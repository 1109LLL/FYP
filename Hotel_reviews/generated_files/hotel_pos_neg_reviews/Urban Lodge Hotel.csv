273892,Urban Lodge Hotel, Sheets were not changed during the 3 day stay Tea coffee not replenished No massage facilities Parking expensive and not always available , Great handy location A short walk from the train tram and bus station 
273893,Urban Lodge Hotel, The only down side to this hotel is that despite being convenientely close to the train station for quick acccess to the airport and downtown and also to the tram station its still a 7 minute walk that with amsterdam very changing weather it can mean you could get very wet as we did Also as you wonder around Amsterdam Center and buy things it could be conveniente to have a close hotel nearby to drop stuff off and keep exploring in this case going back to the hotel and back would be a little to far away Yet we did love the hotel and it is much cheaper than most of the options downtown so if you dont mind the commute this hotel is for you , The hotel is very nice the rooms are spacious the design and overall decor of the hotel is really modern in a chill out way The breakfast was really good It could have used some better fruit Arriving from the airport is really easy just 12 minutes by train and then a 7 minute walk from the station They provided a good crib for our little one and were very friendly to all our request 
273894,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, Wow I am an older gent of 55 years and I need an overnight stop near to the work location I arrived to find lots of young people around the front and thought I had booked into student accommodation Not so This is a great hotel The staff were just fantastic really good WiFi and the restaurant was cheap and really high quality Cant recommend it enough and I will be back if heading to Amsterdam again 
273895,Urban Lodge Hotel, Only problem that I had was that my key was wiped however that was quickly sorted by staff, Right beside the train station good comfy beds couch in the lounge is unbelievably comfy
273896,Urban Lodge Hotel, Having to 10 for parking my motorcycle Parking was in a secure garage underneath the hotel but it seems to becoming the new theme that you charge for parking in Europe I would look elsewhere in future as I have just had 21 hotels in Europe on this tour and it is very expensive just for parking , Easy check in Nice welcome from reception Very helpful staff within the hotel
273897,Urban Lodge Hotel, Cooperation and well behavoiur, We arrived early in the morning but they provive both rooms available for us At reception all young and very helpful Actually that was my second time stay in urban lodge in two months 
273898,Urban Lodge Hotel, It would be really nice if it had washing machines to do your own laundry They do offer the service which takes 1 day to get it ready and it is not cheap , The room and bathroom are really good very clean good beds and bedding The staff is super helpful There is a nice lounge room if you feel like hanging around The location is not bad you can use the train to the centre just one station away from Amsterdam Central But there is not much around the hotel but other hotels and the train station Safe area The hotel is very good for such a place like this one will pay a lot more if it was closer to the center In spite of being a little away of everything I do recommend it if you don t mind walking to the very close by train station and taking the train to get to Amsterdam Central which is very easy 
273899,Urban Lodge Hotel, The communication from the hotel was really poor Things wasn t said that was really important such as 1 They will reserve money on your credit card and if it didn t go through they cancel your booking without letting you know They should keep contact with guests in such instances 2 The housekeeping is not up to standard We did get clean towels but the beds were unmade and dishes left in the room Give the impression that they do not care 3 The dining room area and smoking area is not maintained during the day night when there is no service Should have cleaner s to make sure that everything is clean and up to scratch 4 The parking is available but would cost an extra 15 per day, The location was very good Only a couple of minutes walk to and from the Slotendijk train station The room was sufficient with a safe and clean towels and bedding 
273900,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, We got here by car we found the hotel easy and parked in their paid parking next to it The hotel looks great modern all doors have access cards and the rooms have individually controlled air conditioning In a 5 min walk you can get to the Sloterdijk station where you can get a train a metro or a tram to the city center Also at the train station there is a Spar mini market open until 23 00 The staff was very helpful and very nice The breakfast has a lot of buffet options and is very delicious We really enjoyed our stay here it is a great hotel 
273901,Urban Lodge Hotel, shower is not designed very well water always splashes on the bathroom s floor not major problem though , very close to the train tram or a bus comfortable beds and relatively fast wifi 
273902,Urban Lodge Hotel, Nothing it was all excellent, Of all the hotels we ve stayed it this was the BEST The decor staff cleanliness service were better than most 5 without the high tariff
273903,Urban Lodge Hotel, Parking lot was small and unsecured Surrounding area is business park not much in the way of restaurants shopping outside of conveniences at the station , Comfortable quiet and clean with very friendly staff and above average hotel restaurant Easy access to transit trains to central Amsterdam or anywhere 5 minute train ride to the center 
273904,Urban Lodge Hotel, Sadly restaurant was closed It took a little longer to get into the centre than we had anticipated , Good beds nice room easy parking plenty of wifi Free tea coffee Very friendly helpful staff 
273905,Urban Lodge Hotel, The breakfast was disappointing in that the staffing levels were poor with dirty plates etc left uncollected at our table during the meal and all around us at nearby tables Fed this back to management and some improvement made but still poor in view of price paid for the stay Wanted to dine on night one but there was a notice saying the restaurant would not be open Very poor and no compensation offered ,No Positive
273906,Urban Lodge Hotel, No acoustic insulation anywhere you hear everything that is going on in adjacent rooms and on the street Additionally the cleaning ladies make sure to hit and move everything possible as they move through floor to clean rooms and refresh sheets and towels so if you re a light sleeper that hotel might be not for you , Conveniently located fairly clean and comfortable 
273907,Urban Lodge Hotel, nothing could have been better, the staff were so friendly and accommodating It was an easy check in process and even got a late check out without any problems Great location if you prefer to stay out of the hustle and bustle of the city centre Very close to the train station 
273908,Urban Lodge Hotel, Bunkbeds for the kids were a little dangerous they were a sofa that converted in to bunkbeds and there was a huge gap on the wall side which my son fell into Restaurant had poor choices for kids too Needs more variety Very expensive and kids portions were far too big ,No Positive
273909,Urban Lodge Hotel, The family room should have been bigger It was the same size as a room for 3 people however 4 people need more space It would also have been nice to have a fridge in the room One last thing the shower makes alot of the water spray out onto the main floor there should be something there to stop that happening , How clean the hotel was and how friendly the staff were 
273910,Urban Lodge Hotel, Inconvenient to carry heavy luggage to ance from room and No help available from staff The location is inconvenient for tourist , Breakfast was good Staff helped us booking taxi at early morning and also flexible to allow us check in early 
273911,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, Sorry was not aware of Genius Perks Think the location is perfect nearby Sloterdijk Station Nearly every train goes and comes from Amsterdam Central very frequently 6 80 return Rooms and Bathrooms were great Reception spacious and relaxing whilst planning your day We did not eat at hotel as so many places to try in Amsterdam in short visit Very pleased to have the possibility to park safely 
273912,Urban Lodge Hotel, stayed without breakfast hotel room and facilities was acceptable but a little bit noisy Wifi too week to many times disconnected almost impossible to use it No complimentary water bath shoes Refrigerator was too hot I put something but it was heating rather than cooling finally I unplugged it to avoid fire stayed 4 nights but skipped changing bedclothes , Bed was cozy and comfortable Strong water pressure and quick boiled water easy access to public transportation 5min walk to sprinter metro bus tram 
273913,Urban Lodge Hotel, The area is not in the heart of the city it take 20 mins to get to Central Station There are no restaurants or bars close by The supermarket is located at the Train station which is a 10 min walk away , The hotel has a very comfortable vibe the staff is super friendly there is free coffee tea and hot chocolate for all guest throughout the day Its located close to a major transport hub so you can get the train metro or bus very easily You can rent cycles on the property The wifi is excellent Stay on a room on the ground floor as the windows open 
273914,Urban Lodge Hotel, Staff are helpful but at times a bit disinterested which can be frustrating when you re jet lagged That said management responds promptly to concerns and makes a concerted effort to fix things which abates this It would be nice to avoid this in the first place however When booking a double room you expect to get a double bed If is annoying to be given two single beds grouped together and have to specifically ask for a double bed Again a small complaint , Breakfast was simple but had reasonable options and was delicious Hotel had bike rentals which was reasonably priced and good quality bikes The area was quiet and connected well by bike paths and the station This place is 4km out of town centre however which means you should be prepared to ride walk which is pleasant or use public transport Sloterjik station is close which is a main hub for transport 
273915,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, it s great to stay in a hotel just 1 stop away from Amsterdam crowded and noise There is nothing to complain about hotel nice staff clean and free parking on the street at weekends 
273916,Urban Lodge Hotel, Not sure whether all the raw wood panelling would be considered to be a real fire hazard By today s standards Parking could be considered too expensive for a small hotel , Breakfast good value good choices of food Coffee and tea available in lounge free of charge always a welcome sight 
273917,Urban Lodge Hotel, We didn t get new clean towels , Hotel is located near railway station 5 minutes You can reach city center by train within 7 minutes Trains run very often Tickets are quite cheap Hotel has a very nice design Lobby is great There s a free coffee for guests Rooms are clean quite large Staff was nice

273919,Urban Lodge Hotel, Nothing really negative Rooms need stronger lighting and sockets near mirror in bedroom , Great hotel on the outskirts of the city centre Very friendly and helpful staff Very nicely decorated and comfortable beds
273920,Urban Lodge Hotel, Staff were very pleasant and tried to be helpful but couldn t really assist with directions to get to major attractions I knew more than them about the public transport routes just from googling , The hotel was very easy to get to from Schipol Airport and it had everything you needed Rooms were large and quiet and free coffee tea in the lounge was a real bonus Proximity of the Spar supermarket was very convenient 
273921,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, A fabulous stylish modern hotel Although the hotel is busy it had a relaxing atmosphere and the staff were friendly and helpful I enjoyed sitting in the stylish area by the bar chatting to people I am travelling to Scandinavia by bicycle and my bike was safely locked in the private underground garage for my three night stay I really enjoyed my stay 
273922,Urban Lodge Hotel, One of the lifts wasn t working which was annoying as the other lift was very slow You cannot open the windows on the upper floors meaning that you have to rely on the air conditioning which although good is not ideal for the night , The hotel is very modern and has a good atmosphere about it The staff on the front desk were excellent and very helpful and the people that run the breakfast room very efficient The bed was about the best bed I have stayed in a hotel for a long time 
273923,Urban Lodge Hotel, In the second day soap and shower gel were not replaced Sure it was an omission as towels and toilet paper were replaced No biggie could have called the reception and ask for more , Nicely furnished lodge hotel even the lifts include lodge design Clean spacious rooms Windows can be opened the upper side at third floor Met all expectations for a 4 star hotel We were able to rent bikes from the hotel Great experience overall 
273924,Urban Lodge Hotel, Only that we couldn t stay longer, The stay was very enjoyable We stayed 3 nights in Amsterdam The room was lovely loved the bathroom and the power shower was ideal after a long day of exploring The bed was big and comfortable From the moment we checked in the staff was helpful and friendly I must say the place was very clean and the lounge downstairs by reception is beautiful and a great place to chill out especially thanks to to the free self service tea and coffee all day and night A 5 minute walk to station which takes you to city in 6 minutes Alternatively 24hr or 48hr public transport cards allow you to get the tram throughout the city including from by the hotel The spar is located 5 mins from the hotel and is cheap We would definitely stay at the Urban Lodge Hotel again and would highly recommend it to anyone 
273925,Urban Lodge Hotel, Cleaning was good and the room was tidy but not as thoroughly cleaned as you might expect from a hotel like this Nothing major though , The location was very convenient just 5 minutes by train from Centraal Station We bought the Amsterdam travel ticket day card and it included the train Highly recommended if you plan on staying here The staff was really friendly and helped us with many things The room was large and pleasant There were some noise from the hallway but nothing that bothered us The breakfast was more extensive than usual and tasty All in all a beautiful modern hotel with nice interiors

273928,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, I loved the decor so different from the usual bland hotel rooms Felt very warm and welcoming and the lounge area was enticing Also loved the free coffee and tea downstairs plus the kettle in the bedroom Convenient for the train to the airport or the city plus other good travel connections
273929,Urban Lodge Hotel, Nothing Others might complain that it was a 20 minute tram ride or 5 minute train ride on NS to Centraal District but I really enjoyed the tram rides Gave me a chance to see more of the city and feel like a local , Immaculate condition A modern design
273930,Urban Lodge Hotel, Although it was not noisy and not a huge problem for us room 10 view was surrounded by a large road intersection from all windows and as it s on the ground floor privacy was compromised perhaps thicker net curtains would help Also real milk for tea in the fridge would be good however we just bought some from local spar , The bed was very comfy had two great nights sleep hotel had a modern friendly vibe Great access into Amsterdam or anywhere from nearby train station Food in hotel was tasty 
273931,Urban Lodge Hotel, Area doesn t have much choices of place to eat But not really a concern as you probably have eaten in the city after your activities for the day Hotel restaurant is an option as well , Front desk staff are warm and friendly They are also helpful Hotel location is good It is just a few minutes walk from the station 
273932,Urban Lodge Hotel, They did not have bicycles to rent capable to carry two persons , Near public transportation and easy access to the city center The fare of 7 90 for tram for 24hrs was good as we use it to travel around the city A good jesture from hotel to offer free coffee all day

273945,Urban Lodge Hotel, The area the hotel is in although quite close to the train station is fairly isolated withoutmuch character, Great room with super comfy bed lovely big bathroom clean and fresh 
273946,Urban Lodge Hotel, Check total amount in a bill in my case extra breakfast on the check in day was included in total amount to pay despite check in was after 2 p m But after my request to exclude it from price it was done immediately Hopefully it was just a mistake , Good location a railroad station in walking distance 5 7 min by foot one station to the center of Amsterdam 5 min Comfortable rooms safe electric kettle TV condition wifi are included Responsive personnel Not very diverse breakfast but quite hearty Very comfortable hall with modern style Rent of bicycles is available 
273947,Urban Lodge Hotel, The family room was small just an ordinary double room with a sofa bunk added after removing the other furniture The AC did not work and the solution offered was an extra room on a different floor expecting the family to split up Pre booking rooms forced us to pay almost 50 more than the rates advertised closer to actual stay In an advance booking of 3 rooms they declined to cancel 1 room with 4 day notice even though the reason was a family emergency Overall poor managerial values , The staff was friendly the rooms clean modern It was close to public transportation 
273948,Urban Lodge Hotel, It s not in the city centre and you had to pay about 6 euros for a 1 stop 10 min train ride to go to central each time which really added up since we were day for 4 days, The staff were very friendly and helpful Rooms were clean and decent
273949,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, This hotel is located really close to sloterdijk station which would be your arrival point if say you re taking a bus Also there are tram stations around which would take you to city centre in about 30 minutes Free coffee chocolate all day and there s even a easy gym and a bar 
273950,Urban Lodge Hotel, The fire alarm went off on Sunday morning and scared the life out of us After a night out having a few drinks the last thing you want is to be woken by a fire alarm at 7am , The hotel was just a few minutes walk from Sloterdijk Station which was just two stops from the airport so it was really easy to get to We were a group of four and asked for twin rooms close to one another and were given interconnecting rooms which was great The staff were really friendly The beds were comfortable and rooms were well soundproofed We hardly heard any noise even between the interconnecting rooms The shower was nice with two types of shower heads to use The rooms were big enough with a modern Ikea like design Lots of plug and USB ports for charging things The hairdryer was good quality and really powerful Breakfast was buffet style and the selection was perfect Fresh fruit yogurts muesli cereal eggs bacon pancakes toast cheese cold meats pretty much something for everyone And the unlimited free coffee was really good

273957,Urban Lodge Hotel, After my third stay at this hotel I observe how the standards and the quality of service are getting lower Rooms are less clean sheets and towels are old and over used need to be replaced The property management needs to keep up to the rating and first day quality service and need to pay more attention to cleanliness and facilities to keep the customers coming back to this otherwise great hotel ,No Positive
273958,Urban Lodge Hotel, The hotel is run by teenagers in their 20s Gym is very minimalist The space available would easily allow for a few more useful equipment so it s obviously a lack of willing The moto a hotel for urban cow boys is hard to witness in the property it s pure marketing with nothing behind The restaurant is not open till 18 00 An expensive hostel to me , Rooms are clean Breakfast is OK That s it

273963,Urban Lodge Hotel, Breakfast was not included in the price I believe it should , The room had everything that a traveler would need even kettle with tea bags for tea hair drier shampoo and soap and towels in other words all details had been taken into account Staff were very polite and helpful They also had free storage room for luggage 
273964,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, This was our second time in Amsterdam and we had plans to visit Keukenhof as well as getting from Schiphol airport so the location for that matter was really convenient The hotel is quite new and the decoration is really a plus For this price range it was a good surprise The room is cosy well decorated and had strong wifi signl We also had great quality value breakfast one day which was booked in advance they have a system to customize your stay in advance with discounts The same system asks you by mail during your stay how things are going I have reported a minor issue and got a quick response so it really worked Also enjoyed the lounge bar 
273965,Urban Lodge Hotel, Refrigerator in room is not cold enough , If you don t like noisy accommodation in the city then this one is excellent as the location is great by train either to City 1 stop to airport 2 stop Safe in room is a good idea Receptionists girls are great friendly helpful Thanks a lot 
273966,Urban Lodge Hotel, We had no complaints whatsoever, We liked the location how accessible it was to local transport The convenience to access Amsterdam without being in the centre The room had 3 beds but still had plenty of room All in all it was exactly what we wanted 
273967,Urban Lodge Hotel, The bathroom had no heating it was so cold In such a new hotel the least to expect is a holder for the toilet paper The room was directed out to a street with much traffic which made a noise stay Together the stay was too expensive 800 Euros for three nights is much too much for that hotel placed in a surburban under constraction ,No Positive
273968,Urban Lodge Hotel, Location is inconvenient far from the city center and in a rather criminal district my car s window was smashed and some belongings stolen at the nearby parking suggested by the hotel The hotel occupies 1st floor of multistory appartments building and the rooms are very small there are only two beds and nothing else Suggested with 35 discount the price for room was the same as for Novotel but the quality and location is beyond even minimum standards , Staff was rather nice and friendly rooms designed with love and had an idea travel around the world to different cities 
273969,Urban Lodge Hotel, nth, The staff is very friendly professional with good and clear advice on transportation The room is very clean and spacious with very sufficient charger jus next to the bed 4 USB chargers Comfy bed Location is good personally think it s better than staying at the Central station as you can travel to both the south and the north easily A very nice stay

273972,Urban Lodge Hotel, Door accessing the rooms on the ground floor was acccessible to everyone lacking security There was no hair conditioner in the Toiletries , Coffee and tea 24 hours a day kettle in the room Location 
273973,Urban Lodge Hotel, Money spent for Red light district tour from your hotel is not worthy Though it was mentioned in brochure walking tour of 2hrs it ended within 1 5 hr The service from the guide of the tour is not upto the mark Not taking notice of all the group members whether they are with her or lost in the crowd , Nice clean comfortable hotel Ambience is good 
273974,Urban Lodge Hotel, Room temperature could not be adjusted Bunk bed was not really a bunk bed but an extended sofa which made sleeping on the bottom of this bunk bed uncomfortable as the headspace was too low , Good hotel for a short stay Staff was friendly and helpful 
273975,Urban Lodge Hotel, Nothing , Relaxed cosy atmosphere with friendly staff Nothing too much trouble Coffee and tea on tap is brilliant idea Highly recommend this hotel to everyone 
273976,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, Warm reception helpfull staff Clean comfortable quiet room as requested Nice breakfast The hotel is a bit out of the centre but there is an easy access to the city by bus tram and train A place to remember for the next visit to Amsterdam 
273977,Urban Lodge Hotel, Daily making up room slapdash Food is nice but slow service in restaurant , Nothing of interest near the hotel but within walking distance of Slotterdijk railway station short journey from there to central district or airport Helpful staff 
273978,Urban Lodge Hotel, In the restaurant there were many bones in the fish fillet , Great location friendly staff Daily cleaning and linen change Clean comfortable cozy not noisy 5 minutes walk to the train 5 minutes by train to Amsterdam Central and You are already in the center of city 
273979,Urban Lodge Hotel, There was a misunderstanding regarding rental bike rates all sorted eventually but employees should focus on solving the issue rather than focusing on placing the blame with a it s your fault you have to pay attitude , cleanliness common areas complementary coffees and teas very quiet atmosphere 
273980,Urban Lodge Hotel, I handed in clothing at reception on time for them to be delivered for laundry I was told that I would get my clean clothing 24 hours later Over 24 hours later I called reception only to be told that there had been miscommunication between the morning shift staff and night staff and that my clothing had not been laundered During the 24 hour period no one called me to tell me to get my clothing I assume all staff saw the laundry bag lying there but did nothing about it This was sorely disappointing and an inconvenience to me The location is a bit out of town for its price , The reception lounge is nice 
273981,Urban Lodge Hotel, Shower was a bit fiddly to work but wasn t really a problem , Good location near train station and also good for tram that takes you straight to Museums Comfortable modern room The bed was great very comfortable and good after a long flight Quiet room did not hear other guests we had the corner room Liked the handy USB ports in the rooms 
273982,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, Easy access near train station and 15mn from airport nice design clean friendly staff good wifi comfortable bed nice bathroom quick check in check out very good experience 
273983,Urban Lodge Hotel, Housekeeping housekeeping housekeeping When we checked in our room was clean But the next 6 nights showed how unprofessional and vindictive their housekeeping services can be On our second night back at the hotel room after a long day we found the toilet bowl and cover filled with dirt hair and blackish water My husband had to use the brush and clean the toilet himself We complained to the hotel manager Veronika who was nice enough to have a chat with us She apologised and graciously offered a token meal and assured us she would have a word with the housekeeping supervisor But our stay continued to be ruined by more housekeeping woes as their behaviour became very vindictive when it came to cleaning our room The very next day housekeeping very messily made up our bed We found dirt and hair on our pillows which indicated that they threw the pillows on the floor while making the bed Again the following day we found the pillows placed on the tables instead of on our bed In all our travels we ve never encountered such unprofessional behaviour in the housekeeping , Friendly courteous and helpful staff at reception notably Bert and Daphne Although not in Amsterdam Central the hotel is only a 5min walk to the Amsterdam Sloterdijk station which is a 5min train ride away from Central 5min walk to Spar a nice supermarket Excellent food at the hotel bistro thanks to the talented and passionate Chef Khalid Be sure he s around and you ll be guaranteed a delicious experience Our dinner there was truly sumptuous Nice cosy modern but warm decor Love the blue porcelain touches and wood And they had English news channels If you need bedroom slippers you need to ask at reception Free flow coffee tea at all hours at the very cosy hotel lounge Our first 6 night stay was in a smallish room but on our returning 1 night stay after a week they gave us a much bigger room which was really spacious Wish it were the other way around as it made more sense spending 6 nights in a more comfortably bigger room 
273984,Urban Lodge Hotel, Need a mirror over the desk in the room and the access to cooked food bar snacks needs to be longer and more flexible, The access to the bikes and then nearby park The friendly staff on reception
273985,Urban Lodge Hotel, Restaurant offerings a little bland but more than acceptable to eat after a long flight There is a restaurant between the railway station and the hotel that looked quite nice although intermittent opening hours The BRET pub next to the railway station had a great selection of local beers and nice menu would recommend this over the hotel restaurant , Nice big comfortable bed great bathroom facilities Nice touch with free tea coffee every day Didn t have the breakfast as it looked a little overpriced There is a spa in 5 mins walk and with a fridge in the room you can store some ham cheese yoghurt fruit for breakfast at a fraction of the price Very comfortable stay would highly recommend the extra cost of room with a bath
273986,Urban Lodge Hotel, Not much , The hotel was 5 minutes walk from Sloterdijk Station two train stops from Schiphol Airport and one stop from Amsterdam Central station Hotel was clean well presented and the dining arrangements were simple Rooms were very comfortable 
273987,Urban Lodge Hotel, Location had to catch a 6 minute train every time we wanted to go to Amtserdam City Centre Not reachable on foot maybe on bike , Staff is super friendly Very helpful Beds very comfortable Room super clean 
273988,Urban Lodge Hotel, Hairdryer is dusty Ground floor room next to the street can be noisy Not much amenities for a claimed 4 star hotel costing 200EUR per night Requires payment upfront when checking in , Easy walk to the station Decor is nice Free hot drink in the lobby 
273989,Urban Lodge Hotel, First night went to eat in restaurant at 1930 and were told as we didnt reserve really we couldnt eat for an hour Went elsewhere as we d travelled that day and werent told on check in we needed to reserve Next morning staff thought it somewhat amusing that I wished to reserve a place for evening meal When I described our customer experience the previous evening they didnt look as pleased No problems the rest of the stay , Liked the free coffee and nice lounge area helpful staff Hired bikes for the week which was v convenient 
273990,Urban Lodge Hotel, the breakfast is not included in the price by default and it is a bit higher in price than in other hotels nearby 12 5 euro per person the hotel charges the card to check it before you check in and the money is being returned for about 3 4 weeks after that Too long , the property is new with a cozy design very comfortable location 5 minutes walk to Sloterdijk station where there are trains buses trams metro Sloterdijk train is 2 stops from the airport 1 stop from the city center trains to Zaandam etc Trains operate often and go fast so the trip takes minimum time Price is about 3 30 5 50 euro one way quiet district one can sleep well any time regardless of the side your windows face free coffee and tea 24 7 comfy bed spacious room and bathroom heating works well very warm we stayed in early April electric kettle and fridge in the room are very helpful supermarket is next to Sloterdijk station on the way to the hotel it works 7 days a week till midnight There were 2 hotels in that district next to each other we lived in both we had 2 stays in Amsterdam and Urban one is definitely better in terms of your feel there P S Location TIPs a If you plan to go to Keukenhop the cheapest and the fastest is to go from the airport which is close to Sloterdijk station by train b FlixBus station is right near Sloterdijk c Eurobus station is reachable on a direct metro line green one from there So the location is really perfect for visiting everything

273994,Urban Lodge Hotel, no food after 22 00 It s possible to oder takeaway through the reception pizza from just one option of restaurant but it has to be paid in cash the hotel staff didn t tell me that and I had to send back part of my food for not having enough cash No ATM machine either When I ve complained the ironic attendant told me in Holland they normally eat early the minibar was broken far from the centre for Amsterdam s standards 15 minutes walk plus waiting for the train plus 10 minutes by train expensive breakfast bad value for money , confortable bed nice free coffee at the reception area nice living room clean and comfortable room good free WiFi
273995,Urban Lodge Hotel, The staff at the property were extremely rude They were young inexperienced and lacked the professionalism that is required to treat guests at a four star property There seemed to have been an attitude of you pay so we don t care mentality which I suppose comes with a lack of proper training in customer relations The rooms were also not cleaned properly according to four star standards In the end we had to cut our stay short The manager was very helpful in this regard however and promised to speak to her staff regarding the treatment of guests , The property was in a good location 
273996,Urban Lodge Hotel, Nothing, It was very easy to find Being a wee bit out of the centre meant it felt very peaceful Transport links are great The staff were wonderful very friendly and in a genuine way They were very helpful and can answer questions about sightseeing locations

273998,Urban Lodge Hotel, No bars or restaurants locally , Great if you want to hire bikes from hotel to get around the city as there s a lovely park you cycle through to get into Amsterdam Tram and bus service also very close by and frequent 
273999,Urban Lodge Hotel, The room was a bit tight but it fit all 5 of us 2 adults 3 kids They had a really neat bunk bed that the kids loved and the beds were actually really comfortable We were able to open the window for a nice breeze and fresh air and the location it isn t super busy for traffic so the noise level was not a bother and we all had great sleeps , The location is excellent as it is a short walk to the metro train station and then Central Amsterdam is the first stop The food in the restaurant lounge on the property was amazing I had a salmon dinner that was off the charts good In fact I had to compliment the kitchen staff After dinner we went to the main lounging area with a beautiful wood games table that we played cards with the kids and sipped on wine The hotel itself is very modern but had a rustic feel with neat wood and concrete mix very cool 
274000,Urban Lodge Hotel, I was annoyed to discover that two bills we paid were converted into GBP and not paid in EUR The receipts show Cardholder has chosen to pay in GBP We were NOT asked and we did not agree to pay in GBP ,No Positive
274001,Urban Lodge Hotel, Nothing, The staff was very friendly the beds were comfortable the location was right next to the train station and tram as well which can take you anywhere in the city The best thing though is that the Room had multiple USB connection so you can easily charge your phone without needing an adapter Everything worked as expected 
274002,Urban Lodge Hotel, Lack of teaspoons in bedroom for tea and coffee and prefer milk cartons rather than powdered creamer Appreciated tea coffee available downstairs but facilities in room necessary too Toiletries were not 4 star standard , Comfortable mattresses and pillows Flaky croissants and good variety of food for breakfast Great transport links being between Schifol Airport and Amsterdam Central Nice ambience within hotel and staff were most helpful and friendly 
274003,Urban Lodge Hotel, I liked everything , We loved the stye of the hotel and the fact that it was out of the busy city centre yet so close to the train station as well as trams and buses The staff at the hotel were really welcoming and friendly 
274004,Urban Lodge Hotel, There wasn t enough fine restaurants and it was confused to take a train to central station There were 2 different station , I booked for my family They gave us 2 rooms which one they connected each others It was very comfort with my young kids 
274005,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, All hotel personal was very kind helpfull and friendly Hotel is not so far from the ciyy centre also nera the trum station 500 metre From the central station to urban lodge otel you can recah by the trum firstly 13 after 12 number and sloterdjik is the last station I recommended absolutely 
274006,Urban Lodge Hotel, Nothing really negative to report , The hotel is very conveniently located next to Amsterdam Sloterdijk and therefore we were able to travel around easily The bed was very comfy and so was the shower Great stay 
274007,Urban Lodge Hotel, I ve been to Amsterdam 5 times and have never disliked anything or any hotel I ve stayed at, Loved that the hotel was so close to the train station making it so easy to get to Amsterdam central Loved the open fire and the warm ambiance in the hotel lobby will defo be staying at this hotel again
274008,Urban Lodge Hotel, Small room but more than sufficient for a week or less stay, Great breakfast delicious coffee 24 7 comfy and beautiful lounge area loved the location quiet area away from hustle and bustle of the city but close to train station 5min walk 5min drive to central Amsterdam grocery store at train station All excursion tickets can be bought from hotel s reception with cash
274009,Urban Lodge Hotel, WiFi is sketchy speed not bad but it cuts out often , Amazing team of staff Friendly and knowledgeable Quite rooms got many nights of peaceful sleep Nice and clean bathroom

274011,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, Amazing hotel i loved the design of it specially the lobby is so cozy perfect location if you dont stay up late because then you will have to take a taxi back to the hotel it was an amazing experience 
274012,Urban Lodge Hotel, Unfortunately it was not a perfect stay for us The electric kettle was very dirty and I could wipe dust and mould from it I had to request for an exchange which they did but this kettle was worse There were black stuff stuck at the bottom refer to photo I ended up exchanging it again to find that they had no clean kettle My advise is to check your kettle before using it The toilet bowl looked great but kind of clogged up after a day of light usage Luckily they fixed it the next day It s a fun and unique hotel but I really think that it could easily have been a perfect 5 star experience without the issues faced , Outstanding staff who are fluent in English They are helpful and provide luggage storage before check in The rooms are very spacious and they provide almost perfect toiletries except tooth brush and tooth paste I like the bicycle rental service The hotel is near the Amsterdam slot station and there are restaurants nearby 
274013,Urban Lodge Hotel, It was too warm in the room but couldn t get the temperature lower than 23 degrees Opening a window was also not an option as their is a busy road next to the hotel which you don t really hear if you keep the windows closed , Very nice communal space to relax in the evening Spacious bright room with a great bed Also like the fact that there were sockets next to the bed so I could easily charge my phone at night without unplugging a lamp 
274014,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, Friendliest staff I have ever encountered I think Five minute walk to Sloterdijk station from there a 5 minute train to Amsterdam Centraal or Tram 12 to the museum area 
274015,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, It s a modern hotel with very friendly and helpful staff they will quickly answer to any of your request it s near to the train station 5 8 minutes by walk from that train station you have direct connection to the airport 10 min and as well it s the last station for a lot of trams and busses that are going towards the city center I would totally recommend it 
274016,Urban Lodge Hotel, The water pressure from the shower head wasn t very strong Probably due to the fact that the water doesn t drain very well either , Very spacious with beautiful interior
274017,Urban Lodge Hotel, Cleaning of the rooms was not so good Breakfast has no variation so if you stay longer you will probably get bored , Bed and pillows were comfortable the decoration of the hotel and room are nice good taste Breakfast was good Location very good very close to a train and tram station
274018,Urban Lodge Hotel, , Very friendly and helpful staff very cozy living room down stairs where you can enjoy a tea coffee on the house pr something from the bar The room was clean and nice Train station nearby you get into AMS center in about 10 15 minutes ask for details at the reception We enjoyed our stay very much 
274019,Urban Lodge Hotel, For a four star hotel there should be a coffe machine in the room and not in the reception area , I liked the communal area in reception with the open plan seating around the fire The decor in the room was nice Location was perfect as Amsterdam Centre is very busy and noisy only a small train ride to Central Station and the airport 
274020,Urban Lodge Hotel, Nothing , Standard double room was massive and clean Same was the bathroom Really like the spacious lobby and the complimentary tea and coffee available at all time My booking was Sunday to Wednesday so it was incredibly good value for money Location is convenient as it is a tram ride away from Central Amsterdam and 3 minutes walk from Sloterdijk station 
274021,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, Check was very smith the receptionist was very friendly professional We loved the reception area with a wood burning fire Our room was on the second floor it was a clean modern room the wet room shower was hot powerful Breakfast was good with a range of hot food cereals and continental options Fee good quality coffee was available 24 7 Leonie was very helpful assisting us questions suggests on places to see 
274022,Urban Lodge Hotel, Room temperature was too low Tried first adjusting controls then complained and it finally got fixed Then next day it was too low again Seems the temperature controls constantly reset to some specific setting 23 26 C which did not really correspond to true temperature The special requests I made while booking the hotel apparently got lost and were never responded to It was extremely windy during our stay up to 20kn and hotel is in an area where the wind will catch you The window glasses are not particularly soundproof so one could definitely hear the wind howling during nights which would somehow be more tolerable if room temperature was OK Curiously there was no do not disturb sign one could hang on the door Not having this always makes me uncomfortable Almost got stuck in elevator once Door did not close properly and it got stuck between floors Forced the door shut and the elevator got to correct floor Luckily wasn t the girlfriend there she probably wouldn t have had enough force to close it Apparently this was due to a broken button in the elevator which they already knew about , Bathroom in the room was good and clean The lounge bar was extremely nice to chill in with a large fireplace in the center Comfortable sofas felt it was OK to take my shoes off 
274023,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, Staff were so friendly and full of information marked all the best places to go on our map for us Rooms were kept really clean fresh towels everyday We only had breakfast one morning as it was charged to the room and we had more cash but it was lovely The location is perfect few minute walk to the train station which brings you everywhere we got a 3 day travel card for 25 which was so handy There s a shop beside the station if you want to get food or drink for the room or there s a few cafes around too 
274024,Urban Lodge Hotel, Thought the price of the breakfast seemed quite expensive so we didn t bother with that we did eat in the restaurant one evening mine and my husbands burger had to go back as very under cooked but then it was fine but same again quite expensive , The hotel and rooms were lovely and clean the beds were very very comfortable the staff were so so helpful 
274025,Urban Lodge Hotel, Nothing, Hotel room was pretty good everything was close to perfect The room was clean beds were quite comfortabe furnitures were modern and in good condition there was a small regrigerator in the room so that you could keep your food and drinks clean personnel were helpful and nice and all of this is for a reasonable cheap price The location maybe is not center but its just one train station away from the central station which takes only 10 minutes Also there is a supermarket very near that you can shop for whatever you need Overall I m very happy with my stay in Urban Lodge Hotel I would come here again 
274026,Urban Lodge Hotel, Only negative was that a 100 booking fee was taken from my account a week before check in and I was never informed of this until I checked my account myself Luckily I had no bills that week But the money is put back in 2weeks after you check in , Delighted I booked the urban lodge hotel location was excellent only 5min train journey to Amsterdam central Staff were very helpful and friendly bed was so comfortable and shower was amazing Couldn t fault this hotel Would defo stay here again if I was to return 
274027,Urban Lodge Hotel, I missed my own bed , Location is great Debbie and Daphne were so helpful They gave us suggestions that were not in the tourist books and provided helpful hints on getting around It was our first time in Amsterdam and we were worried that this would be so off of the beaten path but it was the best location we could have asked for I highly recommend staying at the Urban Lodge We only ate breakfast one morning and it was really good but we wanted to explore new places rather than only eating there 
274028,Urban Lodge Hotel, Bed s were a little on the firm side however have slept on worse , Really great facilities welcoming relaxing Also really close to Sloterdijk train metro station less than a 5 minute walk 
274029,Urban Lodge Hotel, Rental bicycles are in poor condition and over priced , Staff are excellent intelligent aware college students Hotel is built to purpose so rooms facilities are as promised easy to maintain and very well maintained Location is excellent 3 minutes walk to Sloterdijk for trains and trams easy to city centre Great value Really great value Overall a very well managed hotel and a great experience

274033,Urban Lodge Hotel, It would have been nice to have breakfast before a day s sightseeing but we felt breakfast was fairly expensive , The lounge area was lovely so cosy and we loved the fireplace games for the kiddies and the complimentary coffees 
274034,Urban Lodge Hotel, Breakfast was poor Didn t expect it considering the fact that hotel is absolutely amazing and staff is just outstanding But regardless I would will come back there for sure , The entire staff was absolutely amazing Very friendly and helpful We loved it 
274035,Urban Lodge Hotel, Maybe coffee D The coffee wasn t delicious , We were very satisfied Everything was perfect Nice stay in Amsterdam We recommend the hotel to others in the Czech republic Thanks 
274036,Urban Lodge Hotel, There is no place to eat at the hotel before 6 pm We arrived just before the rain exhausted by a long journey starving and were told to wait for three hours until dinner could be ordered So we had to go downtown in the rain in search of some grub , The bed was great not too soft and not too hard The heater was working fine so we weren t cold on chilly days Surprisingly it was always quiet in the room If it rains you can get an umbrella from the reception at a 5 EUR deposit The bus tram stations are very close to the hotel some 4 5 minutes walk and you can easily get to the Central Train Station and Schipol airport by bus or to the Museumplein by tram There s a decent grocery store about 5 minutes walk from the hotel that works till 10 pm

274039,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, Breakfast was excellent good range of options and plentiful Bed was comfortable the staff friendly and I liked the lounge area with fire and free coffee Robes and slippers in bathroom were nice we were upgraded on arrival so they may not have been available in all rooms 
274040,Urban Lodge Hotel, Perhaps it was better the hotel to clearly state that the taxi fare will be hectic about 40 45 euro while by train it will be 10 euro from the airport Because the website says it will be about 10 12 minutes both by taxi and train I chose taxi which was a big mistake As soon as the driver said it was 45 euro I immediately said please turn back but he said it was too late Arrived at the hotel with an unpleasant feeling The stay itself was fabulous Want to come back again , Spacious clean everything was sorted out nicely A number of electric sockets Warm fire place at the rounded where I could stay for a couple of hours before my flight 
274041,Urban Lodge Hotel, Service at bar in the evening was slow only 1 person trying to do restaurant and bar Waited 30 mins for a few fries but this was only a minor problem , Large room with a large comfy bed Good breakfast and lots of it Friendly helpful staff Good location with great public transport 5 mins to city centre by train Clean throughout nice lounge area with a warm feel to it very nice hotel

274043,Urban Lodge Hotel, Nothing it was all fantastic, Love this hotel clean stylish and very relaxing Great location as regards transport connections to airport city centre I love the decor in lobby restaurant breakfast room and bedroom also had nice touches I love tiles The most comfortable bed and pillows staff extremely helpful and engaging fabulous lobby seating lounging area with open fire and comfy sofas and complimentary tea coffee made it quite hard to venture out but very welcoming to return to And I will be back

274050,Urban Lodge Hotel, If I was to say one thing it would be that the shower didn t have a door so it leaves the floor quite wet but other than that great , The staff were very welcoming and friendly check in and out was easy and stress free room was lovely and clean Fresh towels everyday free tea and coffee It s 5 min walk from station sloterdijk which is one station away from central and 2 from the airport Would definitely come here again

274057,Urban Lodge Hotel, window did not close properly and very cold and noisy night in the room I have stayed here many times in past and this was my first experience that wasn t perfect, easy access from public transport and not far from city centre
274058,Urban Lodge Hotel, Towels are a bit scratchy , Very spacious bedrooms and bathrooms I loved the raindrop showerhead coupled with a detachable head and the mirror never fogged up The bed is one of the best I ve slept in at a hotel 
274059,Urban Lodge Hotel, We asked for a double bed but we got two beds pushed together Not ideal but not the end of the world , One of my favourite hotels in recent memory From the outside it looks a bit drab but it has a very fresh and stylish interior The room was spacious and quiet the bed was comfortable and the shower was great The foyer had a very cosy fireplace 
274060,Urban Lodge Hotel, Lovely hotel staff all very friendly Free teas and coffees for all guests in the lounge area Location is good a 5 minute walk followed by a 3 minute train ride from the centre If you are looking to stay out late tho the trains only run until 1 30am ish and sometimes are changed to busses which isn t easy to see on the signs 40 aprox taxi to airport centre or 26 for a 3 day Amsterdam public transport pass Would recommend for families couples or friends who are looking for a quiet and relaxing break ,No Positive

274063,Urban Lodge Hotel, Rooms a little small nothing to worry about too much, The bed is an absolute heaven Not to forget the reception area makes me want to sleep for days on end the seats with that fire place is something else 
274064,Urban Lodge Hotel, There was no hairdryer in our room but I think if we d asked it would have been provided , The lounge area with the fire was lovely and there was free tea and coffee available The rooms were very comfortable 
274065,Urban Lodge Hotel, The hotel was lovely and the staff were great there were only two issues One I feel is partially booking com s failure but at no point we were told of the tourist tax so had a surprise extra 30 pound on the hotel price Further to that the wifi of the hotel did not work sufficiently which meant we could not use our smart tv , Staff were lovely very friendly the restraunt was really good Further we appreciated that even when we asked for our room not to be cleaned we were still supplied with fresh towels

274071,Urban Lodge Hotel, I d booked a family room for 4 adults one of which dropped out Thank god he did as the room was a bit cramped between 3 people so I couldn t have imagined what it would have been like with 4 Also it said 2 single beds and a bunk bed the bunk bed was actually a sofa bed folded out which was uncomfortable and cramped After a certain time you cannot order food drink the bar is only open from around 6 12 so if you like a late drink back at the hotel this would not suit also as it s quite a bit out from the main city there isn t many places to get food either, Affordable hotel a minutes walk from the train station shop Rooms were clean and tidy also was able to adjust the temperature of the room which was great as it was absolutely freezing when we stayed Staff were super friendly and always willing to help with any issues Also has a nice hotel lobby to sit and chill out in
274072,Urban Lodge Hotel, It s quite far from the center and main attractions You have to take a fast train that s pretty expensive or the bus tram economic but that s twice the time of the train , Great hotel everything new and clean Staff very attentive and friendly Great breakfast with delicious little pancakes

274079,Urban Lodge Hotel, I asked for double beds in the rooms and I received two single beds pushed together which was uncomfy as me and my partner would fall through the gap , The lobby was beautiful and I loved the decor the shower was amazing
274080,Urban Lodge Hotel, The pictures of the family room were deceiving It did not show what the bunk bed looked like It was a bit of a shock when we first saw it but then got used to it, Hotel lounge was very nice and comfy great to relax Hotel was very clean and staff were nice and helpful
274081,Urban Lodge Hotel, The double bed was two single bed s pushed together Beds where comfortable but would have prefaired a proper double bed Not a huge problem very clean staff are lovely rooms are cleaned everyday although sheets are not changed but understandable when it comes to costs didn t bother me , Very country modern like and welcoming Staff were very kind and polite would go out of there way to keep the visitors happy Its in a great location 5 min away from the train station and spar 
274082,Urban Lodge Hotel, The neighborhood is silent and spacious but lacks supermarkets one has to go to the city to buy even simple stuff There was a bit of graffiti beneath window in my room but no big deal A microwave would be very useful although a member of the staff told me that there was one in the kitchen , The room was very comfortable with climate controls The lobby has a fireplace to sit back in front of and relax after breakfast Breakfast was hot and nourishing although a bit expensive 12 5 euros Interior is fitted with wood which gives it warm and cozy feeling Payment can be made in cash as well as by card The hotel is close to Amsterdam Sloterdijk train station 5 minutes from Amsterdam Centraal 
274083,Urban Lodge Hotel, The fact that bed sheets weren t changed if this was a longer stay we would have liked the bed sheets towels changed as it was a short stay in not too bothered but anything more than 3 nights would be ideal, The staff were amazing and even granted my wish of rose petals a box of chocolates

274088,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, Confort of the room nice forniture and beatiful common areas such as the entrance hall Also the position is good if you have a car because the hotel is located exactly between the airport and the city center 
274089,Urban Lodge Hotel, The location is good it s a quiet area and easy to find once you re off the train But we spent a lot in travel Either paying for the trains or taxis back when it was late Sometimes taxi would charge 15 euros for the 7 of us Sometimes they would try and charge 50 for the same journey , The hotel was really good value The rooms were clean and really nicely decorated The lobby offered free hot drinks 24 7 which is nice considering it was freezing and snowed while we was there Overall it was a really nice hotel and would reccomend it to anyone

274095,Urban Lodge Hotel, I definitely wouldn t give this hotel a four star rating The breakfast is awful worst Iv ever had and they tried to charge us twice for it The cleaner broke a bottle of expensive foundation when she was cleaning our room and left a note saying sorry When I complained about this she tried to say I broke it myself and she found it on the floor even though I had let her into the room myself when we were leaving and obviously everything was fine I was reimbursed for it but it s still ridiculous and an inconvenience having no make up for two days There is nothing in the area around the hotel bar or restaurant wise so you don t have the option of not going into the centre Expensive for an average hotel outside of the centre area , The hotel is ok and one train stop away from the centre Rooms were average Reception staff were very good 
274096,Urban Lodge Hotel, The location wasn t ideal but not something to be complained about due to being close to the station, The size of the rooms the amount of mirrors The free tea and coffee

274100,Urban Lodge Hotel, At the start we were worried it was a bit far out from the main streets but after we experienced how easy the Tavel was it was fine maybe even better as we saw more of Amsterdam , Modern very clean hotel with comfortable friendly vibes It is a short walk from the bus train and tram station It is then a 5 minute train to central station and the rest of the city is also easily accessible Try and get a transport pass that allows travel on tram train and bus to allow for easy travel across the city The staff were super friendly and helpful flawless Breakfast buffet was also pretty good Would stay here again

274103,Urban Lodge Hotel, I had corner room with big windows it was windy and the wind was also in the room , The hotel close to a train station and other public transport The location is between the airport and the center I used direct tram to Museum Quarter At the same time from airport only two stops to this place Nearby there is a shop where you can buy some foods The room had kettle and tee coffee bags 
274104,Urban Lodge Hotel, The family room was in fact a normal 2person room where the so called seating area that it should ve had was in fact the sofabed that was converted to bunkbed for the 2 children So in fact there was no seating area contrary to the description hardly any space to walk in the room Yet the price was that of a family room i e a room fit for a family The bunk bed squeaked with the slightest movement so all night every time my kid moved And since we were sleeping a meter away this kept us all up We could literally follow the conversation of the neighbours also all night The toilets in the lobby were as bad as to be expected along the highway And it s not even in a nice neighborhood but completely outside of the city All this for 245 euro for night , The style with the wood Modern The bathroom in the room was clean

274144,Urban Lodge Hotel, 1 Rooms walls is isolated so you would not hear any noises from other rooms but unfortunately the windows is not sound proof we could hear the cars and road noises Ear plugs is a must 2 They have a real problem with concern to hygiene during breakfast we found an expired bread another day a coffee cup was dirty already used placed with clean cups We missed to put the clean sign so they put the toilet paper on the floor outside our room without even plastic bag 3 You have to pay a deposit of Euro 10 to borrow an Iron with the table and you have to carry it yourself to your room from the reception and in order to get your deposit back you have to bring it down during checkout 4 Prior to your arrival they would hold the first night cost from your Visa only hold not actual payment and if you will pay in cash the hold will be cancelled after one month otherwise if you pay with your visa you will not face any problem 5 Breakfast is the same everyday no changes at all and not much of selection 6 Toilet need to be heated it was very cold 7 Pillow was not comfortable at all look like over used we ask for replacement but they don t have other type 8 I really felt that it was a 3 star hotel not 4 star , 1 Near the train station and public transportation about 25 min to reach the central station and cost approximately Euro 3 for each trip 2 Staff is very polite patient helpful and speak good English they are really good people sophisticated and helpful you would definitely enjoy your stay in the town 4 our room was relatively big compared to other Europe hotels 5 Nice room decoration as well as the lobby area

274148,Urban Lodge Hotel, Well again if you plan to be in the city and visit the city is a bit far away In general in Amsterdam all accommodations seem to be excessively expensive , Actually I liked the proximity to the bus station as we arrived with Flixbus and to the public transport that takes you to the city The breakfast was really nice and the lounge had a great design 
274149,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, the ambience of the property location feasibility just one station from the central station even I like the hospitality of the restaurant chef I m vegetarian and he had made a special meal for me thank you

274154,Urban Lodge Hotel, The room was in general clean though there was some dust in places like the chair or the office but the areas of the corridor outside our room and the elevator were very dirty and that was really sad while it is a very promising hotel , A hotel with an alternative decoration with a very helpful personnel and really 5 minutes from sloterdijk station 
274155,Urban Lodge Hotel, Nothing, We liked that you could get to cbd in 4 minutes by train clean and helpful staff and excellent facility in the room with tea Coffee and very comfy bed We will recommend an if back in Amsterdam will definitly go there

274160,Urban Lodge Hotel, Road to the side is quite noisy Limited menu for evening meal Requires a trip on the tram 5 minute walk from the hotel into the city centre with one change although trams are plentiful clean and cheap , Large comfy room with en suite Lovely lounge area on the ground floor with soft seating arranged around a gas fire Decent hot and cold breakfast Free tea and coffee via machine all day evening Friendly helpful staff Easy to get to from the airport 2 stops then a short 5 minute walk 
274161,Urban Lodge Hotel, It was a bit far away from central Amsterdam but we didn t mind travelling in everyday Also check in was late for us as we arrived at the hotel at 11am but had to wait around for 3 hours until 2pm to get into our room After an early morning flight we were tired and would have liked our room a bit earlier , Beds comfy staff friendly and ready to help if we needed directions etc Rooms cleaned everyday and good facilities

274166,Urban Lodge Hotel, Can t think of anything, Great welcome feeling with the roaring fire in the reception Plenty of variety at breakfast and all freshly prepared Staff accommodating with printing our boarding passes for return journey 
274167,Urban Lodge Hotel, The entrance floors were skimmed with concrete while we stayed meaning that we had difficulty getting into and out of our hotel room Staff allowed us to walk behind the reception desk but on our final day when checking out they did not hear us knocking door so we had a bit of a wait to get out of hotel , Small fridge in hotel room made it easy to keep drinks cool Proximity of train station and trams and buses

274202,Urban Lodge Hotel, Maintenance standards lower than expected lime scale remover might make the shower head work better Also we informed the reception of the clogged washbasin and apart from a promise to fix the problem nothing or little was done very inconvenient and unpleasant for the guests Don t understand how these problems can be overlooked by the cleaning staff , I liked the location close to Sloterdijk station in a modern safe and quiet area The room is nicely furnished and comfortable with a stylish bathroom Very clean Despite the vicinity of a busy road the room was quiet Hardly any noise could be heard from the other rooms either

274213,Urban Lodge Hotel, Although complimentary tea coffee sugar milk is provided I think it would be more hygienic to place these items on a tray so that potential spillages wouldn t damage any surfaces Likewise the soap bars can also become a little messy so perhaps liquid soap would be a better option , I was initially a little worried about the location of this hotel as it seemed quite far out of the city centre but I needn t have worried The station is roughly 3 5 minutes away on foot so we purchased a 3 day GVB travel card for 17 Euro each which gave us the option to travel by either metro bus or tram You could also buy the card with an additional fourth option of train which would then cost 25 Euro each The hotel itself is newly built so it has a lovely fresh feel to it Our triple room was quite large and I especially liked the addition of a fridge The staff are quite young but more than pleasant and helpful with any queries we had I can t comment on the food as we tended to eat out all of the time

274253,Urban Lodge Hotel, Please pay attention that every time you purchase a paper train ticket one extra euro would be charged as admin fee , The hotel is 8 min walk away from the Sloterdijk train station from which u will be in the city center in only 6 minutes by train The most economic way to the center actually is to buy GVB day ticket at the Spar supermarket next to the train station with that it allows u unlimited GVB bus tram ride during the day bus 22 from Sloterdijk sends u to center in 20 minutes Yes train and bus are run by different companies thus GVB day ticket doesn t allow u to take train

274272,Urban Lodge Hotel, The only thing was the view from the hotel is an office block but this didn t bother is at all as we spent a lot of time out of the hotel sightseeing and exploring , The bed was an excellent king size that was very comfy Loved the shower was amazing The staff were extremely helpful when printing boarding passes and booking trips for the city Also very clean and everything we needed was there overall an excellent stay 
274273,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, Honestly this is one of the best Hotels I v ever been to Location is perfect for everyone who wants a quiet sleep and to be close to the City center I mean come on there are actual rabbits next to this hotel You can see them on your way to the Sloterdijk station and than you hop on a Bus or a Tram and in a couple of minutes you find your self in the center of beautiful Amsterdam This Hotel is surreal 
274274,Urban Lodge Hotel, The breakfast was not included in the room price , Very clean and spacious room The location is very far from the city centre 50 mins journey by tram but with the sprinter train the journey is only 11 mins 
274275,Urban Lodge Hotel, Sometimes there was inconsistencies with prices at the bar Be careful of this A glass of wine could range from 8 15 for the same glass , Large group stayed here for hen do prices were so much better than next to central station Staff at reception were nice and friendly Arranged taxis whenever we needed them Hotel bar lounge was lovely decorated really well and was such a nice plAce to relax We would all meet there or evenings and after we got in from being out Such a laid back atmosphere I would definite stay here again Was really easy to get to central 
274276,Urban Lodge Hotel, Nothing , Staff were very friendly and helpful Hotel had very nice modern decor throughout Nice bar in lobby with a fire Great size room and bathroom Location good easy to catch trams or metro All beautifully clean with regular maid service Would recommend and stay again 
274277,Urban Lodge Hotel, Stay would have been quite nice EXCEPT I was in a tandem room shared door leading to another room with unrelated guests Door was closed and locked but other guests were apparently smoking heavily while I slept When I woke up the next morning I was immediately coughing because so much smoke was coming through walls door All my clothing smelled of smoke I am not exaggerating Also the guests next to me woke up vomiting and continued to vomit for about 30 minutes while I got ready I could hear them very clearly Since I was checking out first thing in the morning I didn t bother asking to be moved but it was very unpleasant , Very clean and comfortable the day I arrived Staff was friendly and helpful 
274278,Urban Lodge Hotel, it s not that we don t like it but if any of you prefer to stay in the city center this is not a place But the location is not too far from the center you can take bus train to the center in a bit totally not a problem for us , very nice atmosphere warm interior design very close to the train station just a few minutes walk friendly staff and you can rent a bicycle 
274279,Urban Lodge Hotel, Windows do not open I d really like to get some fresh air in the room but that wasn t possible Only air con Otherwise all is great , Great location couple of minutes walk from train tram bus stations Excellent transportation link with the airport direct line 10 min Quiet and clean area New and modern hotel Very clean rooms and super comfortable beds 
274280,Urban Lodge Hotel, takes more time to go to city center by tram Altough only 6 minutes if using train But the train was not in my One Day Pass GVB Card , The receptions were friendly and helpful The beds are comfortable Near from train station and easy access to schipol airport and city center by train 
274281,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, We picked this hotel because we rented a car for a three week road trip from Amsterdam to Vienna and they have parking on site and it is only two blocks from the train bus station for easier access to locations in Amsterdam The room was clean comfortable and secure It was either new or completely remodeled It has a small bar with ice and a moderate restaurant Breakfast buffet is good but 12 50 EU A couple of mornings we just took the public transit to the main train station and ate a hearty English breakfast a block away to start our adventures for the day 
274282,Urban Lodge Hotel, The fact the another guest onlocked our door at 00 50 one morning and thought it was his room while we were sleeping , Comfy beds and bedding Nice decor Staff go the extra mile 
274283,Urban Lodge Hotel, Pillows a bit soft, Friendly helpful staff Met all our needs for a City break Train station within 5 mins made getting around very easy Bikes were great and available to rent at hotel 
274284,Urban Lodge Hotel, We were hoping to get some dinner in the evening when we had arrived but most places in the area did not stay open till very late , My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night because we were taking an early bus to Antwerp the next morning We were very pleased with the hotel We thought the hotel staff was very nice the location was also very good in terms of public transport however not a lot of things to do in the area walking distance 
274285,Urban Lodge Hotel, No directions goven on website for how to find Were initially given a double room although we booked a twon This was quickly changed , Excellent location next to the station Luggage can be stored in reception Reception staff happy to help with any problems 
274286,Urban Lodge Hotel, The hotel and its facilities were great although you must keep in mind that the television stations are featured primarily in Dutch and French with little English subtitling available Other than that I could not fault the hotel , I booked a hotel room for my daughter and I on our short trip to Amsterdam and I m delighted to say it didn t disappoint Upon arrival we were greeted by our lovely hotel staff Laura and Daphney who immediately made us feel welcome Our room was extremely clean and tidy with comfortable beds that ensured us a good night s sleep after our busy day trekking through the city The room was also stocked with all the essentials and comforts a shower bath television free wifi and even a hairdryer Free tea and coffee were also supplied outside in a beautiful lounge perfect for relaxing Our highlight however had to be the attitude of the hotel staff They were so helpful and truly went the extra mile to ensure that our stay was as comfortable as possible We ll definitely come back here on our next trip 
274287,Urban Lodge Hotel, Very poor breakfast Too cold in bathroom The hotel blocked a deposit on my credit card at least for 14 days although I paid whole accomondation the day which I arrived , The location near to train staiton Very clean hotel

274289,Urban Lodge Hotel, Dreadful experience at breakfast Only one small coffee machine working and not continously and staff not bothering helping guests very much Result 15 minutes line to get a coffee and very nervous people all around Umbelievable that hotel management did not look for an emergency solution by for instance getting their staff to serve coffee directly at tables of moving other coffee machines into the breakfast hall , Very helpful staff at reception comfortable room
274290,Urban Lodge Hotel, Staff are a little disorganized Eg made reservation on booking com with Amex hotel emailed to say they don t take Amex gave them MasterCard then on checkin they said the room wasn t paid hadn t recorded the change of credit card , Nicely styled rooms comfy beds nice bar
274291,Urban Lodge Hotel, Poor wi fi connection in room As mentioned by other guests tea bags not replaced we had read this and taken our own if the same happened to us When only staying for a few nights I don t think it is necessary to have clean towels every day , On arrival we were met by Bert he was very helpful and friendly with information on relevant trams trains and buses to get us to the sights we wanted Although busy hotel there was no noise at night We would stay here again 
274292,Urban Lodge Hotel, The distance getting back from a night out It is hard as we couldn t find night buses and it is a bit pricey just for the room only, Liked the decor the staff were welcoming room service was like almost every morning We stayed 4 nights

274296,Urban Lodge Hotel, Was mugged off on my first night not being warned that building work was being done right outside my bedroom window from very very early in the morning 07 00 Also there was no safe in my room for a good day and a half For 558 euros for 4 nights this was unacceptable level of service and dishonest Also on booking com this hotel was described as having a City View which is utter BS as it is a good 5KM from the city centre I spent a lot of money just on Train travel and the last train from centraal is 01 00 Be warned and be smarter than me , The hotel in general was very nice and the staff pleasant to deal with 
274297,Urban Lodge Hotel, No services at mid night I asked the reception for water at mid night and he replied no available water you can drink using the tap in the toilet , The restaurent was good

274305,Urban Lodge Hotel, everything is good nothing to complain about thank you, The Hotel is in Sloterdijk and can be reached from Shipol Airport directly by train The train station is about 3 4 minutes from the Hotel That s quite nice The hotel itself is very new and very modern with young personal They are nice and trying to help in every question Friendly

274309,Urban Lodge Hotel, The room space available for the cost per night was a bit disappointing especially when seeing the bathroom The Netherlands actually has a tourist tax NOT the hotel s fault just a shock to a clueless American like myself and worth mentioning The hotel s location is kind of far from Amsterdam Centraal if walking or going by car bus or tram , The lobby has an attractive lodge look and feel The beds are comfortable and the room decor is nice One of the few hotels that catered to groups of three with three separate beds The closest train station Sloterdijk and bus stop is a short walk from the hotel and Amsterdam Centraal by train is just one stop away 
274310,Urban Lodge Hotel, Receptionists are very inconsiderate personals although I paid the room from booking com they were also charged the room twice they are never not want to understand me If there would be a lower mark for personals than I already selected i would prefer to select it actually , very clean bathroom and room 
274311,Urban Lodge Hotel, Prices of breakfast expensive Did not eat in hotel, Well positioned hotel at the Westpoort area of town 200 metres from the train link into the airport 10 mins away All the transport links in to the city are are this transport centre Trams and buses also The hotel is clean with a lovely bar lounge area to relax in the evening The rooms are good with spacious bathroom and modern shower There were 4 adults in family room Brilliant value
274312,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, Great bed Friendly staff Very comfy The bath was a decent size too The staff were friendly and helpful They have a store for peoples bags so If you have a late flight home you can leave them at the hotel after checkout and collect them on your way home 
274313,Urban Lodge Hotel, I had a lamp near the window which came into a paintfull contact with my head several times It is a really unhappy place for it moreover there was missing the bulb in the lamp although I asked for it , Very good location as it is near the Sloterdijk Station with rail and underground connection Rail connection to the Schiphol Airport is about 11 minutes Amsterdam Centraal is 7 minutes away by train Rooms are big enough you have everything you need in them Breakfasts well prepared with sufficient choice WiFi connection working well and it is free Staff very helpful and nice

274316,Urban Lodge Hotel, Paying extra for breakfast would be better if it was included in the price of the room or was a bit cheaper Also no English speaking channels apart from BBC News would have been nice to watch a film in English whilst hanging out in the room , Staff are wonderful very friendly informative and an asset to the hotel The rooms are spacious comfortable and clean Very near to the city 10 mins by train 15 mins by the 22 bus and 10 mins by train to and from the airport Quiet area not much around apart from other hotels there is a spar shop right next to the train station which was very convenient Train and bus station is a few minutes walk from the hotel Would highly recommend this hotel for a stay in Amsterdam and will most certainly stay here again 
274317,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, The room was very clean and the beds were comfortable and the room was nicely decorated The hotel is a bit out of the way of the city centre but has great transport links via a short walk to sloterdijk train and bus station you can access any part of the city from here and it only takes 10 mins via train or 20 mins Via bus to reach the city centre 
274318,Urban Lodge Hotel, The room was small especially for what we paid for it It would be nice if breakfast was included but at least there was coffee , The staff was very friendly The room was clean I loved the decorations in the lobby and it was a very comfortable place to hang out The bus ride to the city center was not bad at all Overall it was a nice and convenient place to stay 
274319,Urban Lodge Hotel, Nothing apart from it being 2 single matresses instead of a double, The beds were super comfy the only problem was that it was two single matteresses session pushed together which was annoying
274320,Urban Lodge Hotel, Room too small for 3 Not enough storage for clothes could do with bedside tables not just lumps of wood Tea coffee in room not replaced , Friendly helpful staff Close to transport links Relaxing bar area 
274321,Urban Lodge Hotel, very expensive and four stars hotel but it s incredible that there was not a hairdryer in my room I didnt like that my room was on the ground floor so I could hear all the noise from the people outside in the street breakfast very expensive for the price I paid for one night it had to be included , staff incredibly friendly and helpful beautiful hotel beautiful and cosy room and huge bathroom 
274322,Urban Lodge Hotel, Bit of a sanitised characterless more business like feeling than tourist hotel, Helpful staff comfortable bed and room 5 minute walk to Sloterdijk train station next one to Amsterdam central 
274323,Urban Lodge Hotel, The price is a little high but we were lucky to book between the first ones after they opened so the price was fine , The staff was excellent keeping us entertained giving us tips where to go and what to do Rooms were great the lounge amazing and beautiful
274324,Urban Lodge Hotel, A cheaper breakfast option perhaps , The bed was super comfy the staff were so friendly and helpful and the hotel itself was beautifully decorated The rooms were spotless and well looked after Would definitely recommend staying here super easy to get to and from the airport and into the city center We also hired bikes from the hotel 
274325,Urban Lodge Hotel, 1 The travel information given by the hotel staff is not adequate I checked with them in advance regarding the transportation They only advised us to take train to Amsterdam Centraal 7 mins for Eur3 2 Airport 11 mins for Eur4 5 In fact we can also take bus 22 to Amsterdam Centraal 20 mins bus 69 to airport 40 mins Basically the 24 hours GVB day pass costs only Eur7 5 which you can freely take city bus tram metro It is much cheaper than train If they reply my email and gave me the bus information then I will not buy the OV card It happened the system error when we boarded the train Eur20 x2 was retained by OV card company and the refund Eur40 can only be made via a Dutch bank account It is really ridiculous 2 Limited choice of food in their restaurant , Location quiet and comfort bedroom The hotel is pretty new and cosy Nice staff 
274326,Urban Lodge Hotel, we arrived 30 min early 13 30 but our room was not ready until 14 15 so we had to wait 45 minutes Although the hotel is easily accessed by public transportation but its quite costly so consider it if your are planning to stay for longer periods , Very clean hotel with friendly staff You could buy tickets to museums at reception
274327,Urban Lodge Hotel, The location of the hotel was not listed on the GPS I had my own car and it took me a very long time to find the hotel When I have finally reached their the hotel parking lot was full They gave me a room with a broken window they didn t give me a better room instead they brought a big towel and rapped the widow and that was 2 o clock in the morning I could not sleep until 6 in the morning I almost died from coldness It was the worst night in my life , Their breakfast
274328,Urban Lodge Hotel, Not too close to the city You need a train bus to get to the city center , Clean gorgeous breakfast buffet in the morning cozy lobby setting at night with a beautiful fireplace 
274329,Urban Lodge Hotel, Perhaps hotel bar could be open a little later , Great location Its easily found and very well positioned for access to central station Good facilities friendly staff modern and spotless Would definitely use again 
274330,Urban Lodge Hotel, When arriving at train station difficult to pull suitcases over brick sidewalks be sure to pack light You might be disturbed if trying to sleep late in the morning because both mornings between 9 11 am we heard a loud strange squeaking noise and discovered it was probably the wheels on something the maid was pushing around the nearby rooms for cleaning Breakfast 12 50 was too expensive for us Have coffee tea in your room and bring food to keep in your fridge and wait until you get into the city for lunch , Location A few min walk from Sloterdijk Train Station and easily located by asking ticket seller in train station Check In Amazing in every way we got here at 9 30am We only waited a few minutes to be helped Patrick was kind and informative spoke excellent English and gave us everything without having to ask him He gave us a map circled places on it and explained transportation he gave us the wifi password 3 keys to our triple room and even went upstairs to see if he had a room ready for us so early which he did Room 312 Triple room for 150 Clean and inviting with 3 single beds 2 chairs desk 3 charging outlets TV fridge closet water heater with 3 mugs 3 tea bags 3 packets of instant coffee spoon cream sugar Triple Room was small but adequate Beds Extremely comfortable with THREE pillows per bed night lights and a clean white comfy duve Bathroom Large frosted window allowed plenty of outdoor light in spacious with enough areas to store your toiletries rainfall shower head excellent water temperature pressure and even a convenient clothes line For 3 guests it was stocked with a bath mat 3 clean white soft bath towels hand towels 3 glasses 3 shower caps 3 bottles of shampoo but only 1 bar if soap 2 should be provided 1 for sink 1 for shower Wifi Excellent signal when we arrived in the late morning and easy to connect with password Signal was never dropped or weak Lobby Great atmosphere with comfy couches fire in center and bar to the side Bartender was extremely nice and helpful Several guests lounged around the fire in the evening and used the wifi Luggage Storage locked room available in lobby Receptionist knew we were in a hurry to catch plane and quickly left other customers in line to give us our stored luggage Love this hotel and would definitely return when in town 
274331,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, Loved the Staff and the Ambiance of the Hotel We requested an early check in before arriving We were told they couldn t guarantee it but they would do their best and our room was ready early Everyone was very friendly The Hotel is in a perfect location The train station is right across the street Very easy We would definitely stay here again 
274332,Urban Lodge Hotel, Not enough parking despite having paid for a space Had to park in road and get a refund for last night then go out by 9 am to avoid parking ticket Would be better if hotel made situation clearer at time of booking , Lovely quiet comfortable room Bed excellent Staff friendly and helpful 
274333,Urban Lodge Hotel, The hotel being more on the outskirts parking should have been included in the tariff , Reception staff were very friendly and helpful with suggesting options to go around the city

274338,Urban Lodge Hotel, I can t say anything bad about the hotel , If you want young and lively then stay away this hotel seemed to be more for business men famalies and 30 The hotel was nicely situated in a quiet area The hotel was very well maintained The staff were very friendly and helpful The lobby area of the hotel is so nice big oversized sofas with rugs around an open fire Getting taxis were expensive one taxi cost 35 the next 15 the train station was a 5 minute walk with the trains being so regular and running until 1 30am we just got those mostly 
274339,Urban Lodge Hotel, In 3 days period fire alarm turned on twice once at 6 am for a long time Location is good but it is definitely not near the centre Trip by metro takes over 30 min and need to take 2 lines But travel to RAI Convention centre is perfect Staff had a resentment that everything not fixed in the room is being stolen And we only wanted hairdryer because it was lacking , Staff was very flexible they had no problem to realize even strangest request 
274340,Urban Lodge Hotel, The restaurant located in a hotel could have a bigger selection for foods and drinks , We specifically asked for a quiet room and definitely received one like that 
274341,Urban Lodge Hotel, I am vegan and coeliac and except of some fruit there was no choice for breakfast They got me soya milk for breakfast next morning without any problem , The design is lovely rooms very clean and comfortable Staff very friendly and helpful It is a bit far from the center but you can take bus 22 and takes about 12 minutes to get to Central station which seems to be the core of Amsterdam 
274342,Urban Lodge Hotel, As the hotel is very new there was some furniture being built in the hall ways but this didn t really effect our stay , Our stay in the urban lodge was incredibly good value for money The rooms were very spacious and well equipped with everything you could need The bar area was very nice and included a very nice sofa area with a small fire in the centre I would definitely recommend this hotel It s not central but with a train station directly across the road and the centre only one stop away it is definitely a good location 
274343,Urban Lodge Hotel, As the hotel hasn t been open long they were still doing some of the rooms One morning at about six we were woken up by the sound of drilling it sounded like it was on the other side of the wall One of the days we were there we had gone out for the day and came back in The evening to find someone had been in and added new decoration we found that strange that the room hadn t been seen to but someone had come in and decorated , The staff were very friendly and couldn t do enough to help us 
274344,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, it s really a great place The room is big and clean The people work there is so enthusiasm And the price is reasonable If I can come to Amsterdam next time I will definitely choose this hotel again

274349,Urban Lodge Hotel, Not really any negatives The only thing is that it s a very quiet area so not much choice for dining and drinks so we stayed in the city and returned later Tram train and buses all very accessible , The staff at Urban Lodge Hotel were all so warm friendly and helpful The hotel is only around 3 months old so everything is fresh shiny and new We loved the style of the hotel and booked a large double which was very comfortable and roomy 
274350,Urban Lodge Hotel, Wasn t a great selection in the bar and there isn t really a smoking area its just out side the door where as other hotels had outdoor heaters and somewhere to sit down , When you get out of the Airport ask for a ticket to Sloterdijk an when you leave Sloterdijk station turn left and you ll see the hotel its only a 3 minute walk Beds were very comfortable was 10 minute from airport and another 10 minutes into city center There s a train bus and tram all located beside the hotel Staff were very friendly and hotel was nice and clean Would recommend to anyone Small fridge in the room was great Hoping to get back again this year Didn t have the breakfast coz it seemed expensive but Spar across the road do a great selection of food
274351,Urban Lodge Hotel, there are only few things i can say and that are less then good for 4 people the room with the open dorm bed is a bit small the closet is minimal at best more over for 4 people as a tall person the dorm beds are a bit small Breakfast was expensive so we decided to save the money and eat out super market is close by , The hotel was a great place to stay the hotel the hotel itself is very modern with a very nice lobby with a great fireplace to sit in the cold days and enjoy the heat the staff was very helpful and friendly wifi signal was great all over the hotel rental bikes are available and the price is average compared to other places we saw with it going down the more days you book them the room while for 4 people it might have been on the small side with the dorm bed open the couch opens up for 2 people i will be more the enough there is even a small refrigerator in the closet the normal beds are very comfortable location Urban is 5 minute walk from sloterdijk station that has direct connection to the central station by train most trains 5min ride or bus 22 during the day or 748 at night 20minutes stores nearby there is a super market at the same sloterdijk to buy stuff for cheap
274352,Urban Lodge Hotel, I found the breakfast rather expensive , Really comfortable beds clean rooms helpful staff 3 minutes on foot from the Sloterdjik train station Definitely worth a second stay 
274353,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is in a great location close to all public transport and only 10 15 minutes in to the centre Beds are very comfortable and new linen and towels daily Would definitely return to this hotel 5 
274354,Urban Lodge Hotel, Nothing really , Hotel is very new clean and well designed Modern but with a wooden feel like a lodge Staff are friendly and helpful Rooms are comfortable and the sofa turned into a bunk bed for our 2 kids Room space a little small for a family of 4 but price was low so we can t complain Good wifi too Buffet breakfast was excellent with many choices of food and drink Tram train and bus stations nearby so good access to city centre and beyond Free car parking in front of hotel which is a blessing in a big city 
274355,Urban Lodge Hotel, location 20 minutes out of central station therefore the extra costs need to be accepted to stay here 3 5 euros per person by tram or bus each way , staff were excellent
274356,Urban Lodge Hotel, In my opinion 15 Euro parking per day is expensive , Nice big rooms VERY fast Internet connection very friendly personnel good breakfast Dinner menu is small but tasty I accidentially booked breakfast for 2 persons on my booking and realised that on my checkout on the invoice They paid me the extra breakfast back right away without any problem Very helpful 
274357,Urban Lodge Hotel, Nothing much to complain , So friendly Girl Lillian not quite sure about her name but should be Lillian at the reception She was excellent in helping us Then the Bar boys It was really homely 
274358,Urban Lodge Hotel, Nothing, Hotel special and comfortable Copious and varied breakfast An easy access of the historic center of Amsterdam and airport thanks to the multiple transport has closeness of the hotel very good value for money A staff chalereux one thank you
274359,Urban Lodge Hotel, The smart TV did not work for half the time we was there and the regular television could not be translated to English The television in the lounge reception was out of order too The location was great but not much in the area to do Our sheets wasn t changed even though we stayed 3 nights The room was clean though , The bed was great The location was good and accessible by train Loved the smart tv The reception and Decor was amazing The staff were very friendly 
274360,Urban Lodge Hotel, WAs a little out of the way for us, The chef put a grilled chicken sandwich together for us as there wasn t anything on the menu we liked and it was amazing
274361,Urban Lodge Hotel, The temperature in the bathroom especially the floor during the night was much lower than in the bedroom making it a bit uncomfortable Taking the tram to the city center takes about half an hour and you have to switch to another line once Otherwise the location is fine , A clean modern room with a control panel for the heating system and comfortable beds with various pillows of different sizes and stiffness The bathroom is large the shower was great Overall it was a very pleasant stay 
274362,Urban Lodge Hotel, They re a little short of staff as far as I understood the hotel was only working for 2 months maybe that s why , Very friendly and nice staff excellent conditions clean quiet relaxing lounge area at the main floor pretty good food Very close to Sloterdjik train station which takes you in 5 minutes by train downtown to Amsterdam Centraal Easy to get by car as well and by public transport also Free wifi and good connection anywhere in the Hotel Also there s a free parking during weekends right next to the hotel parking so you don t have to pay 15euros per day
274363,Urban Lodge Hotel, I can t think of anything bad about this hotel , The guy at the reception was great he told us every useful information that we needed for a city trip The lounge was very beautiful it even had a fire place Close to a hotel is a train station that takes you to Amsterdam central in about 9 minutes The room was cleaned every day and towels replaced The wifi worked like a charm 
274364,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, The location of urban lodge is perfect So easy to find from the train station The hotel is clearly marked and when you arrive in to reception the furnishings and overall layout is very modern Hair dryer in the room was handy The smart Tv was good to have We would definitely come back to stay 
274365,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic hotel Worth every penny Staff were superb and very helpful and so friendly only a few minutes to the train station and all other transport links Amsterdam is the best 
274366,Urban Lodge Hotel, Nothing was wrong with the room , So close to everything 5 mins walk from train station and 5 minutes on the train always a train waiting when we arrived and never waited longer than 5 minutes Staff were amazing so helpful and friendly extremely clean room Heating nice bathroom with a nice shower and the breakfast was nice 
274367,Urban Lodge Hotel, Its 10mins by train or 20 by bus from Amsterdam centre Not an issue for us but might be for some , Very modern Very helpful staff Some good places to eat and drink nearby 
274368,Urban Lodge Hotel, Couldnt find fault with anything , From check in to departure nothing was too much trouble for the young enthusiastic staff The hotel is located close to Sloterdijk station 2 stops from Schipol airport station and is an ideal base for a visit to Amsterdam A 22 bus 20 mins to Dam square or a train to Amsterdam Central 5 mins is the best way to reach the centre We had both breakfast and an evening meal and though the menu is limited the food is both good and well priced The hotel has only been open for about 6 weeks so everything is clean and shiny The rooms are large well fitted out and the bathroom is superb A truely memorable stay 
274369,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, Really Great Nice Crew nice room nice breakfast Everything was great the price was AWESOME and the train station is a about 5 minutes to walk See you next time guys 
274370,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, Welcomed by extremely friendly staff beautifil hotel with excellent rooms and facilities One of the best showers I have ever had Would book this 100 in the future 10 10 
274371,Urban Lodge Hotel, This is the first time I found that the reviews didn t correspond to the location Hotel just opened apparently which is why I don t understand how it can have so many comments and such a good score The menu in the restaurant was very limited and printed on an A4 paper There was a bucket with cleaning stuff left next to lifts Was there when I arrived and was there when I left There was no remote control for the TV in the room No bottle of water in the room Just a vending machine downstairs It is these small details that make the difference , Staff were friendly and welcoming 
274372,Urban Lodge Hotel, A little far from city but that isn t such a bad thing Train station is nearby which is just a few stops from central , This hotel is brand new We stayed in a basic room but it was lovely Has been decorated minimalist style The bathroom was beautiful too So clean Comfy pillows and bed Hire a bike at the hotel and ride into the city like a local Staff are super friendly and helpful Quick free wifi in rooms Would stay here again 
274373,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, The staff were so kind one of the receptionists spent at least half an hour going through the map with us Telling us the best places to travel all methods of transport including the numbers and which stations Very friendly and helpful with everything we asked of them Could not ask for a better welcoming party 
274374,Urban Lodge Hotel, Someone was stupid enough to smoke in their room even though there are smoke detectors everywhere which resulted in fire alarm waking up the whole hotel at 6 30am , Rooms were nicely decorated and had a big comfortable bed The staff was smiling and was always eager to help us The hotel just opened so everything is new and modern but also super cozy We really liked the fireplace in the middle of lounge a place perfect to just sit and relax As well hotel is near the Sloterdijk station so getting to public transport was easy The bus trip to central station takes about 15 20min 
274375,Urban Lodge Hotel, still expensive parking even the hotel located outside of the centrum need to pay additional for the parking which is 15 , the bed is very comfortable location near to train station
274376,Urban Lodge Hotel, The Hotel is located about 10 13 mins by bus from the City Center Amsterdam Central Train Station The bus stop is right by another bus Train Station i guess Sloterdijk which is pretty convenient Moreover international buses of firms OUIBUS or Meinfernbus stop as well there , The Hotel provides Service which is far above the Price paid The Advantage is that the Hotel is a new one so everything is still fresh and clean Personal was extremely friendly could speak different languages and was generally very helpful The dishes in the Restaurant and breakfasts were as well above our expectations That was highly appreciated after exhausting trip 
274377,Urban Lodge Hotel, I didn t really like that the bed was split in half as a couple When you re snuggling and playing you tend to fall in between the bed and we had to fix it together every time Other than that nothing else really Very kool place , I really enjoyed the atmosphere It was quite lovely and relaxing and clean 
274378,Urban Lodge Hotel, Price was quite high during trade fair Far from the center, Breakfast was OK Rooms are not too big but OK for Amsterdam Metro station is close Parking was for free Fast W Lan
274379,Urban Lodge Hotel, I think bar should have wooden features so it fits within the rest of the design , Fab contemporary hotel near train station with an easy access to Amsterdam and any other destination The atmosphere was very friendly and welcoming everyone was happy to chat and help Bravo to interior designer to make this place unique we loved chairs little tables and the fire with a big sofa is the highlight 
274380,Urban Lodge Hotel, the cleaner left the full bin bags and cups in my room i got a drink from the bar on the first night and 3 days later the glass was still sitting on my bedside table Cleaning was not very good, lovely interior friendly staff and good location
274381,Urban Lodge Hotel, My room was on the front side of the building and you could hear the traffic below , The staff was very helpful and friendly The rooms were clean and had a modern feel 
274382,Urban Lodge Hotel, Guy at reception wouldn t sell us water after 2am and vending machine was broke and complained that he couldn t just give us a glass from the tap because apparently people steal glasses Thought it was rude as we had spent nearly 12 hours travelling and only arrived at 12 at night Also when we were in bed one morning a guy working in the hotel walked into our room Found this strange as we both should only have a key to the ro we were staying in , Bed was like a cloud very fresh hotel and very clean 
274383,Urban Lodge Hotel, Shuttle service to and from Schiphol Airport My two taxi trips cost me more than one nights stay at the Urban Lodge , This is a beautiful hotel with the most friendly and helpful staff As I m an amputee they went out of their way to make my stay pleasant They even went out and purchase a special chair to put in the shower Location is awesome if you don t mind staying a bit out of town Sloterdijk Station is only a couple 100m meters away from where you could get on the Metro train bus or tram Will definitely stay there again next year 
274384,Urban Lodge Hotel, The wifi didn t work No extra towels placed after old ones used until requested at reception , Breakfast was lovely Rooms spacious and comfortable Fantastic bathroom and shower Excellent location 2 minutes walk to train station where Amsterdam Central is one stop away 
274385,Urban Lodge Hotel, Breakfast staff came direct from street to kitchen Breakfast no plastik gloves no hand washing The restrauant was only fast snack Burger salad burger served cold, Desk staff all ok kitchen low hygine
274386,Urban Lodge Hotel, Only thing we could really complain about was the room was a bit cold Overall Amsterdam was freezing when we were over so maybe this couldn t be helped , The fire in the lobby area was amazing Overall the place was so clean And the staff we dealt with were very friendly and helpful Highly recommend
274387,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, Staff were really friendly and helpful rooms were really nice and cosy and clean Couldn t of asked for a better service Would definetly stay here again
274388,Urban Lodge Hotel, Not necassary but would be nice to have a little english tv, Nice new hotel with a perfect location about a 5 minute walk from the trainstation then a 6 minutes journy to central amsterdam which is very convienient 
274389,Urban Lodge Hotel, While checking out to be asked if i would like to donate the deposit money 1 for a charity I myself a man who loves to help others but in this example i really felt disturbed as i felt i was pushed to donate even though i was asked in the kindest way It was just not cool , Perfect location at a walking distance to most attractions and also to public transportation From the first moment you feel like you are somewhere you know for years 
274390,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, Although not fully finished this hotel is conveniently located and very good value for money as I paid just 40 for the night Would definitely return and recommend at that price it was great 
274391,Urban Lodge Hotel, Restaurant was a bit dissapointing fries came too late and too little Also the portion of mayo was very small The vegetables didn t go well with the steak Just some lettice or a tomato would have been great , The beds were comfy and clean nice shower friendly staff 
274392,Urban Lodge Hotel, I think things will get better as time goes on There was quite a bit of construction and remodelling still going on so it was a bit noisy although not in the rooms I think the bathroom could use a few extra towel hooks close to the shower but the shower itself was heavenly We just came from Berlin where bicycles were 12 per day to rent so I think if the bicycle rental price here was cheaper that would be a really good thing , My daughter and I stayed at the Urban Lodge Hotel for the purpose of catching an early train to Schiphol as it is within a 7 minute walk to the station We learned it was only their first week open Despite the newness and the fact that not everything was completed the staff were wonderful and very helpful There are several nice cafes and restaurants nearby as well as the shops within the station The rooms were clean and comfortable I would stay here again if I needed to catch an early train 
274393,Urban Lodge Hotel, The Hotel is not central however it is fairly easy to get to the city centre Train metro bus and tram stations are close by We got a CityCard which does not include train tickets and therefore we used to go to the city centre by bus usually number 21 or by tram number 14 Depending on our destination it took approx 15 30 min The trip would be much faster if done by train i d say 5 minutes We didn t feel the location as being a negative point at all but since someone might we decided to list it as such , Our stay at Urban Lodge Hotel in Amsterdam was perfect The whole place looked just renovated and very clean The staff was very friendly and helpful The rooms are very cozy roomy and in my opinion well furnished and modern The bathroom is quite big and perfectly clean The air conditioning and WiFi work excellently Very good value for money we were positively surprised 
274394,Urban Lodge Hotel, There was nothing we didn t like it was a lovely hotel although it was unfinished having only opened a few weeks before our visit They were still putting in furniture etc Could do with a mirror in the main room and instructions to the safe, Very clean and staff were extremely helpful 
274395,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, The staff were of great help that our stay was really contented with all the info we needed Defna and the specky guy sorry didnt get his name were great personalities who went all out to help guests Thanks The coffee at the lobby area was generous and the lobby seating place was so comfi 
274396,Urban Lodge Hotel, someone turned our card for roomkeeping to do not disturb so we did not get roomkeeping for the second day of our stay, the room was very spacious bright and clean
274397,Urban Lodge Hotel, The room was okay but would have been too small if we ve had bigger luggages Hotel is a bit far from the centrum so it was difficult to get back to there late at night Surrounding area is quite ugly , The hotel was brand new and had cool interior design Out room was comfy and clean and the common area was great for hanging out Staff was friendly and helpful The location is not central but the metro train station is very close so moving around the city during the day is easy 
274398,Urban Lodge Hotel, As the hotel has just been opened there were still some furniture and boxes on the floor where we stayed Also the trash bin in a lounge bathroom was missing But I m sure the hotel staff will fix that out soon , I love the design of the hotel It is very stylish and modern but at the same time pretty cosy The fireplace in the middle of the lounge is cool The subway train tram and bus stops were in a walking distance and there was also an option to rent a bike right at the hotel 
274399,Urban Lodge Hotel, Despite us placing a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door some random staff member just walked right into our room to give us two decorative pillows I had read on a previous review that this happened to another couple too Not good at all Goodness knows what we might have been doing Not enough tea and coffee supplied Could do with mirrors in the bedrooms and not just the bathroom , Lovely brand new hotel in a great location We were only there for a few days and wanted to visit the RLD We were conveniently located a few minutes from the train station so commuting was easy Would have been good if the hotel could have arranged discounted tickets though because it got pricey Hotel very clean could still smell the newness of it Room was lovely and wellequipped Restaurant a little expensive but there is plenty to eat at the train station so that s what we did Overall a very enjoyable stay and would def return 
274400,Urban Lodge Hotel, Unfortunately one time we tried to get off the parking lot they forgot to open the beam for us and we had to phone them to open it , Location is good near the Sloterdijk train station The staff was super friendly Something I d expect in a 5 hotel 
274401,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, The people make the place I ve stayed in more than a 100 different hotels but never before where all the staff were so friendly as here The design of the rooms and public spaces is very modern with an alternative touch The fireplace in the middle of the bar is excellent

274403,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, The two young girls at reception around 20 were very nice and were also pleasantly welcoming to me and my friend please give them some recognition as this is a new job for them also Jake Holland Craig
274404,Urban Lodge Hotel,No Negative, Stayed at this new hotel the week it opened Friday 15th Sunday 17th January 2016 and I enjoyed my stay in this quieter part of the city The hotel was easy to find just 10 minutes away by train direct from Schiphol airport to Sloterdijk Station and the hotel could be seen from the station Check in was quick and easy hotel was spotless and everything was brand new I stayed in a triple room which was lovely with comfortable beds and a nice bathroom Hotel staff were really friendly and helped us a lot during our stay Location was great too literally 5 minutes away by train from Amsterdam central station it was nice to relax in a quieter part of the city after a busy day Free wifi was also a bonus Would recommend this hotel and would stay here again in future thankyou 
274405,Urban Lodge Hotel, Breakfast wasn t good at all Very cold and a young man member of staff was carrying bread with his bare hands not even on a plate Gloves should of been worn not very good experience, Staff couldn t do enough Very helpful
274406,Urban Lodge Hotel, Breakfast was 9 50 per person day which was a good price but could have had a little more variety in choices Still a fantastic deal overall Will be back with the whole family soon , Staff was sooo friendly and helpful with booking tours and city trips Hotel is brand new very clean and in a good location for Amsterdam city trips The train station is only a 5 minute walk away where you can also find a small supermarket to shop
