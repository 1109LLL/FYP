154810,Novotel Paris 17, The breakfast room was occupied by a group on both mornings The temporary pop up room adequate Food quite basic and ok , The room size and bathroom very adequate and clean Queen room with a view of Eiffel Tower very good on Bastille Night and on other nights when the tower is lit up If you like walking then this is a perfectly ok hotel to stay at More or less a straight walk along the Blvd Wagmar for 30 minutes into Arc de Triomphe Perriar train station a 15 minute walk and access to route 3 on the metro and onward connections very straight forward Gare du Nord to hotel via Metro and walk approx 45 mins with good connections Very nice restaurant on the Albert Square by Perriar station recommend L Hortensia for their traditional onion soup and salmon dish 
154811,Novotel Paris 17, We got late by couple of hours in checking out Manager at the reception got so rude with us raised his voice and got annoyed to say this is not done I felt as if i had committed a crime Such people are complete misfit in hospitality industry Then there was an issue with drain pipe in restroom which they fixed after several reminders Thanks to Indonesian mgr who came to our rescue Will go down as very bad stay for us had it not been for that 1 person , Indonesian person at front office was ever so helpful in giving advice at the time of check in 
154812,Novotel Paris 17, Unhelpful rude staff Booked a room for three people and only one bottle of water and 2 tea bags Despite repeatedly asking it took a few calls and lots of waiting for the extra to arrive Monday nights room service did not turn up at all , Nothing
154813,Novotel Paris 17, Hotel is located just near busy road big traffic around and refuge hostel or some other social place just across the street This is the place where you definetely do not want to stay where travel with kids to see Paris , 
154814,Novotel Paris 17, No microwave Far from Metro walk for more than 15min Only a small refrigerator Window can not open to get fresh air Only give 1 bottle of water per day for 3 guests Kettle is made of plastic not healthy , Breakfast is good hotel staff are kind 
154815,Novotel Paris 17, Being told there wasn t a family room because of a double booking was highly disappointing Having to demand the room I booked months in advance wasn t acceptable Little too far from metro Ended up getting taxis especially at night , Room was comfortable Nice feel to hotel Breakfast was good 
154816,Novotel Paris 17, The taxi ordered through reception to get back to airport was nearly 50 more expensive than the one from the airport to the hotel from airport to hotel 50Euro from hotel to airport 72Euro Free wifi has low speed and capacity , The hotel was clean and service was good Bus station is very close RER and Metro station in the couple of blocks from the hotel but it was great to have a walk in the morning and buy coffee and croissants on the way to metro Good block 17 calm peaceful and friendly
154817,Novotel Paris 17, Very bad wifi When a Hotel says free wifi means free wifi Doesnt mean we have a low speed free wifi and if you pay you will have the high speed At least I expect to know that from the beginning before I book the room , Very gentle people working on the hotel 
154818,Novotel Paris 17, The hotel is pet friendly and in the case of dogs there isn t any areas to walk them If they have suggested walking areas for dogs that would be great ,No Positive
154819,Novotel Paris 17, The fact that we couldn t get room service on New Years Eve as all other restaurants fast food were closed from 7pm so we with 3 children didn t have anything to eat that night Very poor service Also most hotels offer free breakfast for children very expensive breakfasts for 5 for 3nights , We liked our rooms the breakfast food and the short walk to the nearest metro 
154820,Novotel Paris 17, Hotel is too far from Paris gare lyon Breakfast is too costly around 18 per person Heater not working properly Overall not good experience , Hotel staff specially ladies were too friendly and helpful to us The one with specs is really good lady 
154821,Novotel Paris 17, The fact that the restaurant doesn t open until 7 and with kids this is too late Also the windows didn t open and the fan wasn t great so a bit warm at night , The bed was very comfortable and the room a nice size The kids beds were also very good The staff on reception were very helpful too
154822,Novotel Paris 17, In the middle of town and must leave early to avoid traffics Breakfast should have more halal food to attract tourist , Staff very polite and accomodate Room is superb and comfortable Easy to get cab to Eifel and cost 20 
154823,Novotel Paris 17, The fitness area could be improved The location is on a very busy corner of Paris with Terrible traffic in all directions Therefore getting in and out by car took really long , The Staff were very helpful and friendly
154824,Novotel Paris 17, I reserved the chamber executive room but the AC was not working properly so they shifted me to another regular room which was fine but without the view I requested They discounted 20 euros per night for this change Facilitate of the hotel are not very special the lobby is small , The staff were helpful and addressed my needs Quiet and spacious 
154825,Novotel Paris 17, The indian who works in the reception was rude Otherwise all of their staff were nice , The rooms were spacious The check in and check out were smooth Worth the money 
154826,Novotel Paris 17, Eggs Eggs Eggs We stayed at 2 novotel hotels this summer in France and whilst the breakfast was mostly great the scrambled eggs tasted synthetic and like they were out of a packet They taste terrible and given the fact that bowl was offered full to the brim I think we were not the only people that didn t like them and that the hotels have a lot of waste of this item , Decoration and comfortable bed
154827,Novotel Paris 17, The phone charges to a toll free number were higher than expected The Metro stations are a little farther from the hotel than one with luggage might wish , The assistance of the front desk staff was excellent 
154828,Novotel Paris 17, The windows couldn t be opened so there wasn t fresh air , The breakfast was delicious The room was big and nice and also the stuff was friendly It had a good pozition nedt to the periferical boulevard It had enought parking spaces
154829,Novotel Paris 17, no ironing board in the room come on this is no luxury had to go up to the 6th floor to get my clothes ironed , liked the breakfast menu and the hospitality of the staff in general
154830,Novotel Paris 17, I would give a higher score if the carpet would be changed of other kind of floor it always gives me the feeling of dirtiness , The beds were very good We got a family room that was just perfect 
154831,Novotel Paris 17, Same breakfast menu every day the kids couldn t eat after a few days Too far from a metro station , Room was good with functional air cond Breakfast menu was OK for a short stay but needs to improve for a longer stay 
154832,Novotel Paris 17, 1 Staff were so rude unbelievably rude 2 Breakfast not up to par 3 Location was abit crap took an uber to get to Arc De Triomphe approx 6 EUR as Metro is about 25mins walk , 1 Nice facilities 2 Hotel genuinely looked about a 4 
154833,Novotel Paris 17, 1 Catering staff telling customers you only have until 10 am to eat your breakfast 2 Toilet being separate from bathroom 3 Location being not ideal for metro use to travel to city center no local shops nearby , Staff was helpful even ordered food from outside hotel 
154834,Novotel Paris 17, The room is safocated had smell To make things worst it is impossible to open the window I do not recommend to people with allergic reaction or Asma , The staff the size of the room the location is near to transport Very quite room 
154835,Novotel Paris 17,No Negative, The location of the hotel was good as we drove and it was easy to find from the ring road The room was a good size We liked the area and walked into the centre We ate at restaurants in the vicinity 
154836,Novotel Paris 17, Site really unpleasant with nothing interesting around not even a coffee shop or restaurant Very close to the peripheral high speed road , The room was ok 
154837,Novotel Paris 17, Would have preferred the toilet in with the shower sink , Great shower good toiletries Staff very helpful in showing things on a map and ordering cabs 
154838,Novotel Paris 17, Far from public transport so really hard to move around if you come with big luggage from the airport The gym is not a gym facility but a simple cardio Also I have been charged 10 5 for 3 minuscule coffees from a not even Nespresso like automatic coffee machine It costs me more than 3 croissant and 3 chocolate croissant from the bakery , Polite staff clean rooms and comfortable bed Good for business trip 
154839,Novotel Paris 17, Nothing, Always staying at champs elysee but this time I choose your hotel for distance reasons It was amazing The staff was amazing They help us I don t know how to thank you
154840,Novotel Paris 17, Although we booked for 2 adults and 2 children 1 baby and requested baby cot the staff were not aware that we did book a family room and did not supply with a cot until later on Unfortunately even then the cot did not have a mattress and the sheets were left inside for us to make it For this reason our baby had to sleep with us in bed which originated not much sleep for mummy as we were afraid she will fall off the bed Disappointing , Novotel is almost always consistent across all hotels
154841,Novotel Paris 17, i guess only the location of the hotel is a disappointment but over all its a wonderful property , Team at Novotel 17 is super friendly and would sometime go out of their way to help you 
154842,Novotel Paris 17, resturant was very small had to wait for 30min not many options for vegetarians in breakfast will not stay with novotel in future They need to learn from welcome group or ramada group , rooms comfortable
154843,Novotel Paris 17, Location and connectivity The expense to arrange a taxi to go to Paris Nord was fare too much , It was a comfortable stay in this nice hotel with a cordial staff 
154844,Novotel Paris 17, Staff at the restaurant served by 3 or 4 different people wrong wine brought to a table one waitress rushed with service little bit and atmosphere could have been much more relaxed Breakfast little bit late than what we ordered for , View of the Eiffel Tower especially at night bath room d cor and cleanliness
154845,Novotel Paris 17, I liked nothing in the hotel expect the proximity to the city Staff is arrogant food is not Continental Its not so kids friendly cramped rooms toilet facility is not good I would never ever stay is Novotel , Its close to the city and is in Paris
154846,Novotel Paris 17, Expensive parking Scramble eggs not nice at all No fresh milk in the coffee machine , We have enjoyed our stay at this hotel The bed and pillows were very comfy Location is 10 minutes by taxi from the centre We didn t like the metro also it wasn t too close to the hotel Kids loved the play area at the reception Breakfast was ok I like the idea of boiled eggs The scramble eggs were awful also we had to ask for fresh milk for our coffee and they use powder in the coffee machine what doesn t taste nice The pastry and pancake section I would expect to be fresh but it wasn t freshly made We would come back to this hotel as its a good value for money and comfy 
154847,Novotel Paris 17, Upon check in Saturday we were told that breakfast was 6am 11am and were never informed that this was weekends only So on our last day when we fancied a lie in and went down at 10 15am we were refused entry to breakfast informing us breakfast closed at 10am We explained the issue so the member of staff offered us a free of charge bar breakfast unfortunately though this was an orange juice croissant and very bitter fruit It was better than nothing but still had to go and get breakfast elsewhere , The hotel was one of the cleanest I ve ever stayed in Very modern and had absolutely everything we wanted and needed

154851,Novotel Paris 17, The free WiFi was atrocious and the paid WiFi was only slightly better , The provision of beverages in each room really added significantly to my comfort during my stay
