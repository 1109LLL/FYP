143926,BoB Hotel by Elegancia,No Negative, Such a chic hotel The rooms especially the shower bed and pillows were divine Slept wonderfully after spending the day walking around in Paris Its close to the metro not far from the city center and its in a really quite and calm neighborhood Loved this hotel it will certainly be my first choice next time I visit Paris 
143927,BoB Hotel by Elegancia, The only thing it wasn t great is the Wifi conection it s free but it s useless extremely slow we have had to use our roaming data , The location is great just a few meters from the metro station the room was very clean and bed extra comfy outstanding service provided by staff 
143928,BoB Hotel by Elegancia, Thank you dear BoB team everything was perfect , BoB Hotel by Elegancia was my best experience in Paris Everything from arriving with short hotel guide tour to check out was perfect Young and very friendly english speaking staff Excellent breakfast options express or long lasting branch in an elegant courtyard Stylish silent room and bathroom with all what you need to take a shower Staff all the time taking care about what how guest feel and they have any answers to all questions they suggested me nice restaurant for dinner Le Moulin Vert 
143929,BoB Hotel by Elegancia, The only slight improvements needed are a couple of hooks in the bathroom and some shelves for placing clothes during longer stays , The hotel is a gem The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly The room was spacious and perfectly clean the bathroom was very modern and the bed was probably the most comfortable that we have ever had in a hotel Despite being a little outside the center the hotel was a great base for visiting most tourist sites The Pernety metro station is literally one minute away and offers easy transfers to many of the main lines We very much appreciated that the hotel offered a choice of a light breakfast and a fuller buffet While the hotel does not have parking we were able to find a parking nearby at a really reasonable rate using a parking app We will definitely stay here again 
143930,BoB Hotel by Elegancia,No Negative, The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful And the staff was helpful Breakfast was delicious Highly recommend staying here as it is very near to the metro 
143931,BoB Hotel by Elegancia, My friend and i had an interesting experience at this hotel The night we stayed there the fire alarm went off early in the morning we found out the next day that apparently there was a mechanical problem with the system and this was the third time in three months the fire alarm went off without any clear causes I d urge management to fix this problem as soon as possible The communication between staff members needs improvement Upon checking in we asked to extend our check out time by an hour to 1 00pm in the afternoon To our surprise and disappointment between 12 00 1 00 the next day three staff members walked into our room without consent while my friend and I were changing and packing I communicated to the property manager the next morning about our unpleasant experience and received a 25 refund upon my insistence I would not recommend this hotel unless there is significant improvement in its management , The property is very new judging from the smell of fresh paint in the room The design is fresh and modern That said much is to be desired from management service and communication 
143932,BoB Hotel by Elegancia, No fridge in the room No double bed two slim single beds combined which was not perfectly comfortable Toilet is not properly separated from the room no sound insulation at all Complemantary phone was promised inside the description but we did not receive any in the room When asked the receptionist told that this is not a promised feature but convinced when I showed the hotel description where this is clearly listed as a hotel feature At the end he worked to get a phone for us thanks for that Personal on the reception which is there on the night was not very helpful we assumed he may be a student , Very close to the metro station pernety M4 literally 2 minutes away Stylish room design Very good neighborhoud pretty nice places to dine or have breakfast grocery store just opposite of the store which is open until late Breakfast was pretty good Very clean room
143933,BoB Hotel by Elegancia, The storage of our clothes was a bit tricky we had an interesting hanging wardrobe but there was just not enough space , This hotel was a real find and we wouldn t hesitate a minute to come back here again Everything was created with care and taste obviously inspired by art deco designs the reception the little library the terrace in the central yard and our room in the second building All quiet you don t need an alarm we woke up by the singing of the birds and flawlessly clean Besides a special thanks to the lovely and helpful reception team they all represent their house just perfectly The management should be very happy to have them Merci encore une fois 
143934,BoB Hotel by Elegancia, There was nothing I did not like , The hotel is nicely located at a quiet neighborhood From the Eiffel Tower is a 12 to 15 ride which is ok The bedroom was clean and lovely The breakfast was great I will definately stay there next time 
143935,BoB Hotel by Elegancia, The hotel in itself is quite okay however some issues hold it back The safe in our room was small not laptop sized did not work no batteries and was not bolted to the wall The staff was very friendly and offered us to switch rooms however having partly unpacked we did not want the extra hustle This could have been resolved in advance especially since we only checked in at around 8pm We did store our valuables in the hotel safe at the reception and the one in our room got fixed inserted batteries a day later The room itself lacks a cupboard to store clothes I did not check that when booking only a few hangers without the option to hang pants If you are staying for more than a couple of days travel with suits this may be an issue The breakfast was very disappointing Monotone with very few options Haven t been to Paris many times so difficult to know the local standards I am travelling a lot for work leisure and this was one of the worst hotel breakfasts I ve had the pleasure to have I would recommended opting for the sans breakfast option , There was a lot to like about this hotel It is relatively new and well renovated The positives include Excellent and helpful staff always friendly and eager to help Very clean room Convenient location next to the Metro station A very good bed Excellent air con quiet and cool and Decent sound insulation from the inside 
143936,BoB Hotel by Elegancia,No Negative, Nice clean hotel with very friendly staff Small but perfectly equipped and clean rooms We loved the smartphone with unlimited call and data credit and used it all the time while navigating through the city looking for transport resto sights etc Great breakfast you get to choose between an express breakfast croissant bread at the front of the hotel excellent value for money or a more elaborate and thus slightly more expensive buffet breakfast at the back Great location a 2 mins walk to the Pernety metro station The 14th district is very charming and quiet but still has lots of options for bars resto grocery shopping etc Easily accessible by car there s no parking at the hotel but we rented a parking space just around the corner in Rue d Eure using the ZenPark app and that worked flawlessly I definitely recommend this hotel and right now May 2017 prices are very reasonable though that might change since I understood from the staff that the hotel only just opened a couple of months ago 
143937,BoB Hotel by Elegancia, I had a room facing the street which was a little noisy at times due to the pub on the corner but this wasn t much of a problem I imagine if you want a quieter room this can be requested , This is my new fave hotel The staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly particularly with helping me to book attraction passes offer food recommendations and help me get my bearings My room was divine I loved the fixtures artwork and clever use of a small space and I had a beautiful view There is a gorgeous little courtyard for visitors to enjoy a light honesty bar coffee and croissant or in my case an evening BYO beer with another indoor study area nearby The Pernety station is a stone s throw away which easily connects you to the main part of the city however the area has stacks of delicious cafes and places to explore I will definitely be recommending this beautiful boutique hotel to others and hope to come back soon 
143938,BoB Hotel by Elegancia, Breakfast available in 2 separate buildings exactly 6 steps were confusing but it was just a minor issue probably in summer You will find it as a as between these buildings You will find a great place to dine, Definitely people stand behind success of this place Obviously comfortable beds tasty breakfasts and great locations also determine BoB Hotel as a great place to stay while visiting Paris
143939,BoB Hotel by Elegancia, There might be more non French channels on TV but not a big deal who s coming to Paris to watch a TV The only thing we didn t like was the lack of closets there was no space to keep clothes and stuff during our stay we had to keep things in the luggage on a chair etc , Absolutely great kind and helpful staff The hotel is new and all furniture and facilities flawless The smartphone with free calls and internet was an amazing help for us tourists to fully enjoy Paris and never get clueless We liked the bathroom especially the lighting in it tiny LEDs installed in the wall looked like stars in the sky The location is great a metro station is just a minute away there are restaurants shops grocery market and coin laundry nearby Depending on your preferences and exploration style with good route planning it s quite possible to check majority of Paris landmarks just by walking 
143940,BoB Hotel by Elegancia, Space of breakfast area , Cozy new hotel nearly Pernety metro station Very kind staff very clean hotel comfortable bed nice breakfast There is a complementary smartphone to use with 4G internet which is helpful around the city s landmarks Total recommendation 
143941,BoB Hotel by Elegancia, The room has no wardrobe and only 5 hangers looks good but not convenient at all especially for 2 people The sliding door to the bathroom is heavy and has no handle so is impossible to close , Staff were great with directions recommendations taxi bookings friendly and spoke great English The smart phone in the room is a brilliant idea Took this around Paris and followed the recommendations V handy if you have no data whilst in France Pernety station is only a 30 second walk You can connect to all major stations from here easily Supermarket a few minutes away and various places to eat Definitely recommend 
143942,BoB Hotel by Elegancia, The room didn t had a wardrobe and it has a fancy hangers instead that are almost useless , The hotel location is good very close to the Pernety metro station 1 minute walk some coffeeshops nearby quiet street The staff was friendly and helpful The hotel seems to be new or recently refurbushed and the room with a beautful decoration was nice not big nor small but nice for Paris standards with a really very good bed The bathroom is small but the shower is very good and plenty of space We didn t had the breakfast at the hotel by option but the ground floor was nice with a small backyard 
143943,BoB Hotel by Elegancia, The room was a bit small but this is not problem for us because we stayed only two days and didn t have lots of clothes I am writing this to warn the people who will stay in a long time with too many clothes , I like the design of room so much Also the lighting in the room was fantastic Staff was friendly and warm The best service was the Ringme service There was a mobile phone with a lots of useful information about Paris and with an nternet so you can carry this phone with you when you travel around the city without getting lost 
143944,BoB Hotel by Elegancia, Far from city center but close to Metro and best way to get around is with Uber also the rooms had no closets or drawers to put away your clothes, Loved this hotel clean sound proof very accommodating and young staff they offer complimentary coffee and water I would highly recommend this hotel to business travelers and single people
143945,BoB Hotel by Elegancia, The rooms could have been a little bigger but overall was very good , Very nice room very clean Really helpful staff and extremely good location Would defitnely recommend friends and family to stay here 
143946,BoB Hotel by Elegancia, The breakfast is a little complicated as food is in two different rooms that are separated by an atrium and the coffee machine not the easiest to use for example if you require only a dash of milk , Staff are extremely helpful friendly and accomodating unlike most Parisien hotels The hotel is recently refurbished to a high standard and so everything is spotlessly clean and works For Parisien standards the room and bathroom was quite big and the bed very comfortable Overall a very nice hotel and as icing on the cake it has the same name as me 
143947,BoB Hotel by Elegancia, 1 2 out of 3 rooms we should checked in were already occupied This is a bad experience after a long drive since you just want a break The organisation wasn t good and an excuse because of Eastern isn t an excuse Please upgrade your hotel system 2 No towels in the room and in the bathroom were still boxes to repair some stuff no go use the stockroom for that 3 The heater wasn t working and it was freezing cold in the room Even the employee said it was freezing cold 4 The socket wasn t working to charge your electronics Overall the room 205 wasn t ready to be rented and therefore never shouldn t be rented out to someone for this prize We checked out after one night and it wasn t value wasn t worth the money , 1 The bed was comfy and the room size is good 2 The area is fully loaded with restaurants
143948,BoB Hotel by Elegancia, Breakfast was very tasty but also very bad organised When we came literally everything was finished No bread no spreads no fruits nothing Also the breakfast area is split up in two separate rooms causing you to walk in the rain to the other breakfast area for some spreads Space is also limited , The location was great close to the metro close to some nice restaurants and pubs WiFi is good fast and it is stable and good enough for browsing watching videos etc The staff is very friendly helpful and willing to help you find places around 
143949,BoB Hotel by Elegancia, little soap no closet very small elevator late breakfast and unorganized room was very late due to unclear security problem, free coffee and fruits great bed great shower
143950,BoB Hotel by Elegancia,No Negative, The hotel is located close to the tube station where you can jump in and travel to centre of Paris just under 20 mins All staff we met are very friendly and helpful The room is exceptionally clean and quite provided a house party was being held across the street You can see Eiffel Tower on the balcony 
143951,BoB Hotel by Elegancia, Very limited choice for breakfast almost nothing is available no omelette no eggs no yogurt 1 type of ham only 1 bottle of orange juice no fresh fruits not enough cheese 2 types and few pieces are available Basicly the breakfast was coffee croissant bread jam honey nutella and a piece of cheese if you managed to find some Smell of paint in the room building recently finished no coffee machine in the rooms only coffee sticks boiler no creamer absence of closet shelves dressing, friendly staff clean hotel and rooms acceptable room surface good room insulation
