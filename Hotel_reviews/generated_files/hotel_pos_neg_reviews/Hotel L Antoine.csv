17553,Hotel L Antoine,No Negative, The room was very spacious considering it was a small boutique hotel in the city It was very clean and we even had our own nespresso machine Nice touch
17554,Hotel L Antoine, Slip mat in bathroom plus handrail room fridge check not adequate so missing items , Small space well organised Front desk staff very helpful 
17555,Hotel L Antoine, Tiny room for 150 EUR per night, Very friendly and helpful staff very good wifi good location 5 minutes away from Bastille by walking distance clean
17556,Hotel L Antoine, Breakfast is priced at 16 euros so we declined this found a bar within 50 yds with formule at 6 euros , All details carefully thought through Super quiet rooms on request They volunteered the preferred language for communication Tea tray in room and free tea coffee in breakfast room throughout Loads of eateries nearby all with great atmosphere 
17557,Hotel L Antoine, Room very small but the space is planned well which makes it annoying that there is no hook for coats Desk really too small to work at so I had to work in the lobby a fair amount , Very clean great staff access to metro
17558,Hotel L Antoine, The minibar in our room was a tad noisy But after a full day in Paris even the lightest sleepers will drift off into the dreamland and not notice the minibar noise , Staff is definitely the gold of this wonderfully and beautifully decorated hotel Everyone we encountered was super nice helpful and knowledgeable and could put a smile on your face Also the location is very convenient close to several metro stations and excellent boulangeries and eateries And we were happy to notice the windows of our street facing room provide good soundproofing from the lively french nightlife so you can have a good night s sleep 
17559,Hotel L Antoine, I wasn t happy with the reception area It is way too small there was a family wedding in Paris and 16 of us were staying at the hotel but we couldn t hang out together at all No room They have a two seater couch and two wing back chairs, I liked the bed and shower the location was good too
17560,Hotel L Antoine,No Negative, We liked everything Decor amazing Staff could not have been more helpful Location superb Spotless Price excellent value Travelled with family and had nine rooms and not one problem 
17561,Hotel L Antoine, The WiFi this stay in room 28 wasn t working that strong stayed at L Antoine lots of times and it was never an issue so could be an isolated thing or just location of the room , It s a boutique type Paris hotel that quirky but delivers a great stay
17562,Hotel L Antoine, In true Parisian hotel style the room was on the tiny side For us this was really no problem, The hotel is located on a quiet street but conveniently near a bustling commercial street Our room faced a well lit interior courtyard The staff at the L Antoine was exceptionally friendly and professional helping us with tickets and logistics The design of the hotel appeals to a trendy younger crowd As funny as it sounds the bathroom was great Very reliable free Wifi 
17563,Hotel L Antoine, Sink was a bit small Shower tricky to get into, Loved the free snax and water in the break room Also the awesome hot breakfast Great atmosphere and staff was superb 
17564,Hotel L Antoine, Don t buy the overpriced breakfast Book direct to have it included in your room rate it go out to one of the many cafes Oh the other thing I didn t like was having to leave , A wonderful boutique hotel Excellent styling and bursting with personality What the rooms lack in size is certainly balance by artistry and amazing design 
17565,Hotel L Antoine,No Negative, The location is in a great neighborhood with many restaurants shops and bars The closeness to the gare the lyon is another plus Our room to the court was very quiet and we shared a junior suite among 3 friends The bathroom was super spacious and the hot shower and big bathtub were a blessing after a day out in january cold Paris We ll come back 
17566,Hotel L Antoine,No Negative, The personnel was very friendly and helpful always greeting and ready to answer any questions Functional but very small room Nice walk in shower Amazing deco I loved these tiles Location close to the subway 
17567,Hotel L Antoine, The room was a bit small but to be honest I didn t expect to stay at a bigger room in Paris , The room was very clean and well equipped and the personnel was very helpful Also it was very quiet overall and at a good area I would definitely recommend it 
17568,Hotel L Antoine, Nothing we didn t like , We loved staying here The rooms and bathrooms are large and clean The beds are very comfortable even the sofa bed if you need an extra one The staff are excellent and very helpful The area is fabulous with lots of places to eat and the hotel is very close to the metro And it s an easy walk to Gare de Lion TGV station 
17569,Hotel L Antoine,No Negative, Excellent staff multi lingual very friendly and extremely helpful The room was well equipped nicely decorated but very small I will definitely size up on our next visit Excellent breakfast Good location 5 minutes walk from Bastille Metro entrance almost on doorstep Hotel location is on a quiet side street with nice boutique shops cafes and restaurants 
17570,Hotel L Antoine, The room was very small which we knew it would be but the position of the large cupboard made it appear even smaller , Everything you could wish for in the room writing desk tea coffee making facilities fridge etc 
17571,Hotel L Antoine, i know paris hotel rooms are small but my wife slept in the bed i slept on the floor suitcase had to go in the bathroom and bathroom was thus not accessible c est tr s petite but we still loved it , beatiful style nice coffee and cake and cafe facility location perfect
17572,Hotel L Antoine,No Negative, The receptionist was very nice and upgrade us to a higher room when we mistake only thought that the water doesn t work The hotel was nicely renovated and close to Bastille 
17573,Hotel L Antoine, Nothing it s a great little hotel in a cool part of Paris and great value for money, Spotlessly clean comfortable room big by Paris standards cool design We didn t have breakfast we were too busy enjoying the room 
17574,Hotel L Antoine,No Negative, Always smiling and present stuff ready to solve all problems fluent in multi languages doing their best to supply the best service I have stayed here several times and I can confirm that all these qualities are consistent Looking forward to my next time 
17575,Hotel L Antoine, Air con didn t work pretty small rooms but would definitely stay there again, Beautiful refurbished bathrooms great water pressure 2 mins to the train in the heart of shops and cafes Very quiet rooms couldn t hear the next room or the road Very clean 
17576,Hotel L Antoine, The small size of single rooms n poor ergonomics viz no bedside tables n insufficient space to move even a tiny bit The luggage rack when properly set up stops one accessing the wardrobe The only table in the room is unusually small with tv remote telephone competing for space with the tea n coffee rack I ended up crowding the table further with medicine n other personal trinkets , The friendly n helpful stats especially Juan so cheerful n forthcoming in providing info on dining sightseeing n transport I also like the unique interior decor based on Christian Lacroix design concepts 
17577,Hotel L Antoine, Nothing , The staff were nothing short of amazing Nothing was too much trouble and they were extremely knowledgeable about the area Booked a fantastic restaurant for 8pm with less than an hours notice Would highly recommend the next time we visit Paris we all be staying here 
17578,Hotel L Antoine, The room was a little tight with two of us having large suitcases , The hotel is spotless and the staff were very welcoming Enjoyed the design and details and the honesty bar was appreciated Nice quiet hotel with great security liked the idea of turning in the key to the front office The location has lots of restaurants in the area Appreciated that the staff were willing to help us with arranging a ride to the airport 
17579,Hotel L Antoine, Nothing to report , Location lively street with bars restaurants and shops near public transport and a Velolib station Staff extremely friendly and helpful Room we booked the junior suite and it was the best hotel experience I ve ever had in Paris and beyond Spacious nicely decorated excellent A C system which was appreciated during heatwave conditions 37C The bathroom one of the best hotel bathrooms I ve ever come across Spacious powerful shower and bath All in all a gem of a hotel 
17580,Hotel L Antoine, My husband found the bed comfortable but my side was a bit soggy, Great position in interesting area close to Bastille and Gare de Lyon Staff very friendly and helpful Bedroom small but very stylish 
17581,Hotel L Antoine, The size of the standard rooms is rather small which makes the hotel less appropriate for a longer stay We had some difficulties to stow our suitcase away in the room without stumbling over it , Recently renovated hotel very modern up to date equipment Very friendly and helpful staff both at front desk as well as during breakfast Quiet rooms with good silently working airco We had a modern bathroom with good rainshower Good choice of breakfast value for money Only 80 meters away from subway entrance 
17582,Hotel L Antoine,No Negative, The staff at the hotel was extremely helpful and polite They helped us with all the possible questions we had The location is nice there are lots of restaurants and bars close to the hotel and the area is lively Two metro stations are also close by so it doesn t take too long to get to all the major sights I have no complaints 
17583,Hotel L Antoine, room was very small although that s not unusual for Paris, fantastically helpful and friendly staff very comfortable room with excellent shower and quiet despite very central location I had to leave too early for breakfast unfortunately 
17584,Hotel L Antoine, Rooms were clean but smelled of smoke , Rooms were modern and great location would stay again When we complained about smoke they didn t really do anything but when we followed up they gave us free breakfast 
17585,Hotel L Antoine,No Negative, Well placed very close to the Place de la Bastille Friendly staff and quirky decor Clean comfortable and well equipped I will definitely be going back 
17586,Hotel L Antoine, None, Very stylish room and quite spacious Good location with a lot of restaurants around and easy reach to a lot of the attractions only 5 mins walk to metro station 
17587,Hotel L Antoine, Cannot think of anything , Great vibrant location Great staff Melanie Juan Thierry They were there for anything we needed The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful Great bars and restaurants everywhere Great shopping too 
17588,Hotel L Antoine, Nothing, Could not fault the hotel or the staff and loved the complimentary expresso water bottles and pastries Staff were great they helped me book a taxi and dinner for a large group and were always very friendly Location was perfect and so easy to get everywhere especially from Gare Du Nord station 
17589,Hotel L Antoine, Reserved double room and they forced an upgrade in order to have two people in it Room was very small even for Paris I mean it was a maneuver everytime we did anything in the room TINY Excellent pizza and Parisian restaurants across the street , Most of the staff was friendly and accommodating Enjoyed the coffee and tea being available in the lobby They were happy to help store luggage until check in time while we went and explored Metro is just down the block very important 
17590,Hotel L Antoine, The standard room we booked was too small for a couple with luggage We should have take the superior room for extra space , The service by front counter staff was exceptional Always smiling with a good command of English they supplied us with an extra umbrella on a rainy day plus arranged transport to Paris Orly airport on our departure 
17591,Hotel L Antoine, Nothing , Good location Staff were helpful and friendly Room was small but had everything I required I had room facing inner courtyard which was nice and quite Bathroom facilities were modern clean and nicely finished 
17592,Hotel L Antoine, On my floor the doors closed extremely loudly not really much of a complaint though The rooms are small but at 14m2 as advertised I wasnt expecting larger , The hotel is in an excellent location in Bastille close to several metro stations and a 10 minute walk from Notre Dame The staff are very friendly and helpful 
17593,Hotel L Antoine,No Negative, Location was great near Bastille Room was a little small but stunning design loved the bathroom and the shower was great Loved it and would stay again 
17594,Hotel L Antoine, As is usual in Paris rooms are pretty small so if you are in need of some space go for the bigger rooms , Great location and nicely decorated Excellent staff 
17595,Hotel L Antoine, The room was very warm at night I was told the air conditioning units were not turned on yet because it was out of summer April At night we could not open the window because of the noise outside We did get a fan the next day from reception Also no cold beers in the fridge at the honesty bar , Loved the room and the staff Great central location Good value for money the room was clean comfortable and spacious 
17596,Hotel L Antoine, wifi was not working that night room quite small but functional , friendly and professional staff location just next to clubs and restaurants room was quiet 
17597,Hotel L Antoine, Nothing, A terrific hotel in a great location The staff were excellent nothing was too much trouble and they would take the time to have a chat as you passed recption The room was extremely well appointed and care had been taken to get the design spot on I was particularly impressed by the generous provision of power points the powerful shower and the comfortable bed The purpose of my visit was to catch up with a friend who was playing a gig in the area Easy access to the Metro meant that the whole of the city felt close at hand
17598,Hotel L Antoine, The room was miniscule total style over substance No storage space no room for even one bedside table Likewise the bathroom not a single towel rail It s probably the smallest so called double room I ve ever encountered , The location is great with a good restaurant Chez Paul within staggering distance The hotel is stylish and immaculate 
17599,Hotel L Antoine, Not particular to this hotel hotels in Paris are expensive for a 3 star breakfast was delicious but 16euros pp is steep Rooms are micro bathroom comfortable size but prefer toilet not so close to bed Make sure you get the best price as we did on booking com Rack rates price this hotel above its value , Great little hotel little is a true description Friendly staff close to some of our favourite restaurants metro and Bastille steps away 
17600,Hotel L Antoine, The breakfast spread could have been better , The staff was very friendly and the room was extremely clean and tidy Given that it is Paris understandably it was a little small but everything was neatly arranged Would definitely recommend the place for short stays 
17601,Hotel L Antoine, The shower screen in my room didn t shut completely so water was leaking onto the floor everytime I took a shower , Great location about 15 mins walk from the Marais and Pompidou Two Metro lines within a couple of mins walk away Plenty of local cafes and bars in the vicinity They gave one of us who had booked into a more basic room a free upgrade so everyone was happy 
17602,Hotel L Antoine, Minuses some guys were quarreling on street at night which was well heard to the room and the room was a little hot , Friendly staff and comfortable 2bedroom room Originally booked twin room but was upgraded by the nice receptionist as it was actually not available Hotel is 5min from bastille metro station Many cafes nearby Definitely looking to book again
17603,Hotel L Antoine,No Negative, Rooms were very well presented and equipped Great location and Juan on reception was incredibly helpful and friendly overall all staff were great Would definitely stay again 
17604,Hotel L Antoine, This was not a con per se in my book but you should be aware that the small rooms are a bit tight I found them comfortable and adorable but don t expect something gigantic , The hotel itself is beautifully maintained and in a wonderful location Combined with the price however this hotel was exceptional 
17605,Hotel L Antoine, The only complain was odour of the bed sheets and smell in the room in general it speaks a lot about the maintainance procedures in the hotel , Location is excellent hotel is design conscious with new facilities and excellent taste Rooms are rather small but perfectly OK for single use double room Breakfast is great various choices nice area and quickly replenished 
17606,Hotel L Antoine,No Negative, The hotel is very small but room are nice and comfortable The hotel is located in a nice area very close to the subway and allows for quick moving around Breakfast is good so if possible choose it 
17607,Hotel L Antoine, There is literally nothing to dislike , We loved EVERYTHING about the hotel We were able to check in six hours early and enjoy a cup of coffee in the dining room The staff especially Juan went out of their way to be informative kind and professional Our room was adorable small but immaculate We are extremely tall people but there was enough room for us to be comfortable The decor was such fun with many contrasting yet coordinating patterns of tile and wallpaper The towels were plush the bedding crisp and there were many outlets for charging our devices The bathroom looked like an advertisement for porcelain products We overlooked a quaint courtyard and kept our window open all night Our street had superb restaurants outstanding and reasonable with zero tourism We never heard an accent other than French being spoken La Fontaine for croissants and live music Chez Paul for elegant French cuisine foie gras Cafe de la Peintures perhaps the most beautiful restaurant I ve ever set foot in with its art nouveau designs all were on our street Bookstores lovely shops and cafes were everywhere I will stay at Hotel L Antoine next time It s less than five minutes walk to two metro stations in the Bastille area 
17608,Hotel L Antoine,No Negative, This is the second time I stay at this hotel this year and we decided to take the breakfast this time A choice that didn t disappoint The breakfast was very diverse the foods were fresh from small producers and often replenished there were options for the gluten intolerant people as well This was a real treat 
17609,Hotel L Antoine, Road front room extremely noisy on Friday and Saturday leaking shower a bit of an issue Charges for breakfasts we did not eat and minibar item we did not use appeared on the bill , Ready access to good restaurants and shops as well as the Marais area Very pleasant and helpful front desk staff who really went out of their way to assist us 
17610,Hotel L Antoine, Not too close to major attractions such as Eiffel Tower or Notre Dame although very accessible to Metro , Staff were great and very comfortable in English Close to some good shopping and restaurants 
17611,Hotel L Antoine, The standard room is 14m2 but it felt smaller , The location is good just 2 min away from metro The staff members were all friendly and helpful with a good sense of humour 
17612,Hotel L Antoine,No Negative, Greeted by a warm staff that made us feel like home We were told we had the best floor Each floor has different themed decorations The mood of the floors was quite nice The shower was perfect
17613,Hotel L Antoine, No parking on site but parking was close to the location , Great little gem close to Bastille Juan at the reception was very helpful and nice and the overall concept of the hotel is great Rooms are clean modern and super well equipped 
17614,Hotel L Antoine,No Negative, The room was nicely decorated with enough room for what we wanted Heating was great Breakfast was great too The hotel was right next to one of the Ledru Rollin metro entrances and a short walk away from the Bastille station which made it very easy to travel within the city or get to the train station to go to Disney There is also a bike rental rack right in front of the hotel if you want to use that the Navigo pass makes it cheap to use everything If when we go back we will most likely stay at this hotel again If you re on a budget there s a Mac and Subway and a Monoprix and Dia Supermarket right around the corner You can easily PIC stuff up for a picnic along the Sienne
17615,Hotel L Antoine, Just a small note very very small so sometime a little uncomfortable to move in the room and find place for the luggage, Nice beautiful decoration clean very good breakfast
17616,Hotel L Antoine, everything is perfect , This is the best hotel ever in this trip We got upgraded for our honey moon the room is very big and clean and comfortable a bottle of wine was prepare for us also I love this place and it would be our first choice next time to Paris 
17617,Hotel L Antoine,No Negative, The Hotel is situated close to the Ledru Rollin metro station and not too far away from Bastille metro station It is very easy to be reached The staff offered us the best service we received during our trip in Paris They are kind friendly courteous and ready to help with a warm smile We were offered an early check in to our surprise we went to the hotel just to leave our luggage until the official check in time but the room had been just released and coffee while we waited the room to get ready for us It was a wonderful surprise for two really tired travellers The room was large enough larger than we expected based on what we read when we made the booking and impeccable The room was also quiet despite a noisy gathering of sports watchers nearby We passed by them on our way back to the hotel The bed was large and comfortable We had a restful sleep The WiFi worked very well and it was fast I would definitely recommend this hotel A big THANK YOU for everyone at the hotel who made our staying really pleasant and comfortable 
17618,Hotel L Antoine, Everything we didn t like was bathroom related I was surprised the bathroom toiletries had a combined shampoo body wash and no conditioner for this level of hotel Our suite didn t come with a hairdryer and it took three separate requests to get one The rainfall shower showed signs of calcification from the hard Parisien water it could use a regular swipe with some vinegar , We landed a suite at the hotel which was huge anywhere massive for Paris Because we booked last minute we had a very good deal like 50 off Everything was spotless We really appreciated the outlets on both sides of the bed and the double door entry for extra quiet from the hallway We slept comfortably and could have stayed there for two weeks The neighborhood seems to be the Paris equivalent of Williamsburg with very stylish shopping and hipster bars Breakfast was generous and it s a nice option to take the lighter menu directly in the room No problem connecting to WiFi 
17619,Hotel L Antoine, Small thing Shower wasn t great if you re fussy about that , The location the staff the uniqueness of the decor Made me feel like I was in the city of cool design 
17620,Hotel L Antoine, The only thing I would mention is that our bed was actually two twin beds pushed together and dressed as if it was a full queen not sure which size Large enough for both of us however I really like to cuddle with my partner in bed and the line down the middle made that somewhat uncomfortable However the mattresses were both very comfortable on their own , This hotel was absolutely gorgeous I loved the bathroom and room design Beautiful taste in furniture and the tiling wall paper Plush carpeting Very clean Just amazing 
17621,Hotel L Antoine, Classic rooms are v small Small amount of water under floorboards in bathroom rectified by covering with bath mat some noise from the fridge in the room could wake a light sleeper , Location style of hotel breakfast food choice great Double glazed windows stopped any noise from outside Wifi good 
17622,Hotel L Antoine,No Negative, The hotel is quirky and very French in its bold colour choices which worked beautifully The staff made me very welcome and as a mature solo traveller I felt very safe in their care 
17623,Hotel L Antoine, The room was quite small but the decor was very nice which made up for it, The customer service was the best part of the hotel All the staff were really friendly and helpful and went out of their way to deal with any questions we had for example recommending and booking a restaurant for us telling us the best ways to get to certain places etc 
17624,Hotel L Antoine, very small accommodations Tried to make the most of the space but smallee rooms than even the typical Paris hotel , Great location new hotel with modern touches Bathroom is one of the best I have seen in Paris 
17625,Hotel L Antoine,No Negative, In the centre of Bastille but in a quite street The fantastic decoration done from Christian Lacroix The choise of tapestry the bathroom tiles amazing Nice boutique hotel which smells brand new All personnel in the reception were genuinely kind 
17626,Hotel L Antoine, nothing everything was great , the staff is really great Melanie and Erik were super welcoming always hepful and smiling The others too excellent tea an cake in the lobby for free We felt like home proximity to 2 metro lines and 4 buses taking you right to the Opera tour Eiffel Louvre etc 
17627,Hotel L Antoine, Everything was great, Staff was extremely helpful Room was clean but rather small We had superior room with a bit of more space compared to standard room Bed was super comfortable Saw comments that bathroom is extremely small It was small but I didn t feel lack of space Everything was neat and clean Location of the hotel is great Lots of eating places and bars You could do some shopping as well there are a lot of clothes stores in the area Hotel is close to Bastille station and 10 mins drive from Gare du Nord
