180550,citizenM Tower of London, Rooms are small but well designed, The use of technology was impressive UBS outlets using a tablet to control tv lights and room temp The breakfast which was extra was very good
180551,citizenM Tower of London, breakfast is a bid on the expensive side facilitation to use a local gym even if for an additional price would be a plus, the rooms are modern and very clean no carpet which is nice if you are allergic the bar on the 7th floor offers one of my favorite views on London Tower Bridge Shard and is very nicely decorated overall the public places are nice and gave me a very comfortable feeling this time I had a room without view but there are rooms with a beautyful view on Tower Bridge try to get one of those if available
180552,citizenM Tower of London, the room was a smaller than i thought it would be, location and view From my bedroom window I could see the Tower of London like a watching movie from the front row of the theatre amazing and memorable view of London The hotel lobby was an open space where many people are using as a meeting place It was a different innovative style of running hotel and i enjoyed it 
180553,citizenM Tower of London, I love to exercise and missed a gym at the hotel But hey I ll get over that , The staff were fantastic They clearly seemed to enjoy their work and interacting with guests 
180554,citizenM Tower of London, Tea and coffee facilities in the room was greatly missed, Bed very comfy very clean Excellent breakfast especially the fresh fruit and greek yoghurt 
180555,citizenM Tower of London, Bed occupied entire width of room making it difficult to get and out of with two sharing Coffee was disappointing, Helpful and friendly staff really fresh pastries in the coffee shop Spectacular views from the 7th floor bar 
180556,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, The welcoming atmosphere when I entered the hotel It really felt like coming home where the staff was waiting for you Wish that more hotels would be like this Great job 
180557,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Know CitizenM from stays at their hotel in CDG Paris Airport Love the concept and design of the hotel and the rooms Everything you need in the Canteen for breakfast or an evening drink The Bar on the 7th floor is amazing Great location to have a drink with friends looking upon the Tower and the Skyline of the Citiy of London Big comfy bedding 
180558,citizenM Tower of London, The bedrooms were very small with a strange small little bathroom in a kind of pod sink not in bathroom sink was in main bedroom area , View of the shard was amazing Bed was very comfy room so small the bed was literally wall to wall iPad with controls for lights temperature etc was great 
180559,citizenM Tower of London, there was absolutely nothing I did not like 10 out of 10 , The hotel is literally right next to the metro more like the hotel building is part of the metro so you are right there Citizen M is very innovative and modern Rooms small but they have everthing you need Well designed so it feels much bigger than what is actually is Everything is the room is automated so you can adjust with the ipad mood lighting temperature and use the TV Technology very fast internet great offer of TV channels and movies Restaurants the rooftopbar has a stunning view over London Great cocktails and fun foods Downstairs the breakfast and lunch have various options from very healthy to some indulgence food In the evening you have a great bar downstairs as well Lobby great place to relax and chill and after breakfast you even have a hotel bakery that offers snack through out the day All in all it was a really great stay Staff was friendly from check in to check out everything worked well When I had questions they were eager to help me quickly When I am going back to London I would def stay here again 
180560,citizenM Tower of London, No space at the end of the bed Have to clamber over your partner if you get out in the night With hindsite we should have put our pillows under the window , Views from the bar were stunning Good to have a small fridge Thanks for the free water Very large and comfortable bed I pad to control lighting tv blinds etc Location is brilliant 
180561,citizenM Tower of London, Bathroom cleanliness could have been better by day 3, Convenience to Tower Hill tube 15 steps away for use of central and district lines location to tower bridge and southbank super cool vibe in hotel free movies daughter loved lights etc controlled by iPad Floor 7 bar with amazing views of gherkin Thames Tower of London tower bridge and shard Super comfy huge bed x
180562,citizenM Tower of London, No staff apart from the bar all computer check in Nothing personal about this hotel complete buget with a 4 star price tag yet when you add on the cost of a mere cup of tea it soon adds upto 5 star prices People hanging around some asleep It was more like a student hostel As for the bedroom I do not appreciate brushing my teeth in the hallway I own bigger shoe boxes Squashed and claustrophobic is how myself and my husband felt Couldn t wait to leave Glad this trip was business not pleasure , Clean room comfortable bed Can t think of anything else good 
180563,citizenM Tower of London, No windows in the room No kettle in the room Only being able to get out of bed on one side Tv very limited Sink unit in bedroom The list is endless, Room was very clean
180564,citizenM Tower of London, Felt like I was catapulted into the future Rooms small and very clinical No natural light couldn t open the blind All very tech orientated Lift unecessarily complicated check yourself in create your own room key There is no reception IPad to use the TV Would suit a 15 year old Maybe I m just getting old but after a long day at a PC dealing with IT support last thing I wanted was more self service tech , Hotel is very hip and trendy Great views from 7th floor lounge bar 
180565,citizenM Tower of London, Room became very humid after showering housekeeping didn t come on the second day doesn t offer room service lack of facilities and services for a 4 star hotel, Right above Tower Hill station very modern and design is on point Apple TV is a plus
180566,citizenM Tower of London, Not much space in the room for your own stuff clothes luggage , Absolutely great concept Citizenship with all the perks and quirkiness Really great bed guaranteed good sleep it was surprisingly quiet as well Loved the iPad although has battery issues for room control Breakfast was good and check out was the fastest ever Location was on top of Tower Hill tube station and within walking distance of Shoreditch 
180567,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, the rooms are small but awesome best entertainment system in a hotel i have every see really cool hotel probably only stay there from now onwards 
180568,citizenM Tower of London, I didn t want to leave the hotel, The high tech rooms Amazing staff really the key part of the hotel and that s saying a lot Top floor bar with the best views 
180569,citizenM Tower of London, Very impersonal you do checking in and out yourself breakfast was expensive so we ate elsewhere cause there are plenty of pubs around that do great breakfasts , The location was fantastic subway out the front of your door heaps to do around the hotel The hotel was so trendy really really nice looking 
180570,citizenM Tower of London, The room is too small for more than one person unless you are madly in love or it s your first weekend together, A fantastic location and really conveniently between east and west london plus close to the tube Clean rooms and bathrooms 
180571,citizenM Tower of London, no parking although not far Shower and toilet in the room stayed in many London hotels at approx same price and felt like You were in a quality place not here felt like the tiny rooms were making the most of the space and charging you only for the location Everything in room ran off iPad great unless you don t know how to use one 2 of our party were nearly 70 And if You don t put it on charge but set the morning alarm no way of switching it off until you charge the damn thing, Breakfast was fine cleanliness good location excellent
180572,citizenM Tower of London, Could have benefited from a welcome person on arrival Self check in procedures but as mine was a little complicated I needed a bit of help and had to go and find a team member , Technology based rooms Rooftop bar was awesome too 
180573,citizenM Tower of London, Not a lot of options within walking distance for dinner or over the weekend to eat as it s a business district However the tube will take you anywhere you need and that s directly outside the hotel door , I ve never rated a 10 before but this place deserves a 20 We had an uninterrupted view of Tower of London and we were only on the 2nd floor The rooftop bar is incredible and the hotel is basically outside Tower Hill tube station Although the rooms aren t huge the bed is ginormous and super comfortable with storage for bags underneath Cafe downstairs Wifi worked well Hotel was quiet at night for a good night s rest Would highly reccomend it s worth the cost we will stay here again 
180574,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, The rooms are super cool loved the bed right at the window could almost touch the Tower of London the roof top bar is great I will never tire of these awesome views 
180575,citizenM Tower of London, One day we found a hair in our bed after the room cleaning It is inappropriate, View from the roof top bar is just amazing Also a concept of smart rooms is very nice 
180576,citizenM Tower of London, Access to bed only on one side View of construction which is temporary I assume , Crisp modern decor Breakfast was plentiful with a varied selection 
180577,citizenM Tower of London, Only one thing was surpring and harder to accept As the hotel is probably design as energy efficient building it has rooms with permanent air condition ventilation and there is no possibility to open the window It feels claustrophobic , The hotel is excellent personnel interior design comfort great breakfast the intelligent quite small room 
180578,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing , Service was excellent they really went the extra mile for me It was lovely to stay in a hotel which had an international hostel feel about it but business clients I met some fantastic people just sat eating breakfast The rooms are perfect they are not large but just enough to be cosy and with ipad controls to set the mood lighting etc FREE MOVIES Only thing I missed was a kettle in my room BUT you have your own fridge with bottled water and they made fab fresh coffee downstairs and much better than a crappy nescafe sachet Great location and all in all my new favourite hotel 
180579,citizenM Tower of London, Check in is automated which is great for singles but it is very slow with a group of 10 12 when they are tired and just want to get to their rooms , The Citizen M chain is excellent and provides superb accommodation in a very comfortable style with the downstairs lounge room or salon for total relaxation The rooms are small but no one cares because the food and drink is 24 hours and downstairs has books and papers all sorts of places to relax and enjoy your stay 
180580,citizenM Tower of London, That the same bar refreshments as below were not available on level 7 and bar prices were expensive, The bed was huge and very comfortable we enjoyed the citizenM experience immensely very clean bright modern the location was great with the subway just below the rooms were sound proof The late check out for a small fee was an added bonus because we were flying out of Heathrow later that evening and could use the room till 4 pm the next day The staff were excellent friendly and helpful 
180581,citizenM Tower of London, It was a bit shame that they don t have twin bedroom for family, The view from the rooftop bar was amazing and it was a very special experience for us 
180582,citizenM Tower of London, a longer stay , The room was really well thought out with no waste at all on space The room also has lots of gadgets operated through a tablet Cool The bed was the width of the room and up against the window therefore maximum comfort whilst enjoying the amazing view The top floor Bar not only has interesting nooks and alcoves stuffed with books mags and an eclectic mix of objects to delight but also has a balcony that really impressed especially at night as the main view is of the Tower of London and all that you can see down the Thames The ground floor cafe bar reception is also stuffed with a myriad of interesting and arty paraphernalia akin to a gallery or museum rather than a hotel The staff were above and beyond This really is a gem 
180583,citizenM Tower of London, I understand the savings made from using self service check in hubs and the support staff hovering around are great but when you re tired from a journey and just want to get to your room and the bar having to laboriously type in postcodes and telephone numbers on a clunky screen keyboard is a pain not severe but mildly irritating The hotel is only one year old and there are little signs that maintenance may not be quite as obsessive as it should be Electric blinds a little damaged wash basin tap a bit wobbly These details that didn t bother me but if maintenance isn t kept at 100 it will soon get dingy and the whole brilliant cool value proposition goes down the drain and it turns into a bland Mercure or Best Western , This modern ber cool hotel is not my normal style but I loved it it s as far from the classical luxury hotel as you can get yet every tiny detail has been carefully and lovingly worked out The WiFi is astonishingly fast c 100Mb download AND upload at 8 30am The roof top bar views are heart stopping The d cor is brilliantly original yet tastefully short of being over the top the floating lamps in the atrium and ethereal video game lift elevator announcements just made me laugh out loud with delight Yet this is a great value hotel In an amazing location with the one of the best views in London for around 200 a night is excellent I ve stayed in some really miserable places for that rate The cost cutting is extremely sophisticated in its implementation The small rooms are built with standard plastic modules and yet feel comfortable and high design with huge comfortable beds big TV screens and total room control from an iPad mini In the shower lavatory module the shower is outstanding with intuitive controls that don t require an engineering degree to figure out I really didn t care that the bars great music btw are only counter service because the bar staff were so good and the view well I already gushed about that Staff are not too cool to be charming even to an old fart like me The restaurant is self service with a limited but tasty and creative menu it calls itself a canteen and that s what it is but that feels right From my experience this is by far the best 200 hotel in London I m curious to try some of the others in the chain The ambience made me feel about 20 years younger too 
180584,citizenM Tower of London, Although very clean and modern Rooms very small and not worth what you pay Room alarm didn t go off and we almost missed our train home , Brand new very clean great atmosphere and style iPad in room great idea and worked well Great central location and helpful staff
180585,citizenM Tower of London, Small room Boat like showers but very nice fittings , Outstandig view we were located in 5th floor Great lounge in public 7th floor Very nice and helpful people everywhere 
180586,citizenM Tower of London, Room far too small Room cleaning bad effort at a clean Food expensive Noisy main hall reception Crewets thin on the ground Decor so fussy it was not relaxing,No Positive
180587,citizenM Tower of London, Everything was 10 plus , Absolutely everything was perfect The bed was ultra comfy The room a smart room operated almost entirely via the provided iPad The metro was steps outside our door as was the Tower of London The seventh floor bar overlooking all of London provides an unparalleled view of the Tower of London The staff was over the top wonderful When I mentioned on the day of our arrival that it was my husbands birthday they surprised us with a handmade card a complimentary pastry with a candle two lattes and they sang him Happy Birthday right in the lobby There is truly nothing to dislike about this hotel 
180588,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Great location beside the underground station clean quiet and practical rooms with sufficient space lovely service cosy lounge breakfast areas and excellent views from the 7th floor bar Recommended 
180589,citizenM Tower of London, The room size was small hardly two people can stand at same time and toilet fairly small , The hotel is in between three tube stations making the sightseeing so simple Check in check out took seconds
180590,citizenM Tower of London, All Good , This is my second stay in a CitizenM I love the modern design and concept The rooms are great and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful Will certainly book again 
180591,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing to complain, Everything We never experience hotel like this before It is very modern with fantastic artistic ideas Very great staff I became to a member citizen for this place now 
180592,citizenM Tower of London, Room is very small we were there for 1 night We always travel light and even we would have struggled in a room that small for more than a few nights Seemed expensive given the size of the room even given the location, Super comfy kingsize bed and I am VERY picky about beds due to joint pain How quiet it was inside the rooms Shower lots of hot water great water pressure Helpful friendly staff Location was soooooo convenient
180593,citizenM Tower of London, Cleaning standards could have been better specifically toilet bowls Pillow was too soft did not match the hard bed Bed was good though , Communal space in the lobby area is fantastic conducive for anything up your sleeve chilling reading doing work discussion having meals Auto log in wifi that works in every part of the hotel Strong signal too Round the clock food in the communal space is great considering most eateries shut down by 7pm around the area Food quality is great too Next to Tower Hill station can t ask for more Love the edginess the vibes of the hotel 
180594,citizenM Tower of London, Room is clever but cramped Toilet and shower in a frosted glass cubicle in the room is unusual Great room for one but crowded for two Strangely relatively few English language channels on the TV but many international languages Breakfast is pricey but indifferent and the same every day Don t pre book you can do better in the immediate neighborhood , Location is fabulous right at tube station and bus stop right across the street from the Tower Welcoming decor comfortable public spaces great lounge bar it has an open deck with an incomparable view 
180595,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Excellent location literally walk out of Tower Hill station and the hotel entrance is there On arrival We were greeted by a very polite young lady who assisted us with the self check in From the tube to the room in 10 minutes Very impressed with the whole experience 
180596,citizenM Tower of London, The bed was too high and access in and out of bed was limited The hotel is designed for younger people , The convenience of the underground station was good 
180597,citizenM Tower of London, The iPad failed to retain its charge for very long so couldn t use all controls The curtain and blind got stuck a couple of times when opening and closing , The bed and pillows are amazingly comfy Loved the lighting The shower was insanely good 
180598,citizenM Tower of London, Well location wise its OK by the Tower bridge but from Heathrow it takes a while Though Underground station is under the hotel which was great , Tre room facilities were all handled via Ipad great Free movies was an extra advantage 
180599,citizenM Tower of London, Rooms are a little small with just one way in and out of bed but that was fine for a solo traveller could be tricky as a couple , Very modern with great views and nice touches in the bedrooms The roof top bar is superb if not a little pricey 
180600,citizenM Tower of London, They could have had coffee and tea in the room and there was no room service The bed was against the wall so it wasn t easy for both people to get out of bed at night , The room was a smartroom and controlled by iPad We enjoyed this added feature It made using the room easy and fun We also found the staff extremely helpful 
180601,citizenM Tower of London, Sometimes a bit confusing what is and what isn t included in the room rate Luckily there is a lot included so no unpleasant surprises , Very good bed and pillows With the technology available there is a lot of comfort in the room Perfect location for public transport and a base for travelling The hotel has her own style and atmosphere very laid back but luxerious at the same time 
180602,citizenM Tower of London, Room was a tad small Bathroom didn t provide much privacy , SUCH a cool place Amazingly unique style Super funky You basically check yourself in so you don t have to wait in line or deal with people Room was small but very uniquely designed Great room 
180603,citizenM Tower of London, Something was strange about the elevators You would call them but then the button light would go out and you would have to call them again Over the speakers you could hear the continuous automated elevator doors announcements doors opening and doors closing day and night Probably isn t needed so much at night when it s very quiet and it sounds louder , Clean well designed chic hotel and room Excellent service Fantastic hip comfy lobby and awesome penthouse level view bar Great suspended umbrellas art installation in inner courtyard Easy friendly check in and check out Half hour check out extension for free 
180604,citizenM Tower of London, This is totally personal not keen with hot and cold food on display for everyone to help themselves, Exceptionally clean bed very comfy and had everything needed for a comfortable night 
180605,citizenM Tower of London, Bathroom is particularly small but functional, Great location modern hotel with everything you could need in a compact space Great roof top bar looking at Tower of London
180606,citizenM Tower of London, Cleanliness was not good Our bins were not emptied even though our room had been serviced The toilet stank I had to leave a note asking for it to be disinfected so the stench of old urine could be removed After the toilet was disinfected the bathroom was left with white streaks of the disinfectant all over we had to wipe these off ourselves Also the breakfast is a rip off As if the 13 pounds p p charged for breakfast is not high enough the hotel charges an extra 3 pounds if you decide to book the breakfast on the day Better go to 1 of the many places nearby for a good breakfast for better value , This is a no frills hotel however the deco is beautiful the location is great and comfort has in no way been compromised It appears a lot of thought has gone into creating disabled access which is great P S we are not disabled this is merely an observation of something I was impressed with Our bed was big and comfortable and the shower gels for morning and evening are divine The bar fridge is stocked with water daily very important if you will be commuting using the underground in summer like we were The lounging areas are equipped with newspapers books etc for guests use and this too is a beautiful touch 
180607,citizenM Tower of London, No Iron in the room as advertised but a leaflet in the room advised to go to another floor and use a shared Iron Heaven , Location was excellent Tower Hill Underground 20 second walk away and amazing views of Tower Bridge and all of the attractions in the area Room was lovely huge comfy beds and the iPad control system was different but really handy 100 will visit again and would recommend to anyone 
180608,citizenM Tower of London, Room was bit smaller than expected very nice rain shower but didn t like having no sink in the bathroom pod , Clean fresh and modern hotel with unique contemporary design features We had an amazing view of Tower of London from our room because the friendly and helpful staff upgraded us and gave free drinks when hearing our stay was for our anniversary treat Nice breakfast and coffee too and superb location next to tube station 
180609,citizenM Tower of London, 1 The pillows were super fluffy the first day I arrived but as I used them they got flatter and I was only there for 4 days 2 Having an iPad to control the room was fun controlling the light color and easy however the iPad had to be on the dock the whole time or else it runs out of charge 3 The hotel s lifts work using your room key for security measures however sometimes I had to scan the card multiple times to get the elevator to work I had an incident where I was sharing the lift with guests staying on the 8th floor and I had to wait for the lift to reach their floor before going back down again to my floor 4th 4 The hotel doesn t provide any amenities The room is only equipped with a safe mini fridge hangers and lacked bathrobes slippers and toilettries , 1 The easy check in and check out process through the touch screens The quickest I ve ever experienced 2 The hotel is brand new so all the rooms and facilities are extremely clean Hope they keep up the standard 3 The location next to tower hill station is a BIG PLUS And the exit from the station is even closer to the hotel if you re carrying any luggage 4 The lounge on the 7th floor has an amazing view and is only exclusive to the hotel s guests so you don t have to worry about over crowding 5 The different variety of rooms to suit different tastes If you like a quiet room like myself I would recommend booking on a higher floor outlooking the courtyard the inside of the hotel If you d like a room with the view of the tower you ll have to pay an extra charge 6 The sink was inside the room which might sound messy at first but it s wide enough to prevent any water from splashing 
180610,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing I m aware of , Overall modern design which young travellers would prefer such as an iPad to control everything in the room from TV to curtains lightings Breakfast has limited selection but great quality food Breakfast is one of the longest serving hour I have experienced from 6 30am 11am good for laterisers who went late party the night before Check In Out process is automated so it was hassle free Excellent location just above Tower Hill Station and bus stop nearby And also the bar at top floor offers excellent view minus the crowd it feels like a hidden gem in the city 
180611,citizenM Tower of London, Slightly mesmerising on arrival as all technology orientated and as we had two separate bookings made for over three nights which we wished to amalgamate so we kept the same room we were able to check in only for our first night and then needed to look for assistance to sign in for the following two nights As there was no reception this took a little time , Rooftop Terrace was awesome Cocktails to die for High tech Breakfasts in abundance 
180612,citizenM Tower of London, the fact that u cannot open the windows some small items like i have ran out of facial and ears cotton pads and it was sunday and nothing could be found at the hotel , breakfast could be more varied every few days bed v comfi
180613,citizenM Tower of London, The shower curtain Ruined the style of the hotel room and it would stick to your body while washing , Stylish hotel Amazing technology to use in the room Really good wifi Comfortable bed and relaxing shower Had a large sitting area by the reception and a comfortable cafe downstairs to relax 
180614,citizenM Tower of London, Bathroom not good Need urgent refurbishment A pity that the bathroom was in that bad condition mold on the curtain the ground needs to be renovated urgently , Close to Tower Hill Station Interesting new hotel concept Great TV Movies database that can be used free of charge in the room Very nice bar with great view on the 7th floor Nice lounge at the ground floor
180615,citizenM Tower of London, Rooms are functional but too small for multiple nights , Good location although trains weren t running this particular weekend and that cuts into your mobility Uber Great bar for guests and friends with amazing tower views 
180616,citizenM Tower of London, The prices in the roof bar are crazy 16 50 for a beer and small glass of wine, So much about he hotel was amazing the roof top bar and views stunning the quirkiness of the lobby the amaxing extra big super comfy beds just so much we loved
180617,citizenM Tower of London, nothing wrong with the citizen M, I love the Citizen M hotels large beds with a big tv and free movies The bathrooms are pods inside the room and are a great design You can control all the lights TV blinds etc from the iPod A lovely bar on the 7th floor has stunning views over the tower of London
180618,citizenM Tower of London, We were overcharged for our drinks in the bar when I pointed this out I was given a full refund no questions asked I think that there may be a practice of automatically charging for a large glass of wine but giving a standard glass which was the size promoted in the price list , The location was perfect and the hotel is bright and cheerful 
180619,citizenM Tower of London, No criticisms whatsoever , CitizenM hotels have a unique design The rooms are all the same size and although small they are super efficient and comfortable The lobby and other public area are filled with art books cozy corners and ways to relax with friends or solo The staff goes above and beyond to make your stay fun and easy The view of the Tower of London from the rooftop bar was beyond spectacular 
180620,citizenM Tower of London, Room was a little small but nothing that would put us off coming back again , The bed was really big and comfy and loved the fact you could change the mood of the room 
180621,citizenM Tower of London, when I travel for business I like to be alone when having breakfast in this hotel it s almost impossible as you have to share big tables with others , It was my first time in a CitizenM hotel and I enjoyed it Check in and check out are a bit unusual as they can fully done by yourself there is no reception like in most hotel but I liked that it s much faster that way Hotel is nicely decorated and full of touches of humor here and there Room is a bit small if you re staying with 2 Room can be completely controlled with a tablet TV lights shutters it s the first time I see this in a hotel Don t forget to put the tablet back on its dock when sleeping as the battery will be empty by the time you wake up I had set the alarm with the tablet and got woken up by a creepy countdown on TV that I couldn t switch off because the tablet had no battery anymore Good location near the tower of London and a few minutes away from the City 
180622,citizenM Tower of London, Room was on the small side , Modern feel with automated check in and tablet in the room to control lighting temperature tv etc Well designed hi tech environment 7th floor bar has excellent views over the Tower and the City Great reception area for informal meetings etc and entrance right next to Tower tube station 
180623,citizenM Tower of London, None, Clean quiet friendly stuff Low price You can chose a room with a view on Tower of London Bar on the top of the hotel is very big The room was very clean Very nice smell in the whole hotel mixture of coffee and flowers or something like that Very convenient to use all facilities IPad in your room helps you to do everything turn on off TV volume channels turn on off lights color of lights blinds up down set an alarm in different modes There is a safe in a room Rain shower 
180624,citizenM Tower of London, Bathroom was a bit small and were part of the room Not a very clear separation Room was very narrow , Interesting and different facilities Pretty cool place Lighting and iPad interaction with room was nice 
180625,citizenM Tower of London, Choice of beers in the rooftop bar A choice of one 330ml bottled lager 5 50 is not value for money Would recommend guests take in the view but don t have a drink it s too pricey , pillows were out of this world 
180626,citizenM Tower of London, Room design is like marmite well appointed but size and layout will disappoint some , Well located for City Tower Tube and carparks should you want to drive into town Great bar on top floor Great staff 
180627,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Imagine looking out the window and all you see is the world famous Tower of London Very clean rooms amazing lounge well priced food and beverages I d come here every weekend if I could 
180628,citizenM Tower of London, I didn t try the breakfast and 11 00 am is a bit early for check out , Great design of the smart room with an Ipad to change lights etc It was quiet the bed was comfortable I LOVED the entertainment media program great latest movies available for free streaming 
180629,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing at all , The ease of registering and choosing your room the attentiveness of the reception staff the modern clean room the most fantastic shower that I have ever been under the view from the bar from the 7th floor 
180630,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing , Great atmosphere in a superbly modern design Rooms are great love the bed idea Loved the roof top bar with fantastic views and great little spaces Self checkout system worked really well Loved it all 
180631,citizenM Tower of London, In hotel breakfast was expensive for what it was , The hotel is in an excellent location was clean and comfortable and we will definitely be back to stay again Loved the little coffee shop at the front of the hotel and the Sky bar is a lovely touch 
180632,citizenM Tower of London, The towels in the rooms in first day were good but theresfter they were not good and in fact stinking It seems they were bot being changed when rooms were being cleaned , Staff were very helpful
180633,citizenM Tower of London, Even though we had looked at the room pictures on booking com it was a shock to see the size of the room and that we couldn t walk around the bed but had to launch ourselves onto it from the end of the bed The bed itself was quite comfortable It was a real squeeze to fit in our 2 large suitcases as they wouldn t fit in the drawer under the bed We liked the public spaces downstairs and the rooftop bar with its fantastic views but for a 9 day stay would have preferred to have had the space to be able to relax in our room , The staff were extremely helpful Check in and check out were accomplished with no fuss on the hotel computer pod in the lobby The location was great and it was fantastic to have the tube station next door 
180634,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing, This property is in an excellent location The staff are very friendly and willing to help when ever they can The room is a little on the small size but more than acceptable for our needs 
180635,citizenM Tower of London, Only 2 of the lifts seem to work other than that no issues , Loved the rooms Very modern controlled by ipad Really comfy bed had an excellent sleep Good selection of programmes movies on the TV Shower was excellent Towels where lovely felt new and fluffy Hairdryer in the room was good 
180636,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Small but high quality rooms with a very modern approach to the hotel that makes the stay enjoyable fast self service check in ipad in room to control lights tv etc and everything is completed to a very high standard Would definitely stay again Great lounge area working space and bar in the downstairs lobby too
180637,citizenM Tower of London, Well overpriced for the offered services Staff not efficient Aircon not working properly either freezing cold or too hot, Great location Nice bar overlooking the Tower of London Comfy bed
180638,citizenM Tower of London, There was no water kettle in the room , The view was amazing from the room as well as the roof top bar Also the latest features in the room and the concept was so advanced 
180639,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing, Loved the overall modern design of the room And the use of the iPad mini to control everything available in the room was very cool Never stayed anywhere like it before but will definitely recommend and return 
180640,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing , Loved the decor and the fact that the hotel is right beside the Tube walking distance from London Bridge station nice walk across the Thames 
180641,citizenM Tower of London, Can t think of anything we didn t like about this place , Great location super friendly and helpful staff Very funky hotel and comfy bed Small room but perfectly adequate This hotel is a wonderful place to stay in London with access to everything nearby as the Tower Hill station is just outside the hotel entrance We look forward to our next stay 
180642,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, The concept of the hotel is unique Small sized rooms with big sized beds and a really cool lobby with lots of space to hang out The lobby is more like a modern library with many interesting books and antique items displayed Great atmosphere 
180643,citizenM Tower of London, Two things Tea and coffee facilities in the room Just need a coffee when you wake And hot food choice for lunch is average at best , Staff amazingly friendly Outstanding Fabio at Check in And our Italian rugby playing bartender Jacko I think Wonderful people 
180644,citizenM Tower of London, Water dripping and running from the ceiling I guess it was the air con unit above the bathroom door but not sure Dripped all night and mopped it up with towels a couple of times No time to tell anyone but if I d arrived earlier I would have asked for another room ,No Positive
180645,citizenM Tower of London, Rooms are too small Decent price I guess for London and such a great location but man that room is small Guess I m just a big American from the great big ole USA and used to wide open spaces This place doesn t have that If you re looking for convenience of location though it s hard to beat If you re traveling with kids I d probably avoid this place since it is so cramped , The location is awesome Just a few steps from the tower tube station Very cool decor Breakfast was good although a little expensive 
180646,citizenM Tower of London, Rooms are a little small but nicely decorated modern and clean , Very nice hotel all self check in Helpful staff and lovely breakfast Modern and clean rooms 
180647,citizenM Tower of London, Only problem is bathroom is a little stall in the very small room with no extractor that we could see Loved everything else though Definitely not a family hotel though you can barely move in the room let alone put a cot in , Great little pod rooms Great location and very friendly staff Really fun 
180648,citizenM Tower of London, Staff is nice but not always very attentive especially in the bars , Very comfortable bed Clean rooms Great view from the hotel bar Love the design of the hotel
180649,citizenM Tower of London, Size too small room There were No coffee and tea free in the room, Smart building View Bar at the top with beautiful view Smart room The view from the room
180650,citizenM Tower of London, The bar up stairs not being open all the time I mean you rave about the view then you can t see it because the bars shut , The easy check in The I pad remote was pretty cool Plus the bonus of the movie channel excellent 
180651,citizenM Tower of London, Only one downside for us poor sighted people No magnifying mirror on the wall in the room , Breakfast great Bar with panoramic view fantastic All staff really friendly and helpful Super funky decor Big comfortable bed 
180652,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Excellent place excellent staff excellent location I do recommend it Rooms are small but that is part of the game and why the price is not so high 
180653,citizenM Tower of London, Breakfast buffet needs improvement in terms of food varieties, Hotel located above Tower Hill Station Fast check in out Close proximity to tourist attractions Tower of London Tower Bridge HMS Belfast Modern hi tech
180654,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing, Awesome place to stay iPads in room which control everything from multi coloured mood lighting to the tv to the curtains proper cool place to stay bang across from sites can t go wrong 
180655,citizenM Tower of London, Would have liked draught beers available in the Skye bar , Had a great nights sleep on the comfy bed The staff were very attentive and helpful at all times 
180656,citizenM Tower of London, Small room although cleverly designed , Unique features in room with the mood pad and a bold quirky design Different from other identikit hotel rooms Truly excellent location 
180657,citizenM Tower of London, Not for older people had to ask for a change of room as all rooms apart from disabled could only be accessed by one side This meant climbing over ones partner if the bathroom facilities were needed All things controlled by computer Too gimmicky, Thet
180658,citizenM Tower of London, The room was a little narrow but when you consider every other positive aspect including location view transportation access right at the building nearness to the Thames Boats Pier the Tower the great breakfast the View from the amazing bar on the top floor the comfy huge bed the fluffy pillows the cleanliness and of course the outstanding staff you cannot beat this anywhere My husband and I are 65 , The staff was amazing Tilla and everyone that we met were absolutely polite pleasant and wonderful conversationalists as well as knowledgable 
180659,citizenM Tower of London, There was no kettle in the room And I have to have a cup of tea in the mornings before I can do anything , I thought this was an excellent hotel The location was amazing literally around the corner from the tube station a very short walk to tower bridge I loved that you could control your room temperature You had a plethora of choice of free films you could completely control the lighting in the room including mood lighting which I loved Also you have an iPad from which you can control the curtains and blinds the temperature the blinds and curtains and of course the lighting The shower was amazing It was spotlessly clean And there were two bottles of complimentary water in the fridge 
180660,citizenM Tower of London, The only down side was the room A The bed was wall to wall making it difficult to get into and out of B the room air conditioning was useless the minimum you could turn it down to was 18 degrees making it uncomfortable and unable to sleep during the night on really hot nights we encountered should be able to take down to at least 15 degrees c the shower was good but the toilet was in the shower and you had to leave the shower cubicle area and go into the bedroom area to use the washbasin and mirror tight squeeze, The hotel was very modern and spacious and lots of seating really excellent
180661,citizenM Tower of London, Shower toilet wet room not very clean on arrival and the iPad that is heavily advertised as the room controller for tv lighting temperature was flat with a faulty charging dock Was swiftly swapped by staff but maybe should be checked when housekeeping are turning the room around , Contemporary design
180662,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Design is very impressive The staff is very helpful and pleasant My friend has left her card in the room twice while we walking around the city During check out we have identified that one breakfast and bottle of water was charged on her card Although we had only outside hotel breakfast and didn t buy water We problem was quickly resolved by hotel staff Wrong items were removed from our invoice 
180663,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, The bed was really big and comfortable being able to control everything from an ipad was really good and the movie selection was really good and current The public areas of the hotel were spacious and really well designed and the balcony at the bar had spectacular views 
180664,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Everything was amazing From the quick self assisted check in to the comfy and swarve lobby area Amazing tech savy rooms with an excellent bed and luckily for us a stupendous view over the Tower of London and top of Tower Bridge Great and well priced breakfast along with being above the Tower underground line meaning easy access to the city On future visits to London I will most definitely return 
180665,citizenM Tower of London, The only thing I ever miss in these hotels is a kettle in the room , Love CitizenM hotels I love the smart room the media options the ease of navigating all facilities the autonomy of the place Super comfortable bed and I was able to choose a room with a view of the Tower of London which was amazing This location is right on top of Tower Hill tube station which is incredibly handy 
180666,citizenM Tower of London, Room cleaning seems to only happen every couple of days and wasn t very thorough , The view of the Tower of London was amazing to wake up to The quirky charm of the hotel you will either love or hate We loved The iPad smart controls are fun and that Apple aesthetic rubs off on the whole compact but functional room Excellent soundproofing despite the convenience of sitting over a tube station The roof top bars views are even better The relaxation of the lobby area is inviting Have a beer or coffee while hammering out a few emails The check in and checkout process was done on touch screen in the lobby So easy We would definitely stay again 
180667,citizenM Tower of London, The room is quite small for a long weekend it turned just right but we hardly had any luggage , Great location rooms are soundproof beautiful view we enjoyed the room 
180668,citizenM Tower of London, No room service or late night food snack bar , The staff of this hotel are amazing From the moment we checked in till we checked out they all made us feel welcome They were so helpful since we were new to this type of self help hotel The ambiance was great and they all accomodated our needs The hotel is modern the room is just good enough for 2 adults The 7th floor lounge has a killer view of the Tower of London and its surrounding areas The hotel is also just across the famous Tower of London where you can find the breathtaking Crown Jewels of the royal family There is also a train station right next to the hotel and there are restaurants within the viscinity We really loved this little modern gem Would stay here again and again 
180669,citizenM Tower of London, Loved everything , The restaurant was excellent and great value Both dinner and breakfast were wonderful Staff were friendly and professional Room was awesome clean and comfortable Would definitely stay again 
180670,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, We were looking for a hotel that was quirky and a bit different and CitizenM did not disappoint Located literally on top of Tower Hill Station it really is a 2 minute walk We arrived early and were able to leave our luggage to go enjoy our day and head back later to check in Check in was smooth and you re able to choose your own room on arrival from those available we were lucky to get a Tower of London view which was amazing The room was controlled completely by iPad temperature lighting TV curtain and blind The bed is extra large and was right up against the window so comfy The whole stay was brilliant and we are currently looking into their other hotels for our next trip P S The coffee in reception is amazing 
180671,citizenM Tower of London, We were a group of friends travelling together some of us sharing rooms We did not like the bathroom that was enclosed in frosted glass sometimes you need a bit more privacy Frosted glass bathroom doors is an awful trend that needs to go There is no light dedicated to just the bathroom so if you need to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night you will have to turn on the mirror light which is part of the common area There is a curtain that acts as a partition but its transparent so not functional , Tower Hill station is located steps away from the hotel With the London Underground now accepting Contactless payments it s easier to use the Tube We loved the rooftop bar with the wonderful view The bed was big and comfortable the room is not the biggest but when you re in London you don t need to hang out in your room 
180672,citizenM Tower of London, Facility to have a hot drink in room Not always convenient to go down to the ground floor when you are half dressed just to get a cup of tea , Vibe Location Facilities food hall basically Great rooftop bar 
180673,citizenM Tower of London, Liked everything Didn t like leaving , Room was great View was excellent Breakfast was lovely Recommend to anyone Walking distance from everything 
180674,citizenM Tower of London, fire alarm in the middle of the night had this happen a few properties over the years Do feel on this occasion communication could be better at the time when outside no communication no one at a defined gathering point from Staff young staff member at front door came out side just shrugged her shoulders when asked anything people return inside when alarms went off with no real communication from mgmt at the time although nice msg the following morning from mgmt Just feel something they can learn from , great concept and property far superior for the price point in London
180675,citizenM Tower of London, My only fault would be that there were no tea or coffee making facilities in our room , The hotel was quirky and full of entertaining twists and turns you most certainly would not be bored looking around 
180676,citizenM Tower of London, Awful experience from start to finish Despite being very expensive for what was offered the staff were unable to help when it became clear my original booking was messed up I had to have someone else sort it out online Rooms are very small completely soleless and clincal a good portrayal of the death room from the movie Soylent Green The room access card needed for virtually everything stopped working and I became stuck in a lift for 20 minutes resulting in my being late for an important event No apology received just uniniterested hosts I think they re called Alarms went off at 02 25 in the morning due to someone having a shower and the place had to be evacuated A complete lack of information or staff on hand to aid those who needed it didn t help there was no guidance nothing On re admittance the vagrants were allowed in as well and spent 30 minutes harrassing tired and already irritated guests for money there was no one to remove them perhaps due to the almost complete absence of staff The format for this hotel is a victory of marketing and glitz over substance Don t be fooled by the colourful busy exterior or friendly welcoming website page it s anything but that Regrettably the rating indicator doesn t offer anything more damning that a frowning face otherwise I would have clicked that I really was disgusted with the whole experience Apparently we are advised the sister hotel in Paris has been completely remodelled following similar client experiences CAVEAT EMPTOR , Absolutely nothing to commend this place be warned 
180677,citizenM Tower of London, Would have liked more of a private bathroom setting and wash clothes for the shower The fire alarm went off at 2 30AM and there was no announcement of false alarm , Staff was very friendly and helpful 
180678,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Great stay I traveled with my daughter who was actually going to Tobago flying from London We wanted to have some time together before her big university trip I emailed the reception asking for a room with a nice view I got much more that I expected On the arrival we got two complimentary drinks we could decide what we want They did not offer us a chip wine In the room my daughter found lots of balloons and a card The card was prepared by a lovely member of staff Teela She made a huge effort as the card was containing some images from Tobago and a nice story It was a great personal touch Thank you The room itself is not very specious but it is lovely The bed is extremely comfortable Everything is operated by an iPad Lights TV there is a great sellection of movies The hotel Location is great Is literally next to the Tower Hill underground station The reception is nice and modern There are also computers you can use At the bar you can buy some food good selection for a very reasonable price The second night was interrupted by a fire alarm but this things happen I got an email in the morning explaining the situation and apologising for this I would highly recommended the hotel to everyone traveling to London for business or leisure and I will definately stay in the hotel again 
180679,citizenM Tower of London, About half of the rooms including mine do not have an outdoor window but but face an inside court with no real day light and facing the opposite rooms at such a short distance that you have to keep the blinds closed if you want a minimum of privacy given that the rooms are really tiny it is very claustrophobic The nice entrance hall and bar as well as the ipad controls and other funny but no needed features sadly do not make up for the room size it reminded me of my time as a child when we had a caravan If two people use the bed the one next to the window has to climb over the other person in order to go to the bathroom The storage space under the bed is fun but a bit useless as it s too shallow to put even a small suitcase it so that one stands around in the already too small room The check in system asked me where I wanted my room to be located in the house I asked a friendly staff member to advice me she told me to chose high up facing a back road as that would be the best of the three propositions I ended up with a room on a low floor with no real daylight the whole thing was a bad joke , The design of the entrance hall is very nice staff is friendly and the bar on the top floor is worth staying in for a while especially in the evening The breakfast buffet had a very nice choice and good quality food Staff members are friendly 
180680,citizenM Tower of London, To me the hotel is top but the rooms are small and you can hear every sound from the toilet I point this so no one is disappointed , It is really stylish hotel High tech Nice rooms Bed is perfect really comfortable In the end the best one in this hotel is the view from the bar Just amazing 
180681,citizenM Tower of London, Nil, Rarely do I find a location that fits my needs exactly but this place was it Clean modern and comfortable and perfect for a solo traveller The room more a pod was small and might be tight for two but for me it was great Easy check in out and friendly staff Great location and fast wifi There s nothing that was promised I didn t receive 
180682,citizenM Tower of London, The rooms are rather small which doesn t bother me personally since I m there to see the city not the room but if you plan on spending much time in your room it might be a little too small The toilet shower combination is not very usual for this price range in my opinion I prefer a separate toilet with a proper door , The hotel is located near the Tower Bridge and the Tower of London and you can reach a lot of good location on foot Right next to the building is a tube station for the Circle and District lines which take you to a wide range of points of interest buses 15 25 are also close by and the Tower millennium pier is a 5 minute walk the rooms are small but very modern with a smart room control system via tablet lights airco media blinds curtains etc can all be controlled from one tablet The rooms are modern have good quality Matrasses and pillows and are very clean The overal atmosphere in the hotel is very nice the staff was helpful and on the 7th floor there is a bar with a pretty good view over the area of the city hall tower bridge und Tower of London 
180683,citizenM Tower of London, I wish I didnt have to leave I wanted the staff to say I could stay free forever , The bed was amazingly comfy The shower moodlighting was the coolest The view spectacular 
180684,citizenM Tower of London, Can t say , Another outstanding experience the hotel is an unbeatable location with an extraordinary view over The Tower and Thames river Very trendy friendly space 
180685,citizenM Tower of London, Although the bar is open 24 for drinks they stop serving food after 1am would not be a complaint normally because who eats at 1am but when you re still trying to get your body used to the different time zones and you re feeling hungry at 1am it would be nice if there were some basic options sandwiches sushi or even fruit salads , Central to great tourist sights London Bridge can be seen from your room the tube is literally around the corner 5 metres from the hotel the hop on hop off bus is across the road and there are some good restaurants close by Great hotel to meet locals too who use the facilities for business purposes 
180686,citizenM Tower of London, There were works going on all night at the tube station next door which meant we could hear stuff going on right outside, Loved that there were two kinds of loo roll Also Harrison on the bar was super lovely and friendly
180687,citizenM Tower of London, there were no kettles in the room so you would need to get some from the reception bar area downstairs , great views convenient location smart room helpful staff 
180688,citizenM Tower of London, Not enough privacy when going to the toilet, Staff very friendly and very helpful Could get a drink or a bite anytime of the day or night Had a coffee in the cafe downstairs which was awesome Loved the room and although small had everything we needed including a fridge to keep our water cold The bed was massive and very comfortable 
180689,citizenM Tower of London, I don t think this hotel is a good option for long distance travellers with lots of luggage The rooms are too small and one ends up falling over your suitcases to get to the bed Although the breakfast is great it is a bit chaotic to find what you want and a great challenge to find a place to sit and eat it It was a pity that the best space on the patio outside were occupied by smokers , This is a quirky hotel centrally situated The rooms are very compact which is fine as there is ample space to sit in the lounge areas and the upstairs bar area From here there are stunning views of the Tower of London A hearty breakfast is on offer and if you pre book it you get it a a discounted price The fact that you can control lighting curtains and blinds as well as the TV with room iPad was quite fun The staff was generally very friendly and helpful 
180690,citizenM Tower of London, Wish the bar was open for lunch on Sunday, Loved the design of the room small but perfectly formed and we loved the extra little touches Attention to detail was really good 
180691,citizenM Tower of London, No privacy in bathroom due to large gap under the door and washbasin in bed room shower temperature control faulty kept burning us using toilet awkward as floor was continuously wet from the shower had to ask for toiletries noisy fan in shower continued all night no tea making facility in room so had to keep getting dressed and going to cafe to bring tea to room and cost 2 a cup Even Travelodge give you a kettle Cups in room were not removed by staff which spoilt effect of freshly made up room , Comfy bed good TV useful blackout blinds powerful shower fridge useful great view free bottle of water
180692,citizenM Tower of London, There could be more choice for breakfast, The location of this hotel is amazing right near Tower Hill station Tower Bridge is about a 2 minute walk The hotel is very unique very modern and up to date You control the bedroom using an iPad controlling heat lights blinds etc Taxis are always waiting outside the hotel The hotel is in a really great location I would definitely stay here again 
180693,citizenM Tower of London, Did ask for a special birthday surprise for partner which although was 2 free drinks could only be had at downstairs bar and were cut out of card The bar had thought we had made them and were slightly sceptical so would have preferred an actual voucher of sort , Great large comfy beds fun mood lighting and iPad controlled Amazing rooftop bar with great views and you can order pizza and drinks 24hrs Self service check in was great towerhill tube station is right next door so great location 
180694,citizenM Tower of London, NOTHING, It was the best hotel in this price in my life It s really great If I can find same price I will stay in this hotel again It was better than ibis premier inn or any franchise hotels 
180695,citizenM Tower of London, Smallish room with access to the bed only on one side Climbing over your partner can be fun some times but should not be a requirement to get into or out of the bed , View was excellent from bar levels 
180696,citizenM Tower of London, Very few complaints for this hotel The rooms were small but clean The room setup at least for ours was better suited for partners who don t mind being in a very intimate space The bathroom walls are semi transparent and the bed is arranged against a wall so that one person basically has to climb over the other to get in and out of bed Also the breakfast is not a good deal It would be great if items for breakfast and dinner were offered a la carte , I loved the modern quirky decor Although the rooms are on the small side there are plenty of places to gather with friends have a meeting or even just relax with a book and coffee throughout the hotel There is plenty of comfortable seating The staff are wonderful very helpful The location is perfect literally right on top of the tube station which is great when you are transporting luggage or when you ve returned from a long day of sightseeing 
180697,citizenM Tower of London, The room reminded me of a cabin on a boat not a bad thing as such but you couldn t walk round the side of the bed, Ipad controls of lights and blind Bar with a fantastic view Location
180698,citizenM Tower of London, Food and drinks can be a bit expensive however there are plenty of places nearby to eat and drink , Everything was generally excellent location staff even the rooms although small are ideal for a business traveller Maybe not so good for a couple with limited storage space for suitcases this is a large draw under the bed actually a good space saving idea The upstairs bar is ideal to sit and work at there are benches with power and the wi fi is fast Staff are wonderful and talking to one of the bar staff he said he was proud to work there this is always a good sign if staff like their work place 
180699,citizenM Tower of London, Not being able to open the windows but that s just me and my husband we prefer fresh air to air conditioning But one does wonder if London does have fresh air as it is very busy with traffic and constant crowds of people London is lovely to visit for a short break and this hotel is ideal , The hotel is just metres away from Tower Hill Station or walking distance from London Bridge which is excellent if you are arriving from Gatwick as they have an express train direct to London Bridge It has lovely view of the Tower of London and the Bridge from its 5th floor bar It is a very small but unique hotel which is quite quirky We loved the hotel and would recommend it to family and friends We cannot comment on the breakfast or dinner as we did not use the restaurant It was flying visit overnight for a medical appointment Another perfect location as its walking distance from all the major and private hospitals in London 
180700,citizenM Tower of London, Small rooms if you re sharing but not a couple hybrid Ibis room design and Bloc in room technology Sink in the sleeping area , Superb location easiest check in checkout really helpful staff quirky outside the box decor plenty of lounging eating space wonderful view from the 7th floor bar Definitely unlike other hotels particularly the decor M hotels are like a well kept secret for the select few but probably won t stay that way 
180701,citizenM Tower of London, Room too small for longer business stays Close to no room for storing clothes very uncomfortable desk chair Not great to work on I had to work 2 days from my hotel room , Very friendly and helpful staff Ground Floor with reception caf and bar area exceptional room very modern and very appealing Smart room with lighting features Apple TV and international TV channels
180702,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, I really enjoyed the fantastic and original lobby that citizen hotels have The cloud M bar is a beautiful place to have a drink Delicious breakfast Room control is fun and entertainment is really good The bed is big and comfortable Big towels Good shower 
180703,citizenM Tower of London, Breakfast items were tasty but more on sweeter side Can do to add little Indian spices to some dishes , 7th floor bar view nearness to tube the smart pad and ever smiling and helpful staff
180704,citizenM Tower of London, Had to leave our room to get tea and coffee which you pay for and the food area had limited choice and very little information about what was available , After paying for it the view from our room was amazing and the room was small but really comfortable 
180705,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Very stylish hotel and very nice staff quiet enviromnment breakfast is good although there is no view out of window it is a perfect hotel except the rate is bit high 
180706,citizenM Tower of London, no kettle in the room would have liked a normal way to control lights and TV ie just a tv remote not the ipad which was really confusing , clean personalised welcome nice facilities
180707,citizenM Tower of London, Rooms are quite small and everything is switched on off by IPad which may be difficullt for older generation , 24 7 bar friendly helpful staff cosy place feels like sitting in the living room at home and right next to the underground station Tower Hill Lovely views if you pay extra the bed is huge and very comfortable 
180708,citizenM Tower of London, The room size was very small and second person had to jump across the bed to get to the other side There was only room for one suitcase and it had to go in a drawer under the bed The other suitcase we had to open on the bed and then put down when we needed the bed Bathroom was small pod like but OK , So close to the train station We walked out of Tower Hill Station and walked straight into the Hotel The Tower of London is across the road Lots of little cafe s across the road along the river too 
180709,citizenM Tower of London, The breakfast can be better especially the fresh fruit The cleanliness of the room can be improved , We had a great view on the Tower of London The metro station is right under the hotel which is really convenient The general style of the hotel lobby is very nice 
180710,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Excellent choice for staying in central London where most hotel room are small anyways A modern and comfortable alternative to so many overpriced and unbearable hotels in the centre Tube station literally next to the hotel entrance which makes moving around very easy 
180711,citizenM Tower of London, The room could ve been just a little bigger and I would ve preferred the sink to be actually inside the bathroom , The location and the view are fantastic The whole approach to how the hotel is setup is quite unusual but in a good and exciting way And it s still very cozy and friendly along with all the hi tech and unorthodox features 
180712,citizenM Tower of London, They maximise the space in the bedrooms so they are compact but very comfortable , Great location seconds from the tube lovely atmosphere and staff and great bar on the 7th floor 
180713,citizenM Tower of London, Better climate control in room More ventilation would make it perfect , New concept more shared amenities with tons of options to hang out and meet people Room is small however highly functional Ironing room is well set up and well equipped awesome steam iron 
180714,citizenM Tower of London, Excellent Hotel with a Great team All positive nothing that I didnt like Thankyou , After staying many times with Citizen M and through Booking com I was surprised to see my cool room with a great view of the Tower of London and the Shard There were 2 lovely cards welcoming me which I found very touching from the Staff I went out for 1 hour and when I returned to the room Teela Annie May Catherine Emma Shanta Juriana Effy and the AM Team had written a lovely funny poem for me and filled the room with around 40 red balloons Wow This was amazing I work in customer service and fully appreciate what they all did for a complete stranger Incredible team so please spread the word and pass on this review 
180715,citizenM Tower of London, If we were staying for more than a couple of nights the room would be a bit small as insufficient room to work but ok for business trips for one person, Well thought out room lived all the gadgets and decor Staff really friendly and hrlpful
180716,citizenM Tower of London, hall was too scented poor dinner just a few options , feeling at home free movies fantastic location close to Tower Bridge very nice atmosphere great coffee and cappuccino extra large bed
180717,citizenM Tower of London, The rooms are in my opinion quite small the bed is big and the bathroom is very big but it does not leave a lot of free space to leave your luggage even though I ll give them credit for placing a drawer beneath the bed for storage The cleaning it felt lik the cleaning crew had very specific orders what to do and that is all they done few exampls they put new water in the fridge but didn t take the empty bottles we ate pizza one night and the pizza box wasn t taken out of the room one night I left my towel hanging on a hanger and it was left there even though they put a new one in the bathroom , The location of the hotel was great the staff was very friendly the concept of the hotel was great for my opinion The bed was super comfortable and it was long which was excellent because my husband is very tall Also they provide bottles of water everyday which was very appreciated by us 
180718,citizenM Tower of London, The only minor thing that could be added to the room is coffee tea amenities , Citizen M was again brilliant The bed is so comfortable the people friendly and the location perfect The rooms are small but luxurious and equipped with pretty much everything you could need 
180719,citizenM Tower of London, Privacy of bathroom Size but a typical London room, Rooms very small with large bed and wet room style bathroom All you need for city break Privacy with bathroom non existent Fine with family perhaps not friends Very cool decor Fantastic bar overlooking Tower of London and the city everything works by iPad Possibly difficult for those unfamiliar with that device such as my elderly mother
180720,citizenM Tower of London, Courtyard rooms feel stuffy and closed out Rooms are on the small side , Some rooms have amazing views to the Tower of London Smart rooms Super friendly and helpful staff Nice Breakfast Great view from the rooftop bar
180721,citizenM Tower of London, The food options in the lounge are great but unfortunately not everything is available 24hours Also understandably high tech comes with some trade offs when the pad with which you control the functions of the room is out of battery you re out of some options until it is recharged , The concept of citizenM hotels is genius Clean well designed high tech rooms offering peace and privacy in the middle of the city combined with an entry lounge and a rooftop bar which both manage to feel exactly like the super luxurious cosmopolitan living room that you would love to have Food selection was great and diverse with a delicious salad bar The rooftop bar is superbly stocked with excellent cocktails and a view on the Tower of London and the skyline 
180722,citizenM Tower of London, The bed arrangement it is only accessible on one side the other three are fixed to a wall Meaning it is unsuitable to less able people The room is also tiny , The staff and cleanliness of the hotel and of course its location right near the Tower of London and next to Tower Hill Tube Station and Fenchurch Rail Station 
180723,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, The iPad that controls the majority of the room lights and curtains The massive bed is amazing Left us a special gift for an anniversary Excellent 
180724,citizenM Tower of London, Room was unexpectedly small The bed was the entire width of the room which meant someone had to climb over the other to get out As we were travelling for some months it was difficult to unpack as there are no shelving or the like , The bed and pillows very comfortable Staff went out of their way to help us and allowed an early check in after a very long flight from Australia Nothing was too much trouble Lots of common areas to sit 
180725,citizenM Tower of London, Everything If you are a traditional person like me who likes a spoon to stir their morning coffee rather than a stick you will hate this hotel , Very high tec hotel The room is all controlled by an ipad The lobby reception is all self service touch screen computers to check in check out etc The breakfast are bar is like a Starbucks Trendy artwork and decor everywhere 
180726,citizenM Tower of London, As there was no tea coffee in the room only one small complimentary bottle of water for a 2 night stay was a little mean , Its great rooftop bar is spacious and has a real laid back vibe as does the whole place with plenty of nooks and small seating areas It s in an Ideal location for the Tube and all main attractions Although obviously very busy it was nice quiet overnight We had an internal facing room which helped 
180727,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing, Excellent value for money stylish and cozy Located right next to Tower Hill underground station with a lovely view or Canary Wharf It meets all my expectation for travel home away from home I will definitely stay with them by my next trip

180730,citizenM Tower of London, you want an exterior facing room One facing over the interior centrl lobby might lead to people sneaking a view into your room, As a central london pad close to everything and easy to spend time in I loved it I stay in many hotels week in week out in London and I d definitely recommend it Downstairs areas particularly good 
180731,citizenM Tower of London, Bed for a single person Couldn t walk round to access and had to climb over partner Bathroom not private and small basin in room meant floor got wet Trying far too hard to be cool and funky with app based room controls that didn t function properly ,No Positive
180732,citizenM Tower of London, Room rather small not much room for clothes and Suitcases etc Also the fact that the double bed is situated so that one person has climb over another if wanting to go to the bathroom during the night ,No Positive
180733,citizenM Tower of London, I didn t like the fact that the check out was at 11 am that s a bit early I also didn t like the fact that the sink was in the room and the bathroom is a bit tiny , the hotel is super modern and easy to check in The room is very modern everything is controlled by an ipad and the bed was probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on The location is incredible you are on top of Tower Hill station 
180734,citizenM Tower of London, N A, Hotel has everything you need Have stayed at this chain of hotel twice and very satisfied with both stays will stay again The room has iPad to control tv mood lighting music temperature and other services There was no parking but being a weekend we found parking practically outside Tower of London a minute away 
180735,citizenM Tower of London, The pillows on the bed look a little dirty could probably do without them , Breanna at the desk was amazing and helped us celebrate my wife s 30th birthday with some special decorations in our room Also an astounding view over Tower of London a superb place to stay 
180736,citizenM Tower of London, Rooms were very small Toilet and shower room was like a pod and not very private Would say this hotel suits a younger clientele, Bed was very comfortable 
180737,citizenM Tower of London, Everything was good Make sure to take your room key with you if you want to nip down for coffee drinks though otherwise you can t control the lifts , Huge big bed and our room had such a nice view overlooking the Shard and gardens below the hotel The staff were so helpful at check in and when we checked out and wanted to leave our bags The room is controlled via an iPad and the TV comes with loads of good movies The bar on the roof has wonderful views over london and is nice and buzzy but not too busy because it s for hotel guests and friends only The hotel is right next to the tube station you don t even have to get wet if it s raining and it s easy to get an Uber or a taxi later at night about 10 15 from soho Covent garden 
180738,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Great location with views of The Tower of London Lots of nearby eating options About 35 minutes walk to The Strand if you fancy stroll along the Thames Usual Citizen M quirkiness high end style and design 
180739,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, It was my 2nd stay at CitizenM and again it was great worth every penny spent The hotel is located right above the Tower Hill Underground station and is few minutes away from Tower Bridge well known City skyscrapers and The Monument Lovely lobby modern spotless room with enormous sized bed yes even in the Single room The rooftop terrace bar gives you breathtaking view of the Tower and South bank Check in and out is very easy multiple self service terminals however staff is very helpful if you re having trouble Overall great experience will definitely consider staying there again and again 
180740,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, location is great right facing Tower of London The lobby and bar at floor 7 is very comfortable and convenient for reading checking laptop talking etc The room is small but it provides everything I need the iPad control system is cool 
180741,citizenM Tower of London, Bathroom was more of a pod in the room Fine for us as we re reasonably young and married but a bit personal for older ppl or those not in a relationship , New modern quirky Just above Tower of London tube New movies in the room Helpful staff Buzzy communal areas 
180742,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing, Thoughtful design of the room great large comfortable bed large window very useful under bed storage drawer several outlets to recharge phones etc handy desk and table for writing modern walk in shower interesting mood lighting dimmable lights and everything controlled electronically from a provided I pad On the main floor electronic check in and check out 24 hour canteen and many living rooms with chairs desks tables sofas books and computers Excellent location beside the Tower of London and over top of a tube station with many restaurants close by 
180743,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, First of all I loved the concept Very modern and fun The rooms are small but very functional with sufficient space for 1 2 people The bed was very big and comfortable The staff were very pleasant and helpful 
180744,citizenM Tower of London, as usual breakfast is expensive at CitizenM elevators can be slow waiting time, great hotel on top of a subway station superb roof bar with view on London Tower very nice lobby area with coffee bar and a place to have drinks and simple food
180745,citizenM Tower of London, 1 Wash basin right in the room toilet and shower removed from the room by a thin glass wall only 2 Week shower and toilet ventilator 3 Window to the passage no view 4 Non opening window no fresh air , 1 Right at the Tower Hill underground station 2 Nice living rooms at ground floor 3 Wetherspoon Pub just only 3 minutes walking 
180746,citizenM Tower of London, Having to do a self check in after a long flight was tedious and really annoying My credit card is not a pin card and one of the staff had to help me check in all over again View from my room on the first night faced a building being constructed Minor issue but the pillows were way too soft I needed two to have any form of support , The room with the view of the Tower Breakfast spread and the canteen was nice 
180747,citizenM Tower of London, The bed was very confortable but we found the room quite small bed stuck between the window and the walls , Perfect location and nice and original decoration Excellent breakfast 
180748,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, We love this place so so so much Upon the arrival and during our stay the ambassadors were so welcoming and helpful The room was clean the shower gel smell so good that we have to get one home Breakfast was great the bar has an amazing view and the design of the hotel itself is awesome We used to think of a hotel for just a place to stay but this hotel makes us wanting to stay as long as we could with a range of free movies and a comfy bed With the tube right at the doorstep you can reach anywhere in London or if you choose to explore the city by walking is not a bad idea at all We are definitely going to stay here again 
180749,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing 10 10 , Everything Location was right above tower hill station Seconds walk to the tower bridge and all things central London The oversize king size bed was amazing Room was bright and spacious well for the size anyways Shower was amazing and very technologically forward If I had the money I would have stayed here the whole if my visit to London I asked for extra pillows they were there in minutes Asked for directions downstairs staff were very helpful Awesome free wifi 
180750,citizenM Tower of London, No kettle or coffee machine in the room, Most amazing hotel I ve stayed in The bar on the 7th floor is the best view of London ever Rooms are fabulous comfy beds and the little touches with the mood lighting where excellent Amazing shower too So contemporary very impressed 
180751,citizenM Tower of London, The bed was a little firm for me and as its placed sideways across the room from wall to wall whoever is laying closest to the window has to climb over the other person There didn t seem to be separate lights for the bathroom so if you need to get up in the night you have to put the small lamp on which again wakes the other person The main problem for me though was that the ventilation blows directly on to the bed and you can t can t turn it off I personally can t stand being in a draught so it meant I was cold for most of my stay or had to burrow under the covers The room wasn t cold I turned the temperature up and it responded very quickly it was just the ventilation, Right by Tower Hill tube station with a view of the Shard the river Tower Bridge etc Can t get much more central The public areas of the hotel are outstanding fantastic lobby meeting area and lobby bar and a small deli where you can get food although we only got coffee The view from the CloudM bar is amazing Staff are extremely helpful and friendly You have to do self check in which is really easy but there are at least 2 members of staff helping you We arrived at 6 p m on a Friday night and didn t have to wait at all The lighting heating and media in the room are all controlled by an iPad the movie selection is good all free but there were surprisingly few UK TV channels You can though stream directly from your device via a magic app so I guess if we d been there long enough we d have explored that option 
180752,citizenM Tower of London, The only thing that could have made it even better would have been tea coffee making facilities in the room , The staff on arrival were really helpful The whole hotel was lovely with lots of interesting things to look at the view from the bar was incredible and the bar staff extremely friendly Our room was like no other we ve stayed in before with an iPad setting our mood lighting blinds and film viewing We were kindly upgraded to a shard view room as it was a special occasion which was much appeciated We can t wait to stay again 
180753,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing , citizenM never disappoints me Great atmosphere in the lobby with very friendly and helpful staff Rooms are small but all is available and beds are extremely comfortable Can t wait to stay again in of the hotels 
180754,citizenM Tower of London, There was a fridge in the room but apparently they had taken out the kettles due to a problem with them setting off the fire alarms Tea and coffee were available 24hours a day downstairs but you have to pay for them I very much object to paying over 2 pounds for a cup of tea As the room is so small there is no room for your suitcase That is no problem if you are there for a few days as I was and can put your clothes away in the storage area If you were staying overnight there is not enough room to have your case on the floor and live out of it , Fantastic location easy to get to by public transport and next to a Santander bike hire station and cycle superhighway The room was very well designed small but with a big comfortable bed and the bathroom was relatively large The idea is that you have a small private space but large communal areas with a choice of different seating The room was well sound proofed I was next to the lift but it wasn t a problem The ironing room next to the lifts was a good idea as was 24 hour access to food if you are jet lagged and want breakfast at 2am you can help yourself 
180755,citizenM Tower of London, Could have done with a longer stay , What an excellent hotel find Right next to the tube And by right next to I don t mean a few minutes walk from I literally mean right next to Tower Hill tube station where you can literally explore the whole of London Town Location is perfect If the Tower of London built a guesthouse it would be CitizenM Tower of London as it s just across the road Literally Plenty of restaurants and outdoor space around the hotel if you feel like grabbing something for a picnic A couple of stops away on the tube did I mention the tube is literally next door to the hotel and you re at Millennium Bridge which takes you across the river to wonderful Southbank which is the mothership of people watching with a cool beer or fizzy mineral But it s only like a 20 min walk from the hotel to go by foot if weather permits It s about 15 mins to Oxford St 15 mins to Stratford and the monstrous Westfield Shopping Centre We flew into Gatwick and Stanstead both journeys were so easy and took less than an hour door to door But enough about the location the hotel itself is exceptional ENORMOUS beds I was a wee bit dubious when there wasn t a twin room option when travelling with friends but you d have to stretch out like a starfish to interfere with your roommate Plus you ll be in such a deep sleep because the beds are so comfortable that you won t notice anyone beside you The rooms are nice and big so you won t be tripping over your shopping bangs in the middle of the night In fact everything in the room is big bathroom shower wardrobes TV There s a rooftop bar with STUNNING views and a hidden library up another flight with little cubby holes where you can grab a book and relax on some funky furniture Be warned though you ll want to redecorate your house when you get home We didn t eat in the hotel restaurant but had coffees and pastries in the cafe which were delicious 
180756,citizenM Tower of London, Did not get a quiet room I requested initially Moved to a high floor but bar looked right into the room so had to have the blind and curtain closed all the time The moving light in the courtyard made a noise right outside my room Asked to be moved again Ended up in a high floor looking out as I had requested at the point of booking Would have been great to get that last room first ,No Positive
180757,citizenM Tower of London, The room was very compact, The location of this property was fantastic So easy to get to and from The hotel is very clean and the staff very friendly 
180758,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Perfect location Being in a busy part of town entering the hotel makes you feel at home and relaxed right away All facilities are perfect I love the iron heaven which they have in place on each floor Also free movies availible via the tablet Great shower 
180759,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing at all, Each piece of home appliance can be directly controlled with a single tablet They rrally implemented a smart home The room is very neat and tidy 
180760,citizenM Tower of London, the fire alarm that went off as soon as I started resting and the staff was unable to stop it for about half an hour was in the afternoon and also noisy maintenance in the afternoon,No Positive
180761,citizenM Tower of London, We didn t do breakfast as like fry up went to weatherspoons across the road, Everything about the hotel it was classy funky friendly and staff amazing you must visit
180762,citizenM Tower of London, Minor remarks to the room well although cleverly designed still on the border between minimalistic and claustrophobic No fresh air Bed is XXXL size and comfy but if u want to use the TV make sure to place the weakbladder nightwaterdrinker at the outer side No separate illumination in the bath room at least i couldn t find a separate switch Sounds much worse than it is in reality most probably u will not notice these minorities during a 3 nights stay , Location 50 out of 10 cleanliness 30 out of 10 Staff not exactly friendly maybe due to personal cultural differences but 100 professional and helpful 10 out of 10 One very big EU power outlets AND USB charging ports Guys advertise this Bold Underlined Size 24 letters Free luggage storage make it more clear in the property description 
180763,citizenM Tower of London, Unfortunately you couldn t have a look at the Thames or at the Tower of London because the riverside is reserved by a private society and the roof is not accessible , Everything in this hotel is top notch the position is just in front of the Tower of London obviously well served by any means of transport tube stop is just next door The room wasn t large but very comfortable and well organized The bed was huge and great to sleep into the bathroom was mirror clean and almost brand new with great attention to details shower head had five different settings Everything from tv to curtains from light colours to room temperature could be remote controlled by an Ipad The staff was friendly and helpful in settling every problem even if we arrived at 3 00 am being also able to speak a lot of different languages The hall and living is gargantuan but cozy because it was furnished more like a house with great libraries full of every kind of book We didn t try the breakfast because it was definitive too expensive 
180764,citizenM Tower of London, No water hitter no tea or coffee Really should progress on that Although they do serve bottled water but we d really like to have some hot drink before or after a tried day Room is really small on this price We spend 600 pounds for 4 days excluding breakfast and the room is just like 400 ones could serve us mini sized , The facilities in the room is quiet nice bed is comfort tv has movies to watch light is bright and can be adjusted by mood curtain is electrical as well all can be controlled by iPad It is very quiet without any noisy bathroom is clean and big enough The hotel just located on the tower hill station 
180765,citizenM Tower of London, We didn t find any courtesy set in the room but then we asked to the reception and they gave us something , Everything perfect Friendly staff good position room with view thank you and always cleaned bed really comfortable 
180766,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, While the rooms are compact they are well thought through and all details add up positively The tablet control of everything in the room the cozy bed the good entertainmant package the very friendly staff all in all it has everything a good hotel needs The location is amazing not only right next to the twoer also basically in the tube station so you get everywhere quickly 
180767,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Although the rooms are on the small side they are perfectly formed The bed was huge and very comfortable I loved using the IPad to control everything in the room lighting TV Temperature etc We had a room overlooking the Tower of London which was really special The location is perfect and the hotel is right on top of the tube so you don t have to go far at all to jump on the train The communal areas of the hotel are very cool and very relaxing Unfortunately after coming back to the hotel from our night out we just missed out on going out onto the veranda for a drink however the indoor bar area still has fantastic views over the city I would stay here again 
180768,citizenM Tower of London, They have thought of everything , This was more than just a hotel It was an experience Normally I book hotels that are close to things I want or need to do The hotel is a place to sleep and eat This hotel offers an experience where you want to actually stay there and hand out great vibe great staff great location and great value 
180769,citizenM Tower of London, The room controlling iPad had a bit of a worn battery I think It went dead within the hour out of it s charging stand I didn t report it but I assume that would have been easily replaced if I would have , This was my first time in a CitizenM and it has been great It starts with a really nice selfservice check in and even then staff is hovering around to assist you A very nice polite but not distant staff from the first beginning until the end The room is amazing a great bed a really well functioning rain shower with a massage handset mood lightning controlled by the room iPad that also controls the tv set the blinds and curtains what not Complementary films to watch and a 24 7 food offering on the ground floor What s more to say Yes they offer a fine breakfast but extra special is the bar on the 7th floor with a round walking balcony and an astonishing view on the Tower of London you really shouldn t miss that So all and all I now know my new favorite hangout in London 
180770,citizenM Tower of London, Breakfast could have been better , The Bed was comfortable and the room was quiet however a little small for my liking the view from the bar was good and I appreciated the marathon goodie bag 
180771,citizenM Tower of London, Small room but we made the best of it Location made up for it , Smart room from iPad was good We loved the location The view from the 7th floor bar was amazing Huge drawer under bed for clothes Having a fridge to use was convenient We really enjoyed the outlet that had two USB ports and a North American outlet 
180772,citizenM Tower of London, I didn t experience anything negative about the hotel , Small room but that did not matter at all as it came with a very comfortable large bed and everything in the space felt fresh new and clean The overall look of the hotel is clean yet cosy and the lounge provided lots of quiet spaces if you need a larger place to sit I ended up working for a few hours in the lobby and it was a great space to concentrate Also loved the supply of free movies not yet out on dvd Make sure you pick a room with a view of the Tower of London for the extra touch though 
180773,citizenM Tower of London, the bathroom is very small and the sneak is out side you couldn t fell privacy in it the room very small i don t know why the rooms in London very small like that the last thing is the reception and the way to check in it s very wired, i like the system when you control of the lights and the location very near to the underground
180774,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing, This is a very nice hotel for a reasonable price considering its position It is a little different from the norm but in a good way our room was very clean and fun with its ipad controls The decor and facilities are brilliant and quite cool all the staff are polite and well informed The cloud bar is superb with great views and a relaxed vibe the hotel is just a nice place to hang about Didn t expect to be eating at the hotel but the evening food lured us in on our way out so we succumbed and it was fabulous with a good choice We had opted to include breakfast though and it was delicious with something for everyone very glad we did Spot on and we will definitely use it again 
180775,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Great place room was excellent fairly small room but to be expected Great technology which let us control music lighting temperature etc Bar open 24 hours and very pleasant d cor facilities throughout Bed very comfortable and no noise 
180776,citizenM Tower of London, Breakfast could have different menus on different days or alternate days , Cozy rooms and the facilities provided were excellent No hassles in check In or check out Exclusive luggage room 
180777,citizenM Tower of London, The breakfast spread was the same for the 3 days that I stayed there Can t say that as a problem But if you are a foodie you would love to venture out more , The hotel is just next to Tower Hill Underground tube station hence traveling was very easy The room was very clean well organized which was just very accurate for business travel It was a room controlled by Internet of things IoT So you have an iPad in the room by which you control everything the lights TV blinds temperature The staff very friendly helpful The croissant was so delicious soft like cotton candy D I would certainly stay there if I visit London again 
180778,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Wow As a very regular traveller I m rarely positively surprised by a hotel This hotel has come up with a new formula Very modern automated check in room controls with an ipad very efficient and high quality The rooms are small yet fully equipped Perfect for a business traveller Excellent value for money especially in super expensive London 
180779,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing Everything was 10 10 , The bed was absolutely comfortable The view from the room was outstanding amazing And the food and drinks were lovely 
180780,citizenM Tower of London, The cost of drinks and food the lack of welcome and the very confusing signage that does not lead to where it purports to This is not a hotel to stay at if you expect staff to help you check in or out, Location and the modern feeling of the hotel
180781,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Fantastic view from the top floor bar Rooms small but very practical and tidy I was also lucky to have great view towards The Tower Breakfast excellent and the lobby very cosy place just to hang out 
180782,citizenM Tower of London, I would like more vegetables to be added to the breakfast , Everything was great as far as a hotel is considered but most of all the ambience of the hotel was very special Very close to the tube station 
180783,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, The cool desgin and smart solutions of the room and the location is superb The staff was very friendly and helpfull I can definitely recommend this hotel 
180784,citizenM Tower of London, Room size a bit small but had everything needed, Excellent location next to Tower Hill tube station Room 333 with a view of the Tower of London Extra comfy bed fluffy pillows and towels top cleanliness Will come back Love it 
180785,citizenM Tower of London, Checkin was accomplished with a smile however self checkin was not possible as the data held was incorrect no cost for the room entered and took 15minutes to resolve Following that the first 2 key cards failed to open the assigned room door This was resolved by selecting a another room Consequently I was late for my meeting in the west end , Having an express service coffee shop can be regarded as a bonus as I wasn t forced to over eat in an over priced restaurant for a buffet breakfast 
180786,citizenM Tower of London, The iPad to control lights and media is great and handy but even when switched off it keeps lighting up in the middle of the night lighting up the entire room and waking us up We ended up by covering it with a scarf each night but there should be another solution especially given that summer visitors probably won t have a scarf Also we were on the first floor and there was a slight but noticeable rumble from the underground until midnight and very early in the morning so people who are sensitive to noise and spend a lot of time in their room should probably ask for a room higher up in the building , Modern rooms with huge bed funky lights and easy to control lights and media Quiet rooms and corridors the hotel is perfectly located right next to district and circle lines The hotel staff is friendly helpful and overall nice The buffet breakfast offers an excellent choice Nice comfy decor with books literally everywhere makes you feel like home and there is always something to read at hand 
180787,citizenM Tower of London, Unfortunately didnt have a view of Tower of London but a side view , Great room and very comfy bed The ipad control of the room and free movies to stream was excellent Lovely staff too Excellent location 
180788,citizenM Tower of London, Room Airconditoning doesn t turn off and it really dried out myself and partner over the 3 days and partner now has a really poor chest Dry skin and eyes for the duration Take plenty of moisturiser, Location
180789,citizenM Tower of London, Although the room is full with good facilities but is very small and makes it hard to move especially if you are staying as two with a child Also there are a lot of great facilities but missing basic stuff like a kettle and cups to make some tea or coffee , The hotel is new modern clean and price is convenient Great location next to Tower of London and above a train station which makes it easily accessible Next to the hotel there is a great parking space which is only 2 pounds to leave it from 7pm till 6am and also on weekends in general the price to keep the whole day is only 28 during week days Huge bed one of the biggest great for couples 
180790,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, The bed is a large Emperor size perfect to have enough room to stretch out if need be The size of the room and the facilities included are effectively used and made you feel comfortable and not cramped The addition of an iPad to control all aspects of lighting and tv was an added bonus We also told the hotel it was our 7 year anniversary celebration when hearing this they left free drink vouchers for the bar on the 7th floor of the hotel It was a lovely surprise to find when we entered the room and certainly fantastic for the staff to have remembered when I initially booked If you do stay here please go and visit the bar at the 7th Floor the view of the Tower of London Tower Bridge and the Shard are spectacular 
180791,citizenM Tower of London, Room was small but you soon get used to it , Location was super hotel right beside tower hill underground station and the views from the bar at night are breathtaking Comfy beds and wonderful shower 2 necessities for weary travellers and after all the sight seeing Loved the use of the ipad in the rooms to control lighting heating and even the opening and closing of the blinds Safe provided in the room Complimentary bottles of water in room each day stored in your very own fridge Staff very helpful friendly 
180792,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, The room is really quite comfortable and hi tech You can control everything from an iPad the lights of the room the shower the TV On the TV you can find a selection of movies most of them really recent and if you don t like movies you can listen to the radio or read a book Just a word amazing 
180793,citizenM Tower of London, There was a pad to be used for the TV the lights A C and more A little to high tech for me and caused a lot of stuggle I did not ask for a room with a view and I certainly did not get one I just saw a brick wall a few feet from my window 106 , Perfect location by the Tower of London Surpisingly quiet in the room slept well Very close to Tower Hill underground station 
180794,citizenM Tower of London, Our room seemed to be missing some complimentary toiletries , The rooms at CitizenM are compact but perfectly designed with all that you need for a short stay We picked a room with a breathtaking view of the Tower of London The communal areas are also beautifully designed and the bar on the top floor was simply perfect 
180795,citizenM Tower of London, They didn t sweep and mop the floor in room at all during our stay there We saw a trail from shoes still on floor for days Sometime they didn t empty the trash bin as well They didn t clean sink area as well and all the glasses We supposed to get water refilled every day but it didn t happen Sometime we got refill sometime we didn t They only tidied up the bed but didn t really clean it Luckily we are not the type of people who like to eat on bed or messy , Their location is superb Next to Tower Hill Station It was easy to go around with tube from that station because it was not too crowded on rush hour We could leave our baggage while we traveled to Scotland for 3 days A plus point Front office staffs were helpful and friendly IT staff also worked fast to solve the problem with the ipad in our room The view is nice if you can get Tower of London view or Trinity Square It was easy to get breakfast around also for other meals We went to Tower of London area to have breakfast by the riverside Bought something before and sat on one of the benches 
180796,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Extremely clean and a fantastic location Yes the room is small however it s typical CitizenM so every inch cm is used correctly which makes it feel spacious WiFi is fantastically fast rooms are quite and the typical funky CitizenM vibe tablet control of room colour lighting bed against the window etc Friendly staff quality of the food is good and the view from the 7th floor bar breathtaking If you are traveling as a couple and you are the types that like their privacy whilst using the bathroom this hotel is not for you Because everything is quite open and the curtain doesn t offer that much BUT given everything else This hotel is a must go when in London 
180797,citizenM Tower of London, Please see other comment, The room was very clean but I felt very clostophobic because of the position of the bed and there was no access to a window as I like fresh air I can understand why there were two automatic blinds because of the close proximity of other Windows The lights from these were very bright and I couldn t get to sleep easily The TV channels were all over the place and as we are in England I d expext to get the main channels easily instead I had to continuously click through to get past other foreign channels The pillows were also really uncomfortable but you can t please everyone I also felt like I was in a self service hotel as I had to check myself in and out I I never saw or spoke to one member of staff the whole time I was there which some people might like but I would have liked some contact 
180798,citizenM Tower of London, There was no kettle for making tea or boiling water This is a very basic necessity in any hotel whatsoever Everytime i had to go down to the bar to fetch some hot water which was inconvenient and also risky to carry boiling water in lift and then take it to room for making tea The hotel provides a 24 7 bar and expects us to purchase something as basic as tea for 5 pounds not done , Bed was good Entire room controlled by iPad Room was decent 
180799,citizenM Tower of London, The large porn selection also controlled from the iPad , Nice contemporary feel Great view from the room of Tower Bridge TV lights mood lighting blinds all controlled from the room s iPad 
180800,citizenM Tower of London, Airplay through my phone didn t work as expected There was what seemed like a nail on the shower floor Most probably from the previous guest and I guess too small to spot at first sight by the cleaning team , Loved the location and facilities in this hotel I was in love with the decor of the lobby and the cafe area Once I entered the room loved that the iPad and the TV screen welcomed me with my name written on them It s all in the small details The room was decent sized with a huge bed next to the window which had views to the Tower of London No matter day or night the views from the window were amazing WiFi was also fast and reliable and available throughout the whole building Overall a really nice experience in a citizenM hotel and would definitely stay in another one next time 
180801,citizenM Tower of London, The room is a little small , The facilities are extremely modern and totally monitored by iPad Check in and out are totally intelligent and smart The bars and lough are great The location is exactly on the top of the station and opposite to the London Tower The bed is large 
180802,citizenM Tower of London, The room was very small Big enough if you re staying for a weekend but maybe a tad too small for longer trips The bathroom is somehow a room within the room with no real walls just some matte plastic walls so everything you do in the bathroom is heard in the room loud and clear , The entire room was very high tech There is a tablet that helps you control everything lights curtains drapes TV heating and so on It is very practical The bed was very comfortable as well and very very big maybe 2m x 2m There is a safe for your valuables Free bottled water is included in the room The hotel was very quiet The hotel is conveniently located at the Tower Hill tube station very easy to reach and in a quiet part of London 
180803,citizenM Tower of London, the room is quite cramped and it took me 10 minutes to figure out how to shut the blinds using the iPad the battery on the iPad was poor so you had to leave it in the holster and it was quite buggy, the view was great check in was easy and the bar on the top floor is cool
180804,citizenM Tower of London, I should have booked to stay longer , Everything about this hotel was superb I had good expectations prior to arrival but even those were exceeded in terms of location service staff attentiveness great wifi throughout the hotel looks fantastic from top to bottom room was comfortable what I would call fully functional and efficient use of space without being grandiose little touches like free water in the fridge replaced daily room completely left like new on 2nd day personalised touches safe for valuables and last but not least the views All the staff I encountered were fantastic you are properly looked after here Now I m a signed up member and will definitely be back here 
180805,citizenM Tower of London, Self check in at computers but then lots of staff milling about seemingly doing nothing a strange set up I had informed them we were there for my partner s 30th and was a bit disappointed they did nothing to acknowledge this In my experience in this situation establishments usually go the extra mile , Excellent cocktails at both bars Amazing views from the 7th floor bar 
180806,citizenM Tower of London, Would have been better to have an iron available in the room and or an ironing room on the same floor, Fantastic location right next to Tower Hill tube with great views of the Tower of London Great lobby area cafe and bar Small but functional rooms excellent value for money Enjoyed the apple TV and movies available Quiet and well insulated rooms with black out curtains 
180807,citizenM Tower of London, Bit naff Staff in the cafe really noisy so I had to move somewhere else to hear myself think Only disposable cups and plates in the front cafe iPad in the room didn t work very well flat and failed to charge overnight Also really bright if checked it in the middle of the night Coloured light in rooms unpleasant and almost nausea inducing in the shower Check out computers were broken but staff came to rescue quickly Check in card is bag tag also advertising gimmick but doesn t have room number on it so you have to carry the little piece of paper around too which is easily lost Due to lack of windows that could be opened in room ventilation fans very loud though this is common to lots of newer hotels I would be interested to see how its carbon footprint compared to other hotels with fewer buttons , Lovely bar and workspace upstairs with nice staff and great views Great black out curtains in rooms Clear instructions on how to work things in room needed for overly complicated lighting system Nice big comfortable bed 
180808,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, The location was great and the hotel was gorgeous I will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and stay here again The beds are so comfy and the staff are so friendly The hotel is right beside the underground so it s ideal for getting around the city 
180809,citizenM Tower of London, IPad used to control room settings lights TV etc not holding a charge and therefore not working Not replaced despite three calls to service staff No tea coffee in room and no room service , Great views from room and hotel bar Very clean room Very comfortable bed and great shower Fantastic location and excellent bar and reception area 
180810,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, The staff is absolutely the best They always seemed to be in a good mood energetic and ready to help This was especially remarkable since they are mostly very young working at a trendy place and I somehow expected them to behave a bit snobbish towards us a definitely uncool couple None of that happened On the contrary they went out of their way to make us feel comfortable allowing us to enjoy a memorable experience Thanks for that guys 
180811,citizenM Tower of London, Can t think of anything except for the price of the food Great experience overall , Great concept hotel with a modern theme Their decor is great Rooms were plenty spacious very decent size for London standards Beds were big and very comfortable Steps from the Tower Hill tube station Very convenient Food prices were a little high but we went out to a Pub called Minories less than a 5 min walk from it that served delicious breakfast for 4 pounds and had a great menu The hotel had a great view from the roof bar and very helpful and friendly staff 
180812,citizenM Tower of London, I accidentally double booked for three nights non refundable and the manager would not offer a refund even though it was clearly a mistake I contacted them through an intermediary the next business day but the manager said that contact needed to have been made within 24 hours , The location is very convenient for the Tower area and the views of the Tower of London are spectacular The rooms are unique functional and well thought out The top floor lounge is welcoming and fun and its outside views of the Tower of London and the Tower Bridge are unbeatable 
180813,citizenM Tower of London, Rooms are very small and compact I m not a fan of bathroom in the same room, The location of the hotel is really nice Close to Tower Bridge Really modern is the ground floor with several places where to sit down and relax and the bar kitchen I liked the self check in procedure at the desktop Rooms are controlled via ipad to move blinds adjust the lights turn on tv View was amazing see picture attached Staff is very young smiley and easy going 
180814,citizenM Tower of London, The room size very small and not matching with the size mention on the booking com Hotel is more suitable for business trip, Amazing Hotel Staff so friendly Hotel very clean Perfect location 
180815,citizenM Tower of London, The room size very small and not matching with the size mention on the booking com Hotel is more suitable for business trip, Amazing Hotel Staff so friendly Hotel very clean Perfect location 
180816,citizenM Tower of London, Room was a bit dirty with hairs and dust from other people not nice , Breakfast selection was good but space in the restaurant seating area was limited Comfortable bed and good soundproofing 
180817,citizenM Tower of London, The iPad in our room was not charging so we had difficulty controlling the temperature in the room Prices of drinks very steep even for London standards , Location location location Awesome Staff super friendly Comfy bed and great rain shower Next to underground station

180819,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, I liked the modern atmosphere and the spacious interiors on the ground floor including a bar and a coffee bar The 7th floor bar was amazing and they made refreshing drinks The room was specially well designed and the bed was comfortable 
180820,citizenM Tower of London, I mean I don t enjoy having to spend so much on a hotel room 250 quid for a double room for two nights but it was seriously reasonable for central London especially on a weekend Besides if I had booked a cheaper place outside of the city centre I would have probably spent just as much money on public transport and wasted time coming in and out of town So I m not complaining , I absolutely loved this place Will definitely stay here again when I m next in town The rooms may be small but I lived in HK for five years so it seemed spacious to me The view of the Tower of London was insane Literally a stone s throw from the hotel This hotel is super quirky the staff are lovely can t do enough for you and the location is just so good It s for real next to the tube stop there are loads of buses but so many LDN attractions and places of interest are walkable including Tower Bridge and Borough Market 
180821,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing to complain about, Breakfast was delicious best sausages I have had in a hotel Very close to the tube literally next door 24 hour food so always something there if you are hungry or thirsty Staff very friendly and helpful Would definitely stay there again 
180822,citizenM Tower of London, Extra water would be good Maybe it s just me but I did find the tv layout a little confusing Didn t seem to have all the channels , The size and comfort of the bed was perfect I love the simplicity of the room 
180823,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Everything As it was my partners birthday I d requested to have the best room with a view of the Tower of London it didn t disappoint Amazing stay Will check out the other Citizen M hotels soon
180824,citizenM Tower of London, Husband had to climb over me to get in and out of bed as only one side has access , Room very quirky We had a terrific view looking at the Tower London from the 4th floor Bed fitted across the whole width of the room under the window Huge bed comfy pillows Movies on TV free latest ones available Felt like we were camping in a huge motorhome but without the kitchen although their was a mini fridge in room which was perfect for us Controls in room managed by an iPad which was provided It regulated temp and gained access to all the tv channels Shower was wonderful choice of waterfall or hand held wand Would stay again 
180825,citizenM Tower of London, I m not a fan of hard floors in bedrooms although I do appreciate it make it easier to clean can we have some slippers to make it softer when walking around Also an iron in the room just makes life easier in fairness I may have been able to order this from an Ambassador but didn t check The room was fine for me as a lone traveller but i m sure it s a bit snug for 2 people and going to the loo in the night must be a pain for whoever is at the window side Small issues really I did have a great stay , The funky lighting and ipad controls were easy and fun The staff were friendly and helpful thanks especially for finding the ring that I left in my room when I returned later in the day they were able to reunite me with it in minutes thank you so much The space is interesting and comfortable and easy to use whether you re there for business or pleasure The views from the bar were great over the Shard and the Tower of London etc although the drinks are pricey 12 is a shock for a cocktail for a girl from Leeds The evening coffee however felt like a bargain at 2 50 and was lovely Having Tower Hill tube station underneath the hotel meant that travelling around is just that bit easier A great stay I d definitely recommend 
180826,citizenM Tower of London, Better description of the view type although this was readily explained at check in, Best breakfast ever had in a uk hotel Very large very comfortable bed decent shower Great views from the bar area over London Too be honest I was expecting a soulless building operated by machines iPads What we experienced was a warm friendly welcoming family atmosphere with refreshments available 24 7 Will definitely return recommend 
180827,citizenM Tower of London, I would prefer a bit richer breakfast that the varities were a bit limited I would rather have the breakfast outside next time , Very cozy and cool atmosphere smart architecture great coffee warm staff More like a lounge so you don t feel the coldness of a hotel 
180828,citizenM Tower of London, Sink outside the bathroom in main bedroom was a bit inconvenient , Interesting friendly amazing 7th floor bar cafe comfortable seating areas Fab views easy to get around esp as right on Tower Hill station Rooms are compact but huge beds and spotlessly clean 
180829,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, For the 40 discount price I paid of about 155 it was a good hotel but definitely not worth the 260 list price It s fancy beautiful quiet clean very good large bed nice coffee bar good Wi Fi top location 
180830,citizenM Tower of London, The choice of breakfast needs some variety for guests who stay more than 1night Also would like to see a lite bites or a la carte menu available, The bed size was excellent and was extremely comfortable The smart home feature was also quite enjoyable and convient
180831,citizenM Tower of London, The room was too small The service was disappointing Although I told the staff before that my partner relies on gluten free breakfast there was none on the second morning , The double bed itself was great but one had to climb over the partner to enter or leave the bed The location is great right beside the Tower 
180832,citizenM Tower of London, the sheets had a stain and have not been changed my fault I didn t noticed it but the cleaning staff had to see it and replace the sheets hope they ll have more attention in the future , kind staff great position good breakfast and lovely view from the bar at the 7th floor

180834,citizenM Tower of London, room is smaller than it looks in the pictures and what is written breakfast could be richer in kind, Location is very convenient very close to financial area Underground station is just by the hotel entrace Easy to reach to Canary Wharf 
180835,citizenM Tower of London, One very small drawback is that the bathroom sink was outside the toilet shower cubicle however this would not stop us from going back to this hotel , The staff were exceptionally helpful we asked for extra pillows and help with getting TV to work and both issues dealt with within minutes We were there to celebrate a 60th birthday and we were given a room upgrade plus a free drink for both of us Room was good with views towards Tower of London and Tower Bridge Bed very very comfy and clean 
180836,citizenM Tower of London, Check out time could be 12 am as in majority of the hotels worldwide not 11 AM The standard rooms are not very spacious but hotel s location just by The Towers and just above the subway station compensates that The bed is comfy but only one person had the direct access to it , Great central location great interior design especially common spaces The standard rooms are not very spacious but hotel s location just by The Towers and just above the subway station compensates that Very nice roof top terrace and bar with superb view on The Towers and The Shard 
180837,citizenM Tower of London, While the location was great for that area and literally right next to a Tube station it was a bit of a pain to get to Westminster Southbank area Not really anything to worry about though , Staff were excellent the decor was brilliant and just the little touches like all the wording of the text around the room was brilliant Thanks for a great stay 
180838,citizenM Tower of London, Tea coffee making facilities not provided in room So if you fancy tea coffee in bed you have to go to reception in PJ s None are complimentary Staying guests should have free tea coffee vouchers or credits on your room , Very handy for the station No reception just log in screens help is offered 24hr food Great compact room with huge bed Welcoming lounge area Free WiFi free use of iMac Finding a corner to chill is easy 
180839,citizenM Tower of London, Can t think of anything, Staff were very friendly and helpful on check in Room was spotless and well equipped Loved the blackout blind and fluffy pillows Breakfast was varied and delicious excellent coffee
180840,citizenM Tower of London, It would have been nice to have Tea Coffee Making Facilities in the Room Also it did state in the Hotel Brochure that the Sky Sports channels we available to watch when in fact they were not , The Hotel was amazing will definitely stay there again 
180841,citizenM Tower of London, saw a rat running through the lobby which was a tad offputting I understand the hotel is above the tube station but never great seeing a rodent in a hotel you re staying at, the d cor is super funky and on trend Loved loved loved the roof terrace bar beautiful panoramic views across to the Tower of London And the rooms were ultra modern and techy brilliant choice of free movies too 
180842,citizenM Tower of London, but a little slow room was hot and AC control didn t work though plentiful breakfast is a bit overpriced check in may be a little confusing without staff to help you out, Close to tube station room is well equipped problem with key was solved in an adequately manner staff is friendly and helpful 
180843,citizenM Tower of London, Difficult to say they ve put a lot of effort into every space It s a nice place to visit , ber funky to the point of trying too much But I like it 
180844,citizenM Tower of London, The only thing missing was the ability to make a cup of tea in our room , Amazing location brilliantly designed hotel Friendly staff Relaxed public areas 
180845,citizenM Tower of London, The electric curtain wouldn t close on the first night for some reason so we had a bad nights sleep due to the morning light coming in to the room On the second night it suddenly started working , Everything except the curtains

180848,citizenM Tower of London, The room was incredibly small particularly for two people sharing Would recommend for a single traveller The website suggests free coffee as none in the rooms but that is apparently only if you buy breakfast, Very cool stylish well designed hotel with first class facilities Excellent location and 24 hour cafe
180849,citizenM Tower of London, Room could have been a bit bigger Sauna would be a great addition The card controlled lifts were annoying , Super cool and stylish design hotel The MoodPad and wifi were great Amazing showers Good choice of food 
180850,citizenM Tower of London, Very clean on arrival but unfortunately the housekeeping did not bother cleaning on the 2nd day of my stay which I thought was odd , Excellent customer service provided by some of staff who are sincerely passionate and proud about their work You can tell this is a good place to work and hence a great place to be as a guest Compliments and many thanks especially to the ladies at the barista machine on the morning of 13 03 2017 and Jessica and Emmanuel Look after these guys because they will look after your guests In general I love the genuinity of the hotel and the funky style the room the fantastic view and the CloudM on 7th floor On of the best hotels in London and not just one of those mainstream boring hotels 
180851,citizenM Tower of London, Check in was very slow Could not do it through the machine Took 5 mins plus to check in , Huge comfortable bed in tiny room Very good pillows Great ventilation and technology in room Like the happening lobby 
180852,citizenM Tower of London, wished the bar had food options, Brilliant location very comfy bed fantastic helpful staff location is fantastic proximity to tower hill tube a huge bonus
180853,citizenM Tower of London, Breakfast The selection was very limited Room size Even though rooms are modern design they are very tight i e the room width is of a bed width bathroom is basically a plastic box fit into the room Sink is located in the living area In essence it s a very modern economy hotel which offers a good value for the buck However I was mislead by booking com 4 rating The hotel isn t rated by any official hotel rating agency and is definitely not a 4 hotel , Lobby It s so beautiful and spacious Everyday I would come down to the lobby to chill out for an hour in there Location Could not be better for a tourist Porn and all the latest Hollywood movies free of charge 
180854,citizenM Tower of London, Rooms are on a smaller side but ergonomically designed , Brand new hotel Excellent location with easy access by subway Nice lobby with a bar Excellent bar on the top floor with a panoramic view of the city Very comfortable bed 
180855,citizenM Tower of London, NOTHING Loved EVERYTHING , One night was not enough We had such a long flight so we were hoping to check in early The staff was really lovely and kind and was able to get us in a room they knew we were exhausted I still can t get over how kind everyone was They location is like a 50 out of a 10 close to the tube view of Tower Bridge the Shard and Tower of London What more do you want We loved the bar with the balcony looking out on the Tower of London and all the choices of food and coffee downstairs and of course the decor 
180856,citizenM Tower of London, The blind in my room was broken so I couldn t open it otherwise its fine but I am getting tired of the controls in the hotel Maybe I m too old but I prefer a light switch , its very predictable and always the same I love this hotel
180857,citizenM Tower of London, The price of breakfast was a little steep per person but it is London so , The bed was Massive and so comfy the staff pleasant and always available to help at check in desks The view was amazing The imbuilt smart features were excellent and made it feel awesome
180858,citizenM Tower of London, Cut too many corners No view No tea or coffee in rooms or option of getting a coffee at no extra cost downstairs in the lobby No opening window Expensive for what it was , Great location comfy bed very quiet modern and clean Bar is fab Very happy and helpful staff
180859,citizenM Tower of London, I would have thought 170 a night breakfast would have been included Not enough tables had to have breakfast on a sofa Would have preferred to of had the hot food cooked to order , Good choice 
180860,citizenM Tower of London, Not a huge amount of space in the room if you have a big suitcase to unpack but with that view of London who cares , Location is exciting Views of the Tower of London Tower Bridge and The Shard from the funky 7th floor bar private to guests is priceless Our room with the tower bridge view took my breath away worth every penny Quiet location at night Staff were cheerful friendly and always on hand I had a problem with the room door and whilst it was swiftly attended to by Flavio and the team I was given a complementary glass of wine This felt like 5 star service I have booked to go back 
180861,citizenM Tower of London, Maybe some tea or coffee in the room , The d cor the tongue in cheek humour of the place the friendliness of the staff relaxed but professional ambience location quiet lighting and superb views from the 7th floor bar Comfort Fab shower Plethora of books
180862,citizenM Tower of London, I couldn t book through the CitizenM site and had to go through bookings com, Interactive spirit of the setup of common areas and the bar on the 7th floor 
180863,citizenM Tower of London, Attitude of the bar staff lack of flexibility about food in the top bar the bathroom pod design , The design was superb very cool very modern with awesome break out areas lounges bars and hanging out space Highly impressive decor and design led hotel 
180864,citizenM Tower of London, As some room functions such as heating were apparently controlled by an iPad supplied it would certainly have helped to have the said iPad functioning but sadly it s battery was flat and the charging port was broken Clearly maintenance of rooms is not sufficiently thorough Rooms are too small for both you and your suitcase , Interesting lobby area self check in and check out 
180865,citizenM Tower of London, nothing, the place is perfect Social spaces are excellent rooms are small but very well organized Bed is so big and smart room is great If you loved to go hostel by hostel when you were 20s now that you re 30s 40s this is the place you would love 
180866,citizenM Tower of London, The size of the room could have been better Unfortunately these are just those 50 sq ft too small , I liked just about everything Great new Dutch hotel concept The location is rather ideal if you want to be close to the City and still have one of London s best views from the lounge bar on the 7th floor towards the Tower and the Thames 5 or 6 stops away from Embankment st from where you have everything within reach You do not have to walk more than 25 meters coming out from Tower Hill tube st then you enter the hotel Excellent When you get inside some very cool young people will quickly approach you taking you to a round table with a set of screens giving you an Apple Store feel for customer service and a choice of rooms Excellent When you come down after putting your luggage aside you sit in a livingroom kind of combo foyer coffee bar restaurant sofa area with a good number of Apple iMac s at your disposal And space And colours inside as outside Excellent The ambience in the combo foyer is like in the 7th floor bar you can feel that people like to be there Food and drinks are good And what was it about the price it is clearly cheaper than any other high quality choice you can think of in the vicinity Excellent You will be a big question mark when you see the room as the bed seems to be almost up in the window until you get a feel for that the upholstery at the bed makes it possibly for you to lie in bed and look out on the Thames Shard scenery Good thinking very unorthodox but it works 
180867,citizenM Tower of London, i could not sleep at all since every time someone in the rooms next to me flashed the toilets in his or her room i have heard it strongly at my room at all times for that reason only i would strongly consider if to recommend to stay at the hotel, the location and the facilities of the hotel thegood breakfast and theyoung and nice staff i liked the smart room options and the free wifi and movies and the design of the room and the hotel and the use of sense of humor at the design of the room pillows liquid soap 
180868,citizenM Tower of London, I missed making a cuppa in my room but understand why the canteen is always open , Enjoyed the experience of this whacky hotel it s practical colourful fun spotless great room and shower amazing coffee and just a few steps from the tube 
180869,citizenM Tower of London, Room size quite small Bathroom in the middle of the room Uncomfortable Bathroom, Design Atmosphere of the Lobby Check in informal postations Concept of the Room View of the Room on Tower of London
180870,citizenM Tower of London, Bed only accessible from one side is a deal breaker if you are not travelling solo, Loved the public spaces bar and on site cafe Super white fluffy towels and great views of the Shard Brilliant location right at Tower Bridge station and very quiet rooms 
180871,citizenM Tower of London, The iPad in my room wasn t charging and kept returning to the start screen I forgot to let the staff know , The team were really helpful and friendly 
180872,citizenM Tower of London, The public toilets in the basement are being renovated and are hard to access , Great bar on the top floor and lively on the ground floor in the restaurant cafe living area Staff very helpful and rooms have all you need 
180873,citizenM Tower of London, Overall a pleasant experience , Location location location Also in general I really tend to appreciate the funky sense of style of M Citizen hotels making them different from your typical run of the mill hotel experience The croissants and coffee for breakfast were quite enjoyable although price seemed a bit on the high side 
180874,citizenM Tower of London, The hotel is very modern Yes it is a quality but it also makes the room less warm or cosy A little too futuristic which reduces the feel home feeling , The location is great Nice and safe area with good access to the metro Room is confortable and there is a selection of movie offer by the hotel direction on the room TV
180875,citizenM Tower of London, Added breakfast charge could have been better value but never the less the food was good, Attention to the small details cleanliness and very updated facilities made this hotel a pleasure to stay
180876,citizenM Tower of London, Quirky or not the hotel is very expensive for the size of room They are tiny Beware the hotel uses a third party payment processor for incidentals and American Express suspected the transaction was fraudulent It doesn t say CitizenM on the the statement it says Ayden Recurring so I had to spend time on the phone to Amex to agree that the payments actually were for Citizen M , Quirky Hotel with a funky vibe The public areas are great to chill out in during the day and the bar has a lot of atmosphere in the evening The rooms are very small and the very comfy bed takes up half the room I love the TV and lighting controls using the supplied iPad mini Good rain forest shower 
180877,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Extremely good location just opposite Tower of London As always i Citizen Ms super comfy bed and high tech room equipment very nice and helpfull staff
180878,citizenM Tower of London, small room made me feel like I was in a ship cabin the breakfast though is was very good it was very expensive , comfortable and very nice decorated lobby friendly helpful staff hi tech facilities comfortable and very big bed 
180879,citizenM Tower of London, Tiny room but very well organised thus very comfortable , Very modern hotel with in no way trivial approach to any matter I liked moody signs on different items in the room Good breakfast Possibility to have lunch or dinner for a reasonable price Excellent location next door to the tube station Very nice and helpful staff I got the room with a fantastic view to the Tower of London 
180880,citizenM Tower of London, iPad lost its charge very quickly which made it difficult to change lighting heating blinds tv after about 10 minutes , Fabulously comfortable bed amazing shower Quirky hotel not dull and boring in the slightest 
180881,citizenM Tower of London, The room was tiny the bed actually rested on 3 walls so would have to climb over my wife to use the bathroom then family stayed for one of the nights and there room was twice the size even had a wardrobe and sofa and I booked both rooms same price and we was on same floor so wasn t impressed and hotel couldn t understand the difference if we had there room we would go back, Excellent location Excellent bar in 7 th floor with spectacular views friendly staff great choice for breakfast

180887,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing, Unbelievable view of the best parts of London The full room length window situated next to the very spacious bed was a unique and enjoyable experience It was my partners Birthday and they even presented us with a surprise special treat to help us celebrate The rooms were a good size and the interactive room system was a cool feature that complimented the modern styling The bar on the top floor had fantastic views the ambience was relaxed and the d cor was homely yet modern Bar staff were friendly and attentive helping us choose some funky cocktails that only added to the experience All round the hotel was excellent you couldn t ask for anymore and all within the best location in London

180889,citizenM Tower of London, The lighting in the room was trying too hard I would have liked a reading light by the side of the bed so as to not disturb my partner while he was sleeping The available desk light that was on a separate switch was too far from the bed , The lobby was spacious allowing for separate gatherings and plenty of room to spread out Not stuffy 
180890,citizenM Tower of London, For two people the rooms might be a tight fit however the public spaces in that hotel are like a big comfy living room , Its a great funky hotel I loved the decor the books everywhere the art The ambassadors were really friendly and helpful Cool roof top bar

180990,citizenM Tower of London, Having booked 3 rooms I would have liked the ability to check all three in one go and pay for them in one go it felt a bit silly to go round the self check in booths three times and do three transactions This was technology for tech s sake rather than to make life easier Lift was a bit temperamental with the cards I could not work out how to light the bathroom only in the night it would have been nice to have had an actual light switch to control just the bathroom as opposed to lighting the whole room or coming to grips with the tablet settings I also wanted to switch off the tablet in the night but could not so I put it face down with the result that it was out of charge in the morning Would have welcome more toiletries in the room such as hair conditioner The shower gel was good but it could have felt a bit more luxurious I guess more in keeping with the vibe in the rest of the hotel Don t get me wrong we did enjoy our stay these are niggles rather than big things it s just that on the whole I felt that the technology focus was trying too hard and that the rooms could feel a bit less functional , Superb rooftop bar with amazing views of London and good selection of drinks and cocktails with friendly staff prices not cheap but it is worth it Good breakfast buffet with cold meats yogurts fruit juice pastries bread great jams and cooked selection Hot drinks took a while to arrive but you get free refills until 11 Really nice decor stylish and trendy very spacious common spaces And free wifi and movies in room good TV screen Bed is big and comfortable Good shower with a choice of hand held or fixed head hairdryer in the room free bottled water in the room The location is excellent for exploring the Tower Tower Bridge and the City

181011,citizenM Tower of London, The check in and out process and the system Didn t work three times credit card declined yet when I checked with my bank the charge had been approved three times Not dishonest just poor technology implementation The bed is difficult for two to share as it spans the full width of the room so someone would have to climb over their partner to get out if sharing the bed I was alone but a friend and his wife likened it to caravanning Not a good idea , Breakfast wonderful bath towels view of the Tower of London Meeting Rooms 
181012,citizenM Tower of London, Room was very small akin to an easyhotel room but trying to appear not so basic Bed squashed end to end across the room wasn t great and the duvet was far too warm I normally want a warm duvet but this was ridiculous I d take the duvet off to cool down and in less than 10 minutes be too cold and the cycle would repeat so I didn t get much sleep very very disappointing as with all the hipstery bells and whistles that make this a funky hotel there s no point to any of that if you can t provide the basic requirement of a good nights sleep , Room gadgetry was very cool 
181013,citizenM Tower of London, All was great Will definitely visit again, Great location super great staff really stylish hotel high tech comfortable room Recommended on all counts

181022,citizenM Tower of London, Seems that the rooms were designed to be twitted about but they left out some basics like a bathroom door that actually closes or an ability to open a window and let fresh air in Also they re very very small , Room control via iPad is cool international power outlets is a nice touch High quality breakfast and located right on a tube station 
181023,citizenM Tower of London, well appointed but the room was too small the change in price of the limited breakfast the 3rd morning so that the difference to the full breakfast was little it made not sense to get the limited breakfast Found that offensive in the middle of my commitment to you , The feel of the W but the rooms were much smaller
181024,citizenM Tower of London, The lifts in this new hotel seemed temperamental stopping randomly at other floors showing OUT OF SERVICE when they were clearly working , This new London option has an amazing reception and lounge area It is a perfect business or tourist location with a couple of USP s i e the terrace adjacent to the old Roman wall and the proximity to the Tower of London As with all Citizen M hotels the bedroom and facilities were clean and very comfortable I thoroughly recommend meeting friends here for a daytime drink at the wonderful bar or a coffee in the lounge areas which are perfect for meetings and to introduce them to the unique experience of these amazing art hotels

181027,citizenM Tower of London, 2 50 pound charge for using credit card make sure you read your email confirmation from them You have to prepay in order to avoid this surcharge Even if you use your debit card at check in it appears the fee is built into the final cost , Seems like they listened to consumer research and built a hotel addressing common complaints e g they offer 2 free bottled waters the bedding is all white with crisp sheets and fresh white towels no long queues at check in Bar on 7th floor with amazing views of Tower of London Another bar in the lobby Creative cocktails Snack bar in the lobby if you don t want to pay for a full breakfast I didn t eat dinner there but there was a nice buffet at night Amazing location right on top of the Tower Hill Tube station When you exit turn around and the hotel is right there Not sure if there was a gym but you can run around London Tower and across Tower Bridge Rooms are small but that s offset by great common areas

181038,citizenM Tower of London, The beds in all rooms are enclosed on three sides so the person furthest from the room has to climb over the other to get in and out The wash basin is in the room and the loo and shower behind a glass enclosure so if privacy is an issue you might think twice about booking this hotel I enjoyed my stay but would not book again unless the price was low enough that it tempted me from booking another hotel with more room space and greater toiletry privacy , Location Excellent for the tube Tower of London tower bridge and St Kathryn s dock Staff friendly and efficient check in easy and the hotel has good facilities

181106,citizenM Tower of London, See what I commented on on in likes No sandwiches available at 4 00 pm on Sat afternoon , Bed was great Apart from the fact you had to crawl over to the wall to get to your space And a bed side lamp so that I could read with the main light out would suit me The shower was good and the staff were very pleasant and helpful too The location was brilliant 
181107,citizenM Tower of London, The bed was against the wall which means that one of both has to disturb the other if he she wants to get out of the bed We also did not have any outside view from our room We did not really mind , The location so close to the tube station bus station Tower bridge Thames is fantastic The bar lounge is very nice and offers a wide selection of drinks and nice views At first the room seemed small but in fact everything we needed was there because they made optimal use of the space in the lay out of the room

181112,citizenM Tower of London, I did not like all the little add on charges and thought the breakfast option at 13 95 each plus an extra 2 if you had not already pre booked even if you wanted to pay cash was excessive Quote the rooms do not have awful coffee sachets but there is a constant supply of fresh coffee in the canteen coffee in sachets in the room is free Coffee in the canteen is not , New style hotel some things good others not 
181113,citizenM Tower of London, hotel staff no service e g no clearing of rubbish bin lack of refill of water bottles bed sheet very dirty unbelievable for a new hotel expensive breakfast menu very easy to find equal quality but cheaper food nearby e g Kitchen by the tower strange chopping noise at night which disturbs sleep Note the scary story that the hotel is located in the area where the british royalty used to behead prisoners of the tower of london, convenient location nice view of the tower of london but not all rooms have such view reasonable price for its location and room
181114,citizenM Tower of London, iPad only for lighting which was malfunctioning No concierge services at a travelers hotel , They need a master light switch in the room The little iPad that controls features of rooms would not turn on Window shades would go up and down We had to switch rooms Person working around terminals did not know how to spell Westminister Could not help us with any concierging The decor on main entry is good They could improve with master light switch somewhere other than on iPad Hotel would rate immediately higher They need a concierge or staff other than this gal working there who didn t know anything at all about Westminister how to even spell it a bit too ridiculous I liked the breakfast and again decor as they have something there But certain things did hit my nerves as mentioned above Cheers

181136,citizenM Tower of London, Some of the rooms have dismal views Don t pick a courtyard view room as it is just the atrium and other room doors you see The room lighting could be better stark white light or slightly nauseating mood lighting from inside the shower cubicle made me feel like I was playing Halflife in situ , Great beds The location is fantastic coffee s great and it has a cool feel to it that reflects London better than many other hotels in the area

181139,citizenM Tower of London, Bedrooms far too small for two adults Bed very comfortable but absurdly big and filling the end of the room completely so the far occupant has to clamber over the other one to get in or out our solution was to lie across the bed Miniature wash basin There is no proper restaurant only a self service with limited choice Some problems like running out of filter coffee which are perhaps just teething problems in a new hotel , Staff all willing and helpful

181212,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, A new concept to me very small bedroom but excellent lounges to work and hang The size of the BR put me off at first but after discovering the purpose of the lounges I quite liked my stay 
181213,citizenM Tower of London, iPad room controller was temperamental Felt like you were in a ship cabin Really needed a window to open A little clostrophobic , Efficient Great location The lobby area was lovely Disputes the room being small it was ok for this area as you want to explore London Not stay in 
181214,citizenM Tower of London, Would of been nice to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room, Bed and shower were amazing Loved the modern decor of the hotel and perfect location 
181215,citizenM Tower of London, Doona was too hot for sleeping Simple sheet blanket option preferred, Lounge area made feeling of home away from home Ironing room with steam iron made this boring task quick easy with less fuss than normal hotel 
181216,citizenM Tower of London, The mix of online check in and flustered staff leads to a lot of confusion The chances of a room with anything but a view of walls and windows are slim , Great location comfortable beds good facilities
181217,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Location then good quality bed shower and bath towel all key ingredients to an enjoyable overnight stay I also found the room tablet easy to operate

181221,citizenM Tower of London, Ridiculously small rooms Who was the genius who designed the hotel room like a prison cell , Outstanding staff Smiling welcoming true help The lobby is amazing in size and artworks inside
181222,citizenM Tower of London, I did not manage to operate air conditioning via provided iPad I could not even switch it off I read some other comments and I see I was not the only one So it was just too cold in the room , It is new reasonably located very modern with a nice view from the upper bar It is a few steps from the Tower Hill metro station what I found extremaly useful 
181223,citizenM Tower of London, Room a bit on the small size price of rooftop cocktails even though it was good , Location All electrics controlled by an I pad supplied Great cocktail bar on top floor spectacular views 
181224,citizenM Tower of London, Bed was a bit high to climb onto but otherwise very comfy , The location of hotel was superb and staff extremely happy and helpful The ipad in the room to control the tv curtain lighting was a novelty Loved the rain shower in the room and the ability to change the colour lights above the shower 
181225,citizenM Tower of London, Trying to get two of us ready in the bedroom to go out together Not sufficient room and complicated by having the sink outside the bathroom , New and funky hotel very friendly and helpful staff 
181226,citizenM Tower of London, No bar soap No coffee maker No ironing board Lobby music loud No toiletries available Bed touched 3 walls Tablet smart remote confusingly convoluted onto physical switches Tablet smart tv remote had bad latency Fluorescent bathroom ceiling,No Positive

181228,citizenM Tower of London, Good attempt to make the room space feel bigger than it actually is but still very small and claustrophobic for the price , Free film library and ipad control of all features of the room Very clean and classy lobby room and environment 
181229,citizenM Tower of London, THe iPad that controls the room would not hold a charge long and would not stay active or open when on the charger but that is an iPad issue not the hotel, The room is narrow but modern and fully automated unique set up Wonderful staff the bed was wonderful
181230,citizenM Tower of London, However it took ages for checking in and out due to the fault at the reception Clearly the computer system did not set out well enough to support the service but to slow it down and made it very complicated Some of the stuff at the bar are not very helpful I asked for a latte to go and it took her more than 5 minutes to figure out how to make one because she is all playing around with other stuff And the coffee was only filled by 1 3 of the cup Bit disappointing , Second time here Like everything about it The location the decoration the facility and etc
181231,citizenM Tower of London, No tea coffee in the room so if you need a coffee fix you have to visit the reception and only a luke warm shower on one morning , Fab relaxed modern hotel with really friendly staff and amazing views from the 7th 8th floor bar 
181232,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, We loved the quirky style of the hotel and its location The bar on the 7th floor has a great view of the Tower of London and the Tower Bridge The staff were friendly and helpful The room was comfortable and clean but ensure you know the person you re sharing with well as you will be in close proximity 
181233,citizenM Tower of London, When we did the self check in our cards didn t work so we had to go back down to the lobby twice to get it resolved which kind of defeated the object of the self check in this was the only hiccup , Bed was massive and view from room of tower of London was immense Brilliant location and superb stay 
181234,citizenM Tower of London, Small room Pricy for the room size , Excellent location just next to an underground station and with an excellent view on Tower of London Vey nice staff Very pleasant lobby Comfortable bed Free wifi 
181235,citizenM Tower of London, 2 Fire alarms in two nights stay IPad for steering the room did not work well Rooms much too small Not good value for money , Entrance and bar are nice modern 
181236,citizenM Tower of London, Useless water pressure you can t shower properly Don t believe their claims of power shower water emerges in a pathetic dribble that won t get you clean They claim to be luxury but really they re far from it They re functional modern cool design but cheap ikea type quality but a far cry from the luxury they claim , Aesthetic modern design gimmicky iPad control New hotel means everything is shiny and clean Location is awesome 
181237,citizenM Tower of London, A kettle would have been nice, Huge bed and room was operated by iPad mood lighting blinds huge choice of films to watch fridge amazing shower good quality towels safe shower gels and soap tissues and quirky furniture
181238,citizenM Tower of London, The room is tied not functioning well room service need improvement we had to ask them to refill tissue and toilet paper we had to change the room 2 times for 4 days stay one time for the room view was on the next building construction and second time because of AC problem , The location is great and the style of the hotel is nice and comfy 
181239,citizenM Tower of London, Cell like rooms did not appeal to us Difficult to get out of bed without disturbing your partner Impossible for two people to move around get dressed at the same time , Efficient friendly staff Great decor and ambience Nice bar food looked tasty although we didn t eat in Wonderful location part of Tower Hill tube 
181240,citizenM Tower of London, View from our room Instead of a room with nice view as was advertising on website so was a main reason for booking this hotel and we required for it in advance we ve got a view to wall of a new building under construction Not correct at all , Location of hotel nice and modern design
181241,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing could have been better , Everything was perfect top to bottom Definitely a hip vibe which fits London properly Open for only a month at the time this hotel has the Roman wall with Trajan s statue running along the rear Tower Hill Underground to one side London Tower at its doorstep The terrace on the 7th floor gives views of London Tower Tower Bridge The Shard The Gherkin The rooms are minimalist run by a provided iPad with chic decor The lobby 7th floor are the gathering places with really cool collections including the Number 10 Downing door to enter the club on the 7th floor The staff special mentions for Emmanuel Emma Harry are very welcoming and accommodating When we had trouble with a room outlet TV reception Emma accommodated immediately with a change of room rather than disturb us with a repair person She helped us with the luggage herself set things right within minutes including a special access room because she noticed my wife traveling with a cane The food offerings were available and fresh around the clock reasonably priced for the area Outstanding for the price 
181242,citizenM Tower of London, I usually have something that could be improved even if it s small to balance what I liked If I got a fabulous room and service I you usually do pay for it This time I thought the price was value for money for what i got , Perfect balance in services offered room location and price The room felt like a cocoon comfortable fresh zen like The hotel has areas where you can work or relax It felt like a team of designers and a psychologists got together to create a space where distractions ineffiiciencies are minimised so you can concentrate on what you want to do whether it is work or for relaxation Location excellent as the hotel is located above Tower station with a direct line from all of the major airports Heathrow Gatwick City and regional rail stations I don t like transferring on the tube with luggage bigger than a carry on I prefer to catch the tube over a taxi Room the rooms are small but the enormous bed I think it s bigger than a King and the large window more than makes up for it There is a desk but I would prefer to use the tables in the communal areas on the ground or top floor You get an iPad interface that operates the lights media movies Tv curtains and alarm Movie and wifi is included in the price Thoughtful design as you have lots of usb plugs power points around the desk and it was something I appreciated Large shower with rainfall fitting There is a self serve Ironing facility near the lift area which i did use I am often not too bothered about the view from my room as I prefer to be outside but the large window that I could easily open with the iPad interface made it easier to wake up which is handy if you are suffering from jetlag Coffee dining communal space i typically avoid hotel restaurants and the lobby but I used the cafe dining and tables in my short stay here These areas are decorate with interesting items which was energising but it wasn t too much to be distracting The meal area which in think operates 24 hrs was very handy flying in late and I didn t want to head out to look for something 
181243,citizenM Tower of London, The service is awful lots of employees don t speak english fluent and they don t know the prices of the food They are rude don t allow to drink even a coffee bought outside of their facilities One of the guys Harrisson seems to have psychological problems when treating with the guests he laughs and makes awkward comments constantly Also no one is very helpful they create trouble instead of solving them The bathroom is a semitransparent cabin with no sound isolation so the person outside in the room hears everything I would never come back , The bed is comfortable and the rooms are well equipped The furniture is nice and the decoration too Location is good and has a good access only a few steps from the metro station 
181244,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, The bed was super big and comfy loved the fact everything in the room was controlled by an iPad Didn t have to move Such a pleasure to stay and will definitely be returning 
181245,citizenM Tower of London, There are certainly lots of gimmicks and razzamattaz about this place and the stay is a slightly different experience than usual But having no tea coffee facilities in the room misses the mark completely There are certainly no spectacular views of the Thames or Tower Bridge as it said in the description of the hotel My room had a great view of the Shard and there are good views of the Tower of London from the upstairs bar but I wanted the Thames because it advertised it No coffee first thing in the morning You can keep your fancy iPad air conditioning and streaming TV which didn t work , Location was superb literally right next to Tower Bridge tube with all the local amenities that are there 
181246,citizenM Tower of London, Everything was perfect , Perfectly clean enormous bed lovely shower amazing staff they actually feel like friends Everybody is helpfull and kind The location is perfect and we loved the bar with a view Coudn t be better Oh and don t forget the funny quotes everywhere Makes you smile all the time 
181247,citizenM Tower of London, You have to carry your luggage thers is no service for that and that is bad thing for 4 stars hotel I booked room that have view but I was shocked that no view room shoud be bigger, Breakfast was quiet good I hope will be better Bed was very comfortable
181248,citizenM Tower of London, Food was only a terrible overpriced buffet and some of the bar staff not experienced trained anything like well enough Shame as there is potential but they spent too much money and importance on design and gimmicky slogans everywhere which pale a little when the basics like food are not right at all , Design and location
181249,citizenM Tower of London, Security here is very lax we were twice bothered by a guy approaching people and asking for money downstairs none of the staff seemed to notice him even when he appeared to be trying to nick stuff from someone s backpack at the bar Anyone can get up into the hotel rooms via the lifts or stairs as there is no ID or security In addition the food downstairs is INCREDIBLY overpriced 23 for a self serve English breakfast and the iPad controls of the room while very amusing didn t actually work properly e g the air conditioning did not respond at all The rooms are basically pods and I would not really recommend for a long stay or for older people who might have trouble clambering over one another to get into the beds which are accessible from one side only , Very nice communal areas and upstairs bar Ipad control of the room lights is a novelty for a while 
181250,citizenM Tower of London, The wash hand basin should be in the shower room toilet pod not outside in the bedroom It is not hygienic to open the pod door without washing your hands first , The location is great On Tower Hill tube station with great view of Tower of London
181251,citizenM Tower of London, Over priced products and food at the coffee shop on the ground floor bar on ground floor and bar on top two floors but also very good quality Too much technology in room using iPad for everything having to remember to keep it charged otherwise there s no control Signals from device can often be slow too , Excellent location adjacent to Tower Hill Station exit Really friendly staff Very modern and brand new Clean and bathroom in excellent condition with a wet room Views of the shard from sixth floor Get a choice of a few rooms on arrival always go higher Good terrace bar on top two floors with excellent views and park opposite Good climate control within room and good disability access and black out blinds curtains WiFi speeds Download 135Mbps Upload 118Mbps Fridge provided with two bottles of water provided Would recommend and would visit again 
181252,citizenM Tower of London, No cash payment possible A call at 9 a m confirmed for a potential pre check in was coming in 1 hour later than standard check in at 14 00 Quite disapointing Check out process for two different invoices lasted too long Air condition was off on iPad but not in real , Great location tower hill circle line tube station around the corner 
181253,citizenM Tower of London, Really loud banging noises from about 2am Sounded like someone was knocking really loudly on the door I think it may have been the pipes above the room I told someone at reception the next day and although they were nice about it they didn t offer any compensation or solution , Loved the bed dreamy
181254,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing that i can think of , I like the overall atmosphere during our stay Right next to the tube station so no hassle to walk more with all the luggage that we have and the attractions are so near Very good value for money 
181255,citizenM Tower of London, Could have made the bathroom a bit longer and put the washbasin in the bathroom Booking com didn t mention that there is an additional 2 50 charge for booking with a credit card , Check out the view from the bar on the 7th floor Right next to the Tower Hill tube station Fast check in and out Fun and quirky 
181256,citizenM Tower of London, Only gripe The hotel should have an option of twin beds it is especially difficult to get out of the Xlarge enclosed on 3 sides bed if both persons are disabled , Trendy quirky designed hotel brand new build staff very kind friendly breakfast was fabulous loved the hi tech iPad remote control for lights tv the free movies watched two a great price for the amazing views of London from the private bar on the 7 th floor views on three sides 
181257,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing, The whole citizen experience was a pleasure from check in to check out the self check in was quick and easy the room was comfy and spotless and the view was amazing
181258,citizenM Tower of London, Maybe the food there wasn t much to chose from , Everything The bed was so comfy and the decoration was amazing All of the staff were so friendly and helpful would definitely recommend 
181259,citizenM Tower of London, Would prefer coffee and tea making facilities in room especially as early riser and enjoy a Cupar in bed Breakfast rather expensive especially as go down road and can get a great breakfast with juice and coffee for 9 99 , Love the lounge facilities Staff excellent Location fantastic Exceptional cleanliness Love the check in and out self service lovely late check out and a room to keep luggage in if going exploring on checkout morning so no need to lug it around with you Highly recommend
181260,citizenM Tower of London, We didn t go for the extra breakfast option so can t judge the food or service but it was quite pricy for a hotel breakfast The bar was closed on Sunday s so we never got the option to visit which was a shame Could have done with being open during the day at least Besides that can t complain Had a lovely stay , This www such a good find Best hotel I ve even stayed at Brilliant location 2 mins walk from Tower of London and right Next to Tower Hill station Staff were always willing to held a hand and always a friendly welcoming atmosphere Loved the high tech feel checking in out was quick and painless Highly recommend 
181261,citizenM Tower of London, There was a loud banging noise in our room throughout the day and night which was possibly the air conditioning unit of linked to the water supply which did wake us up during the night, Staff were friendly and very helpful and greeted us each day with smiles and genuinely seemed to be enjoying their jobs The rooms were amazing with the extra large beds and mood pads Couldn t have asked for a better location and a added bonus of a view of The Tower of London 
181262,citizenM Tower of London, Didn t have the best view only really good for one night stay as room quite claustrophobic more water would of been good and tv wasn t working at beginning of stay , Fantastic service and friendly staff perfect location very comfortable bed loved the iPad detail and mood lighting very modern
181263,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Great location easy check in we were able to check in at 11am and we left our luggage until early afternoon after checking out Room clean with great shower No kettle though 
181264,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Faultless stay the bed was so comfortable all the extras in the room were a real perk such as the hairdryer mood pad tv and wifi Also check out the rooftop bar for a view of the city centre 
181265,citizenM Tower of London, There was a power outage not the fault of the hotel but as a result even the water did not work It highlighted the over dependance on technology as it was not possible to open the blinds or a window and there was no air conditioning A back up power generator might be worth the investment If the power cut had not occurred the review would have been even more positive but not being able to wash is a big negative even if the hotel cannot be responsible , Excellent location Friendly hard working staff Good price With a power outage the staff were under severe pressure They responded really well The 7th floor bar has great views though it is very pricey We would definitely go there again Hopefully there will be no major power cut the next time This is a lovely quirky modern hotel It is new and we got it at a great price I suspect that it will never again be priced so favourably 
181266,citizenM Tower of London, too much check in automation that does not always work then you need 2 staff members to handle what supposably you should handle without any assistance, great lobby fantastic ironing facilities
181267,citizenM Tower of London, We had a couple of friends back for drinks and had to curtail the evening a little earlier than planned due to the no non guests at the bar policy Accidentally set the bathroom mood lighting on red and for a second thought I had a medical emergency on my hands , Try the lemon and earl grey marmalade It ll change your life No trouble too trivial for the lovely staff Marvellous views Characterful decor and fixtures very taken with the interior design Barman knows his cocktails 
181268,citizenM Tower of London, No kettle no coffee no tea facilities in Room having to check in ourselves in reception although The staff were very helpful bed on a c rner so had to climb over each other to get in and out of bed bed too high for an 8 year old as he had to take a running jump to get on to it coffee served warm not hot The food looked un appetizeing so We did not try it , Locaci n Clean Comfortable bed comfortable p llows shower fridge in Room a bottle of chillen Water in The fridge for us both 
181269,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing, The staff was always friendly and in a good mood The rooms aren t too big but very modern and clean The location is perfect for a trip to the city but the Underground is next to the building as well Breakfast was better than expected All in all we really enjoyed our trip and highly recommend CitizenM 
181270,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing at all, We re proud to be Citizens and would not stay anywhere else given the choice Friendly staff along with comfort and cleanliness A 
181271,citizenM Tower of London, The prices seemed high and no coffee in rooms was a disappointment All the red decor and use of citizen felt a bit Communistic The music was a bit loud , The technology was an asset thanks for the printer All staff very personable The 7th floor lounge was perfect The many different sitting areas were effective and the reading material appreciated 
181272,citizenM Tower of London, Perhaps having the toilet shower bathroom in a separate room rather than together in one room, 24 hour bar super friendly staff smart room and black out remote blinds excellent decor amazing views of the Tower Of London the shard great location and super comfy beds
181273,citizenM Tower of London, The only thing I would add is a fitness room Love the music just turn down the volume a bit , Really like the hotel the open lobby space the details the design and the people 
181274,citizenM Tower of London, More variety of dining options would be nice The tablet that served as a tv remote temperature control and mood lighting ran out of battery quickly and always had to be on the charger making it a bit inconvenient , This location of CitizenM had opened just one week prior to our stay It s the newest location in London The staff was very welcoming knowledgeable and efficient The bed was comfy Our room was very trendy and clean We had spectacular views of the Shard London Bridge Tower of London and the Historic Royal Palaces It s also conveniently located right next to the Tower Hill tube station Furthermore We enjoyed and appreciated the convenience of a decent breakfast here 
181275,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Bed was very comfortable and clean Shame the view outside the window is not so good building construction is underway Staffs were very polite and helpful as well Hotel location is very close to tube station too close in fact I ended up circling the whole area near tower of London before realizing the hotel is JUST BESIDE the station Overall a very satisfying experience 
181276,citizenM Tower of London, The room needs to be clean more from the dust We would appreciate if you offer toothbrush and toothpaste tea coffee and Kattle in the room , Very lovely and friendly staff the view was amazing the structure and furniture of the hotel was amazing 
181277,citizenM Tower of London, As an Englishwoman I missed having tea making facilities in the room I d have been prepared to pay an extra amount for this, tiny space but perfectly appointed intelligently and artistically appointed
181278,citizenM Tower of London, Bed could only be accessed from one side Not a problem for one but could be difficult for a couple , Good facilities but shoe horned into a small space 
181279,citizenM Tower of London, No iron in the room need to travel down a floor to the ironing room, Everything is very modern and perfect for a short stay Bed was great Hotel only opened a few weeks ago a few little teething issues but the staff handled these quickly and professionally
181280,citizenM Tower of London, The view was fantastic but we couldn t work out how to open the blinds to make the most of it I don t think they do stay open as there is a permanent privacy blind then a blackout one you can raise and lower the toilet is contained in a frosted glass case in the room so whilst with my sister I didn t care with a new love interest that may have felt a little awkward On the whole though fantastic stay great staff great location would return , Bed super duper Had a fantastic stay a little expensive for my budget as a student but went for a special occasion if I am in London and can afford it I will return Room was just as advertised cosy for sure but with everything you need About a 60 second walk from the tube station so getting there was quick which helped us feel secure 
181281,citizenM Tower of London, Pillows could have been slightly softer , Awesome high tech rooms Great location Lovely rooftop bar Great decor Food looked good but didn t eat there 
181282,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, OMG this hotel totally rocks The rooms are great for single travellers might be a bit crowded for couples The community spaces were awesome I felt so comfortable and at home here Just loved this hotel s style and atmosphere Proximity to the tube and the river are great too I would go back again in a heart beat 
181283,citizenM Tower of London, Dust and hair strands on the window ledge No e cuse for this as the bed lifts up to assist with the cleaning, The rooms consist of modern decor red and black colours Enough space for two people overnight or a couple of nights Next door to underground station so ideal for all tourist sights Staff are very friendly and cant do enough to make your stay enjoyable The views of The Tower are surreal and worth the price You will not be disappointed 
181284,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Amazing hotel with great location Absolutely worth it Right next to the Tower Hill tube station Nicely designed hotel with a good ambiance in the entrance Staff is really helpful and friendly Fantastic comfortable bed really liked the iPad room control The Rooftop Bar on the 7th floor was fabulous with spectacular view I would definitely stay here again 
181285,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, We had an incident with hair straightener and wrong voltage all the power went out in the room not only were the staff super friendly and helpful but they were prompt in their response 
181286,citizenM Tower of London, A very small thing however the shower curtain was too short for the shower meaning water went throughout the bathroom Considering we were visiting in the first week of the hotel opening this may have already been fixed and they did well to have the rest of the hotel perfect , Great location for a weekend in London There is a tube stop right next to the hotel which is perfectly convenient when wanting to optimising your time moving about the city The hotel is very modern with Vitra design furniture throughout rooms are on the small side however this is expected in central London and somehow don t feel small due to the layout Also like they are green eco conscious We really enjoyed our stay 
181287,citizenM Tower of London, Only 1 pillow per person but they brought more up as soon as I asked no where to sit down in front of a mirror, Staff incredibly friendly they went out of their way to make us feel at home really comfy beds yummy breakfast complimentary muffin for my friends birthday never felt so clean as I did after the rainforest shower 
181288,citizenM Tower of London, I don t believe there was anything I didn t like , Loved the little touches The carpet in the hallway The energy saving lighting at elevators The use of technology such as check in and check out the iPad control in the room 
181289,citizenM Tower of London, Breakfast was a bit of disappointment as compared to Other same hotels like Hilton However coffee was great even much better than Costa , Staff was young and amazingly helpful Great decor and awesome cleanliness Nothing bad to say about 
181290,citizenM Tower of London, For the period that we stayed at Citizen M we couldn t fault the hotel or it s staff thank you all , Loved the Staff the location to the under ground location to London s tourist centre breakfast layout 
181291,citizenM Tower of London, I had a room facing a building site which I had to pay the same money for as a standard room This meant I had to have my blinds curtains closed completely for my full stay , I like the location the quality of the rooms 
181292,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, Amazing hotel Absolutely worth it Just a little sidenote the breakfast might seem a little pricey but it s definitaley worth it It s a huge buffet continental and english with fresh fruit and warm options Even vegetarian sausages where served Also you get unlimited barista made coffee and tee of your choice

181296,citizenM Tower of London, We have no complaints Without hesitation we would return to this hotel , This is a new hotel and the staff is very friendly enthusiastic and eager to help The common areas are fantastic lots of places to hangout with friends or catch up on work The room was small but very comfortable We stayed at the hotel for 10 nights and because the space is designed so well we never felt cramped The beds are very comfortable and the rooms was cheerful and bright Another benefit is that the hotel sits above the Tower Hill Tube station we loved this convenience 
181297,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, you can see that this is citizenM s most recent hotel because there is much more storage space and details in the room than in their older hotels there is a beautiful bar at the top of hotel with very nice view on three sides of london tower shard gherkin underground station is practically in the hotel 
181298,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, We loved the hotel from the moment we entered until we left Everything is new and modern and has a very personal feeling due to the domotica used You can connect your own laptop to the tv We didn t even need electrical converters since they have different kind of plugs and usb chargers Anything you wanted you could get there without hesitation and with a warm and friendly smile included Last but not least since we got engaged there and the staff helped with the whole romantic setup at the rooftop bar it will be a memory we will never forget 
181299,citizenM Tower of London, Room size was disappointing Too many technical issues with checking in opening the room door making the reservation , Great staff who resolved several technical issues and were very welcoming Clean room and decent amount of tech

181301,citizenM Tower of London, Mealtimes were confusing There was no menu so you didnt know if there would be food we would like therefore couldnt plan ahead Meals were written on a board with no price or explanation of what was included There was 3 hot meals and an area with cold food I had to keep asking how much things were and what was included in price so tended to eat elsewhere , Where do I begin Hotel was lovely room was great with comfy bed and pillows and a fantastic shower The staff were all very friendly and helpful and made a lovely latte Location was perfect for the tube station 
181302,citizenM Tower of London, Would have liked tea coffee making facilities in the room , Loved this hotel Rooms were compact but excellently designed to make great use of the space The huge bed and floor to ceiling window directly overlooking the Tower of London gave a real luxurious feel to the room Would have expected to pay a lot more than we did for that kind of view Decor throughout the hotel was modern and quirky and immaculately clean Staff were friendly and helpful Would definitely return 
181303,citizenM Tower of London, Not enough staff on at reception during breakfast hours , Overall no complaints re the room and facilities as usual a joy to stay at Citizen M and fabulous location in London Tower Hill 
181304,citizenM Tower of London, The room is a little bit small Not a big problem , Very good location You go out from the tower hill station you will find the hotel on the right hand side Staff are very friendly and helpful The bed is very comfortable Enjoy cocktails in the evening in the sky bar 
181305,citizenM Tower of London, The music in the lobby and canteen was to loud during breakfast In the evening it was even worse It s a pity because lobby and canteen were spacious and beautiful , Wonderful lobby and canteen Marvelous breakfast 
181306,citizenM Tower of London, No service to the room in terms of breakfast The air conditioning could not be turned of in the room so found it a little cold , The room was clean and the location was excellent Staff were also very friendly 
181307,citizenM Tower of London, No iron in the bedroom No room service , The hotel was modern clean and the decor was very funky There was a mix of families and young older couples which was nice The bed was very comfy and spacious Everything was controlled by an ipad which was very cool and easy The choice of movies tv avaliable was great The room had everyhing you could want in a hotel room Surprising amount of storage Self check in was a great idea and hassle free We were able to leave our suitcases for the day when we checked out free of charge which was a great help Rooftop bar is a must see in london Fantastic view both day and night Hotel location was amazing access to bus tube taxi water taxis less than a minute away There was also a great variety of bars cafes and restaurants near by Great value for money and very clean Would highly recommend 
181308,citizenM Tower of London, Optional Breakfast a little expensive , Friendliness of staff Large comfortable bed Blinds TV lighting alarm etc all controlled by iPad Contemporary furnishing Cleanliness Adjacent to Tube station 
181309,citizenM Tower of London, Could fault it if anything the cocktails can be a bit pricey, We ve stayed in Citizen M hotels before and find them great value for money On this occasion was no different spotlessly clean very friendly staff and for being so close to the centre of London there was no noise at all from the traffic We will be returning
181310,citizenM Tower of London, International staff sometimes misunderstood what you were asking for No tea making facilities in the room for that tea coffee first thing , Easy check in out beautifully modern and lovely rooms
181311,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, The staff were super friendly They made sure we were happy Harry and and Anne marie I m sure her name was were willing to go that extra mile Well done to all the staff 
181312,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, All staff were really friendly the hotel was very contemporary and had a quirky fun edge to it The rooms were compact but the bed was huge and very comfortable we had a great view of the Tower of London and we also enjoyed the Cloud bar We would definitely stay again
181313,citizenM Tower of London, Teething problems hot water in room not hot can t switch air conditioning off , Position facilities in hotel great view of Tower of London and Shard friendly helpful staff 
181314,citizenM Tower of London, Although the public areas in this hotel are well equipped one cannot really find a quiet place to work outside the room the room itself is too small for a desk Wouldn t recommend this hotel for someone who plans to work from the hotel during his stay unless a noisy cafe lounge like environment is sufficient Staff mostly smiles but not really helpful when needed Take a room with outside facing windows The inner facing rooms miss all the action , Beautiful hotel Heaven for people who appreciate design Don t miss the roof terrace Smart self Check in 
181315,citizenM Tower of London, Wifi was barely working in the room , Perfect location tube station Tower Hill is literally a few steps from the hotel Very clean rooms and the huge bed was really comfortable Also fun to control the room lighting and set it according to your mood 
181316,citizenM Tower of London, Improve on House keeping , The hotel is really nice Very beautiful but the house keeping totally messed it up for us They never changed the bedsheets or the pillow cases They never cleaned the counters well and they forgot to give us towels Was so disappointed after that because we were actually enjoying our stay 
181317,citizenM Tower of London, Generally all was fine but some minor quibbles only Breakfast choice was okay but hot food was generally cold and the plates were cold too Sometimes it s nice to be able to make yourself a tea coffee in your room whilst getting ready although I understand the logistical space implications Room was fine for short stays but storage could be a problem for longer visits ie two larger suitcases and limited hanging space, Staff were incredibly helpful and friendly Being able to leave bags after check out for a couple of hours to allow for some last minute sightseeing before travelling back was greatly appreciated Room was great and the view of the Tower was a real bonus The ambience and layout of the ground floor public areas was great with plenty of space for all
181318,citizenM Tower of London, 1 Paying at check in It is a waste of time If during your stay you charge meals to your bill you will have to pay on the way out anyway So what s the point 2 Trying to get a VAT invoice in the company s name is far from obvious I entered the date when checking in and I had to enter when checking out because apparently the system did not remember or the data was discarded , 1 Ambient light 2 Shower shower gels and the towels 3 Downstairs the broad spaces the home like environment in the dining living area with bookshelves different corners different types of tables seats etc 
181319,citizenM Tower of London, The property is clearly built by millennials for millennials lots of wonderful ideas with haphazard execution , Ultramodern hotel in one of the most convenient locations in the City Friendly and hip staff 24 hour canteen with cakes and mood lighting in rooms 
181320,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing The price is always steep in London for any hotel but certainly worth every penny for this experience , I loved the living rooms that created amazingly homely communal spaces for chatting working and eating And what views from the room and Top floors Also loved the ironing rooms brilliant idea Finally the staff were unbelievably attentive helpful and welcoming 
181321,citizenM Tower of London, There was a mix up with my booking my fault I booked in for one week after the actual date I was arriving Thankfully there were rooms in the hotel but I was charged just short of 100 extra for this As it was a genuine mistake I would not turn up to London without a booking I thought they could have charged me the same but instead they charged me extra I had no choice but to agree Also the canary warf rooms are looking onto a building site This needs to be changed temporarily whilst work is going on I changed my room , Staff were fantastic very friendly and greeted me every single time 
181322,citizenM Tower of London, Service in the 7th floor bar was very very poor Sad considering the money we spent in one afternoon we actually left the bar due to the bad service better on the bottom floor shelves surfaces in the room we re very dusty when we checked in , Bed was huge and very comfortable room in general really nice I ve stayed in the Rotterdam hotel before which brought me to stay here Views from the 7th floor were really great 
181323,citizenM Tower of London, The staff at check in continued a conversation rather than greet me then I headed up excited to see the Canary Wharf View that the check in terminal had promised only to find a close up panorama of an adjacent building site Neither wifi nor air con worked particularly well in my room From the other reviews I accept that my experience doesn t reflect that of others but I was really disappointed , The hotel is very well located for all of the sights 
181324,citizenM Tower of London,No Negative, A brand new quirky hotel located right next to the Tower of London The staff are really friendly and it is excellent value for London It also serves great food and coffee The rooms are small but have fabulous views and a big comfy bed loved playing with the room control pad The sky top bar had great atmosphere just a shame it was closed on Sunday evening I would thoroughly recommend this hotel 
181325,citizenM Tower of London, Plumbing problem encountered so no hot shower one morning but as it just opened I guess a few teething problems Also a mix up with bookings so delayed in checking in and a fire evac called during this time due to a toaster malfunction All teething problems , the location cleanliness as well as staff enthusiam Also the focus of Sandie when there was a booking mix up how she addressed it and made sure I was comfortable 
181326,citizenM Tower of London, Breakfast at 15 95 is a bit too steep for a buffet, Bed so comfortable lovely friendly staff fantastic location Gorgeous decor and open spaces Amazing views of London Tower from the top floor bar Highly recommend
181327,citizenM Tower of London, There could have been a bit more options in the Continental Breakfast eg some cakes , Awesome staff Tweeted about the same and was instantly recognised by the staff next day and said thank you Simple things matter and CitizenM makes sure that it is taken care of 
181328,citizenM Tower of London, Dust on window ledge and shelves Lifts and air conditioning temperamental Limited space at check in and lift access , Located at Tower Hill Tube station Views of Tower of London and the Shard A few minutes walk to the Thames and Tower Bridge 
181329,citizenM Tower of London, The rooms are extremely small and part of the bathroom is in fact in the room The bathroom feels cheap claustrophobic and the walls area plastic Just like they installed a porta potty in the room This is definitely not a good choice if you dont know your partner very well , The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel was generally pleasant The rooftop bar is really great limited to hotel guests so its not crowded and you have some spectacular views The price for the drinks are also reasonable 
181330,citizenM Tower of London, There was no room kettle coffee machine Similar hotels place a Nespresso machine in the lobby where you can drink coffee or a ewer of hot water to make tea free for guests There was no SPA There are 3 locally although I would have preferred access to one in the hotel there is room for one should they wish to build one the place is vast , Closeness to Tower Hill tube Access to all areas of London City Tourist Sites examples Tower of London Tower Bridge Walk to South London for Tate Shard in 10 minutes Relaxing in the lobby and Rooftop Bar feels like you re living in your own luxury Penthouse Frightfully sociable Macs available to play with I particularly loved the Royal memorabilia throughout and the Prime Minister s own front door as an entrance to the Rooftop Bar which incidentally has spectacular views of London A selfie opportunity right there 
181331,citizenM Tower of London, All very good but a few minus points No chair in room also no space for one And the breakfast was average , Very modern clean and a great location 
181332,citizenM Tower of London, expensive breakfast top up at GBP15 95 per night and limited selection also in terms of location you cannot get better if you want to be close to the business area tower hill area however there are few shops for amenities around , Excellent option for accommodation in the area very good wifi connection 
181333,citizenM Tower of London, Because it just opened for a week time you can still smell the paint in the corridors , I am very surprised by this hotel Since it just opened Extremely clean and tidy all the facilities are so handy All the staff are very welcoming and nice and happy to help you with anything The room is a bit small but this is how it s designed The bed is huge for a room like this and comfortable the selection of movies available in the room are great as well The lobby is nicely designed and the reception is great for speedy checkout And the location Right at the trinity square and by the tube And for this price probably the best value for money hotel in london 
181334,citizenM Tower of London, Room was dusty but defiantly was the least of the worries, Great location really cool looking hotel and the views from the 6th floor across the Tower of London were delightful 
181335,citizenM Tower of London, Not being to stay longer But seriously nothing to fault , Faultless stay Citizen M just the best within the price range small and perfect room with storage fridge safe power rain shower ground floor foyer is amazing just a minute from Tower Hill Tube exit just turn right Free movies wifi quality drink at the bar great coffee to kickstart our morning Staff have a greeting and a smile books and newspapers to browse Will stay again 
181336,citizenM Tower of London, Nothing major more like teething pains Although it is supposed to be self serviced check in the process is not easy or straightforward We ended up using three staff members to assist with check in and two to assist with check out The late night food options are limited The prices of the drinks at the bar upstairs are too high and not justifiable , Loved the hotel concept tiny but very well equipped and ergonomic rooms the quality of the bed and the technology very very nice Great location too 
181337,citizenM Tower of London, Shame you had to clamber over each other in the bed to get to loo in middle of night , Great downstairs reception Shame you had to clamber over each other in the bed to get to loo in middle of night 
181338,citizenM Tower of London, The breakfast is too expensive for what you get Besides I had to wait 20 minutes for my coffee Incidentally this is due to the still inexperienced but willing staff , Great location nice view from my room at Trinity Square A good and large bed in a small and efficient furnished room A fresh and nice hotel Very friendly but still inexperienced staff The hotel is above metro Tower Hill 
181339,citizenM Tower of London, No free drinks when you book via booking com, Excellent value for money stylish and modern bespoke decor with a no compromise feel Located right next to Tower Hill underground station with a lovely view or Canary Wharf I would actively seek to stay in CitizenM again 
181340,citizenM Tower of London, The only downside we had was that security continually approached asking us where we staying at the hotel Never experienced that before It was funny at first but after the 5th time it was just annoying , The view of the Tower of London was amazing The bed was extremely comfortable and the hotel staff were lovely Always making sure we ok
