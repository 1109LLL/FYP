106220,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture,No Negative, Amazing Hotel Very helpful staff I would like to thank George and Mervat from the Reception Team George allowed me to do early check in at 7 AM and next day he upgraded my room without any extra money hotel is closed to Champs lys es street and Arc Triumph 
106221,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, The flooring was awful in our rooms Extremely old carpeting and the floor creaked We all wore our flip flops Shower heads are low but have the removable handles , Family suite was ideal for our family with one older child and one younger Great location close to the Arc This gave easy access for the hop on hop off buses Our rooms had a top view of the tower Beds are comfortable and bathrooms nice Breakfast was great Just enough options for everyone to start the day and to save money 
106222,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Very far from being a 4 stars hotel every thing except the location is very bad I can also say poor very high rate for nothing every single part in the hotel needs renovation the furniture is very old it was really a bad experience,No Positive
106223,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Don t get too excited about the free minibar though as there is little in it and is only restocked every three days , Great location We booked a Classic Junior Suite for our stay and were not disappointed the room was lovely we had two bathrooms and two toilets and a sitting room with a sofa ample wardrobe space The hotel offers afternoon tea each day which was nice Breakfast was quite nice There were three doorman whilst we were there at different times all three were lovely happy friendly people the rest of the staff weren t so happy a big thank you to the doormen as they made our connection with the hotel a happy one 
106224,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, There was no air conditioning in the lobby area which made it rather uncomfortable This might be a temporary situation but the lobby was very muggy and warm Our room had ants on the desk which we mentioned to the staff We believe they did spray for ants but it can take a couple of attempts to ensure all the ants are gone But the hotel was definitely clean and neat and everything else was perfect , The hotel is in a good area and was clean and neat The happy hour every evening was a wonderful bonus The staff was very helpful every time we needed directions or had a question 
106225,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, The elevators were very very small 1 lg piece of luggage and 1 person is all that fits in the elevator and it was slow , Breakfast was a buffet and the staff kept it stocked well Food was great
106226,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, The noise of the traffic had to have the window open was hot in the room so got all the traffic noise in the morning Rooms are a bit tight as per the bathroom A, May be all right for a week end and handy to Paris
106227,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, The Privellge Suite was a lot smaller than on the website The wifi coverage is poor We were disappointed that tv channel for English doesn t work , I like the location is very central I like the happy hour and and the free mini bar We got the room with Eiffel view like we requested I like the balcony overlooking the tower The view is very nice at night I like the pocket wifi facility It was very convenient I like that there was elevator I like the shower and the bathroom 
106228,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Nothing, They staff moved us to another room that was ready early because we had a child even though we arrived 3 hours before checkin and the baby cot was already in the room The staff was friendly and helped us out Great coffee maker in the room Bathroom was enormous with a shower and very large tub 
106229,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Carpet is worn stained and torn Hotel entry curtain seems worn and paint is peeling from hotel outside walls Sink in bathroom did not drain well and water from shower came out onto floor , Location was good and easy to get to sites It also is next door to the Dominicans where mass is celebrated at noon daily Hotel has real potential Has private bathroom with a shower and tub Carpet is worn and stained and needs to be replaced It gives a poor impression for the hotel as does the entry window curtains and paint peeling from building We will not stay here again unless the hotel has changed carpets nor will we use booking com since our expectations of the hotel was much higher than what we were led to believe on the internet 
106230,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture,No Negative, The location was the best thing Staff were very friendly and understanding It is a very safe area and so close to everything like pharmacy hair dressers groceries touristic areas I will definitely visit again 
106231,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, We arrived about 2 30pm but had to wait until after 3 to check in even though they were knocking on the door the next morning before check out When we checked out the next day we asked to pay for our breakfasts and Georges checked and when he handed us our bill the breakfasts were added on then taken off again we only had to pay the city tax However when we returned for our luggage later in the afternoon the assistant manageress said we hadn t paid for breakfasts with various excuses for Georges and it will be 36 euros please After a scene the hotel manager said he would not charge for them after all Apparently Georges had only been there a week and overstepped his mark in waiving the breakfasts charge but that is between him and the hotel ,No Positive
106232,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Bathroom amenities weren t placed everyday shampoos etc Room service wasn t that good for a 4 star hotel the room heater was switched on by staff without us asking for it to be on Cleaning staff would knock on our door in the morning to clean while we were asleep , The bed was very comfy suit was spacious with two balconies although the view was nt nice at all Location is great for people that like walking Champs elysees is about a 10 minute walk A supermarket next to the hotel 
106233,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, The fact that I could not turn on air conditioner in my room really bother me The hotel should let people know beforehand I have stayed in colder places and I had the choice to turn on the ic or turn it off And the wifi sucked , The staff was nice 
106234,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, they did not give us even one hour extension, friendly and larger room than average in Europe complimentary water and juices complimentary coffee in the lobby super close by restaurant recommended by the staff was excellent called 110 de Taillevent
106235,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Noise between the Rooms Hotel Wifi slow Should be renovated , Location Room Space Good Staff Good Price They Offer a Pocket Unlimited Internet Wifi for 5 Euros a day which is cheaper than any phone carrier 
106236,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture,No Negative, Great location near to the biggest attractions of Paris friendly and helpful staff comfortable room with big bed delious breakfast and very nice welcoming with a glass of champagne 
106237,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, There could have been better selection in the mini bar Lifts were very small , Room so were beautiful location excellent Spotlessly clean Staff were pleasant My children s room even had a view of The Eiffel Tower 
106238,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, The hotel is not same as the pictures and reviews in Booking com The facilities are not for 4 star hotel The bath room is so small and we were not comfortable for taking shower We ve reserved 1 room with king size bed but the bed was twins and we were not comfortable during our stay time I ve already asked to reception in my check in time but unfurtunatly nothing happened The staff are not so prefosional and they were not in kind mood especially waiteres in resturant , Nothing
106239,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Our door lock was so wobbly that two days out of three we returned to the room to find the maid had not successfully closed the door at all , This hotel is near a great bakery beautiful park and two small lovely museums There are at least a half dozen bus lines within a block s walk and the Metro is three blocks away The Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees is a 10 minute walk away 
106240,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, N A, Our Wedding Week all our friends came from USA UK Mexico Japan Africa etc The hotel was fantastic staff 5 stars nothing was too much Location the best one and the police station is just in front so we felt safe 24 7 On rue faubourg st honor perfect for shopping just 2 min from avenue Champs Elysees Some our friends even decided to extend their stay for few days they really loved it 
106241,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Nothing, Everything specially the staf were so friendly and if u wish to have an Internet outside the hotel they give u an router for 1 per a day I really recommend this hotel 
106242,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Small bathroom No splash cover on shower bath Small lifts Max 3 ppl , Close to Metro Ternes station Great location Close to cafes and patisseries Value for money Ideal for short stays Small but comfortable room Staff were very helpful and friendly Quiet surroundings
106243,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, I booked a junior suite but room 603 was just a room with a sofa bed more resembling a family room and in need of renovation it was nothing like the nice pictures The double bed was actually two single beds pushed together which kept moving apart with the smallest of movements so I needed fished off the floor out from the gap in the middle during the early hours Not what you want on a romantic weekend away The bathroom was badly in need of renovation too with a very strange narrow bath and shower setup not the nice big tub in the pictures The sort of room you don t want to come back to after a nice night out I m sorry to say, Friendly staff in a good location with a view of the Eiffel Tower
106244,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, The room we were in was okay It didn t live up to the expectations in the pictures and for 420 for two nights we expected a high class 4 star establishment The bathroom looked like it had just had the door repaired from being kicked in there were broken corners on the wall and scuffs everywhere Needed a severe refurb We booked a classic suite but the sitting area was more like a tiny spare room with a sofa bed The seats were worn and the floor had dodgy marks on it Other than that it was comfortable but I d not pay that sort of money again for the price There are better hotels close by with nicer decor for the same price , Great location Lovely service from the staff and incredibly comfy bed memory foam mattress and pillows Loved the sound proof room and the complimentary glass of champagne included
106245,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Make up by the housekeeping are really perfunctory The bathtub was dirty when we came back and they just throw the sheet on the floor , The room is big and pretty Front desk officer are nice 
106246,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Not clean staff are rude Self service in the luggages parking is to small it didn t fit my small SUV First last time in this miserable place , The location is not bad 
106247,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, The decor must change, The staff are the best the bed is comfortable and the size of the room is what I think is not related to Paris in some haw big rooms
106248,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, No towels in bathroom on arrival Took 2 phonecalls and 1 hour to get them Safe not working again took over an hour for a new battery , Complimentary Coffee machine in lobby 24hrs plus Afternoon tea good size of room for Paris Convenient location for our short break Friendly staff 
106249,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Fire alarm went off one evening but that wasn t the hotel s fault it was a guests and it was dealt with quickly and also good to know they re working , Fantastic room wonderfully surprised by the upgrade amazing views of Paris staff very warm and friendly extremely pleasant stay 
106250,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Breakfast selection could be more but ok for now , Staff s service is impeccable Room is clean and modern Just that it is a little small but manageable 
106251,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Elevator is hilariously tiny putting hotel key in slot to turn on lights is weird , Staff was super friendly and helpful hotel was clean and modern coffee available in lobby was great breakfast was tasty and nice location was great to walk around Paris
106252,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, The shower wasn t working properly I guess there wasn t enough time to fix it within 2 days , Sindy was fabulous welcoming helpful and informative My next visit to Paris definitely includes me staying there 
106253,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Location was not so convenient to Metro Stations, The service was very good plus it included free tea buffet every afternoon wifi and provided very affordable access to portable wifi which helped us a lot Downside is that the Metro stations are not so near But it does not matter Service and staff were amazing 
106254,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture,No Negative, Our room was absolutely delightful and we travelled with my son and he had his own room and own bathroom Toooo good Phillipe and his staff were fantastic great location too we will definitely stay there again when in Paris 
106255,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Curtains didn t close properly no cups for tea coffee in room milk and sugar not topped up each day lights in bathroom hanging down from ceiling, Bed was great staff friendly and helpful handy location
106256,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Not a thing , The staff was extremely attentive and pleasant throughout our 3 night stay The breakfast and happy hour treats were consistently great We figured out that we could connect more than one device to wifi by using our various email addresses The restaurant suggestion to nearby les 110 de TAILLEVENT was superb We were a bit chilly the first night as the Paris temperatures dropped and the heat had just been turned off for the season The manager quickly arranged for a portable space heater which solved the problem 
106257,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, The cleaning people made our beds each day but NEVER took out the trash and left our dirty coffee cups there for 3 days On day 1 the cleaning person left their cleaning spray right next to my tooth brush yuk We had to ask the front desk to have them take care of that They apologized profusely and fixed the problem , Room is updated and very clean Their happy hour with champagne and finger food was awesome and their coffee is fabulous you get free sodas and water in your room refreshed daily The staff was super helpful and courteous I m coming back this summer Location is awesome 
106258,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Sometimes the room is a bit different than the one seen on the website Sometimes at the arrival we have to wait a bit longer than expected for the readiness of the room , The staff is very professional always available and reacts very quickly to the customers needs The suits are very comfortable Two things have positively caught my attention The happy hour free lounge and the pocket wifi at the disposal of the customer during all his stay The hotel is located at 5 minutes from the Champs Elysees I recommend this hotel for business and leisure trips 
106259,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture,No Negative, The rooms were big and comfortable staff were nice and helpful afternoon tea with its assortment of baked items and finger sandwiches was a very welcome touch especially for the kids 
106260,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Our room was just not up to standard at all for a 4 star hotel This place is more 3 star Our room was very basic toilet did not flush properly bath shower space was tiny and leaked Looks nothing like the pics Avoid this place it s not worth the stars or cost per night , Good location and friendly staff
106261,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Check in time was 3pm but the room was not ready till 3 15pm and we had to wait , Spacious room friendly and helpful staff location is very safe and quiet but also close to arc de triomphe
106262,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture,No Negative, Large comfortable room Friendly service Repaired problem with sink quickly and effectively Generous with drinks and food free mini bar coffee in reception afternoon buffet 
106263,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, nothing, the location and everything are excellent specially nice afternoon meeting in lobby and marvelous accomodation in room like free mini bar and amazing coffee machine 
106264,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, The hotel rooms need a bit of sprucing up The carpet was worn the furniture painted too many times The radiator in our room could not be turned off so it was too hot The TV reception was spotty , The beds were really comfortable the bathrooms modern and super clean They had free wi fi a free mini bar in the room and free late afternoon tea in the lobby Located on a block between two major streets transportation by Metro bus and taxi was easy The staff were all super nice and attentive 
106265,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, cannot write anything because everything as per our expectations , Friendly staff good comfort good location from where we can walk down to Champs Elysees and other places and come back good restaurants at walking distance etc 
106266,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, The hotel seemed a little tired The carpets need to be replaced and a little sprucing is in order I should have upgraded my room lousy view Poorly designed shower door Could NOT take a shower without spraying water everywhere , Great location very helpful pleasant staff 
106267,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, The shower was cramped and water sprayed on the floor of the bathroom But we know that this sort of thing is typical in many European hotels and it really didn t bother us at all , This hotel has the best service and most friendly staff we ve ever had anywhere and we ve traveled around the world so this is really saying something Staying here is more like being in a bed and breakfast or someone s home than a hotel because everyone treats you like you are a special and cherished guest Everyone also speaks excellent English and they genuinely want to ensure that your visit to Paris is perfect Everyday there is a 3 hour afternoon tea with free sweets savory snacks and non alcoholic beverages you can also purchase alcoholic drinks from the bar Breakfast is amazing with hot eggs bacon beans and sausages not to mention fresh fruit breads and pastries yogurt and much more Our room was large and comfortable and the beds were good The windows in both the room and the bathroom could be opened wide something I always appreciate The mini bar is stocked with a range of water soft drinks and fruit juice and it is free for the guests They do charge for refills but we didn t drink it all up in our four days here The fridge is large enough to hold a bottle of wine or two and the hotel will gladly provide a bucket of ice if you need to chill a bottle quickly The wifi is very good though you do have to sign in again each time you use it The hotel also offers a portable wifi device about the size of a deck of cards that you can carry with you as you explore Paris This allows you to access the internet and googlemaps from anywhere as well as send photos to your friends at home to make them jealous The charge for this device is only one euro a day which is a fantastic deal It worked very well for us and we think it is a simply brilliant idea for a hotel to offer this to guests who may not have a local mobile phone The hotel is just a few blocks from the Arc de Triomphe in a quiet non touristy neighborhood There is a small grocery store in the same block and many restaurants and cafes nearby 
106268,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, The room and the bed weren t super high end but they were large and comfortable enough The rooms could perhaps be updated a little to improve , The staff were so pleasant and helpful especially as we barely know any French The hand food and fizz offered for free was a nice touch before we went out and the location was great 
106269,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Nothing I will be back , The staff were extremely friendly and yet professional The cocktail welcome in the early evening was a extra surprise before going out for a late dinner That alone was worth the price of the hotel Breakfast was fabulous and the manager stopped by to enquire how we were doing Nice touch Room very spacious and clean Big comfy bed Location great 10 min walk to metro and bus stops on the corner Lots of shopping and restaurants in the area 10 minute walk to Champs Elysees 
106270,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Nothing to dislike , Very good value for money Great location very helpful Staff and free afternoon tea with champagne what more could you want I traveled with my 17 year old daughter and she loved it We would stay there again
106271,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, There was at some point something missing in the bathroom and in the tea service like tissues and shampoo and creamer so we had to ask for it The h tel is not really soundproofed the last night of our stay my friend didn t get to sleep until 3a m because of our new neighbours who were receiving some friends and partying anyway when she told me in the morning I told that she should have called the reception other than this everything was satisfying , The welcoming atmosphere of the reception area staff and the pleasant personality of the manager The great idea of offering afternoon tea and snacks Innovative
106272,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Staff service hotel style food beverages, It was the worst hotel I stayed in our whole trip to Europe of 20 days Except the location nothing is good its not yet worth calling a five star The hotel staff was rude they moved us to another hotel later and lied about it While we were in this hotel the beverages food everything was below standard Room is dated and nothing like a four star Too expensive and dingy Never think of staying here
106273,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, None , Very comfortable bed clean sheets rating 10 for overall cleanliness Big rooms and big bathrooms The GM is very friendly and approachable friendly and great customer service of 2 indian bellmen Well mannered staffs at the breakfast lounge they always greet good morning and assisted the guests very well Hotel is located on a quiet area and very accessible to grocery store pharmacy and a 5 10 mins walk to Champs elysee The free afternoon tea is a treat after a long day 
106274,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture,No Negative, The staff at Etoile Saint Honor are simply amazing this includes everyone from receptionist to the hotel manager We only met kind faces which made us feel very welcome and at home They were all very concerned about our well being The location is excellent close to Champs lys es but in a fairly quiet street Breakfast was excellent with a wide choise of drinks and food We stayed in a junior suite which was very nice and spacious including 2 restrooms We enjoyed the free minibar and the coffee maker in the room and the afternoon coffee in the reception too Highly recommendable for the hospitality 
106275,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, the chauffage in one of the room was not working while in the second room we had a problem of water the water was falling from the wall breakfast is poor,No Positive
106276,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, The heating system Food can be improved, Extremely welcoming and helpful staff and manager of the facility 5 o clock tea room spacious comfortable bed
106277,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, The computer language is in french I had a hard time figuring out how to use it in English but it is ok The lifts were too small , Hospitality Staff The director of the hotel is a real gentleman within a walking distance from most landmarks restaurants metro stations Almost everything I LOVE IT and Highly recommend it 
106278,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Improper divider for shower and room Harsh lightening of room No reading lamp at desk and bed Outdated TV To dark wallpaper who tends to peel of Outdated furniture , Quiet room 
106279,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture,No Negative, The Staff the director are very friendly and lovely people I would recommend this hotel to everyone visiting paris it is a walking distance from everywhere 
106280,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, The lift was uncomfortably small and the hotel room lights were a little too dim , I liked how the hotel was not situated too near the bustling Champs Elysees but neither was it too far 
106281,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Only the lobby in front of desk it s not beautiful need to renovate to become presentable But inside wow it s beautiful , Location is perfect The staff are friendly and honest 
106282,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Breakfast is not included in the package and costs 18 Euros It is kind of strange not to include breakfast but to include tea The walls are paper thin so you here everything in the room next door especially if you have noisy neighbours , They provided afternoon tea free of charge every day from 5 30pm to 8 30pm with delicious tarte aux pommes and macaroons You also get a glass of champagne on the first evening and I also found half a bottle of red wine and macaroons in my room as well as water and soft drinks whilch were included in the package There were tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms but it was also possible to have hot drinks downstairs 24 hours a day 
106283,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, They dont do early check in room service isnt 24 7 in out last days the a c was working fine but dropping water in the floor we didnt inform the hotel and the room service staff didnt fix it, Friendly staff Good Location and the daily happy hours as they serve free drinks and food
106284,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, wifi didnt work in room carpet stained and wooden furniture tired chipped drawer didnt close fridge not mounted Curtains didnt close properly and 2 single beds pushed together doesnt equal a double bed ,No Positive
106285,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Not great at given the full information it s not a free mini bar as it only gets re stocked every 3 days Spoke to the manager who wasn t even bothered wouldn t say it s great for money, The location is useful
106286,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture,No Negative, The location was excellent Only a few steps away from the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees Also Anh Tessa at the front desk was absolutely wonderful so helpful and friendly 
106287,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, The Mattress Not Comfortable No rooms service , I like the Location the staff Hotel Decoration Nice Breakfast Very Good Afternoon Tea in the Lobby 
106288,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, The property needs to invest in sound proof windows It felt like I was sleeping right in the middle of the street The room were less than average , Location was very convenient and central 
106289,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, The only negative I can mention about this hotel is that at this time of the year the heating system was not on and the room was quite chilly especially considering we had a toddler with us Could not wash my daughter as the room was too cold and she did in fact get a cough as without realising I did wash her once We asked if anything could be done and the staff offered more blankets but toddlers kick off blankets kept waking during the night to cover her up , The staff is fantastic and the Hotel Director Phillipe is amazing he takes an interest in all the guests greeting them and making everyone feel welcome Location is great and breakfast too was good with ample choice 
106290,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, This is not a 4 star hotel Our room was old and dirty the walls had mold the carpet had big stains the urinal is was black inside and had toilet paper inside when we first got into the room and all furniture was very cratched up Not even remotely worth the money spent , Fairly good location nice staff
106291,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Paris prices especially for car parking , Everything They provide free soft drinks in the room and a high tea in the early evening Bags are taken to your room by the porter Easy walking distance from the Arc de Triomphe Plenty of brasseries close by 
106292,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, The wifi worked and was easy to get going however I was only able to use it on one device at a time it was also incredibly slow which to me is an annoyance as I love fast wifi speeds However it did work and got the job done so it really wasn t a deal breaker , The best bit about the stay was without a doubt the view from our room We had room 703 which was one of the Junior Suites the view allowed us to see many landmarks including Sacre Coeur and the Eiffel Tower The room had a lovely little balcony with a table and two chairs which allowed us to have a quiet drink and meal on an evening with a spectacular view of the Eiffel Tower which when illuminated enhanced the already brilliant view Twice during our stay the manager of the hotel Phillipe spoke with us and asked us how our trip was so far and if we were enjoying our stay in the hotel and advised us on places to visit and how to get there as well as places to eat and drink I ve stayed in a few hotels and have never had the manager do this so to me this a lovely personal touch It wasn t just us either as we ate we saw him meet and greet other guests in the same manner clearly putting the effort in to ensure guests were happy with their stay The staff were friendly and helpful though my experience was limited with them as I didn t need to interact with them a great deal because there was nothing wrong with the hotel and we had all we needed however when i did deal with them they were helpful in anyway they could be and very polite too 
106293,H tel Etoile Saint Honor by Happyculture, Our 3 rooms were in the older section that needs renovations , Happy Hour was great and the ability to access other Hapoy Cultures was a bonus
