177947,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal,No Negative, The hotel is close to everything and the staff is amazing they were friendly and very helpful The breakfast is excellent We had cocktails at the bar which I would rate as 5 star We will definately stay at this hotel again and I would recommend it to anybody 
177948,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, There is a apparently disconnection between the reception and the concergerie service I travel around the world for bussiness purposes and in my trips I just say make my request one time I don t know if the disconnection was between booking and the hotel I don t think so because even the requests made directly on the phone were not performed as expected or not with the quality and profesionality that would be expected of the services promoted in the webs and advertisings of the hotel Normally I don t complaint and the high price of the services is not an issue for me if I get back a good service for what I m paying for Other misinformation was regarding the service offered by the hotel Meet and Greet it s promoted as a service offered to wait the customers at the airplain door or at least I understood like this Actually the person that received us was waiting for us at the baggage claim aerea We wouldn t get lost in this terminal in Paris It s not Schiphol airport or Frankfort but customer expect something special and even the person was very kind and attend the service is not as special as we expected Also in our trip back to the airport the driver dropped us at the wrong place and we had to walk a bit to find the right place to drop out luggages we were waiting that the driver would escort us till the check in area For a service that cost 290 and 160 there are taxis and other kind of transport services that for much less they perform better and more professional Summarizing Big prices for very normal services The room was good I would say better than normal For a luxury room it was not as good as I saw in my trips for rooms with the price this room had Again I m use to this kind of prices but it s too expensive I think the customer only pays for the location Excellency is something else and I didn t get this in my journey , Very well located hotel boutique hotel If you are familiar with the cold bussiness environment where people even don t look to you this is your hotel If you are looking for a warm hotel where you can feel the people forget it The staff is very nice good concergerie I would put more enphasys in the arrangement and quality of the activities that the concergies organice In my case through booking I made a couple of requests and they were not excellent as I expected for this kind of hotel examples bouquette of roses with an inscription as it was my wedding anniversary the roses were old and not very elegant and the inscription that I requested to put I with the flowers was forgotten Really a pity 2 we arranged a guide with the concergie to take us around in Paris with a chronological trip as said we needed a very simple but nice journey as it was the first time of my partner in Paris above the cost of the arrangement that was exaggerated I was expecting even a super special and well prepared person the trip was as I say correct let s leave it like this my knowledge of the city and historical background was I think better We repeated the tour with one of the guys that makes free tours and it was much much better and professional All the respect for the guide Sophie She was amazing as person but she didn t perform as well as we expected for the price 390 
177949,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Rooms too small even the deluxe Too pricey Only give water in evening at turn down service, Fab location Comfy beds Staff friendly Views onto central courtyard
177950,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal,No Negative, Fantastic location near the Louvre Terrific staff and concierge who recommended a fantastic cafe around the corner I would highly recommend the hotel and wish we could have stayed longer 
177951,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Value for money is extremely poor Breakfast is simple Mini bar prices are laughable Room is very very small, Location is very good Just a few steps away from Louvre and Metro
177952,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Nothing, Everything especially the staff Staff were attentive and very helpful They were so kind as to upgrade us to the homeyroom suite Beautiful room 
177953,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, The wait staff and room service although good could be improved , The staff is very friendly and very knowledgeable Front desk and concierge attentive and result oriented They made us feel very special 
177954,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, The only thing we weren t that happy with and it s not really the hotel s fault is that the rooms the basic standard size are extremely small and there were few places to put our things We were packed for a two week trip and things were tight They did however provide us with a rolling rack on which to hang stuff so it ended up working out ok , The hotel is beautiful and located between the Louvre on one side and the Palais Royal on the other Even though we didn t visit the Louvre we found the location to be ideal for walking to different places We were originally going to stay in the Invalides area and are glad we decided not to The hotel was exceptionally clean and elegant yet not over the top Very tasteful The staff were so nice and accommodating and helped us with all of our questions A simply wonderful experience 
177955,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal,No Negative, Perfect service and wonderful suggestions from the concierge Great breakfast We had a small but cosy and clean room with a relatively big bathroom Excellent location for going by feet and public transport Would definitely come back and fully recommend 
177956,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal,No Negative, The staff and property were wonderful This is my favorite hotel in Paris Tasteful discreet intimate layered and very causal yet sophisticated I plan to be back in the Fall 
177957,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, The one and only and very minor area for improvement would be the buffet breakfast which is quite limited for the price specially when it come to the selection of sliced fruit The room service breakfast I had was outstanding and the restaurant breakfast just didn t match the quality However do not let this stop you from studying at this exceptional hotel , Beautiful boutique hotel in an excellent location Walk to the Louvre and Tuileries gardens and the shops on Rue st Honore The room is a decent size given that it s Paris but is charming and tasteful The bed linen was lovely and the bed was very comfortable As requested I was given a quiet room on the 6th floor which had a small balcony and lovely views plus a bath tub The room had a kettle for making tea which was a welcome addition as many hotels are doing away with this facility All of the staff including the Concierge are friendly welcoming helpful and genuinely go out of the way the can to do anything for you An incredible team of well trained staff who really set this hotel apart by making you feel truly cared for I ate twice in the hotel bar where the staff are true mixologists making exceptional cocktails and I ate what was without exception the best crouque Monsieur I ve ever had You must try it A parting gift of a beautiful book just topped off an incredible stay at a very special hotel that I cannot wait to revisit 
177958,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, The shower drain clogged up Can hear other room doors slamming closed , Very comfortable bed great location next to the louvre balcony friendliest staff made us feel at home and very comfortable 
177959,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, I would rather say that the cost of the breakfast was too high considering all the other possibilities to enjoy and explore that Paris can offer , the location of the hotel is exceptional very friendly and available staff Extremely comfortable bed 
177960,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, The rooms are small we had a deluxe double which I believe is their equivalent of a standard but you can live with that because of all of the above Drinks and food in the hotel are pricey but you re not obliged to dine or drink there These aren t really negatives for us as the hotel is so close to restaurants and bars , The service was excellent as well as the location Our room 412 had a gorgeous view over a courtyard The hotel staff placed macaroons and madelines in the room when we got there The beds are really comfortable and I know I ve said it before but genuinely the loveliest staff from the cleaners the bar tender to reception and concierge Cannot fault this beautiful hotel The hotel is a stones throw away from the Louvre and various other places such as Rue St Honore for restaurants and Rue de Rivoli for shopping Notre Dame is also not too far We had a lovely cocktail in the hotel bar served by a lovely and talented bar tender The hotel decor is clean and elegant 
177961,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, The mattress not comfortable the bed sheets when we cheched in was not clean Since there was no coffee machine in the room we asked for water kettle and the staff said its too hard to find one after talking to the manager , The staff
177962,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, No complaints whatever We plan to go back and stay longer on our next visit , First of all the staff were incredibly helpful and polite The bar was great and our room was clean and a quick walk to many places in Paris It is a more modern contemporary looking hotel definitely luxurious 
177963,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Breakfast choice was slightly limited and a little disappointing, The staff went above and beyond to help and were so friendly They made a special birthday cocktail for my 8 year old daughter for her birthday 
177964,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, The room was extraordinary small and sometimes things like boiled eggs to be extra in breakfast buffet is a little annoying Also for people that have allergic problems the restaurant kitchen is not so flexible and some of the foods came as partly prepared rather than freshelly cooked in cafe and restaurant sections , The cleanliness of the hotel was quiet good and the staff was good enough for an standard 5 star boutique hotel
177965,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, breakfast is overpriced room size is a bit tight though understandable for the Paris centre location, very friendly staff great location and cozy atmosphere excellent service and small but touching gestures of appreciation for the loyalty as I was staying in this hotel before as well 
177966,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, The hotel was not the one I expected The size of the room was too small it lacked a tea coffee machine which is the norm in all 5 star hotels It didnt have a stand where one should put luggage Not enough space in the wardrobe and access is limited the fitness center about which there is a long list in booking com description is a 10 m2 space with four pieces of equipment This is a small boutique hotel not the Grand Hotel of Royals as the name suggests and exxagerated marketing works the other way once you are there , The staff were helpfull 
177967,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, the room is too small they kept it tidy but not as clean as a 5 star hotel should be bathroom corners doors and walls were dirty , comfy bed great breakfast and very nice staff
177968,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, there wasn t anything I didn t like, The staff at the hotel were incredible the concierge had tickets to many museums They recommended restaurants to eat at that were all fantastic 
177969,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Nothing, Everything about this hotel was wonderful I have never stayed in such a lovely hotel The building itself was beautiful The room was lovely with two large windows The shower was the best hotel shower I have experienced They had an evening turn down service which was amazing Breakfast was delicious with an amazing selection of food The bed was very very comfortable The staff could not do enough for you and were very attentive 
177970,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal,No Negative, We had a very enjoyable and comfortable 3 nights stay Location can t be any better with easy walking distance to great attractions restaurants metro etc Yet the property is very discreet once you step in you find yourself whisked away from the crowds and noise I would say it s a good and fair SLH hotel it totally met our expectations Interesting pre dinner cocktails good facilities Carita SPA though no swimming pool friendly and professional staff very clean and generally well maintained property 
177971,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal,No Negative, The staff were fantastic Unfortunately I was sick during my stay and they arranged for me to see a doctor and organized the taxi They were very caring and made me feel calm when I wasn t well The hotel is in an ideal location to explore some of the best sights of Paris The facilities were great and the decor is lovely I will absolutely stay here the next time I m in the city I can t praise the staff enough They were extremely friendly and professional 
177972,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Really impressed by all aspects Difficult to fault in any respect , The staff were excellent and nothing was too much trouble They could not have been more helpful and family friendly This is beautiful little hotel in a great central location but is situated in a quiet side street Facilities were great and everything was clean and very well maintained Strongly recommend a stay here 
177973,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal,No Negative, Excellent hotel every detail handled with care and taste Classy and luxurious but comfortable and friendly Excellent location steps from the Louvre Fantastic breakfast Staff is extremely helpful and cordial Excellent spa facility Wonderful hotel and I would return there next time I m in Paris 
177974,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal,No Negative, When we had an issue with our room the guest manager Mathilde sorted out straight away and was brilliant Hotel is in a fabulous location and our accommodation was excellent 
177975,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Nothing, Location was perfect Breakfast was good Staff very very helpful I was in Paris to celebrate my wife s birthday The hotel gave us a nice gift and also gave us complimentary drink vouchers at the hotel bar They also helped us in making restaurant reservations All in all we really liked the place and the staff 
177976,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, I can t think of anything that I didn t like about the hotel , We loved the location of the hotel and its beautiful and clean rooms real paintings in the rooms Rooms are smallish but do not feel cramped because of thoughtful layout Very comfy beds We broke up our stay and stayed both at the street side and the courtyard side rooms and both were very quiet It is probably worth the money to book a delux room We found hotel staff to be very professional courteous and friendly The breakfast is limited in selection but more than adequate 
177977,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Room was very small even for Parisian standards as well beds were smaller than average it seems, Location staff amazing quality of hotel furnishings beautiful hotel
177978,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, We did have an unpleasant experience when on the second day wanted to try the breakfast buffet A waiter did not allow us to seat in the closest area to the buffet wrongly saying they were booked the reason our skin and race The manager apologized We left the buffet without trying and did not wish to eat there anymore Another comment is about the trash canes not having a plastic bag inside specially the one in the bathroom not hygienic for the personal and the things she or he touches in the room this is something a five star hotel should not save money for , We just used the room did not eat there 
177979,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, I d like to have some Milk with my Nespresso Coffee from the fantastic Coffee Machine on the sideboard Long Life Milk in small packs would be kind a lot of them please, Bed is 7th Heaven Bathroom is 8th Balcony for Smokers with table is 9th heaven the Lulli Bar is 10th AND the Manager ANGEL Mr GERMAIN is 11th Heaven is friendly as a Gentleman can be and kind as a DOG and HELPFUL as a SAMARITAN If you ever run into a problem you can turn to anyone there BUT Mr GERMAIN has the 7 Service for you great Guy and brilliant
177980,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, More wardrobe space but that is being picky , Parisians have a reputation for being unfriendly and snobbish Not so at this hotel where you are made welcome from the minute you set foot in the lobby to the minute you leave And it is or at least seems genuine The hotel is so close to the Louvre you can almost smell the chestnuts roasting in the courtyard Anouck a gem of a concierge my teenage daughters are fans sliced through French beaurocracy to serve up queue free tickets at all the main spots the private tour up the Eiffel Tower is unmissable as we only had two days to zoom around everything She also provided us with an insider s guide to restaurants so we didn t have to rely on the usual search engines and end up disappointed I haven t been to Paris for 30 years and thanks to this place may not leave it so long next time 
177981,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Staff was helpful but if more than one or two people needed assistance the wait was a little long , This hotel is truly beautiful The beds were so comfortable and the toiletries were luxurious It was a little pricey but I would stay here again in a heart beat The location was close enough to everything without being right on top of it 
177982,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Unacceptable service and inconsiderate staff, I arrived there at 4pm when they decided that my room was no longer booked and they bumped me in favor of another client I had no prior warning or email from their Mangement Someone on the reception was just trying to figure out which other hotel in paris to move me to even though I was in town for work for less than 24 hours Extremely unprofessional It s only after I became extremely agitated that they actually gave me my room which implies that there was no need for this whole story or added stress Or they did that stunt to the next client who decided to check in Just unacceptable 
177983,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal,No Negative, The hotel is located right beside the Palace Royale and the Louvre The rooms were excellent and had a lovely view of the courtyard The concierge desk went above and beyond to help me plan a very special occasion for myself and my fianc Special mention to Baptiste thanks again for all your help 
177984,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, room facility could be improved no coffee machine or tea maker in the room, Location and staff very nice little hotel in centre of paris good value will stay again 
177985,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal,No Negative, Very friendly and helpful service Loved the View Enjoyed the workout room the tea and fruit offered and the Hamaam Boutique hotel like a art museum Fits perfectly with the area 
177986,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, The rooms are very nice but small we stayed at 615 of which dressing area bathroom and toilet are of sufficient space but the room itself is simply to small, Very impressed by the staff of this beautiful hotel Whatever they could do they did to make our stay even more comfortable We felt at home 
177987,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, The room was quite small but nice The concierge was not informed about vital information important to travelers We were taking a day trip to Versailles and inquired where to catch the train We had tickets for a tour so our time was limited when we got to the recommended train station it was closed for construction as was the entire train line We stopped a Taxi and asked where to catch a train but he didn t know so we paid him to drive us to Versailles So disappointing and when we told the concierge she was surprised but didn t offer to do anything for us ,No Positive
177988,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal,No Negative, Couldn t fault the staff extremely helpfull and the congierge was amazing Great location opposite the Louvre food was excellent both for breakfast and dinner
177989,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, This is not 5 stars hotel The room was small For me iron is the main room equipment No coffee tea facilities in room , Location Very very friendly staff 
177990,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, No complaints , Beautiful hotel with exceptional accommodations The staff was warm friendly and very helpful The concierge Antione advised and took care of all our tour planning while in Paris The location is perfect The Louvre is across the street We will be back 
177991,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, The air conditioning struggled with the high temperatures and our children s suite shower drain smelt at times , Wonderful location and superbly attentive staff sincere and very helpful Great service Rooms rather small but well appointed and very clean 
177992,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Everything was superb , Excellent service throughout our stay from the first moment and up until departure with staff kindly offering water bottles to take with us for the ride to the airport We loved hamam and tees and refreshments provided at the spa area Our suite was great too very comfortable for 3 people 
177993,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Nothing really , The most amazing hotel stay in my life Our honeymoon plan went disastrously wrong as we initially planned to go to Nice via Istanbul when tragic events hit both cities As an alternative we chose to stay in Paris and we were somewhat disappointed with the last minute changes in our honeymoon plan But these guys at the Grand Hotel du Palais Royal pulled out a magic and lifted our honeymoon spirit up from the rock bottom I know honeymoon room upgrades cannot be generalized to all visitors but still the service and the rooms were just amazing and the pleasant surprise with an upgrade to the Panoramic Suite for the last night left us speechless and put the icing on the cake I will definitely stay at this hotel again for my future visits to Paris 
177994,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful The rooms were clean and the beds comfortable The conceirge was very very friendly and helpful The hotel is in a good location close to The Louvre Overall great experience

177996,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Our junior suite was very modestly sized even by Parisian standards , The staff were extremely attentive and very helpful Location was a 5 minute walk to the Louvre 
177997,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, The bathroom was small, The hotel has a boutique feel and is in a fantastic location It is close to the metro and barely a block from the Louvre Most of the other major museums attractions like the D Orsay Pompidou Tulleries St Germain are a short walk The staff is very professional and the property is well maintained I would not hesitate to stay here again 
177998,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, No complaints, It was so conveniently located in the heart of Paris but the best thing was its staff which is extremely friendly To get such service and smile in an otherwise arrogant Paris makes such a difference They take care of small details Loved restaurant recommendations
177999,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal,No Negative, The very obliging staff Always ready with helpful advise despite our lack of French Arranged our tours etc effortlessly and most importantly always with a smile The decor was absolutely beautiful No frills just classically chic You left us with a very memorable Paris experience Thank you
178000,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Breakfast was a little disappointing and service was slow Drinks at the bar were pricey , Location was excellent Spa was very good and reception and concierge staff were extremely good 
178001,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Our only disappointment is that we had to leave , Absolutely the most charming hotel with the most attentive and intuitive staff in the most wonderful location 
178002,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Room was a little small Massage was a little bit expensive but quality was great , Service was excellent especially the front desk and concierge Spa was great Location was also great

178004,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, The room was the size of the bed I was shocked the minute I enter the room and Bath room was very small This is not Five Star I have paid less for better Hotels in Paris Actually I book my return in another hotel Bigger room Had Little Kitchen Beautiful bathroom with less price with Balcony Same location Actually Better location The Lounge Drink was included The price for breakfast less and Better breakfast , It was Clean but Over priced 
178005,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Not a thing A great hotel , Lovely boutique hotel perfectly located near the Louvre in Paris Beautiful comfortable and exceptional staff attentive helpful kind A fantastic find in Paris I will go back again and again 
178006,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Not getting a card the second night to tell me about the weather , All the staff were charming We were also given small cakes in our room on the first night together with a card telling us what the weather would be like the next day so that we could plan our day

178009,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Staff was a little judge mental when I could not locate my computer I checked in with it but did not check out with it It was upsetting , I love the location the rooms and all the amenities 
178010,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Upon checking in it was very cold as the reception area is facing to the outside the outside temperature at that time was almost 0 degree Used the Turkish bath downstairs and the facility is for both men and women showers also I was feeling uncomfortable to hear men s talking just outside the sauna room since I was alone with only a bath towel wrapped around myself Although the change rooms are separated for men and women there is no separate wall between the rooms so when you just step out from the lady s room or a shower booth you may see unknown men just in front of you , The room was very quiet it was great to recover from a long flight Nice welcome sweets and a bottle of Evian in the room Staff are very friendly and professional The room bed linen and towels were always very clean

178014,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal,No Negative, The staff at the hotel were some of the most professional and helpful i have come across in a hotel Nothing was too much trouble for them to make our stay as comfortable as possible and the reccomendations that the hotel concierge made were excellent The hotel is in a great location being a stones throw away from the Lourve and nearby to some nearby cafes and bars We had a superior rom and the facilities were very good The shower was great with a large monsoon shower head as well as an additional detachable shower for me the bed and the shower can make or break a hotel The bed was very comfortable and the hotel was very peaceful so we slept very well both nights Also really good to see a full length mirror in the room 
178015,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Breakfast too expensive Lots of choice locally so we explored and ate outside, The hotel is marvellous Everything we could have wished for Friendly helpful staff and incredibly quiet for a very central location Good cocktail bar Very helpful concierge for eating out and explorations 
178016,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, The only slight disappointment was breakfast it was so so little choice and one had to wait up to 10 minutes for coffee to be served, Location decoration room we were upgraded very helpful and kind staff especially the concierge 
178017,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal,No Negative, The location of the hotel was perfect I had informed the hotel that the reason for our trip was my daughter s birthday The staff were very friendly and gave us not just one but two up grades to a Junior suite which had beautiful views over the roof tops of Paris As a luxurious hotel it had a very welcoming and relaxed atmosphere I would recommend it to anyone

178023,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, You needed to be about 7ft tall to reach the shelves in the wardrobe , A lovely boutique hotel located in the heart of Paris The staff were really friendly and the room was very comfortable 
178024,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, We checked in later afternoon on the day and we just simply wanted to sleep Housekeeping tried to come in but cannot as I had locked the door The house keeping was so insisted they called in and ask if we need any service Guess we would call if we need any help , Just the right proportion in all aspects The hotel is big enough to equip with everything but not too big so crowded with too many guests Breakfast is excellent Just appropriate Will not waste unnecessary food Everything well thoughts and achieved an excellent balance

178030,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Our view was of a rundown area with peeling paint hugely disappointing Also the room literally had no floor area for a suitcase without it being in the path around the bed We put one bag on the desk area and had to step around the others Way to small for a room in a 5 star hotel I have stayed in other 5 star hotels in this area in Paris and they offered nicer views and larger rooms , The location and staff were great The food was excellent 
178031,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Breakfast was expensive but worth it as so nice I would have really liked coffee tea facilities in the room , Gorgeous room although small was really lovely very happy Staff were so friendly could not have been nicer Fantastic breakfast 
178032,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Smaller room that we expected but fogot about how common that is in Paris It was functional , Quiet room with small balcony and if you leaned a bit could see Eifflel Tower light show Very comfy bed and hotel is in a great location to walk to many restaurants and musems etc 
178033,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, The room was small but that s what you get in the middle of Paris Real estate is at a premium , Beautiful hotel in a super convenient location It s a small hotel and it felt intimate The staff was so gracious and attentive 10 all the way 
178034,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Didn t get the room with view and patio as booked Also the room with view of louvre is very misleading Everything was fine but nothing spectacular for the price We live in NY and travel throughout Europe often in 5 star hotels I left this hotel disappointed , Good location 
178035,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, the room was very small unexpected for 5 star hotel The price for such a small room was high, The staff is very kind and professional I liked also a breakfast and restoran atmosphere
178036,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Uhmm nothing Maybe the TV was responding slow , Everything was perfect Staff was really polite We ve received gifts after checking in it was perfect 
178037,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, The room was not what I expected and a bit smelly from some chemical cleaning not really what you would love to get at the boutique hotel at the middle of Paris, Good location nice entrance and disign 
178038,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, Nothing, This hotel is located on a very quiet street yet conveniently close to major subway stops Our room was small but well appointed and the front desk staff concierge were very accommodating 
178039,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal, The rooms was a little smaller than expected , The staff of the hotel was incredibly helpful and kind and the location was fabulous Had a little balcony off of our room where you could see the top of the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower 
178040,Grand H tel Du Palais Royal,No Negative, I was planning on proposing to my girlfriend and notified the hotel of this The management of the whole event was superb even down to the flowers champagne and complimentary upgrade The rooms were beautiful as was the food and the location was perfect for those wanting to see the Louvre and attractions on the river front Planning to stay here many more times in the future I literally couldn t find even the smallest thing to complain about
