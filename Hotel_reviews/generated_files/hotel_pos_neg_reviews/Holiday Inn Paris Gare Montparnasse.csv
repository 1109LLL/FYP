245325,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, Parking place too small and don t have two way traffic It looks like that you have to drive to a lower level however when you do that you will get a closed door so hard to drive slaloms back backwards slope up in a small place We had booked two rooms both rooms didn t had towers in the bathroom and only one bottle welcome water , Good location nice breakfast also at the end of the breakf time friendly staff 
245326,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, nothing major to complain about , Location is great Easy access to two metro stations Supermarket bar restaurants near by Having the Tour Montparnasse tower nearby was a great landmark to find the hotel when endlessly walking the beautiful streets of Paris 
245327,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, Two days of room cleaning were missed of a 4 night stay resulting in my having to call reception and ask for the job to be completed There was a shortage of toilet paper on day 2 A rep came up to give me a half a roll as he couldn t find any more He was obviously embarrassed but did eventually came back sometime later with a complete roll One of the bathroom sink drains was blocked I had to request it be fixed It did get fixed There are areas that could afford repair The back patio has loose wooden tiles that should be fixed There is an accident waiting to happen Clearly some of the furniture is old and needs replacing or fixing The clothes drying rack in the washroom wasn t working and the staff said they weren t going to fix it The room was very small Little space for 2 people to put their clothes so we left them in the suitcase Overall the breakfast was good but the veggies were not fresh Some of the channels were not working CNN for example I reported the problem twice and nothing was done about it Staff was nice but I think they are stretched I don t blame them rather I put the responsibility on the management of Holiday Inn Your 4 star hotel rates a 3 at best We were hoping for more , The staff was very friendly The location is very central The breakfasts is decent 
245328,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, The only thing I didn t like was our door was left wide open by the maid Luckily we had only been out a short while and nothing was missing but this could have been a lot worse Apart from this the hotel was great and I d stay here again , The metro is literally right outside the hotel The room was very nice and the bed was really comfy which was great after the longs days walking around the city 
245329,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, absurdly overpriced the normal price of the hotel is about 100 euros most of time but booking com charged us 330 euros per night which is totally absurd When we were booking the hotel we did not know the fair price of the hotel and the reception at the moment did not remind us either If we go to the reception and have an ask the price at that moment would be around 200 euros We totally understand that the price would go up if the demand is high or else reasons but it does not mean that the price can soar into sky super rude staff a staff called Wiliam the supervisor on the morning was really rude We were discussing about the price issue described above and at first we were really polite and we only asked for a fair price say 200 euro per night but Wiliam did not even give us a smile but replied mechanically that they cannot give us ANY discount He meant that we have to pay the price discussed above even though everyone knows that it is ridiculous since we are stupid More annoyingly when we were having conversation for some times he stopped and talked to another customer without any explanation and he was muttering something in French which I don t think would be something good I asked him why he ended our conversation abruptly and he said every customer has only 15 minutes of conversation he also talked to us in front of another customer that we have occupied too much time letting another customer wait too long but there were at least three staff on the front desk no towel yeah you hear me in a four star hotel there was only one towel in the room one night We asked the front desk one staff only replied Sorry we are out of stock Sadly sorry means nothing and does not solve any problem cemetery behind the hotel of course the hotel won t tell you that until you check in There are two headings one to the cemetery and one to the main road which is noisy ,No Positive
245330,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, Wallpaper was torn in our room and we couldn t open our window to aerate the room The linens also had a funny smell , Great location subway station right infront of the hotel 6 stops away from champs elysees
245331,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, Limited choice for breakfast The underground parking is very dirty One elevator under renovation , Confortable room very close to Montparnasse train station Kind staff Lot of restaurant at proximity 
245332,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse,No Negative, This is a great hotel for business close to the Montparnasse train station so easy access to all kind of modes of transport Certainly will be considered next time I vacation in Paris the location is really awesome with a nice lively street next door and access to 3 different metro lines in less than 10 min walk Great rooms comfortable well appointed Overall really satisfied booking com has outdone itself as usual 
245333,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, I didn t like that I had to slam my bedroom door in order to close it That is my only complaint and it was annoying having to pull very hard each time to close it , I thought the rooms were well appointed and the staff was very accommodating I also thought that it was conveniently located as the Gaite metro stop is right outside the hotel s front door 
245334,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, There was no mineral water in the room and no mini bar in comparison with the Kowloon Holiday Inn and Mumbai Holiday Inn The corridor to my room 1st floor had a non finished wall and one of the wall lamps had a broken cover Due to the poor light it looked really spooky when I went to my room at 11pm the first night of my arrival ,No Positive
245335,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, Everything was alright but the centre was a little bit far By walk it is about 30 min , The place was very good It is little bit far from city centre but metro station is about 5 metres from hotel so you can go anywhere with metro Personal was very helpful rooms clean

245339,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, Two staff members on in the morning were very helpful in swapping my room following being woken in the night twice by the stench of sewage in my room Staff on in the evening didn t really have a good grasp of English which didn t help checking in I asked for directions to a race my son was to run again I asked the same staff members for directions and the internet wasn t working well at all therefore no directions for me advice was to get a uber I paid for my stay upon arrival and upon check it was told I need to pay government tax again I had no idea what they were on about as they didn t explain nothing to me upon arrival And following the smell of sewage and very poor wifi which lost signal so frequently it was ridiculous and that the heated towel rail had its dial hanging off by the exposed wires I was so angry Overa would never return , Two daytime staff members were nice and helpful 
245340,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, Negotiating the French underground without escalators or lifts at lower levels but the French people were very friendly and helpful It was a little disappointing that our hotel provided only one large bath towel and gave us a small hand towel to use instead saying that we were lucky to have it as it was the last one We discovered this lack of provision at 10 00 pm at night , A particularly good wine restaurant nearby and easy access to the train station

245342,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, The rooms were generally nice but there were some deficiencies one room had a bit of water leakage one room had an issue with the toilet In addition we booked one room separately not via Booking and this created confusion with the payments etc for which I needed the assistance of Booking to resolve it Booking did a really good job there , Breakfast was good though personnel was a bit understaffed to arrange for all guests The personnel was very friendly and willing to assist in problems

245348,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, The place was constantly under renovation with many of its facilities not working including the elevator and air conditioning Mostly beware if anyone there suggests taking an airport shuttle I paid a deposit for one which never showed up at the agreed upon time and I had to strongly encourage a staff member to return my money This hotel needs a new plan , The staff most who were friendly and helpful despite the challenging conditions 
245349,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, Breakfast is very poor not enough variety and very expensive the room doors are not fixed properly and every time someone shuts the door they wake you up very loud one of the lifts wasn t working Never enough bread or juice always had to ask and wait for everything coffee is terrible Not enough towels provided in your room, The two male staff at the reception were great and also the staff at the breakfast Metro very close which is handy

245360,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, I arrived in from a transatlantic night flight and had hoped to be able to get a few hours sleep when I arrived at the hotel at 3pm but the hotel is being renovated and drilling went on until 5pm Strange as I had said to the receptionist when I checked in that I wanted a quiet room and she did not say anything about the possibility of hearing a drill , I had requested a high floor with a room away from the elevator and got that The bed was very comfortable and the room clean The hotel is about a 2 minute walk from Montparnasse train station Around the corner from the hotel there are several small theaters and lots of restaurants also

245368,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, We did not take the breakfast too expensive 15 euros compared to German breakfast 8 50 euros also the choice and quality of the food cannot be compared Apparently the Germans complained to the staff about it , The location near the Gare Montparnasse
245369,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, some of the staff were wonderful but not super keen to help One staff in particular seemed unable e and uncertain about helping me with a dilemma at all , Neat clean tidy great position
245370,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, The heating in the lobby It was uncomfortably hot and the staff had some bo due to wearing suits in the heat Takeaway food had been left on the balcony which made the room smell slightly and someone had been smoking on the balcony which also went into our room , Top floor room really big Friendly staff Good value for money Didn t blow my mind but comfortable accomendation

245373,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, The area was a little rough prostatutes on the streets less than 50m from the hotel front door and a road of interesting establishments less than 50 metres from the hotel front door I wanted to stay very central it was heard to determine the area until we got there it s not what it s described as from that perspective However the hotel was clean and the staff where very friendly and attentive speaking excellent English which is a real bonus The dining room could be improved as it s small and to close to the lobby it s basically in the lobby Also you ended up sitting on tables with others which isn t great if you just want to sit with your family A few touches would change this The breakfast selection is good though , Metro station right outside the hotel excellently convenient to travel

245386,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, The car park has only 10 spaces so it is worthwhile to ring up and reserve a space prior to your booking Also the toilets and sinks were across the hall from each other which was odd , Beds had very comfortable and different types of cushions to suit everyone Excellent location right next to a metro which you can use to access the whole of Paris 
245387,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, The WiFi signal was very poor and hardly working , The bed was really comfy Location near the train station was perfect for us It is a reasonable distance from touristic attractions too

245393,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, Drains in the sinks did not work Tub too tall and dangerous for older women to get in and out Baseboards were not dusted and thick with dust and carpets were not swept The sheer curtains hung off the hooks and were never adjusted The black out curtain was frayed and dirty Coffee cups were put back with previous lipstick on the rim and not cleaned Glass drinking glasses were never replaced No supervision of the cleaning personnel , The breakfast was good most of the 5 days we were there 
245394,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse,No Negative, The location near the Montparnasse station can t be beat as it s also a big metro hub and easy to go anywhere from there Also there are buses going back and forth to the airport stopping right there much more comfortable than the metro with luggage as everyone can sit down and they put the luggage down the bus Very comfortable hotel great bed great breakfast buffet
245395,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, The staff Some of them are not the most friendly person only 1 out of 4 staff I encountered that is actually nice Before coming to France I heard the French are not friendly and proud It turned out to be half true half wrong In Lourdes people turned out to be nice However in Paris people turned out to be rude , The bed is the best The room looks luxurious and it does imo It is clean the bed is huge there is also sofa bed The bathroom is nice as well

245397,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse,No Negative, We can only say all the best about our stay at this hotel We give our highest score to the reception staff comfort and housekeeping We are a young couple that were on the go for our entire stay which means that we needed a big breakfast to conquer all the beauty that Paris has to offer us as tourists we needed a comfortable bed and some peace and quiet in the night and thats what we got Also a good thing about this hotel is the location We were so close to all the happenings but still in a part of the city where we could experience the typical small streets boutiques creperies and brasseries

245423,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, Was a bit too warm in the room and difficult to control the temperatue e, Very convenient to Gare Montparneasse with plenty of restaurants near by Hotel staff were friendly and room was clean a small fair amount of room 
245424,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, The staff was a bit snooby The room a was small the air condition did not work nor did the window but the hotel did change our room which was great because we had the window opened the bad thing was that the room was even smaller then the first , I loved the fact that there was a metro right outside the hotel Location 
245425,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, Due to the busy location a lot of street noise woke me frequently during the night So maybe better glazing would help with that issue This is my only criticism , Staff were very helpful and friendly room comfortable clean warm Lots of restaurants nearby 
245426,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, There were no outlets in the bathroom so I could not blow dry or curl my hair I had to stand in the hallway to use a plug and stretch to look at myself in the hall mirror I had a nonsmoking room but I had to go through a smoked filled hallway to get to my room The maids closet was next door and they were extremely loud I also asked for a full bed and they just pushed two twins together They only serve breakfast for 18 euros which I though was steep , I liked the fact that everything was within walking distance restaurants shops train and bus stations Montparnasse is a beautiful town The receptionists all spoke English which was very comforting Everyone in the city was so friendly and most spoke English 
245427,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, We had a room to the street side and that was very busy and noisy For that reason we could not open the windows It was quite warm in the room and opening a window would have helped For the rest all was fine , The very friendly staff 
245428,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, When we arrived we realized that there was only one towel and the staff s answer was that we had to wait until late afternoon before we could get one more towel We also wanted to have two keycards but that was impossible to get It s the directors rule we were told So when my husband was out running early in the morning I had to stumble in the dark to reach the toilet and I could forget my reading , We enjoyed the breakfast and that the hotel is situated near the Metro 
245429,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, THE HOTEL WAS LOVELY BUT IT IS JUST STANDARD MAYBE SHOP ABOUT SAME AREA IF YOU WANT A BIT MORE LUXURY , GREAT LOCATION CLOSE TO TRAIN STATION AND 25MIN WALK TO TOURIST HOTSPOTS GREAT FOOD DRINK GREAT SHOPPING NICE PLACE TO SIT AND JUST WATCH EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING 
245430,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, When I was checking out early morning there was a long queue and only one staff member to help It was a very slow process , The location is fantastic for a transit stopover with the Gare Montparnasse in proximity and the Roissy Bus to from the airports 
245431,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, When I booked the hotel I included breakfast as part of the rate and requested for gluten free breakfast At first they told me that breakfast was extra at 15 Euros per person but when I showed the reservation they provided breakfast at no extra cost There was no gluten free bread for breakfast and when I asked them they nodded like it is what it is even though they told us that they would provide This was the only hotel during our 2 weeks of travel in France that did not provide what we requested , Being near Gare Montparnasse is a big plus You can access the metro and train lines as well as bus to either of airports pretty easily The station is about one and one half block away 
245432,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, The price was to expensive for the service they provide They didn t have room service The personal of reception was terrible The room was too small The parking should be including on the room price , The only moment that we were treat it good was only the guy from the breakfast He was servicial and polaid 
245433,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse,No Negative, Superb location immediately 2 mins walk from Montparnasse station and used the local metro stop at Gaite to access other parts of Paris which is immediately outside the hotel 
245434,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, Rooms are very small it was not mentioned in the room description that it is 12m2 Bathrooms are not clean pipes are blocked, Metro station few steps from hotel Freindly staff
245435,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, Would have been nice if the room sizes were a little bigger though I am sure they had that option which I did not see when booking Window was broken so was unable to open it but the air conditioning more than suited our needs, I liked the friendly and informative staff The check in was quick the location is amazing and so close the train line 
245436,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, you can hear all through the door the cling lady just very straight come to the room without even waiting the permission no water in the room poor breakfast, my room was faced to the garden cemetery very quiet
245437,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, Internet is very unstable Most of the time is offline For business trip that need Internet most of the time can forget this hotel , The room is nice and clean Location is near train station and convenient Lots of restaurants around 
245438,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, value for money score is low because I found the room price too expensive for a simple single i e child s bed direct neighborhood Blvd du Maine not very Parisien so very low on ambiance, great location for quick easly access to train station
245439,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, I asked for quiet room they gave me a room in front the main street with a lot of noise They forgont the towel in the room I call 3 times and wait for 45 min to have a shower the bed was unconfortable first very bed experience in holiday inn , it is really close to metro and to a lot of restaurants 
245440,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, One of two lifts was not working properly it happens normally No problem The problem was anouncement of Hotel Staff Only one written A4 paper was attached to lift door in the floors and warning of not using Is it enough for Kids Olds and who may not see the page I heard one was shouting since she had used the lift without noticing the anounce paper ,No Positive
245441,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, The ambience did not reflect a Holiday Inn quality Hotel The beds were not comfortable at all Toilet was not clean This seems to be a n old property not well maintained The housekeeping was not upto the mark The used spoons from the coffee trays were not washed for the next day They were left as it is , People at the reception were good Location of the hotel is good it has good access to restaurants and metro 
245442,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, Unfriendly and u helpful staffs Slow and small lift Limited choice of breakfast No bell boy service, Except the location we don t like anything about this hotel First they rated as 4 star hotel We arrived with 3 luggages and no bell boy and we have to carry our luggage to our own room We booked twin room but they gave us triple bed and made the room too squeeze Requested to remove 1 bed out of outreach room but they have no staff available to do that after5 pm Went downstairs to borrow staple for nylon document to use a while back in my room They claimed they only have 2 stapler and asked me bring my documents down to do in lobby The staffs are unfriendly unhelpful n never know how to smile The toilet is very smelly The good thing is their WiFi is very fast Near the hotel They have this very good vietnam restaurant Very authentic and taste good Super recommended must try Please don t try any Japanese food around there It taste horrible anyway very unhappy stay in this hotel Will never come back next stay Overrated Please improve on service for this price

245446,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, I believe we got what we expected paid for The air conditioning in our room could have worked better though in all fairness it was exceptionally hot muggy outside when we stayed there , We had to catch an early train out of Montparnasse train station so the hotel s location was perfect I wouldn t necessarily stay in this area on a sightseeing trip to Paris but if you need to travel onwards by TGV to the West of France the location is top Rooms are standard not overly large but clean At EUR 15 breakfast isn t overpriced Relatively good selection of breakfast items including eggs 
245447,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, when we leave asked the recetionpist to call a taxi after10 15 mins the taxi arrived and we when got on the car the price was already 12 euros I asked why he said it was the cost he drived to the hotel If we were not happy this he can cut the money at the end but he took us into a traffic jam later which I already told him to avoid at the end he didnt cut th e money and locked our luggages if we didnt give him the money to met this situation I was so disppointed at the hotel we trust hotel so let them to call a taxi for us but it led us to dangerous situation, breakfast location price
245448,Holiday Inn Paris Gare Montparnasse, terrible wifi it did not work many times and we were explained it was due to high guests quantity lol Location far away from tourists sights but close to metro stations We asked for private parking at time of booking but when we arrived parking lot was full and yet we were charged for it though it was removed when I informed they own parking lot was full , Modern rooms with decent roominess and comfortable beds
