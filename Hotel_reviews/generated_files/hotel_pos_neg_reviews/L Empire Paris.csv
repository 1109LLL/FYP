194356,L Empire Paris, Missing a workout room spa etc After a long walk around Paris it would be nice to relax in a spa Although our room had a wonderful extra large Jacuzzi tub which was very nice to unwind , The Staff was amazing From check in to check out your entire staff was very friendly professional and helpful I recommend this place to many family friends and co workers The hotel is very updated and modern with stylish rooms and bathrooms The food was superb The maids were the best The location was convenient next to the Louvre 1 block away and other sites 
194357,L Empire Paris, The breakfast was quite limited and didn t have much of a variety , When we arrived we were greeted by Sonya at the front desk who was very friendly and gave us so much info and help All the staff of the hotel were very friendly and professional Our rooms were bigger than we expected and the beds were very comfortable Location was within walking distance to the Louvre and alot of restaurants and shops around too Overall we had a great stay and definitely recommend this hotel 
194358,L Empire Paris, The Nespresso machine was in the room which is great but there was no capsules The cabinet had no hangers to hang the clothes The was some noise even when the windows are closed , Very supportive staff We checked in late at 9pm and we were surprised that we were upgraded to a better bigger room 
194359,L Empire Paris,No Negative, The room was huge we booked a double and got a king size bed with a very large bathroom Staff was friendly and booked us an early cab to the airport No complaints 
194360,L Empire Paris, Air conditioning difference between the bed room Colder and the living room Disappointed about The status of the elevator Checking and some part broken Iron mark on the floor Torn Hanger I was upgrading but when I book I choose specifically a single bed I did not want to have a coach for me not really confortable with the upgrade I got it 0 We arrived at 3 but the room was set up for 2 only Not enough towels Even the coffee was free in the bed room we did not have enough capsule for 3 peoples I came also for the SPA we asked to the entrance how was the process They said that they will phone and come to pick up us in the bed room Could have 5 minutes delay After 15 minutes delay I called and another person said to us that it was ready and we should go down In the discussion to order the SPA I am pretty sure that 2 glasses of Champagne were included I was surprised to find on my facture the 2 glasses to pay extra The Jacuzzy was not set for 2 peoples Not confortable for the second one , The location of the Hotel was good Air conditioning I was upgrading when I arrived Staff is Friendly and smiling
194361,L Empire Paris,No Negative, Perfect stay for my surprise birthday trip to Paris Close to public transport for the airport and walking distance to tourist attractions Beautiful spacious rooms and friendly helpful staff Great buffet breakfast We would definitely stay here again 
194362,L Empire Paris,No Negative, The staff was excellent they were very friendly and definitely took the time to speak with you and get to know you a little I arrived early to check in so they gave me a complimentary upgrade to one of their two suites free of charge Definitely a great hotel and it centered perfectly in Paris just a short walk to several landmarks Shopping and restaurants are right on the corner with many more jus a few minutes away by walking Perfect location 
194363,L Empire Paris,No Negative, Staff were extremely helpful with directions etc Also i left something behind in the room and they arranged to post it to me Great location clean comfortable room 
194364,L Empire Paris, The hotel was gloomy with dark dirty carpets with halls filled of an odor of chlorine mixed with vanilla messy with big sacs of laundry everywhere in and out of the elevator and noisy they were repairing sth for three days in a row The bed was uncomfortable especially the pillows and also the duvet quilt was very thick and heavy , We liked the location and the fact that the room was spatious 
194365,L Empire Paris, every thing is not for 4 star hotel iron shirt take two days bad cleaning we cant use spa and pool because is booked for out side the hotel even you cant see it no lobby in the hotel we don t have to take a breath in the hotel everything is small , location only
194366,L Empire Paris,No Negative, staff offered special service like printing out tickets reserved online recommendations to restaurants transportation Private phone for use during stay with free calls and internet access Nespresso in room
194367,L Empire Paris, Nothing, Everything was great they were extremely friendly always smiling whenever we need anything they were helping directly the room was very clean large the bed was comfortable The location is near everything for sure next time in Paris I will reserve in the same hotel many thanks for all the stuffs 
194368,L Empire Paris, I loved everything , Large room and beautifully appointed Spa bathroom with bathrobes and slippers Bed was very comfortable Staff were very helpful and accommodating Location was perfect 
194369,L Empire Paris, Nothing to declare , The people who works there are very helpful and frienfly The room was fantastic the cleaning perfect and also was a nespresso machine in to the room that are essential for an Italian The Position is very good and strategic to visit Paris I will put in my Favourites 
194370,L Empire Paris, The lift was out of service for one night when we had heavy luggage to carry up to the 3rd floor by stair , Helpful in providing hot water and clarity on the checkout bill
194371,L Empire Paris, That I only stayed 3 days, Staff were absolutely amazing breakfast was lovely room was clean and tidy and modern definitely visit again Also close to all Paris attractions 
194372,L Empire Paris, Not necessarily the fault of the hotel but we were in a street facing room and even on the 6th floor the street noise was very bad late night drinkers on the weekend morning construction noise on the weekdays , The staff was great everyone was very friendly and helpful The hotel was clean and well maintained Also a very good location walking distance to many sites and shopping and only a block from the Metro The breakfast was good though I don t know that I d pay separately for it The standard rooms are small but probably a better value than the upgraded larger rooms which are nice but perhaps overpriced 
194373,L Empire Paris, They can change the hours for breakfast For me it s too early from 7 to 10 when you party all night But no big deal about this small problem, Everything was perfect from the hotel to the staff and food and services No regrets at all
194374,L Empire Paris, Stains on the bedsheets in the room They had to be changed It was explained it was a problem from the dry cleaners , Comforable Friendly staff Good breakfast
194375,L Empire Paris, We paid for a deluxe but they tried to put us into a standard room We then waited 40min for them to clean the correct room Very over priced Bathroom shower smelled odourous Overall unsatisfactory , Very little Deluxe room was adequately spacious 
194376,L Empire Paris,No Negative, Everything was of a very good level I was very happy with the hotel I know Paris and you usually end up in small rooms and low quality At the Empire I had nothing to complain about 
194377,L Empire Paris, Hotel looks shabby and needs update here and there Mold in bathtub pump in 4 hotel No ventilation fan in bathroom No hairdryer, Location is relatively good Spacious rooms Kind staff
194378,L Empire Paris, We would love to stay here again and would perhaps like to try a different room Ours was below street level and was very adequately lit with natural light by virtue of a central opening in the building itself And the room itself was spacious and comfortable We were just a little surprised to be going down to bed rather than up LOL , While enroute from southern Sweden to Breton my Swedish wife had to attend a business meeting in Paris We had our friendly labrador Nelly with us as well We needed a hotel which was 1 at least near the 3 me arrondissement if not in it 2 had parking and 3 was pet friendly L Empire Paris was a great choice Extremely warm and helpful staff Really They welcomed Nelly took care of the car and followed up to make sure we were comfortable once settled in The location is great too just a block and a half from the Louvre And there are plenty of restaurants in every direction although we do not recommend you chose La Poule au Pot which we choose on our own so not the hotel s fault We took Nelly for an absolutely magical walk along the Seine in the evening and then through the Mandela Garden and surrounding area in the morning The generous breakfast was pleasant and informal After breakfast they brought our car to the front door Wow Tr s gentil 
194379,L Empire Paris, Our room was not the room we thought we had booked there website wasn t accurate Our bed was covered in hairs the buffet was awful and our trip was ruined due to the experience of our hotel ,No Positive
194380,L Empire Paris, Sitting arrangements for breakfast If you are sitting along the wall on one of the long benches It is hard to get in and out without bumping or disturbing your neighbor to your left and right , Love the free phone and the decor Will definitely recommend this hotel to others
194381,L Empire Paris,No Negative, Very good located beside main attractions Very nice and helpful staff Manuel from the reception was exceptionally helpful with his kindness and good tips to make our stay a great experience 
194382,L Empire Paris, The beds were ok Not the best not the worst it was very hot when we were there and we had a room on the top floor It was too hard for the air conditioning to cool off our room If it wasn t hot it would have been an awesome room However the staff were very accommodating and moved us to a much cooler room , The location was close to the river and a metro stop 
194383,L Empire Paris, It needs a face cleaning rooms are fine but corridors and elevator are a bit old Breakfast is not specially good such untasty croissants in France , Very good location and very kind people
194384,L Empire Paris, Too much charge for an additional bed You can not cancell the resevation but only to accept this incredible charge It s like a rob 100 , Execllent location 
194385,L Empire Paris, Broken commode seat Faucet to turn on water for tub stuck in off mode Window casing loose could not close window, The staff was very friendly and helpful Breakfast very good 
194386,L Empire Paris, There was never anyone eating in the hotel restaurant over evenings of our 4 nt stay The Hotel is one block south and so was sufficiently away from Les Halles gardens which is inaccessable full of contractors site offices This impinged onto the view spectacle of the new roof , Located in a smart side street with several restaurants and bars but little traffic Turn the corner and there was the Louvre Check in expected us The Superior rooms 269 sq ft very spacious lovely ensuite bath with shower over but room looked onto courtyard which was rather bleak I had previously requested room a view so perhaps no superior rooms onto the street 
194387,L Empire Paris, the color of hotel was black almost everything black Poor breakfast choices don t go late for breakfast 9 30 there is no refill of food No welcome drink as they told us it would be before we booked , big room and bathroom modern Nice staff 
194388,L Empire Paris, male staff was on duty by 24th night 25th early morning was not friendly All other staff were good except this male staff member who was on duty , good
194389,L Empire Paris, Nothing , High appreciation of the staff especially the lady that was on reception on 13 of April till check out on 14 do not remember the name very helpful communicable and just pleasant It would be a pleasure to be hosted at your hotel next time thanks 
194390,L Empire Paris, Actually I don t think the room is clean enough The room I stayed the layout was so weird long hallway to reach my bed Toilet is located right in front of the front door and I felt like I need to make a trip to use it There is the weird smell from my the shower room luckily they have bath again weird layout shower room and bathroom coexist altogether so I use bath to shower during my stay , Location is great and staff are friendly 
194391,L Empire Paris, Aspects of the room decor quite tired Generally lacking character Breakfast nothing special not worth the additional money , Great location Friendly check in 
194392,L Empire Paris,No Negative, A really comfortable bed and excellent bathroom facilities a lot of attention to detail in the room and for breakfast Excellent staff and really good location in easy reach of 2 metro stations a few minutes walk from Le Louvre and the Seine 
194393,L Empire Paris, Rooms are big but the decoration white black does not fit to my taste With the black out curtains you do not feel good in the room , The location is excellent A couple of hundred meters from the landmarks of paris Breakfast is good 
194394,L Empire Paris,No Negative, The staff was amazing We were there to celebrate our wedding and they were super nice helping with all the details and helping with any requests we made 
194395,L Empire Paris, no kettle and coffee tea bag in the room it will be perfect to have it , Excellent service Staff are extremely friendly and helpful especially the people at the bar breakfast They make you feel very comfortable welcoming Very clean and spacious room Very convenient location to shopping and various metro lines 
194396,L Empire Paris, Always look at room before saying OK Our original room was given away prior to our arrival and night staff not honest about circumstances However young lady the next morning resolved issue and we were very happy with end result , Location was excellent with many good restaurants close by Breakfast was very good Room and bathroom were very clean 
194397,L Empire Paris,No Negative, Everything was great The hotel is on the expensive side but the experience was excellent Franco from France made the stay even more pleasant as he had answers to all our questions Other staff members were super nice and helpful as well 
194398,L Empire Paris, Very narrow and dark corridors Uncomfortable bath No kettle tea or coffee in the room No drinking water outside the minibar Price performance is terrible , Slippers
194399,L Empire Paris, The shuttle booked through the hotel to get us back to the airport didn t arrive which mortified the staff We caught a taxi instead Taxis seemed freely available in Paris This turned out much cheaper than the shuttle would have been , Our room was enormous very clean and comfortable Huge comfortable bed Staff couldn t have been more helpful about what to see and do in Paris and also assisting with confirming air tickets on line Breakfast was good 
194400,L Empire Paris, We didn t like leaving We were there for seven nights yet wished that we were staying longer at our home in the heart of Paris , The location was perfect as was our large quiet beautiful room What we liked best however was the magnificent front desk staff Thank you to Antoine Franco and every member of the staff for their kindness and professionalism and for making us feel at home at L Empire Paris 
194401,L Empire Paris, Nothing significant, Great location close to the Louvre and a short walk to Notre Dame A modern well appointed hotel blended into an historic district with numerous restaurants close by
194402,L Empire Paris, They charge 30 extra for a small dog Either allow or don t allow but what s the reason for a surcharge Booking com mention something like extra charge may apply it s their respondsability to inform the customer properly , Simple and effici nt approach The staff make you feel at ease The location is superb 
194403,L Empire Paris, Breakfast was good but the restaurant was not big enough to occupy people and the staff were run off their feet trying to keep enough food present , Location was excellent Staff very helpful 
194404,L Empire Paris, Not a bad experience parking is exspensive 35 per night for a medium sized car 70 for a large jeep or people carrier Which i unfortunately have , Great location for the centre of paris and especially the louvre museum within walking The Bed was one of the comfiest i have ever stayed in Decorated to a very high standard and the staff are really friendly and helpful Especially Franco he went out of his way to help you whenever he could 
194405,L Empire Paris, we could not pay by cash in different currency for whole stay at hotel what i was prepared for because web side show amount in pounds and euro, Great location 3 min to Louvre 2 min to Paris beach We came 3 hours before check in and left our luggage in reception Receptionist offer us we can check n 2 hours before because room will be ready with no extra cost what helps a lot after a tiring journey Very friendly and helpful staff Excellent quality of hotel We expected better window view but its nothing big Love French breakfast Would recommend it to everyone
