205840,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, Breakfast was very poor a French hotel and the croissant were packet not even fresh bottled water in the room only for the first day after that you have to pay 10 euro per bottle lifts broke down with people in them Seriously not worth it maybe a couple of years ago it was a good hotel service was very poor , Concierge were fantastic very helpfull
205841,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, The furniture was out of style and old And not pretty like antique Just old ugly and damaged Also we didn t have a table for tea coffee at our execuitive room they were on the tv table but there was actually no room for it Things felt out of the table Not so 5 Also in the douche there were rusty places , The food was fabrlous I enjoyed the execetive lounge facilities and the friendly staff 
205842,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, The walk to the room from the elevator was long but understandable because there is a beautiful courtyard the property looks into, Bed was comfort and the receptionist was excellent
205843,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe,No Negative, The staff were so friendly and welcoming especially Geoffrey who worked on reception He was very helpful and kind and nothing was a problem The bed was amazing like a big marshmallow I would really recommend staying here it s really a beautiful hotel
205844,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, The lifts broke down staff were very abrupt breakfast was not included and charged at 40 euro per person Water was only left in the room on the first day and after that they charged 9 euro per bottle Had to ask for the toiletries to be re filled , The concierge staff were excellent 
205845,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, By any standards absolutely unacceptable Internet was painfully slow unuseable for browsing Had to switch to my own 4g hopefully it is not the case for all rooms By 5 star standards so still kind of OK Shower was ergonomically awkward to stand in bath tub was curved directly under the shower No toothpaste in the bathroom strange We ran out of toilet paper both days There was too much dust in the closet apparently not cleaned regularly or missed Regarding the size of the beds I would have expected more from what was called a Superior Double Room Instead it was just a slightly larger room with 2x 140cm beds Was OK nontheless , Room was comfortable what you would expect from a 5 star hotel Staff was very nice except this one lady at breakfast reception who seemed to be very sad or tired Breakfast was amazing although expensive 40 euros for a buffet free for children but worth it We got a doubleroom for 4 people only 350 per night So good value for money for 5 star 
205846,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, Everything went pretty bad Horrible old and smelling hotel Ugly rooms and high rates The m nager on duty has no respect for the guests Overall 2 stars hotel absolutely not 5 , Nothing Worst stay of my life 
205847,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe,No Negative, Expectational First of all the hotel is perfectly located the service is the best great stuff always showing respect and make you feel special We booked standard room the room had technical problem but the manager gave us presidential suite for the same price The room was very nice comfortable with terass view to The Eiffel Tower 
205848,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, The size of beds should be mentioned especially in the rooms of 4 , The room of 4 was not really for 4 so we had to ask for an upgrade we payed the difference and got a suite to accommodate all 4of us 
205849,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, service was really questionable front desk was really slow and making mistake housekeeping not at the standard of a luxury hotel Did not do the room before 4 00pm do not change towel in the evening or bring shower gel do not remove trays, Good spa good location room were ok
205850,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe,No Negative, please suggest for yourself some things that could be in service for the people staying at the hotel the voituriers should come out of the hotel when arriving by car asking if they could help and empty the car the reception could tell us at what time and where the breakfast is we were late and we were almost shot out of the breakfast afterwards we were being seated in a corner behind the buffet in front of the egg baker People are not friendly at all the room was not fresh smelly someone has smoked in that room the overall service was bad except for one mister in the restaurant le safran the presentation of the hotel on the website is very well but doesn t match reality spa service is bad hammam is stinky people don t understand French ask us if we speak english my husband burnt himself in the sauna because the stones are not covered the spa is dirty and smelly we were taken out of the jacuzzi in a rude way after 20 minutes we had to leave the tiles in the bathroom are loose while leaving our suitcase wasn t in the car even though i ve asked to put our suitcase in the car this hotel is not 5 star worthy i had an appointment in the spa for a facial and body massage together with my husband but didn t want to go because of the friendliness and the cleanliness of the spa i had to cancel it 12 hours before the appointment impossible to get someone on the phone reception spa and concierge must cooperate in a more efficient way your staff should do the work not the people staying in the hotel the reception should mention that we need our key to go up with the elevator they didn t even we had to use the lefthand elevators because that is the only one working with a key the overal impression of the staff is that they don t want to work they are not smiling we were in l oiseau blanc on Saturday Evening 
205851,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, The parking is incredibly expensive 42 euros for the night The cleaning ladies transformed my mornings into a nightmare they bang the doors of the neighboring rooms all the time and worse they chat all the time among themselves But dont imagine they just talk silently they yell they laugh and they will make your morning rest impossible if you are sleeping later than 8 am The room service is charged 20 euros on top of the price of what you are having And room service is all you have after 22 00 because the bar wont serve any kind of snacks , The hotel has an amazing style and the ann es folles design creates an extraordinary atmosphere It is a big underground parking and the rooms are of reasonable size 
205852,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, The room was quite hot and it was fairly challenging to bring the temperature down The design of the bathroom lavatory was such that when the light was on it shone straight onto the bed Consequently not ideal if called short at night with a partner you are trying not to wake When we checked out we were overcharged one item being added in error and one wrongly priced but this was remedied when it was pointed out , It is a beautiful hotel the art deco style is delightful The restaurant is excellent and we had an exceptional dinner with charming service and a delicious room service meal Friendly staff and clean and comfortable room 
205853,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, Liked everything apart from the bill maybe but you get what you pay for , Very comfortable beds and good bathrooms Staff superb helpful and kind I d go back as it was a very good stay
205854,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, Housekeeping was a little hit and miss No water 1st day No tea and coffee 2nd day No CUPS for tea and coffee 3rd day , Lovely decor and fantastic location 
205855,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, staff at the reception did not reflect the standing of the hotel on this specific visit Also the response time to an issue was not timely we actually questioned if the call was place on our first request On the contrary the person who came to fix the curtain was polite professional and helpful , spacious room irreproachable cleanliness quiet comfortable Breakfast fresh products and wide range to cater all 
205856,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, Not very modern old worn out furniture carpet not clean or well fitted Bathroom really old and sink did not drain Shower extremely dated, Garden area looked nice Nice lobby
205857,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, Disappointed by the breakfast for the price we don t expect to ask for tea spoon a lady who came few minutes after us has been asked served before us what she wanted to have Only 1 person at front desk on Saturday around 10h30 to check out, The room in general spacious choice of coffee teas bathroom clean well equipped Despite the hottest the waiters are helpful profesionnal
205858,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe,No Negative, Fantastic experience My 18 months old son was sick and the hotel staff was very kind and available they even called a doctor Excellent hotel great facilities incredible location and 5 staff

205860,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, issue with lights no enough in bedroom some had to unplug to get it off no double curtain for all window, Inspired design of twenties large choice on breakfast such as 9 different fruit juices confortable bed bathroom
205861,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, I didn t like the fact that although we were paying a lot for the price of the room we couldn t get an adapter to use for free we had to buy it from the mini bar for 9 Which is unexpected for a 5 stars luxurious hotel as I have stayed in many hotels before Also all the movies provided on TV required payment However this is kind of usual in all hotels Spa facilities were priced the same to hotel guests and outsiders Usually guests who stay at the hotel get more offers , Everything was amazing we stayed at the executive floor 6th floor The rooms were big enough and clean and very tidy Staff were really nice polite and helpful The room we stayed in was provided with a phone that can be used to make local and international calls and unlimited internet to keep us connected all FOR FREE The TV in the room also had TV channels for all countries which was very beneficial The hotel was about 10 mins walk from Champs Elyesee and the location was surrounded by restaurants cafes and supermarkets 
205862,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, Very expensive Not much happening of a night Didnt like having to keep ordering room service when I wanted water from the bar had to go back up to order , Nice hotel quite location
205863,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, Not applicable , The staff were excellent there the little touches that the hotel provided that made it so special the rooms ere lovely and it was a great location 
205864,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe,No Negative, Comfortable bed lots of room Little extras like iron hairdrier came in handy We had a long snack in the Purple Bar on our last evening excellent food excellent service Metro nearby Walked to the Arc de Triomphe on the first evening The hotel is not cheap but we were spoiling ourselves And don t be afraid Paris is wonderful 
205865,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, Staff was so slow and rude the room was cold and there wasn t much heating Breakfast queue was like rush hour on the tube, Reception area and rooms are lovely
205866,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, When a hotel is this expensive and also not exactly in a prime location to justify the extra expense it is at least 10 minutes walk from the Champs lys es then my expectations are much higher and unforunately there were two key areas that I felt were lacking 1 The breakfast It is either 30 for a continental breakfast or 40 for full As always I opted for the continental However the selection and quality was very poor for this price point utensils and plates hard to find and the facilities such as the cereal dispenser and toaster not well maintained and not working properly Overall very disappointing especially as breakfast is what you do before checking out so is the last main memory I would recommend any guest if they have the time to skip breakfast here and search out a cafe or bakery somewhere nearby Wish I done that 2 My room was a little cold and this remained despite turning the heating on full Also I could not find the hairdryer which only increased this problem Also the wifi seemed to intermittantly drop out and I had to reconnect my devices numerous times during the stay Not huge issues but again for the price you expect more , It is a luxuriously decorated hotel and the room was spacious with a large TV and except for the missing hairdryer and ineffective heating generally good facilities The staff on reception when I arrived were very friendly and helpful 
205867,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, Breakfast not cheap if you just walk into the restaurant in the morning as they charge 40 onto your bill If you pre book breakfast the night before at the reception desk they only charge 25 , Great location Very helpful staff

205869,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, Being a family we were clearly given a room far away from everything Also our room had no view instead facing a wall with green despite asking for something better Naturally we were not happy with any of these 2 aspects and felt very much 2nd rate customers,No Positive

205871,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, There was nothing superior about our superior room and expected a lot more for our money I feel if you are after a deal at this hotel they put you way out the back in the 3 star area Nothing 5 star about our room whatsoever When we called in advance about the spa we were told it was 99 just for access per person so we decided not to take our swim suits but when we arrived we were told it was free but we had no swim suits Door staff and the staff roaming around reception not very friendly but the lady who checked us in was very nice Overall I wish we booked elsewhere for the one night we stayed in Paris It s not the worst place I have stayed in Paris but have stayed in many better welcoming cheaper hotels in this city , Impressive entrance location
205872,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, not a big issue but I think it s time to renew the rooms furniture because it s seems to be old but it was good , The decoration of the Hotel is very good and really attractive the lobby also is nice and the staff are friendly

205875,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, This is NEVER a 5 Star Hotel in any sense and more akin to a medium 4 Star The hotel is old and shabby and dirty Shower was pathetic and the furniture damaged and broken and showing signs of repair Other than the location which is good and close to the Arc De Triomphe and the Champs Elysee I could not recommend it to any traveller , The only redeeming areas of this hotel are the staff who are extremely pleasant and very helpful with lovely professional attitudes and the location

205877,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, Only downside is the price of the drinks on the room service menu However this is almost to be expected as a central hotel in the capital city , The hotel lobby is exquisite and the grounds are impressive Our double double room was the perfect size for 4 women travelling together It provided every amenity including bathrobes and bathtub it even had English terrestrial TV channels The staff were friendly and assisted with recommendations and making a reservation in a Paris nightclub on our behalf I would return to this hotel in a heartbeat ideally for a longer stay

205935,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe,No Negative, We were staying at another hotel but we didn t like at all and decided to change to Le Collectioneur Couldn t have made a better decision This hotel is wonderful Staff treat you as royals they are always kind gentle and helpful The location is just perfect within steps from Champs Elysees We are definitely coming back 
205936,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, The prices in the hotel were very expensive charging 6 for a mars bar and the hotel itself was quite noisy on a morning , The location was really good and the hotel itself was beautiful 
205937,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, Our room faced an alley and was a little noisy and if we had stayed longer it might have been a problem We plugged in the iron that was provided by the hotel and all the lights in our room went out However the staff came right away to correct the issue , Loved the location The hotel was a short walk to the Champs de elysee The rooms were average size for Europe with a nice size closet and bath 
205938,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, Staff very slow and bad behaviour , This hotel is not treat the guests in good condition and they tried to cheating me to add some wrong amount on my invoice 
205939,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, Restaurant was over priced but no matter as some great restaurants literally 2 mins walk, High class location accommodation style and old style Paris Double bass player in bar 
205940,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, I waited for more than 15 minutes for my luggage to get into my room Finally I went down and take it myself The bathroom door knob was squeaking and the water drainage was making a loud noise for 30 second each time somebody was using it so each morning I was waking up all my family when going to the bathroom I signaled it twice to the reception first time they sent two people to see what is wrong but nothing was fixed and no alternative room was offered This is unacceptable for a five stars hotel After five nights stay I asked to keep the room for two more hours but I was refused I spent the two hours working in the lobby and during this time I have only seen a couple of single individuals checking in I am sure they did not ask for a 4 person room therefore I do not understand the lack of customer focus of the personnel when refusing my request especially after our disappointing customer experience in the previous days that they were aware of , After giving a 5 EURO tip for 3 pieces of luggage the bellboy was extremely nice and carried our bags to the taxi that was waiting in front of the hotel he smiled and wished us a nice trip back 
205941,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, Some general confusion around payment I was told accommodation had to be prepaid but I wasn t charged in advance Then the reception staff got a bit shirty with me when I questioned an additional preauthorisation on my card attempted without explanation which I did not enjoy The spa is tiny it s just a large jacuzzi and a couple of small sauna rooms Also the room aircon was pretty loud so we settled for an open window and street noise , The gentleman on the concierge desk was brilliant helpful polite and informative We also got upgraded which was much appreciated made our stay much more comfortable I was traveling with my disabled mother 
205942,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, Not much, The interior the spa the food and drinks Close to metro Walking distance to champs elysee Good restaurants just around the corner And a beautiful park for walking relaxing and picnicking 200 m from the hotel 
205943,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, The Air condition was very cold and when I asked the reception to send one to fix they didn t send then after one hour I called them again to send one from the staff and they didn t respond fast, The classic style of the hotel
205944,Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe, Room is too small as well as the bathroom Wardrobe is from the wrong side towards the wash basin and bathroom It should be definitely on the other side next to the entrance door in the corridor The magnifier mirror could not be moved freely Hairdryer cable is too short The space around the wash basin is so small that one can t put even usual toilet articles TV could not be moved left or right Service is not very hospitable Staff could not be classified as friendly Practically no service at the business center after hours , Location is excellent The hotel s common area and the interior is well designed
