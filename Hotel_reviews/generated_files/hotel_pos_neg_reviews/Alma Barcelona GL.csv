374699,Alma Barcelona GL, Price of breakfast we ate out instead, Really comfortable beds spacious rooms wooden shutters made room really dark at night free soft drinks at mini bar were hit with the kids 
374700,Alma Barcelona GL, This hotel tried to be modern and with design However the finger print door opening did not really work for us only 2 4 of us were able to use this technique therefore there was one time it did not work for my Mom 85 years old and she really needed to use the toilet And so i have to ask the guest relationship manager to come help us open the door and he was quite annoyed and rude Maybe he was busy with something else but we didn t expect that kind of bad attitude One lady staff at breakfast was also very rude Overall speaking I would not recommend to my friends and would not go back to this hotel , Convenient location but if compare with the bad attitude from some of the staff I would not go back to this hotel 
374701,Alma Barcelona GL, The staff forgot to replace the empty tissue which made me feel their housekeeping manage isn t that good, The staff is very friendly best breakfast I ever eat during this honeymoon very close to casa mila 
374702,Alma Barcelona GL, Furnishing in the room a bit dated No face towels and old bath towels No mirror facing the sink making it very awkward to shave brush teeth apply makeup etc Requested a small vanity mirror at least but nothing requested extra towels none delivered requested some first aid disinfectant nada all requests to the reception were ignored without any response Strange Advice is to see the room before your stay in it , Restaurants and food outstanding and exceptional at this property Lobby Lounge very comfortable with a relaxing outdoor terrace 
374703,Alma Barcelona GL, Cafe service was rather haphazard and very slow Portions were small and expensive , receptionist Chubby was friendly and most welcoming and informative Garden area was an absolute haven Quiet spacious with wonderful trees and plants Restaurant food was most delicious The veal cheek was the best meat meal I ve ever had The restaurant service was excellent 
374704,Alma Barcelona GL,No Negative, The bed was amazingly comfy very hard to get out of in the mornings The staff members particularly on reception were exceptionally helpful I travel a lot on business and would rate them among the best I ve encountered for friendliness efficiency and going the extra mile The breakfast was delicious and the garden is a delightful oasis in the midst of the city 
374705,Alma Barcelona GL, Decor very minimalistic could do with some art work on the walls , Very helpful friendly staff Large rooms comfortable beds Location ideal for visiting all the sights and shopping areas 
374706,Alma Barcelona GL, The spa facilities are a little basic the sauna and steam room are excellent but the lap pool is a bit shallow to really swim in and they could do with having more than two lounging beds , The staff were very helpful friendly and professional but in a relaxed way which was perfect Breakfast was extensive and excellent The location is central but the hotel was still quiet The bed was very comfortable 
374707,Alma Barcelona GL, Breakfast should be included in room s rate , Excellent hotel great staff Room was super clean and comfortable Amazing location almost in Paseo de Gracia Breakfast is also wonderful but should be included in room s rate 
374708,Alma Barcelona GL, The pool was too cold to use, Lovely big bed comfy pillows nice big bath seperate bigger than average shower 2 wash basins seperate toilet good easy to open and close shutters that kept the light out of the room friendly helpful staff nice sauna wet room and gym
374709,Alma Barcelona GL, there was nothing to complain about , Already at the check in very professional and help with getting a ticket for Sagrada Familia just some 15 20 min from the hotel A lovely bar area with Tapas at your fingertips Located just off Pasteig de Gracia it is well suited for your shopping experience In short an excellent place that made my stay in Barcelona even more relaxing 
374710,Alma Barcelona GL, The noise that s coming from the street that the hotel is located on , The staff and the management were the highlight of the hotel One of the best services I have ever received from a 5 star hotel 
374711,Alma Barcelona GL, loved it wish I could have stayed longer , The staff was super friendly and accommodating They were kind and well versed in English my Spanish is quite poor They offered a beverage upon check in and talked me into the fingerprint room security very James Bond and it was just oh so clever A very highly stylized modern hotel Serene 
374712,Alma Barcelona GL, Rooms and public areas too dark Need more light Not enough hooks counter space etc for personal stuff in the bathroom No door to bath and shower room , Everyone polite and helpful Very clean great location 
374713,Alma Barcelona GL, missing coffee machine although mini bar is free it would enhance the value of stay at Alma Barcelona if there is a nespresso coffee machine inside each guest room , Customs Service excellent locatio plus very comfortable bed Also the cellijg shower head is one of most comfortable shower experience among five star hotels that I have stayed 
374714,Alma Barcelona GL, Having a sink in the toilet which was in a separate room from the shower , Very chic modern hotel with great customer service Conveniently located and close to many sights 
374715,Alma Barcelona GL,No Negative, We had an excellent stay They staff were so welcoming and kind and we thoroughly enjoyed our time at the hotel including in the spa and the scrumptious breakfast 
374716,Alma Barcelona GL, The style of the hotel is very modern minimalist decor which is not my personal preference but I knew my husband would like it and he did , We really enjoyed this hotel The staff couldn t have been nicer So very helpful in every way At check in they offered a glass of cava this was a very nice touch We had a great nights sleep on those comfy beds and the breakfast was excellent perhaps a bit pricey but worth it I loved the fact that the products were all local and very delicious A huge assortment of pastries croissants meats and cheeses Bonus was the coffee tasted great The staff helped us with the purchase of our tickets to Sagrada Familia so that we could fast track They also recommended the most incredible seafood restaurant We also enjoyed the park like setting off the dining area It was very pretty 
374717,Alma Barcelona GL, The room is dark Hard to put your lipstick on straight And there s no door on the bathroom Odd if you want privacy , The restaurant is excellent Menu is small but very very good Room is large and well equipped 
374718,Alma Barcelona GL, Having breakfast inclusive as part of the hotel rate would have been nice better value for money Rooms very modern but slightly on the basic side , Amazing location minutes from Passeig de Gracia shopping centre of Barcelona and an easy 15 20 minute walk from most tourist attractions such as La Sagrada Familia extremely friendly staff very smooth check in and check out process and very modern and sleek hotel 
374719,Alma Barcelona GL, Room was a little minimalistic housekeeping not always at same level as other employees but not a real problem , Staff were awesome Highly knowledgeable about Barcelona and always willing to find things out arrange bookings or answer questions Food in the restaurant was excellent Finger print recognition key a winner 
374720,Alma Barcelona GL, 1 Had to request a kettle for the room not because we are obsessive tea drinkers but for taking Lemsips 2 Cleaners did not replenish supplies of shampoo etc 3 Food ordered from room service below par and only luke warm , Excellent location room a good size and had nearly everything we needed Good that all soft drinks in minibar were free 
374721,Alma Barcelona GL, Only thing I didn t like was that our visited had to come to an end , From the minute we were greeted at the front door until they put us in a taxi for the trip to the airport my sister in law and I were treated like queens We arrived early off a cruise ship and were offered a cup of coffee while we waited in the very comfortable bar lounge area With in half an hour our room was ready and our host came personally to get us Our bags were waiting when we entered the room Room was very comfortable especially the beds I can only hope we can return in the near future Location was perfect 
374722,Alma Barcelona GL, Some of the rooms are very small and do not have a bathtub we were given a bigger room but there were bathroom amenities missing no vanity set shower cap no electric kettle and none was available and the fingerprint lock didn t work Not a 5 star hotel more a well designed pricey 4 star , Excellent location friendly staff modern and clean decor beautiful garden in the back 
374723,Alma Barcelona GL, Breakfast is expensive There are lots of coffee shops nearby where breakfast costs a fraction of the hotel s charge , The location was excellent staff extremely professional and helpful 
374724,Alma Barcelona GL, I loved the room layout and amenities but a bit more lighting in the hallways would be appreciated I had to use the flashlight app on my phone to find the door s keyhole , We loved the look and feel of the hotel from the warm welcome at reception to the modern and well thought out design comfort of the room and the beautiful courtyard where we could sit and relax after a day of touring Also I could order a cappuccino and roll for breakfast a la carte without paying the full breakfast price of 25 Euros There are various dining options to choose from for dinner too The hotel is well located too We d be happy to stay at the Alma again and recommend it highly 
374725,Alma Barcelona GL, For dinner the main restaurant food was disappointing, Location and service outstanding Room was comfortable and quiet The garden area was peaceful Enjoyed the roof bar with the live music and great bartender and staff and view 
374726,Alma Barcelona GL, could have brought a daily paper to room , Perfect location had a room on 4th floor facing street no problems sleeping a very sound building Exceptionally helpful staff 
374727,Alma Barcelona GL, The Check out guy was not very friendly and they left the girl to take our heavy bags down the stairs I obviously stopped her and took the rest of the bags myself , The check in staff was very accommodating and informative The hotel was located in an excellent location near all the fine shopping boutiques and trendy restaurants The turn down service and housekeeping was immaculate 
374728,Alma Barcelona GL, Nothing could have been better This eclipsed all of our expectations , The beds and linen were white and fluffy room spotless staff friendly complimentary bar fabulous breakfast and service romantic rooftop terrace with great city view and lounging outdoor garden lit up with lanterns 
374729,Alma Barcelona GL, There were no tea coffee making facilities in the room but the room service did bring your order very quickly The hotel does not have parking but the hotel staff valet park the car in a local car park and the cost is 30 euro per day , The staff were very polite and friendly The room and bathroom were spacious and furnished nicely The bed was very comfortable The room was serviced twice a day There were a selection of free daily beverages in the mini bar There is a lovely roof top bar and another ground floor bar set in a pretty garden I would definelty recommend this hotel 
374730,Alma Barcelona GL, When you arrive the parking is a bit confusing since you have to stop in the bus lane for the valet parking Be aware also if you are using google maps as there is another hotel with the name Alma in the name but is located at Las Ramblas and is totally impossible to find , Very nice Hotel to stay in Barcelona Excellent location nicely appointed rooms and excellent service 
374731,Alma Barcelona GL,No Negative, First the staff cannot be beaten They are available and more than happy to help with anything you ask Outstanding representatives of this hotel Re my rating This hotel is minimalist almost to a fault The lighting is terrible there are no clocks in the rooms no facilities for ice etc I doubt I would stay there again for these reasons 
374732,Alma Barcelona GL, It was a kind of a quiet boutique hotel decorated in black grey wood I am not sure if it was the best choice because of a little baby I think that a more gladsome decoration would be better for her , The hotel was very quiet clean and staff really helpful and polite Location was very good 
374733,Alma Barcelona GL, Everything else Not a hotel for anyone over the age of 30 Ultra modern No privacy Couldn t figure out the phone airco shower No privacy for grooming or showering Dark dark dark They think it s chic I think it s absurd Turn on the lights , The bedding 
374734,Alma Barcelona GL, None, Perfect location very close to Passeig de Gracia nearby Casa Batllo Le Predera and Sagrada Familia Very friendly staff Excellent hotel room facilities
374735,Alma Barcelona GL,No Negative, Highlights are the Beautiful outdoor garden and rooftop terrace The suite with its own balcony was excellent Staff were friendly and spoke very good English Rooms beautifully appointed and every detail in the hotel attended to with thoughtful precision 
374736,Alma Barcelona GL,No Negative, Everything was amazing It is a modern clean boutique feel hotel in a fantastic location for sightseeing food bars and shopping The staff is extremely helpful and go above and beyond to make you comfortable I can t rate the Alma highly enough 
374737,Alma Barcelona GL, Needed a full length mirror in the room , The service at the hotel was fantastic Everyone was friendly and helpful The attention to our comfort was appreciated The beverages supplied in our room were delightful Wonderful location 
374738,Alma Barcelona GL,No Negative, Beds are super comfortable Roof terrace bar is fabulous the signature cocktails are an amazing adventure Staff are always helpful and friendly very pleasant to deal with 
374739,Alma Barcelona GL, Rooms were a bit dark The balcony didn t open unless we requested someone to come in and unlock them Food was below average in taste from what we ordered Mini bar was free which was lovely but poorly stocked Payable snack options would have been great , The beds were heavenly clouds
374740,Alma Barcelona GL, The roof garden wasn t open and ought to have been as it was June , A very stylish and understated hotel with lovely staff and comfortable beds The garden is an oasis in the city 
374741,Alma Barcelona GL, Unfortunately when we were there the rooftop bar was closed as it only opens in summer Not sure why as weather in Barcelona allows to stay outside already in May when we were there There was a private party in the garden on our first night with loud music until midnight that we couldn t avoid even in the bedroom Finally there was no door to the bathroom and when we asked whether there was another room available with a door to the bathroom we were told that this was only available for luxury superior rooms It seems odd that this is a luxury in this category of hotel , The design and decoration of the Hotel are nice and modern the garden and the bar are very pleasant Most of the staff is nice and helpful Rooms are spacious comfortable and quiet Location is perfect very close to Casa Mila 
374742,Alma Barcelona GL, A great deal of concentration is placed on the business community who use this hotel a great deal People there as tourists leisure should appreciate this has to be accepted, The garden is superb The staff are excellent and bedrooms very comfortable 
374743,Alma Barcelona GL, There was a major party in the courtyard which was very loud on a Friday night We were thinking it would be so quiet on that side as opposed to the street side but not on that night , The Alma is in the perfect location The staff is extremely attentive to your every need The rooms were VERY spacious and the beds extremely comfortable 
374744,Alma Barcelona GL,No Negative, everything is just great i cant say that enough and i have recommended Alma to all my friends who are making plans for Barcelona the staff is the most welcoming and helpful hotel staff in the world the location is wonderful especially for those who are ready for a shopping spree the city itself is another surprise sunshine beautiful architecture the most amazing seafood nice people everything is just perfect 
374745,Alma Barcelona GL, rooftop terrace was still closed while at other hotels this was not the case, very nice and enjoyable stay great location great rooms very friendly staff great design 
374746,Alma Barcelona GL, The gym facilities are a bit lacking although they do have one The steam sauna pool facilities smelled a little funny , Fabulous location and excellent service My room was lovely and looked out over a charming courtyard Chic bar and restaurant within the hotel I highly recommend this hotel 
374747,Alma Barcelona GL,No Negative, The staff were attentive and genuine making us feel at home and comfortable the moment we arrived A stunning hotel with amazing decor throughout A perfect 5 star hotel 
374748,Alma Barcelona GL, Swimming pool too small Only 2 people can stand there Employee attitude could be more constructive Lack of environmental awareness Are changing bed linens and towels every day despite us asking not to do so, Location Room Quietness Breakfast
374749,Alma Barcelona GL, The only one tiny little thing was that the rooms didn t have coffee making facilities I d have loved a Nespresso machine in the room and wouldn t have minded if they d charged me per capsule , Absolutely amazing hotel Location couldn t be any more perfect Staff are amazing Restaurant served the best tapas we found in Barcelona Rooms are super comfortable and the showers are fabulous 
374750,Alma Barcelona GL, Breakfast somewhat pricy and I would love to have a coffemaker in the executive rooms, Love the central location staff very friendly and helpful Nice breakfast and spa Nice room and ambient modern nice room amenities 
374751,Alma Barcelona GL, We liked everything, Staff fantastic i have never known such helpful and friendly staff A very relaxing hotel modern with a chilled atmosphere fantastic rooms very comfortable beds great bathroom nice and quiet Breakfast was lovely a choice for everyone I took my mother and both of us have said we will definitely go back Good location easy to catch the tour bus designer shops bars cafes you can walk to see some of Gaudis amazing art I just want to say a big thank you to Mark on the door you were so helpful and the reception staff were like a big family We would love a hotel like yours in London Class excellent service sophistication quality what more do you want The restaurant was lovely too and Barcelona amazing place 
374752,Alma Barcelona GL, There was a group of older gentlemen using the swimming pool sans trucks in the middle of the afternoon which was really weird awkward inappropriate The hotel staff were very apologetic and sorted it out immediately though Service in the restaurant was a little slow but my only real gripe was at being charged an extra 4 euro for asking the barman to fill the champagne glass properly , Everything was great got a suite v nice and airy clean etc Hotel was beautiful modern and professional and lacking the stuffiness of some 5 star spots Was in Barcelona for the marathon and the restaurant even made up some pasta off the menu for us which was delicious Room service and reception could not have been more helpful All very friendly courteous and accommodating Gym was fine the swimming pool was a little on the shallow size but did the trick Breakfast was very good in terms of food service was fine but not outstanding Nice terrace garden off the bar area too I will stay there again next time I m in Barca 
374753,Alma Barcelona GL, Nothing not to like , Design of the hotel felt very cosy Staff were very friendly and helpful but not overbearing Rooms were beautifully designed and thoughtful Loved the outside garden very peaceful felt you were a world away from the hustle and bustle outside 
374754,Alma Barcelona GL, Photos of hotel entrance were quite dark so I was a bit nervous about my choice but it worked out really well , Old palace with really modern vibe and beautiful design features I loved the garden 
374755,Alma Barcelona GL, lighting at reception could be better you absoluteley need a door for privacy in the bathroom the breakfast was expensive , Beautifull hotel great location a really good experience 
374756,Alma Barcelona GL, The shower get warm and cold alternately and the central heating didn t function at all until I called the reception a 5 star hotel shouldn t be like that , The staff is nice
374757,Alma Barcelona GL, No bad experiences, We had booked ourselves into the suite as a special treat and although the cost was eye watering it was so worth it Superb bed and bedding likened to falling into a snowdrift at the end of a hard day s sightseeing Typically understated sharp Spanish design throughout the spacious suite 
374758,Alma Barcelona GL,No Negative, This is a truly amazing hotel The decor ambiance staff room everything was first rate This was my 5th visit to Barcelona and to be honest it has never been a favorite city This hotel helped me change that The location is in a great part of town I would recommend this hotel it s one of the best I ve ever stayed in 
374759,Alma Barcelona GL, Neither the bathroom or the shower had a door The hotel was very dim especially the lobby , The location of the hotel was perfect and the staff were very friendly and helpful specifically Elizabeth the manager 
374760,Alma Barcelona GL, That we had to leave , The staff did an outstanding job making us comfortable right upon arrival Their recommendations for restaurants were excellent Location was fantastic as well Nothing but great things to say about this hotel 
374761,Alma Barcelona GL, Female staff didn t know much about surrounding area Being a fave star I would assume the staff would know where everything would be View was bad from room Thought 30e was a lot for breakfast Never got our paper we asked,No Positive
374762,Alma Barcelona GL, AIR CONDITIONER TOO HIGH IN GYM NEEDS TO BE LOWERR TOO PREVENT PEOPLE GETTING ILL , LOCATION FACILITIES QUALITY OF PROPERTY EXTREMELY ATTENTIVE STAFF
374763,Alma Barcelona GL, No bad experiences I would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel, Extremely friendly staff Really lovely rooms Excellent shower Very quiet Lovely restaurant and bar area 
374764,Alma Barcelona GL, The breakfast was ridiculously expensive as compared to the rest of my dining experiences in the city It was good just seemed unnecessarily high Also my safe didn t work they thought they fixed it but didn t and never did even after being reminded Also a light bulb was out that wasn t replaced after a couple of reminders Last they didn t change the drinking cups in the bathroom each day when they cleaned All minor issues that would not prevent me from choosing this hotel again , Location staff and style I was concerned because there were no bad reviews on line and how could that possibly be But I was not disappointed the reviews accurately described our experience 
374765,Alma Barcelona GL,No Negative, The location is perfect although the hotel is very good but quite dark inside the staff however truly illuminate the place they are a credit to the Hotel seldom have we had such attentive informative service 
374766,Alma Barcelona GL, Lack of illumination not enough lamps at night you cannot see what is in your suitcase even Pls put a standard lamp into the rooms , Excellent beds spacious rooms quiet Good breakfast for the money

374769,Alma Barcelona GL, It s a shame the widely advertised roof terrace is closed check in is unimpressive and room equipment was barely adequate for a otherwise comfortable 400 euros suite no plug by bedside for phones no corkscrew nor coffee machine nowhere to hang a hand towel in the bathroom, Hotel location is great rooms are comfortable restaurant service and food quality are excellent breakfast is one of the best I experienced
374770,Alma Barcelona GL, no bad experience with this hotel , I liked the people They were all very helpful especially Elizabeth I also liked the location It is in an upscale neighborhood and a nice walk to the major attractions of the city

374772,Alma Barcelona GL, The hotel has v modern decoration but they have used v dark colors and very dim lights even in the rooms Executive rooms have toilet separate from bathroom which is not really convincing and as a 5 star hotel it doesn t have a bidet neither , Location Quiet trendy boutique hotel Helpful staff and kind
374773,Alma Barcelona GL,No Negative, This place is amazing Newly renovated it provides luxury at a fair price With fingerprinted door entry it is very modern Free minibar was very appealing too Very clean and fresh Would recommend to anyone wanting to stay in Barca as the location was ideal
