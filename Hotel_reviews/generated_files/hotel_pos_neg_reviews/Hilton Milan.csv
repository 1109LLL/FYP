481137,Hilton Milan, We paid a little extra to get an executive club room and it was horrible it was under staffed over crowded filthy the food was cold and there was very little variety we have stayed at many ex clubs before including Hiltons and was by far the worst, Good location good room

481153,Hilton Milan,No Negative, The distance to the train station is very convenient Generally the area around the train station does not feel very safe but the street where the hotel is is very nice and quiet The room was huge and clean the bed was comfortable well isolated The breakfast was very good Some of the staff members are real pearls who make you feel very welcome There was a hick up in communications prior to my arrival however my request was eventually resolved in a very professional and respectable manner which I highly appreciated 
481154,Hilton Milan,No Negative, Best stay in our entire Europe trip highly recommended The room is spacious and furniture is nicely designed and modern Breakfast is good but bacon is too dry and hard to eat The room rate is very affordable and value for money We will definitely book again when we travel next time

481162,Hilton Milan, Concierge was not overly keen to assist , Excellent location near Milan Central train station Very comfortable Aldo in reception was lovely Very welcoming 
481163,Hilton Milan,No Negative, Everything was good The room is pretty clean the location is perfect really near the central station so it s easy to go anywhere the service was okay
481164,Hilton Milan, the male reception staff were just plane rude And as a result I will not stay at a Hilton hotel again Really made me angry to be treated so poorly the worst of any hotel anywhere I ve ever stayed which is really saying something , the bed was really comfortable 
481165,Hilton Milan, When I checked in they asked for my credit even though I prepaid for the room and they already had my card details they said it was for just the city tax and as a safety measure if there is an accident Next morning they blocked 178 euros from my card without any warning It turned out that that 111 euros charge was just a mistake and the other 78 euro was a sort of safety deposit that they didn t tell me about I needed to make several complains to have the 111 euros unblocked I don t like that fact they essentially they abused my credit card and acted like I was a nuisance when I complained I checked out on Monday morning and they still haven t given me money back , The room was very nice although the bathroom needs a little bit of maintenance and the hotel in general is very comfortable and well furbished The location is great it is just a block away from the Central Station 
481166,Hilton Milan, Lobby was being constructed when we arrived and was completed the day we left so check in temporary lobby was a bit small As luck would have it all renovation work was completed for lobby on may 16 the day we checked out newly done up lobby was very nice tho and I m sure will add more charm also to visit of future guests to this hotel , Very good staff The receptionist called nanchi was really nice and gave us the room early at 12 30 noon even though check in time was later at 2pm We were very grateful as we were tired from our trip from Athens early morning that day Rooms were clean and comfortable and upto standard of Hilton Concierge was also good and gave us correct guidance This hotel is value for money as they offer rooms at a good price compared to other hotels in Milan in my opinion 
481167,Hilton Milan, Accounting service is terrible Our credit cards have been debited 3 times once by booking com twice by the hotel in 2 days for guarantie without any notice We have to call our bank to find out who made this mysterieux debit and block our card for further payment We re still waiting for these 3 guaranties pay back Very unique Inpleasant experience We stay 2 nights and the bathroom carbage hasn t been clean up Just can t imagine it can happen in Hilton , Front desk staff very nice and helpful
481168,Hilton Milan, The shower took an age to heat up to any sort of comfortable temperature , The location was exactly what we needed which made it easy to travel around the city 
481169,Hilton Milan, We arrived struggling with heavy suitcases the doorman was standing outside smoking a cigarette threw the butt on the ground and walked in in front of us letting the door swing in our faces Bathroom was not clean or cleaned properly daily, location and king size bed
481170,Hilton Milan, There is no hotel parking The parking next to the hotel is very expensive 23 Euro per day , Very nice staff the hotel is placed 2 min walking distance from the main station the room is very quite even if the hotel is located on a very busy street 
481171,Hilton Milan, Nothing worth mentioning The standard ok Hotel if u r looking for comfortable room with good value , Room is standard nothing special Size is good The staff were amazing as always Specially the nice lady at the reception Her name is Valentina she was very helpful and helped with a situation when didn t have to One of the best hotel staff I ve ever met Thank u Valentina I need to mention the concierge guy his name is Pio He was great and will help u with anything Thank u Pio

481174,Hilton Milan, I am a Hilton Honors member and I was extremely surprised when I was advised upon check in that breakfast was not included BUT could be for 35 00Euro per day REALLY I have stayed at over 75 different hotels in the past 30 years throughout Italy sometimes 4 Star 3 Star and on a couple of occasions even a 2 Star Always without any exception breakfast was ALWAYS included except for this time at the Hilton I felt like I was 2nd Class guest in a 1st Class hotel each morning as I walked past the breakfast area NOT an good experience With this one exception I enjoyed my stay very much , The room was very large and quiet especially for Italian standards The furnishings were all very nice and the shower was maybe the best that I have ever had I highly recommend the Hilton Centrale 
481175,Hilton Milan, Not a single thing that went wrong with me, I liked everything from the moment I stepped into the hotel till I left I was surrounded with care The breakfast was out standing The rooms were extra clean The staff were friendly and helpful especially the concierge

481177,Hilton Milan, The hotel receptionist did not offer me a map During my arrival the system network was out of service so another entry card requested for the second person was not feasible to them Also the refrigerator did not operate properly for couple of hours due to this technical difficulty However they sent a technician to the room after my call and they offered us to proceed with a trick to open and close a fridge which was via unplugging then plugging the cable which I thought was unsafe The system came back to normal after couple of hours as they have anticipated and forecasted I called the hotel during the evening requesting their support in giving me thoughts as to what options I have available to ship a large umbrella internationally they have suggested I call them during the day shift where they could be of greater help That did not bother me and was alright What bothered me is that they hanged up the phone on my face and not for the first time This is not an expected behavior from Hilton hotels Also Internet is not free in rooms and is only available complimentary in the lobby They offered me a membership card with which I could get free internet but I refused , The location and amenities of Hilton hotels was very well known to me well before staying for two nights in the hotel of Hilton Milan The hotel is within a short walking distance from Centrale Station of Milan where you could get metro tickets to Duomo and other beautiful neighborhoods such as Zara The bed was comfortable and the shower has a temperature regulator with written instruction which I thought was superb The restaurant was nice and their staff were nice
