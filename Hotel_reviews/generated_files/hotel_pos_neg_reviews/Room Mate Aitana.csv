347200,Room Mate Aitana, We did pay 563 euro for two days for 2 rooms but i still think it was still bad they ask 21 for the breakfast Normally breakfast have to be in the price And also for 1 day parking 25 this is seriosly seriosly very very bad for people And we have been the hotel for cheek in 14 00 clock our rooms still wasnt ready and we have to wait untill 15 30 with our 1 years old baby Thats really make u s feel not good And also we did ask 2 rooms next to each other in booking com before 2 weeks we are booking but we Where in reseption but always excuses But stuff are very friendly and Nice , It was Nice in the centrum and we ask for baby bed and we get it shower and rooms are very good internet also Hotel clean and beautiful 
347201,Room Mate Aitana, I lost my deodorant , They upgraded me to a suite which was gorgeous The hotel and facilities are beautiful I was very surprised as it was at a much higher standard than hotels in the area which are not much cheaper The location is very nice and in a good place for the station or Danzigerkade where I was working I didn t get a chance to go but there is a Bagel and Beans across the road and I love that place 
347202,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, The hotel was beautiful and the location was perfect to where we wanted to be The staff were brilliant We had a problem with the door in our first room and when they couldn t fix it they moved us to another room which was one floor below the first room The views from both rooms were lovely we faced the north of Amsterdam and had some beautiful water views 
347203,Room Mate Aitana, We avoided the breakfast as the price appeared prohibitive Across the road was an excellent Bagels and Beans restaurant for this Wardrobe door was flush with floor so avoid opening with bare feet , Very big airy room with good aircon and excellent TV coverage Bathroom was shower only but very good one 
347204,Room Mate Aitana, Access to property from the central station is not the best it is a 10 15 minute walk, Room was very big and pretty much better than what I was expecting
347205,Room Mate Aitana, Carpet seems to have been installed directly onto the concrete floor without any underlay might as well have been the concrete floor itself , location location location Excellent restaurant in hotel 
347206,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, Staff were brilliant friendly helpful and accommodating The bar and restaurant area are fabulous a great place to relax after a hard days site seeing Only downside was that we weren t staying there longer 
347207,Room Mate Aitana, The reception was quite frosty upon arrival and the maintenance of the room daily cleaning was not of high standard Room service menu was very limited , The location was off the busy area but easily accessible to walk to Many options of coffee shops etc on the walk to singel st 
347208,Room Mate Aitana, Check in staff poorly trained all design no substance much better value elsewhere if all you require is a clean room and bed, Clean quiet proximity to Centraal
347209,Room Mate Aitana, No breakfast included although on booking com it showed as breakfast included , Staff especially HANDEL was very accommodating Booking com shows room rate as breakfast included but this is not the case Another guest checking in also has the same complaint HANDEL arranged an upgrade room to compensate 
347210,Room Mate Aitana, nil, everything comfort beds nice view perfect staff very nice restaurant and breakfast spacious rooms smart location near to central station and away from noise and crowded street me and my family want to thank the hotel staff 
347211,Room Mate Aitana, The views of the rooms seen on booking com pics dont seem to exist the price of the room for one night is a bit expensive A personal payed a visit to my room and knocked the door to repair sth althought i hadn t checked out yet , Big and comfortable room clean nice shower gel and schampoo nice tv s very comfortable bed
347212,Room Mate Aitana, Less expensive mini bar and goodies in room for example 3 50 euros for a choc bar Location good but a good walk to the centre if weather fine ok but if raining abit exposed Breakfast expensive so used cafe across road which was good Very modern hotel but derived of much character , Comfortable bed Lovely bathroom and fantastic shower Great selection of toiletries Ice machine on corridor Great view from 10th floor
347213,Room Mate Aitana, Breakfast not included, prior to the trip I communicated with Diago and Paloma who both went out of their way to assist me The hotel is in s great location and the executive room is fantastic
347214,Room Mate Aitana, The food in the evening not a lot of choice for room service No information or help for people with food allergies there should be free mini bar it was too expensive for what we paid for the hotel 3 50 for a bottle of water is redicilous It wasn t value for money The staff weren t friendly , The clean rooms Breakfast 
347215,Room Mate Aitana, Booked extra night to cover early morning arrival Emailed hotel of this Very disappointing room had not been kept for us Poor communication on their part Staff at desk did however handle the situation well, Comfy bed Good bathroom
347216,Room Mate Aitana, The restaurant was a bit of a let down in terms of service and price but this is pretty standard in Amsterdam Service in Cafes bars restaurants are generally slow and its very expensive otherwise the hotel is great , Beautiful hotel in a good location Bed was amazing and everything very clean and nice Restaurant was ok but very expensive for what we got but that is Amsterdam no matter where you go Beautiful bar with outdoor seating and a great bar tender Hotel check in was fantastic and reception staff were very nice 
347217,Room Mate Aitana, Room had no proper side tables or shelves for my stuff We ordered dinner in the room and had no where to put the dishes except if we removed our toiletries Very uncomfortable Hotel was modern but not user friendly , Bed was comfortable Room was bright 
347218,Room Mate Aitana, Although the location is not bad because it is on a little island of its own with a bridge to access it took longer to get to the main area of town and even the train station While the room was big and clean it was not good value for money , Spacious nicely furnished rooms with nice view of canal Friendly and efficient staff 
347219,Room Mate Aitana, Just a few little things such as nowhere with a dressing table and mirror for my wife s make up , Excellent hotel and we got upgraded to a junior suite for free 
347220,Room Mate Aitana, Booked an extra night by mistake and the staff were not lenient about refunding the value though i check out a day before Ended paying for day for an unused room ,No Positive
347221,Room Mate Aitana, worse food in the restaurant slow and very salty thought the food arrangement looks nice staff are slow and not very helpful we have asked to get an extra blanket for 4 times and finally we need to goto concierge in person to ask for it , big double bed and spacious room clean bathroom the view is very nice quiet environment easy to access to Centraal station with around 10mins walk 
347222,Room Mate Aitana, I really can t think of anything The one time when our room wasn t made up while we were out the management made certain to check in the us the next day to ensure that wasn t repeated , This hotel was lovely and modern and while it was a short walk from everything going on in the Jordaan section of Amsterdam it was pleasantly quiet in the evenings The bed was extremely comfortable and our room wonderfully spacious My husband found it s facilities very easy to have meetings as there were lots of places available to sit and talk The breakfasts were very good and the hotel faced west so it received plenty of afternoon sun Really a great place to stay with very pleasant and accommodating staff 
347223,Room Mate Aitana, 30 euros to upgrade to river view, Excellent location for a hotel in the river which is reflected in the price Its always high here but somehow got a reasonable mid week deal A pleasant walk in the sunshine from Central station and a relaxing beer sitting under a parasol surrounded by boats in the marina Large room by Amsterdam standard all window so lots of light No balcony View of the marina and city looking onto the river costs more Super shower and shampoos Fast internet Excellent bars cafes a short walk along the Westerdok Quiet and peaceful on the river at night Mints on the bar
347224,Room Mate Aitana, Because the breakfast was expensive we preferred to have breakfast outside hotel , The location of the property was very good The hotel was very clean and quiet There was no voice 
347225,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, Nice location away from the main tourist areas but close enough to walk to the station and central town There s cafes bars and a bike rental place right outside the door very convenient 
347226,Room Mate Aitana, I requested a double queen bed on my reservation and this was completely ignored by the Front Desk Nevertheless their single beds are actually large , Brand new hotel with very cool vibe and deco The staff is very friendly and the bedrooms are very comfortable and spacious Breakfast is excellent Location is very convenient just opposite to Amsterdam Central Train Station 
347227,Room Mate Aitana, The restaurant restaurant staff food service time and limited menu does not fit with hotel s general quality , hotel side facility is great like rooms cleaning service reception services etc 
347228,Room Mate Aitana, Room decoration is just off when compared to the design of the lobby and cafe Very white some swatches of bright colours Doesn t need to be bad except that the pure white style extends into the bathroom complete with plastic finishing of the shower area and thin walls This is highly reminiscent of Ibis Budget except this hotel is supposed to have four stars not one Minibar is aggressively refilled meaning staff walks around to replenish it and will knock on your door about it even if you have a DND sign out saw it happen to other guests In summary not worth the money would not come back , Great classy atmosphere in the lobby and cafe Building looks nice Rooms are roomy The place is somewhat close to the central station though not so much to make it really convenient to go up and down there take some 15 minutes out for this especially with luggage The tiny harbour next to the hotel is quite charming 
347229,Room Mate Aitana, This is a very expensive hotel and if you are traveling with a low cost budget don t even consider this place , My husband and I just returned yesterday from Amsterdam and stayed at room 815 of this hotel It is a completely new and modern building located at walking distance from Central Station which is at a 10 minute walk away From Central Station very modern you can walk or take a trolley tram within the city A bus station is located almost in front of the hotel that you can use if you do not want to go walking The room is beautiful with light color decorations large beds stunning views air conditioner satellite cable tv excellent WiFi and a spotless bathroom with a provision of all kinds of goodies like bath gels shampoos and conditioner hair caps and lotions It even has a tv channel from the hotel providing lots of information about their services and about the city in general It also has an ice machine every two floors which is very uncommon in most of european hotels The buffet breakfast as well as room service is expensive but it is worth the price You can enjoy everything you would expect for hungry american consumers as well as lots of pastries breads vegetables sweets fruits coffees juices chocolates etc They have a chef that can cook you something else that you would desire and breakfast service is from 7 00 AM to 12 00 Regarding the service everybody was very nice and accommodating from the cleaning lady to the restaurant staff and front desk employees They make you feel very good reserve taxi service can guide you to events at heaters or museums going on at the city and you can buy tickets with them This hotel has a gym which I did not use and good meeting rooms This hotel is very expensive but after all Amsterdam is a very expensive city from hotel rates restaurants cafes etc Trolleys within the city cost 2 90 euro for a 2 hour period I will definitely consider staying again at this hotel if I ever going to Amsterdam again 
347230,Room Mate Aitana, Time cleaner came in to clean room We were out early each morning so if our room had been cleaned in before we got back late afternoon early evening it would have far more helpful , Very modern hotel with a light airy bedroom with extremely comfortable bed Great choice offered for Breakfast 
347231,Room Mate Aitana, a little far from the central but it was worth it a little high price for the standard room, comfort room nice design for the lobby and restaurant selvador the guy who welcomed us at the door he knows everything and willing to help without asking thank you selvador
347232,Room Mate Aitana, Felt using the dining area could have been explained better regarding breakfast set up and more than 1 cook to be on during breakfast service Menu for eating dinner I felt was limited not much to choose from Basically it was either or , The location was lovely Staff were friendly and happy 
347233,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, Good sized room with plenty of space storage and very comfortable bed Excellent shower Staff were really pleasant and helpful The restaurant in the hotel was very good Overall ambience light and airy with lovely views 
347234,Room Mate Aitana, Room size is small and for tram you need to walk for 10 min I feel it was little overpriced We should be able to get hotel at some other location with easy tram access Indian Restaurant is 10 15 min walk , Nothing Great it s near to central station but tough to walk with luggage
347235,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, good location keeping a distance from the noisy part of the central station room is clean and big with a nice view of the city big window bed is comfy 
347236,Room Mate Aitana, Breakfast choices are limited and I think is understaffed especially during rush hours 0730 0815 hours as the staff really struggled to provide timely support food plates spoons etc Room price is also at higher end , The property is conveniently located at a quiet place just 10 mins walking distance from Amsterdam Central Clean and reasonable sized room 
347237,Room Mate Aitana, The only thing that let the hotel down was some of the staff on reception we arrived at around 11am to drop our bags and was told the room would be ready before 2 We arrived before 2 and was rudely told check in time is 2 this was by another member of staff however the other receptionist shouldn t have told us it would be ready early if they couldn t guarantee it Despite this I would definitely return as the hotel itself made up for it , The hotel itself was lovely room was very spacious facilities excellent ironing board iron toiletries tea coffee mini bar etc comfy bed wifi great Location is good however not much right around the hotel the centre of Amsterdam is around 15 minute walk due to some roadworks Centraal Station 10 minute walk so not bad at all Taxi rank outside the hotel which was very useful 
347238,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, We really enjoyed our stay here The staff at Room Mate Aitana were lovely friendly and attentive Extremely helpful The room was superb very comfortable and cozy The hotel s decor was modern with clean designs and fun use of colour The bathroom was spacious and modern the rain shower was an excellent touch The TV came stacked with great channels so there s something for everyone Tea coffee facilities are provided as well as towels and Room Mate s own brand of delectable hair body and shower goods The hotel is close to Centraal station excellent transportation links including to from Schipol great shops and restaurants and right by the docks for ferries to Amsterdam Noord which was perfect for our needs The location offered great views of the IJ docks and the river which made for a peaceful and relaxing stay 
347239,Room Mate Aitana, Delayed check in to rooms Rooms not available until after 4pm check in 2pm However we did recieve an apologetic hand written note with cupcakes a complimentary drink at the bar , Excellent breakfast Nice view of harbour Good size bedroom bathroom very clean Helpful reception staff booking tours taxi s etc This hotel is located around the harbour area If you don t mind a 10 15 min walk to Central station Damrak then you ll have a very comfortable pleasant stay 
347240,Room Mate Aitana, Aircon did not cool room down to a comfortable level for sleeping, Good rooms nice bar friendly and helpful staff handy for the railway station interesting and modern locality 
347241,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, A modern hotel with comfortable facilities The hotel was a 10 minute walk from the station and about 15 minute from Ann frank house The rooms very clean with very comfortable beds I would recommend this hotel although it may not be central enough for some people 
347242,Room Mate Aitana, Nothing to dislike from me and my girlfriend , Room mate Astana is a cool funky hotel close enough so everything is within a walkable distance yet far enough away to escape the throngs and madness The rooms are first class and the beds and pillows are probably the most comfortable I ve ever slept in All round top drawer 
347243,Room Mate Aitana, Broken coffee machine Nonetheless I would stay here again , breakfast was fantastic EXCEPT Only 2 coffee machines and one was broken the last 2 mornings we were there over a weekend which was a very busy time You really could not get coffee without a 10 15 min wait NOTE to Room Mate Get another coffee machine for back up 
347244,Room Mate Aitana, I had made a request for a certain bed configuration 2 x double beds and was assured that this would be on the hotel s computer Nobody seemed to know this We could not decrease the temperature in the room which was too hot The room did not have adequate lighting in the main area and was too dark There was only one coffee machine at breakfast with a long queue Should be a separate access to hot water It was a longer walk from the Central Station than anticipated , The room was a good size and very comfortable the bathroom and shower was also big The products provided in the bathroom were excellent The breakfast was very good Free Wi Fi easy to access Information given at check in with an info sheet was very helpful 
347245,Room Mate Aitana, This hotel is quite a walk from the central station If you are carrying big luggage you can take bus no 48 which is one stop from the central station Similarly you can take the same bus to the central station and go to the various attractions from there You can get the transport pass which will cover all the bus tram and train ride It will be definitely worth it The nearest supermarket called Albert Hejin is actually 15 mins walk away , Rooms were big and the bed was very comfortable There is a nice Bagel and Beans cafe just opposite the hotel which you can take a decent breakfast if you are not having breakfast at the hotel 
347246,Room Mate Aitana, If there s service for transferring customers or even just their bags from the Centraal would be awesome It s not a very easy walk from Centraal with luggage and yet it s not long enough for taking a cab The bathing bowl was a bit tall , The room was bigger than I expected The outlook is modern It s comfy with good view They offer us courtesy early check in 
347247,Room Mate Aitana, Lack of communication with late check out times but was soon resolved , Amazingly comfortable beds and amazing shower facilities Staff also very happy and friendly 
347248,Room Mate Aitana, it is a 15min walk from the Centraal Station partly due to the ongoing road works near to the Station But the morning breeze along the riverside makes the walk cooling , Very cool and nice hotel 
347249,Room Mate Aitana, We stayed in a room on the fourth floor 423 Only problem was we could here the music from the bar at night due to the location of the room allocated to us , Lovely large airy comfortable bedrooms Powerful shower in a spacious bathroom Very clean hotel and staff were more than helpful 
347250,Room Mate Aitana, Though the hotel is on a portion of land that extends into the water bay the hotel is hidden within three different buildings that have better views The lighting in the rooms are not good and very dim Finally we upgraded our room at an additional cost to the 11 th floor but the room was stinking and on complaining no one came up for checking the same , Location
347251,Room Mate Aitana, Due to our late arrival we had to have a wet room instead of a normal bathroom which was more inconvenient However as it was a large room it wasn t a huge problem and we didn t request a move the following day which had been offered by Reception It seemed rather expensive with no breakfast included That would have been an extra 21 per day per person , The room was large spotlessly clean comfortable and quiet Very well situated next to the harbour and close to the main railway station The foyer is very attractive with plenty of sitting and meeting areas 
347252,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, The room was very clean the staff were friendly and the view was great The hotel is very conveniently located only a short walk from the city center
347253,Room Mate Aitana, Housekeeping coordination bad I arrived at 16 30 2 days and the room was not clean already okay large hotel lot of rooms I can accept that but the service knock the door at least 3 different times during the afternoon Please don t bother if you are not called , Great hotel and facilities Nice restaurant 
347254,Room Mate Aitana, Unfortunately the pan cakes were really dry most of the time I think it was because of the machine , The young crowd at the reception was always super nice and extremely helpful Such a great team The breakfast was on the one side super nice the girl making the eggs is a true artist remembered what I ordered the days before and was always super nice 
347255,Room Mate Aitana, Breakfast selection was quite poor considering the price of the hotel , Super fast wifi very close to the train station as well as city centre Rooms spacious and very tidy Bar and restaurant are excellent 
347256,Room Mate Aitana, Decoration of the room was pretty poor and the breakfast could have been better Also price quality ratio was poor since the demand for Amsterdam hotels were high at that time Otherwise ratio would have been better , Stylish lobby but the room wasn t that special Reception and lobby bar staff were great 
347257,Room Mate Aitana, The banging of doors whilst housekeeping were cleaning the above rooms through out the day , The hotel was in an ideal location The rooms very comfortable and good sized We had a great view Staff were lovely 
347258,Room Mate Aitana, Breakfast was very expensive but plenty of options close by , Stylish modern hotel close to the city centre and train station Quiet location Helpful staff thank you for the great restaurant recommendation 
347259,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, Fabulous location without being right in the centre easy walking distance to Dam square etc Check in was quick staff couldn t have been more helpful Room was lovely great size 
347260,Room Mate Aitana, I really couldn t say anything here everything was perfect , The staff were amazing they thought of everything and made us feel so welcomed We had food in the hotel one night infact it was the last night and the food was so tasty we wished we would have tired it sooner 
347261,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, The location was beautiful as was the decor of the hotel The staff were extremely helpful and offered fantastic advice and tips on the best sights to see and even gave us coupons to save us money on trips which we used Thank you once again for a brilliant stay at your fabulous hotel 
347262,Room Mate Aitana, Foods are little different from Switzerland , Everything was good except weather We used all type of transport systems car bus boat Taxi and public transport 
347263,Room Mate Aitana, The hotel s place is ok it seems in the center but the taxi drivers refuse for service from train station to hotel Due to this reason you can came to face with walking more thn 1 5km wth your laguages The hotel place is very far to dome square The heating system fixed 22celcius and you cant operate it more then this level , Cleaning reception service sleeping quality 
347264,Room Mate Aitana, I think breakfast for 18euros p p are quite too much Its breakfast not lunch I didnt find a place to smoke so i had to go down to the main entrance from the 4floor not very comfortable , Nice place near the city center Rooms are nice and clean the design of the rooms and all hotel are really beautiful Reception ladies are very nice so are the other hotels staff 
347265,Room Mate Aitana, Pillow was a bit firm Minus this everything was perfect , Great service Rose petals on bed upon arrival with personal message Didn t want disturbed the 3 nights I was there and had no issues at all SILENT hotel great sleep 
347266,Room Mate Aitana, Expensive mini bar , Excellent location The staff couldn t have been more helpful and friendly They always smiled and went out of their way to speak to you 
347267,Room Mate Aitana, Bad Location Some of the staffs where not helpful The rooms are very simply decorated The toilet and bathroom are not a 4 star hotel standard The price of food at the restaurant is absolutely unfair and you get a small amount of food while you pay a big amount of money I reached there at 8 00 in the morning and I had to go to the Exhibition and based on that I asked from reception somewhere to change my cloths and they offered me the toilet I, Most of the staffs were friendly and helpful The room was clean 
347268,Room Mate Aitana, Only problem was I got priced out of the breakfast , This place was amazing from the get go A warm welcome and convenient parking I didn t get the breakfast as it was expensive But the minibar was well stocked The Wi Fi was super fast The rooms was so comfy lovely views on the higher floors also The location is perfect for an easy 20 minute walk into the centre of Amsterdam 
347269,Room Mate Aitana, The room was not ready for 14 00 Well so we just had a drink at the hotel bar while waiting for not more then 5 minutes , Excellent hotel in Amsterdam staff very friendly rooms just perfect breakfast delicious to start the day in Amsterdam The fact that a car parking is next door was an additional reason to chose this place We ll come back for sure 
347270,Room Mate Aitana, Room door make noise when closing small hair on the toilet floor and shower floor from the previous guest when we just got in to the room I m very sensitive with this thing One of the towel was dirty have small black dust on it , Location is good away from the crowd and beautiful view Friendly staff 
347271,Room Mate Aitana, Location too far out of City Centre 15 minute walk in cold and rain not recommended Breakfast overly expensive and poor choice Excellent shop opposite Hotel hand made gourmet sandwiches at a fraction of the Hotel offerings , Clean large modern comfortable Rooms
347272,Room Mate Aitana, A bit of a palaver to walk there from Central Station as there is so much construction and you have to run the gauntlet of mass cyclists and busily trafficked roads Check out process was a bit laboured , Good design oriented newly built hotel with all the mod cons Excellent wifi throughout Seemed like a lively bar although didn t use myself Close to Central Station of Amsterdam on the waterfront of the Ij 
347273,Room Mate Aitana, Reception area should be much more comfortable than it is some easy chairs can make it easier to wait check in , Great location of the Hotel and really well finished room We were on the 11th floor and the sight was wonderful Staff great they changed our room complying our request for a room without a fitted carpet Great restaurant area with good selections of wine beers and high quality served foods There is a covered parking downstair of facility we have payed 45 for 31 hours 
347274,Room Mate Aitana, My room was located next to chambermaid room Starting from 08 00 it was absolutely impossible to sleep Because it was critically noisy Every movement by chambermaid was excellently accompanied with a noise , The hotel is quite new I was living on highest floor The views from the room were great The personnel was very friendly 
347275,Room Mate Aitana, Our first room was awful it wasn t even close to what is shown on the pictures Also the receptionist who checked us in was a little bit condescending Later that day receptionist G lten helped us move to a better room and take care of us , Our Second room was very nice 
347276,Room Mate Aitana, Hotel is short walk to train station but area is a bit isolated especially at night Expensive breakfast , Great staff and service and beautiful clean rooms with great view 
347277,Room Mate Aitana, There is honestly nothing that could have been done to improve our stay it truly was amazing We spent so much time at our hotel this time because we didn t really want to leave , Staff are amazing beds are so comfy views fantastic The cocktails in the bar are exceptional and we had a really lovely time in the restaurant looking out on the water drinking wine I was a bit dubious about booking this hotel as the price was so reasonable I thought there must be a catch and expected us to be disappointed with tired d cor etc I could not have been more wrong The hotel is so luxurious and is lit up so beautifully on a night For the price you really cannot get better 
347278,Room Mate Aitana, Restaurant choice is too limited and contained only pretentious faffy food First time I ever walked out of a restaurant without ordering , Large quiet and comfortable room
347279,Room Mate Aitana, Very poor English breakfast Rubbery eggs restricted choice of hams and cheeses No shaving mirrors nor bathrobes , Large modern airy and quiet rooms Immaculate cleanliness Friendly staff 
347280,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, I stayed only for 2 days for a short business trip I loved this hotel and would recommend it to others 5 minutes from central station spacious room comfortable bed very clean helpful staff Also breakfast was available till noon 
347281,Room Mate Aitana, Room not clean dirt and things left under beds even found someone s baseball cap under the bed clear sign that they do not clean under beds Whilst hotel says they are children friendly its not the best choice for families since the hotel restaurant doesn t really cater for children The menu is limited and do not even offer children s meals Seems like they do not really like having kids in the restaurant No on site parking have to use the underground car park 25 00 per day , Great location good facilities very new modern and great for business or couples Free Wi Fi bonus and really nice area the dock looks amazing at night 
347282,Room Mate Aitana, Location is a bit far from central station especially if you re bringing luggage Pillows are a bit hard but the bed is comfy , Room and toilet size is really big very clean too We got the water view but couldn t go out to the balcony though so that s a bit weird Good value for money given how big the room is and we got offered welcome drinks The staff are also really helpful We ve had a dreadful arrival from Paris Wallet got stolen and our baggage got left behind in Paris never ever fly with KLM again even though we were flying home the next day Staff helped to call KLM service number to ask for us the whereabouts of our baggage when the KLM airport staff themselves refuse to call for us and organise to have it delivered on the next flight 
347283,Room Mate Aitana, The breakfast was expensive and disorganised with limited choice for the money The coffee and orange juice both ran out and took a while to be replenished Fair to say we only had breakfast on one morning , The bed was lovely and the large windows were great Very warm hotel a nice haven after a busy day in the City 
347284,Room Mate Aitana, Really nothing we loved everything This is not a downtown Hotel and it maybe a little bit far away if you are with small kids , Excellent hotel With a very good trade off between price and quality We liked that the breakfast was served until 12 that was great We also loved the fact that the hotel has baby sitter service GREAT that we we had the opportunity to enjoy a couple of nights in AMS We loved so much that we cam back at the same hotel and room at the end of our vacations in Europe 
347285,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, The bed was HUGE and so comfortable Staff couldn t do enough for us really friendly A little out of the centre but easily walkable Would highly recommend 
347286,Room Mate Aitana, I had a breakfast box prepared the first morning when I had to leave at 6 40 for a train to get to my work destination The quality of the packed breakfast was quite poor compared to what was offered at the breakfast buffet They didn t give much chance for choosing on the form that I filled out I suggest improving that form Also the loud music in the lobby at most hours is kind of annoying But I am 58 years old and its clear this is a hotel geared towards younger clientele so I guess that it doesn t bother them Also I could not hear it from my room The insulation was good The lighting in the room was very very dim even with every single light possible fully lit The hotel is in a nice corner on the Ij but is at best a 13 minute walk to any sort of public transportation People should be aware , The staff were fantastically helpful There were always plenty of people at the front desk to help At many fancier hotels Sheraton Hilton they are perpetually understaffed and have short waiting lines only for executive club members Here there was no need They really went out of their way to help and provide information etc Outstanding service The room was large and comfortable with plenty of nice towels and shampoo The wifi was fine On my last morning they opened the breakfast 10 minutes early to accommodate me since I had to leave for my flight That was really excellent service Bike rental place and a nice cafe right across the street made it very convenient I didn t rent a bike but the idea of it was nice 
347287,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, Near to central station about 10 min walk very clean and comfort room with all extras Great view to the river Excellent breakfast and very helpful staff A 4star hotel in the center but in a very quiet area They didn t charged the late check out 
347288,Room Mate Aitana, N a, Everything was close and at a walkable distance 10 min walk from the centraal train station 100 recommended Staff are extremely helpful Bike hiring oppetsite hotel Awesome bagel restaurants oppersite hotel too 
347289,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, Great welcome helpful staff Room hotel in general very clean warm Was offered an upgrade on arrival for a room with a better view Glad I accepted 
347290,Room Mate Aitana, Really we liked everything as I mentioned in my previous note this hotel is not in the center of Downtown but is located good enough to walk from it almost everywhere We had a 3 year old son so sometimes this was a little bit of a problem because he got tired buy in spite of that we recommend it Yes they have babysitter available so we had the opportunity to enjoy some of the hight life in AMS , we liked almost everything the hotel in general the rooms breakfast is served until noon which is perfect for the party animals We used the babysitting services 2 nights and it was perfect for us that travelled with our 3 years old son It is very closed to the trains station and to the tours in the canal or with the red bus We never took a taxi and always walked everywhere even though is not the best located Hotel We spent 3 weeks in Europe and AMS was our first stop we liked it so much that we decided to come back and we booked on the same hotel I believe that is a good reference per se

347339,Room Mate Aitana, I can t think of anything , Stayed at many hotels on our trip this was the best one Right across the street from the train stn yet quiet Staff went out of their way to help 
347340,Room Mate Aitana, Its not the cheapest hotel in the area and while it is very clean and modern I felt that there wasnt any added value for the relatively high price the rooms while clean are basic why not add a coffee machine The breakfast is very expensive 20 euros per person and not included in the rooms price which forced us to eat outside every morning Thankfully there are a couple of very nice cafes right in front of the hotel The shower water pressure was also not great at all , The hotel is super clean being pretty new it looks very modern and thoughtfully designed The rooms were kept in pristine condition every day The location is very close to the central station The staff was very kind and welcoming 
347341,Room Mate Aitana, Shuttle service to the airport was running behind Driver was 1 2 hour late Transportation otherwise was very good , Location and property were outstanding Great proximity to downtown 
347342,Room Mate Aitana, Some improvements 1 Train the housekeeping staff to first look at the Do Not Disturb door hanging sign on the door handles BEFORE knocking on guest room doors at 8 AM Then after around 9 or 9 30 AM enter the unit to do the cleaning I was out of my room for touring the city by 10 AM When I returned I saw to my dismay that the bed wasn t made the towels in the bathroom weren t refolded or replaced and the room wasn t tidied up I had to decide whether to tip the housekeeping staff when I left the hotel the next day In the end common decency won out over common sense 2 Revise the elevator directory of services and facilities to omit references to a gym on the 1 floor There was no such facility on the property 3 If the property wants people to enjoy the bar at the Ij dock facility they need to promote it more Just having the bar there on the Ij dock is not enough How about a promotion that includes a bar beverage in combination with a tour of one of the docked yachts at the adjacent marina How about a sunset canal or Ij river boat cruise that concludes with dinner at the hotel 4 Elderly or mobility challenged guests please note that the shower stall in the bathroom does NOT have safety rails to hold on to and there is a high step from the bathroom floor into the shower and a low step from the shower to the curb then that high step to the bathroom floor I didn t see that step situation and fell on my right hip after taking a shower Hotel manager please install safety rails to the shower stalls if you want to avoid lawsuits from disabled guests , The staff members at the Front Desk and the Concierge s Desk were very helpful especially when they helped me not only successfully navigate my way to Amsterdam s Centraal Station but also to confirm the transfer from the hotel to the cruise ship terminal The rooms are very nice but if you want a nice room that overlooks the river Ij ask for one that does so because the room I got looked over an office building and an apartment building rather than river views I chose the hotel because the Movenpick wasn t available and the other hotel available by the cruise line screamed business traveler Note Trams are a great way to explore the city if you re not a bicycle rider Ditto for walking and canal boats I d like a better explanation of how to ride those water taxis using the I Amsterdam transport cards Do not trust Tram operators to tell you how to get to Centraal Station the main station for boarding trams and trains you will get lost if you rely on them to give you accurate directions I did just that got lost and had to flag down a taxi to take me to my hotel This was especially the case w the operator of Tram 10 Regarding the food and beverage service at Room Mate Aitana I found the bar service to be very attentive especially if you ask for munchies to go w your beverages They also have a great selection of Belgian beers Regarding food I only experienced the breakfast service at the hotel which was provided free of change to hotel guests as a buffet Chefs please try to make your scrambled eggs taste less yolky than what I had The water and OJ glasses were held on a high shelf and should be taken down to a lower shelf for better accessibility The fruits and pastries were terrific Ditto for the bacon 
347343,Room Mate Aitana, We had to wait 4 hours to be checked into our rooms making different excuses each time we had asked We were given complementary drinks and a free room upgrade , Room upgrade
347344,Room Mate Aitana, Location for musuems wasn t amazing but saying that the hotels by the musuems were too far from the center of Amsterdam , The hotel was really nice and clean 5 minute walk from Amsterdam central train station better and cheaper than the Double Tree nearby 
347345,Room Mate Aitana, We were given a free drink on our arrival which was very nice When we used the voucher the drinks were added to our room At checkout we were advised that the voucher can only be used in the first floor bar not bottom floor bar so we had to then pay We felt that it was pointless offering the free drinks as both bars form part of the hotel and we were not advised of any restriction Also one day room service did not come we called and they apologised and said someone would come straight away which was actually 2 1 2 hours later , Good location 
347346,Room Mate Aitana, No TV Problem with the conection apparentley as a single traveller this is important Quite far to walk into town Shower needs more power Bathroom shower gel etc is gimmicky and hard to open , Really unique style of hotel Great staff excellent room with great views Great bed linen was super bathroom lovely all spotlessly clean Good curtains that blocked out all light good facilities in the room

347358,Room Mate Aitana, Shower could have been more powerful and much hotter We didn t have breakfast there as 20pp seemed a bit pricey , Comfy bed good toiletries and friendly staff 
347359,Room Mate Aitana, A bit far from the center of town and the walk to town via the train station area was a bit sketchy at night A little on the expensive side including breakfast in the rate would have made it a better value Pillows were also quite hard although the bed was excellent , Large room quality amenities in the room close to train station friendly staff quiet room We were on the 9th floor facing the city side nice view

347393,Room Mate Aitana, The room doors are like slam doors and unfortunately you hear every door shut when other guests don t close them gently them , Stayed a few times and always feel welcomed had a suite this time which was really nice 
347394,Room Mate Aitana, Maybe this is just me but the pillows were very very large as in high I did ask for a replacement pillow but didn t get one I found it difficult to get comfortable and didn t sleep well and this was in an Executive suite so maybe the Hotel should get a few spare pillows , The staff were great The location was great lovely looking hptel
347395,Room Mate Aitana, food available in restuarant was not a great selection for a hotel of this standing lots of options were not available gym was a little sparse, location deco very clean and modern nice bar area to relax 
347396,Room Mate Aitana, The toilet across of bedrooms The price is overcharged , Clean hotel in a convinience place and great breakfast The staff was very helpful especially SELLYNA in reception is a amazing person 
347397,Room Mate Aitana, Breakfast was included but I was charged extra While it was all you can eat I do not eat a lot at breakfast so I paid 17 50 euro pp They need to make that clearer in booking , Close to central Amsterdam but away from the noise and chaos In the marina and 10 min walk from central station You can see it from your window 
347398,Room Mate Aitana, Really nothing to complain about but if I need to mention something Gym has plenty of space for stretching but does not have any yoga mats, Spacious non smoking airy rooms with large floor to ceiling windows providing lovely views over a small marina and the city good size bathroom and very very comfy beds Rooms have safe fridge and ironing boards plenty of power plugs although there could be more next to the beds Funky cool design in the lobby area and clean finishing of the rooms hotel comes with a spacious gym in the basement Great quiet location just outside the hustle and bustle of the center 1km from Central station 2km from Dam square Great wifi all around
347399,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, Short walk from the Central Station the room was great and really comfortable Excellent facilities and the minibar was spot on with lots of choice Very helpful staff Lounge bar area good with decent choice of drinks Didn t have breakfast at the hotel as found it overpriced there s Bagel Beans literally across the street so you can eat there for 1 2 the price Area safe and great for a morning evening jog You need to remember this is not in the center of Amsterdam so if you re out and about sightseeing for the whole day there is still a bit of walking to do to get back to the hotel 
347400,Room Mate Aitana, 3 lifts for all floors We got stuck on 9th floor for 10 minutes to get a lift to ground floor, Interior design of hotel and welcoming staff makes it really pleasant It s located in a nice quite area 
347401,Room Mate Aitana, Booked breakfast but told it wasn t included In package which was dissapointing to say the least as cost 28 pounds tea and coffee in room we had to pay for which I ve never come across ever the staff a little uninterested and everything in hotel had a price which was extortionate, Nice comfy bed shower was nice and room spotlessly clean plus good channels on TV
347402,Room Mate Aitana, breakfast too expensive 19 17 5 if you order upfront no fish salmon halibut no hot fresh chocolate milk no fresh sliced fruit either you take a complete orange or you take the fruitsalad with mostly watermelon preserves in plastic no fresh pepper or salt fresh juice is from a jar , spacious room good and large bed nice rainshower
347403,Room Mate Aitana, The check in and check out process takes way too long , The location is good and hotel is facing the water A quick ten minutes walk you are right in the Central Station area 
347404,Room Mate Aitana, The breakfast No variety and we stayed 3 nights Every breakfast was the same every day , Had the rooms with 2 x double beds Very big rooms with the right amenities Food at restaurant was excellent though very pricy Location is all right though you would have to walk about 15 20minutes to centrum for all the touristy facilities Excellent wifi No limit of gadgets 
347405,Room Mate Aitana, Nothing , A good quality modern City Hotel Very helpful staff concierge excellent full of good advice Made the stay seamless Great views over the river and the City especially from the upper floors 
347406,Room Mate Aitana, We did find it very expensive even for Amsterdam As we had to leave quite early on the Saturday it was a disappointment to learn that they only serve breakfast which was included in the price quite late on a Saturday morning which we then had to miss They did pack a breakfast which we appreciated but is was a very meager meal a fruit and a roll , We just stayed for one night as we were in transit to catch a plane the next morning and the hotel is perfectly situated close to the central station yet with the advantage of being on the IJ and not in the inner city 
347407,Room Mate Aitana, Booked a queen room for a special 3 nights with my girlfriend The room we received was nothing like advertised at all Was very very expensive for what we got Would not book here again or recommend , Amsterdam is a beautiful place to visit 
347408,Room Mate Aitana, Nothing , The colourful decor gave the hotel a great atmosphere and its proximity to the town centre meant it was quiet at night but only a five minute picturesque walk to Centraal station and so close to the historical area of Amsterdam We had a room on the tenth floor which gave us a very nice view of the city 
347409,Room Mate Aitana, I had to travel to Amsterdam for business 3 nights and decided to extend my stay by two nights to see the city I had made a booking for 5 nights using my credit card Upon arrival staff at the reception asked me to pay upfront for my stay I then informed them that I would be paying using different credit cards my business card for the duration of my business visit and my personal credit card for the last two nights of my stay this was the card that I had used to complete the booking on booking com They only took payment for the first 3 nights but failed to inform me that the electronic keys would expire after 3 days When the electronic keys to the room expired I went to the reception and enquired about it I initially interacted with two members of staff who behaved as if I had deceived them I realised that it would take a while for them to sort everything out so I asked them to re issue the keys for my partner to go back to the room while I made the payment They demanded that I pay for the two remaining nights and they would not re activate the keys until the payment had been processed it took them more than 15 20 minutes to sort everything out When I told them that they already had my card as the booking had been made electronically through booking com they told me that they did not have access to my booking details I then challenged them to explain to me why they did not ask for an upfront payment for the entire duration of my stay they claimed that my card had insufficient funds I was told that they would investigate the incident and get back to me It s been 25 days since I checked out but I have not heard from them yet ,No Positive
347410,Room Mate Aitana, The room was very stark and the large window made the sun very hot You need a bike if you re staying here as it s quite far to walk anywhere , The external design and great views of the water at night 
347411,Room Mate Aitana, Nothing really Lift can be slow to arrive at peak times but we were not in a rush , The staff had noted that it was my birthday during our stay from my passport and on the due day I receive a lovely handwritten card and delicious bowl of exotic fruits with their warm wishes An excellent touch and surprise 
347412,Room Mate Aitana, No inclement weather transfer options no shelter from the wind rain even though a 10 min brisk walk from Centraal Station Perhaps a hotel bus service could be pressed into service when needed , Breakfast was very good Corner upgraded room was awesome 
347413,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, Rooms were lovely and spacious with very comfortable beds Staff were very helpful and the wifi box you can have to take around the city is an excellent idea 
347414,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, very comfortable rooms staff very knowledgeable and helpful great location just away from chaos of Amsterdam centre especially if you use the local transport with the great 24 hour discount tickets Ask for top floor upgrade facing over the City 
347415,Room Mate Aitana, Very busy with tour coaches tour operators Breakfast expensive 40 euros per day for two people , Good location very clean great beds excellent soundproofing helpful staff Would stay here again 
347416,Room Mate Aitana, slow checkin due to training so not really their fault had to go through 3 persons in the reception one in the kitchen to borrow a butter knife, great room and very spacious
347417,Room Mate Aitana, If you arrive day time you will be delighted by nice modern spacious room but after sunset even you turn on all lighting it s so dark and I had difficulty to unpack my suit case I ve asked staff to call taxi but didn t arrive and had to rearrange by myself I was surprised by cleaning lady dusting the roof and wall even a lot of guest having breakfast right below I had 15cm cut because of very sharp damaged hand shower on my leg I asked for the medicine to reception the first staff I spoke to was very rude and gave me a bad look which I don t really expected , Very clean and modern design nice breakfast
347418,Room Mate Aitana, The breakfast I personally had was very poor and expensive , Beds comfy and rooms are clean with nice views I also like the location it s just out the way of the busy areas 
347419,Room Mate Aitana, Nothing All great , Right next to Centraal Station Perfect location Lovely view of the river from our room Option to pay more for a room on the top floors of the hotel with a view of the city centre at check in Great value for money Staff were polite friendly and helpful 
347420,Room Mate Aitana, only a very small number of rooms overlook the water Even rooms on the water side are obstructed by another building Its a strange and interesting design all the windows open into a glass area that protects the building not to the street so you can never check out the weather without going outside of the building, this hotel is very close to the train station so if you arrive by train it s a plus It is also very close to the Amsterdam boat tours A short walk to the Concert Hall based on the water and you can watch the sunset over the water
347421,Room Mate Aitana, The location while close to central station is a good 10 minute walk and there is no footpath at one point so you have to walk in the cycle lane, Service was always prompt and with a smile
347422,Room Mate Aitana, The price , Modern rooms with tea coffe facilities We upgrade room for the top floor room so it had amasing view on the city Hotel is just 5 minutes walk from train station Soudprouf is very good 
347423,Room Mate Aitana, Restaurant is managed by different company Some of their staff were a bit grumpy Breakfast overpriced and buffet understocked , Very comfy room great location close to Central Station 
347424,Room Mate Aitana, Being British we really like our tea with fresh milk but it didn t spoil the visit so not a big issue , All of the staff went above and beyond to give excellent customer service from the front desk to the chamber maids Nothing was too much trouble Excellent breakfasts with everything you could possibly want Bright modern rooms Just fabulous and our two friends who we had booked for as well loved it too The provision of computers and printer for guest use complimentary was an unexpected bonus and the checkout and breakfast times were nice and long so you really could relax from the first moment til the last One of the best hotel stays we have ever had Thank you
347425,Room Mate Aitana, No movie channels on the TV I would have been happy to pay extra to chill out with a good movie, Breakfast was excellent rooms big modern and clean 
347426,Room Mate Aitana, Recepcionist that checked us in tried to upsell to better room when refused he became less friendly and rushed through the process Breakfast very expensive and could have more staff assisting during busy times Overall price is expensive, Location bedroom was clean and comfortable loved the balloons and delicious birthday cake surprise for my husband that gave a very special touch to our stay
347427,Room Mate Aitana, On arrival we were told there was no cot for our daughter despite booking one oh but you booked through Booking com and it does say subject to availability Frankly as a parent that s like saying here s your room but it has no bed it it that would not be acceptable and this is not acceptable in any way If you tell me when I book there is not cot then I go and book somewhere else Its that Simple A childs safety is paramount and not subject to availability Starting our stay this way ruined our experience in this hotel I do not want to start my stay with a fight and then have to think about trying to fond another hotel Although it was sorted and no doubt someone else therefore had the same experience later and an apology made it is not acceptable EVER and its not the first time this has happened and sadly not the first time we have been made to feel like 2nd class citizens for using booking com , The room was a good size we paid for a view and it was good breakfast was nice to look out over Amsterdam and enjoy the sunshine We ate in the restaurant one evening and that was very good too Its a shame because overall the hotel was very nice but our overall experience was spoilt by a terrible first impression 
347428,Room Mate Aitana, Very low lighting in the room No drawers at all for privacy Bizzare bedside box instead of table with at least one drawer, Beautiful hotel beautiful view charming service excellent food 
347429,Room Mate Aitana, Changing water pressure when taking a shower from hot to cold Airconditioning problem in the bedroom, Very well located 20 minutes walking distance to the dam square Quiet location no noice during the night Large rooms and bathrooms great view over the town 
347430,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, Great location right in the city Less than 10 mints walk from the Central Station New and modern Nice bar restaurant lobby area Big room comfortable bed Helpful staff 
347431,Room Mate Aitana, Room is suppose to face the water front but instead view was block and face the city, Room is spacious and comfortable Bed is nice 15 mins walk to Amsterdam Central 
347432,Room Mate Aitana, The room is quite dark at night time Hard to read in the room , Hotel location is great 10 15mins walking distance from Amsterdam Central The room is clean room temperature is comfortable 
347433,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, A lovely modern hotel Near to the station and an easy walk to the town centre Beautiful view of the water from the upper floors excellent food and very helpful staff 
347434,Room Mate Aitana, furniture bed was great but the chairs are cumbersome and difficult to move The set up of room 502 is difficult but having more mobile chairs and smaller coffee table would have made it a more comfortable room do not need so many food or refrigerator stocked items breakfast cost too high need choices rather than full breakfast provide separation of trash items would be more green might propose to tie in with bar across the street that was always empty but must have a great view at boats going by, location full view of river access to central station restaurant coffee machine friendly folks
347435,Room Mate Aitana, Really Nothing everything was fine, Great and friendly staff The rooms especially our room are very warm and welcoming Towels changed every day Gym opended 24 7 The bar at the first floor is very nice The cook prepares custome made eggs WONDERFUL Great hotel not only for businessmen if you are plan a visit in Amsterdam the hotel is really worth a look Good accomadation good price 10 minute walk to the central station where you can easily reach the center by food Ps instead of the bathroom i uploaded another pic of our room which was awesome 
347436,Room Mate Aitana, coffee machines in some rooms only Corridors lights are ugly Ppl at the bar 1 floor are always closed 15 or 20 mins before its time , Clean Comfort Spacious rooms View Friendly reception especially Marta
347437,Room Mate Aitana, This is my second time here and I always seem to have issues with the bill ie Charged for useing mini bar but didn t charged for breakfast but didn t have it far to expencive , The Hotel is very clean and there s loads of space in the rooms unlike a lot in Amsterdam The location is great and the staff are very pleasant 
347438,Room Mate Aitana, The breakfast is really quite poor in terms of range and quality The dinner menu in the restaurant wasn t at all appealing too contrived and chefy I think the hotel is expensive relative to similar hotels in a number of other cities but Amsterdam does seem to be expensive hotel wise , Room Mate Aitana is a new and funky hotel The design of the hotel gives it the feel of a smaller hotel than it actually is The rooms are bright clean and comfortable The rooms were also quiet I couldn t hear anyone in either adjoining rooms or in the corridors The staff were without exception pleasant and helpful When I checked in I was given a map and an offer of assistance with advice or booking of tours I know the location has been raised by some reviewers There is a cycle hire shop immediately opposite the hotel reception The hotel recommended the company I completely agree with the recommendation nice people and very reasonable price I hired a bike for four days and ended up enjoying the ride to and from the hotel to all the places in Amsterdam that I visited Aitana is a good option I d absolutely stay here again and recommend it to travellers to lovely Amsterdam 
347439,Room Mate Aitana, Nothing , Very good location close to the central railway station near the downtown it is 10 minutes walking Breakfast was good Bed very comfortable Building is modern 
347440,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, Easy access from to Schipol Airport by train through Amsterdam Central Bike parking in front of te hotel Ten minutes walking to downtown to Anna Frank House and to many other city spots
347441,Room Mate Aitana, Breakfast is ok it would be perfect if more choices, Quiet room really fantastic clean design Big double beds is a perfect option if you have young kids Great location close to the connections The staff Perfect and very helpful when needed
347442,Room Mate Aitana, No complaints, The hotel is new modern and absolutely beautiful Rooms are large and comfortable with a great view of the water Staff was helpful and kind 
347443,Room Mate Aitana, but the pillows enormous and hard and there was nothing else on offer when I asked But I m not alone in liking a much flatter pillow, The beds were comfy
347444,Room Mate Aitana, 1 It would be better if the hotel could also carry shuttle bus service chargeable or not to the central railway station It still takes around 10 minutes to walk there 2 The location is great for boarding a train but it is a bit far from the city center Dam Square therefore the view from the room is not that stunning 3 House keeping can be bettered I left my trench coat on the table and when I came back it was still there , 1 Staff were great and breakfast palatable 2 The room was very quiet 3 Near Amsterdam Central Station 4 Cleansing kits are great 
347445,Room Mate Aitana, From personal experience I certainly would not recommand that hotel which looks and feels more like a train station hall than a place you could call home for a few days Answering to an offer sent by mail I chose to pay to get upgraded when elsewhere this is usually offered on arrival only to be proposed once arrived to pay again for an other better upgrade The room was nice enough facing not the sea nor the city but the industrial zone of A dam why should we pay for that view I wondered Long queues are to be expected on checking in or out at any time clueless smileless trainees requiring that you fill up new forms distributed at random what s the use of Booking com then some justification being that the system doesn t work In this dark and inhospitable place where breakfast cost 20 euros room service is very invasive someone from room service stepped in my room early one morning without being invited that s a first And every morning up to three cleaning trolleys were parked in the corridor leading to my room and were still there by the middle of the afternoon All in all hospitality standards seem quite low at the Aitana and I definitely won t be a roomate again , The Central train station is within walking distance 
347446,Room Mate Aitana, Only the limited choice in the rest for our child who has many allergies Had warned them in advance but nothing suitable , Staff were so charming and friendly
347447,Room Mate Aitana, Location is not far but a bit of a walking distance to the real city center which starts from the central station in average 10 12 minutes by foot , Very modern hotel with panoramic windows The staff was very kind The room was big clean and had a balcony and a nice view 
347448,Room Mate Aitana, No one informed us about the bus which is across the hotel as it was a bit difficult to walk to the Central station as the road is prepared for the bikes and cars and it is a bit far I didn t like the breakfast no varieties poor , I like the view and the comfort the pillows and Mattress the hotel in general is very nice and new 
347449,Room Mate Aitana, Price that s all I can say but then who wouldn t want things cheaper, Was lovely hotel staff were amazing The bath was so deep and the bed was so comfy I wanted to take them both home with me Locations abit out there but it s worth it for the view It only takes about 15mins to walk into town though The breakfast was lovely with a good choice pretty much anything you want Would defo recommend the hotel and would stay there again 
347450,Room Mate Aitana, It is very closed to the Amsterdam Centraal Station but not convenient You have a half mile walk to either the tram or the the beginning of the city In winter it hurts because you are walking close to the pier and wind makes it difficult and chilly, The hotel is perfect clean built recently so rooms are vey comfortable Service is also great
347451,Room Mate Aitana, The advert gave the deceptive impression the hotel was on the river bank in fact there was a block of flats inbetween the hotel and the river So if a view is important pay extra No one told us you need to use your room key to activate the lift to one s room floor Chaotic signing in computer down long delays getting to our room and then we were locked out the next day so that we would go down and give our details all over again We got the impression that our room wasn t allocated when we booked but first come first served in order of arrival Great wastage a new bar of soap every day part used shower gels shampoos etc thrown away and replaced New towels every day Having to take a bus between the centre of town to the hotel Our bill showed that every night was charged at a different rate depending on room occupancy, lovely spacious room with enormous comfortable bed and superb sparkling ensuite reception staff stayed charming despite all manner of administrative problems which inconvenienced us 
347452,Room Mate Aitana, Late checkout at high cost Expensive place Noisy hall, Impressive interior design and location Excellent breakfast with great choice of options and personalized omelette Great restaurant location at the pier
347453,Room Mate Aitana, Not a dislike as such but it is approx 15 mins from central station so a bit out of the way The upside is that it is quiet , Relatively quick check in got in room early Good selection for Breakfast but a bit on the pricey side the bakery across the road would be a cheaper option Nice bar not too expensive good selection of beers 
347454,Room Mate Aitana, Balcony would not open Shame as it was a lovely view Price of the bar was very expensive Beats staying at a hostel but comes with a price , The hotel decor was to a high standard The tv showed many channels using smart technology The location was good far away enough to be in a quiet location on the dock but close enough to walk into the town A bit far from some places but cheap taxi ride 
347455,Room Mate Aitana, Expensive bar prices but one has a choice , Very nice modern hotel with friendly staff and nice views across the water and city Good location for the station and city Very nice breakfast with good choice of everything and very nice bright spacious area with nice views 
347456,Room Mate Aitana, The only thing I would say was annoying was on second day we were trying to have an afternoon sleep and they kept knocking to check we were happy with the room , Beautiful hotel friendly and helpful staff Highly recommend 
347457,Room Mate Aitana, We arrived in the evening around 21 00 and I tried to get a cup of coffee This was initially impossible because the coffee machine in the bar was broken and the restaurant had a private function I expressed my surprise that it was apparently impossible for the staff to get us some coffee from the restaurant but I had to take my complaint to management level to get my coffee This should not be necessary in a four star hotel ,No Positive
347458,Room Mate Aitana, It could of been a little warmer we had a corner room so lots of windows and at times felt a bit chilly , The room was clean comfortable and airy Perfect 
347459,Room Mate Aitana, We arrived early and there was no rooms which was understandable Then when we did get in out room wee were then disturbed twice Once to check the mini bar then to check if the room had been cleaned Also upon checking in we were told that a 100euro charge would be against the room and the rest would be charged at the end of the stay Then on our 3rd day we couldnt get in our room so i went to the reception to then be told our room had been frozen as i had not payed the outstanding balance Very annoying,No Positive
347460,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, Everything was excellent Spacious room huge comfortable bed spotlessly clean very quiet staff excellent great restaurant Unlimited high quality wi fi Even had tea and coffee in room unusual for the continent 
347461,Room Mate Aitana, Nothing, Location near central station bus 48 takes u from the hotel to central station in 5 min 2 stops only You can walk also 10 min Room big spacious room for Europe standard Bed very comfortable We had twin room with 2 qeen size bed not the standard single bed its really huge and comfy for one person So if ur looking for twin bed Room Mate is your best option Very clean and fresh rooms The hotel opened in 2012 i think so everything is fresh and new You can get free wifi to use within the city of amsterdam just ask the reception 
347462,Room Mate Aitana, I don t particularly like the concept of paying for late check out Price is 35 until 3pm and 50 if you want to stay until 5pm , Absolutely gorgeous hotel Location isn t right smack in the middle of the city however it s a short and enjoyable walk to the first canal and cosy streets 
347463,Room Mate Aitana, No movies channels but that s just being picky , Super comfy bed brilliant views and just a lovely classy feeling about the place staff very friendly and helpful Even held our bags on the day we left as we didn t fly out until 9 that night Would definitely stay again would recommend to any one reading this to do the same Thank you Room Mate Atianna
347464,Room Mate Aitana, Gym facilities were OK but would benefit greatly from steam or sauna , Great location lovely new hotel friendly staff amazing views of the marina 5 10 mins walk from the main station 
347465,Room Mate Aitana, Nothing , One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in Staff couldn t have been friendlier and was VERY clean Would highly recommend this hotel to friends visiting Amsterdam 
347466,Room Mate Aitana, Location is a bit compromised but that s rejected in the good value in pricing and a short taxi ride or 15 min walk into town isn t too much of problem, Staff are really helpful and friendly The rooms are modern and clean and place has some nice design touches The resturant is worth a visit
347467,Room Mate Aitana, We were very satisfied with the whole package , We had the room with the bicycle theme it was spacious comfortable and the facilities were excellent We loved the dockland location which was within 10 mins from centre of city We used the restaurant and the meal was very good 
347468,Room Mate Aitana, The location ot the plugs in relation to mirrors could have been better ie 2 females travelling together both need to use hairdryer at same time , Did not have breakfast in hotel
347469,Room Mate Aitana, Tourist would be pleased if Breakfast starting hour were the same during all weekdays , Large and comfortable room nice view to Amsterdam port area Silent region near Centraal Station and bus stop Very good breakfast with many choices Staff is very helpful and check in and our are fast and seamless 
347470,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, Excellent hotel with incredible views near to the main station friendly helpful staff in all areas the food and service dinner were exceptional won t hesitate to return 
347471,Room Mate Aitana, The walk to the station was a bit awkward with a stroller and luggage, The room was clean modern and comfortable Because we have a baby we were given a room with a bath and crib which was very helpful 
347472,Room Mate Aitana, Food selection in the bar could be better , Modern hotel Very bright airy Had a corner room with a great view Very comfortable and quiet Staff very friendly helpful Pity it was raining as they have a nice outside seating area by the water Located a few minutes walk away from the centre but very easy and enjoyable walking just watch out for the bicycles 
347473,Room Mate Aitana, Couldn t get out onto the balcony to take a picture never mind great view , Very helpful staff great location 10 minutes walk from central station funky vibe and interior Decent Wi Fi
347474,Room Mate Aitana, The location was ok but something more into downtown would have been nice , The bed was very comfortable The amenities were nice The room included an iron and wonderful bath products The staff were incredible very helpful and nice We opted to not have the breakfast at the hotel and go next door to the small but Very Good cafe Bagels and Beans 
347475,Room Mate Aitana, We never got any milk with our tea or coffee Having said that we never asked so maybe it would have been provided We just bought some and kept in our fridge , Great modern hotel within easy walking distance of the centre Very quiet great beds the shower was enormous and lots of hot water The room had all the necessary extras fridge hairdryer and the TV channels were good too I would recommend it and stay there again Thank you
347476,Room Mate Aitana, The weather but who can control that x, The hotel Staff on arrival where very polite and helpful the guest services went all out to make our stay special for my husbands birthday with balloons and a bottle of prosseco in room ready for our arrival paid in advance It takes around 5 minutes to walk from central station then Amsterdam is on your doorstep Queen room on upper level floors has an amazing view did nothave the breakfast or eat in hotel but food looked great and Bar service was amazing Would recommend this hotel with its modern and trendy interior and great location on the canal 
347477,Room Mate Aitana, The prices of the food was a bit pricey is only thing i didnt like, I liked the friendly welcoming staff was excellent cleaning service was good quick n mindful of your belongings had shoe shine machine n ice machine on our floor mini bar stocked with nice variety n replenished quickly even left a bottle of champagne for the staff very happy customer
347478,Room Mate Aitana, Shower was open no curtains just a piece of the glass on the side it wasnt comfortable to take a shower which caused wet and cold floor , Location staff 
347479,Room Mate Aitana, nothing to do just around but for young couple like us this was not a problem 10min walking and you are in the center of amsterdam did not try the breakfast because of the Bagel Beans just in front of the hotel , very close to the central station 6 7min walk spacious and clean room very calm nice view 10th floor for us staff very kind and helpfull
347480,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, Offered an upgrade on arrival bed was very comfy variety of drinks snacks in room decor staff excellent knowledge of the area and very welcoming 
347481,Room Mate Aitana, I didn t like how a trannie staff member mixed up our rooms and was not helpful in sorting it out until a manager stepped in , The bed was very comfortable and the view from the hotel was beautiful The higher ranked staff were very good at dealing with issues There was a mix up with our room and the manager was a great help in sorting it out 
347482,Room Mate Aitana, Breakfast was maybe a little too expensive, The bed was perfect matters was not too fluffy and not to firm Everything always clean There was a service of room service and the boiler in the room very useful 
347483,Room Mate Aitana, My initial first impressions weren t that great We were welcomed by staff at the front desk and the person went through these check in procedures very quickly with a heavy Spanish accent She was telling us that along with the payment for our stay and the tax we also had to put down a 100 euro deposit in case we used facilities No where on the website was this mentioned and she even had the cheek to say we should of read it and have we ever travelled before and insinuated we were irresponsible travellers We ve travelled many times and have never been charged anything prior to using anything We ve had to leave our card details in case we decide to so we can be charged accordingly She went on trying to explain its customary for hotels to charge up to 500 euros as a deposit and if we had travelled previously we would know this I found it to be very rude and the fact that she kept speaking so fast in such a heavy accent it s seemed dismissive In the end she said it s ok we don t have to pay but she will be in trouble Made us feel very uncomfortable and unwelcome Did not feel like we were valued customers at all even though we were paying close to 800 euros to stay there as well as it was my birthday trip We weren t treated special at all and the hotel staff aren t very personal at all very blunt and the person we dealt with was very passive aggressive Our stay was tainted by this initial impression and we didn t feel comfortable using anything at the hotel during our stay here Money driven hotel lacks personal touches , The rooms were a decent size had really nice big windows Location of hotel was great can walk into dam square within 15 min Nice views onto the canal and away from the noise and busyness of dam square 
347484,Room Mate Aitana, Nothing we didn t like I ve never said that about any hotel before , Beautiful hotel gorgeous architecture and interior design The food in the restaurant is stunning The staff are extremely helpful I can t fault our stay here And to top it off it s fantastic value for money Go try it out We ll be going back for sure It s only a ten minute walk from the station and central Amsterdam and is on its own dock so very quiet Perfect place 
347485,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, Great room bed was very comfy even though we didn t leave the room until after housekeepers had been around they still came back to do the room Great vibe around the hotel and friendly atmosphere 
347486,Room Mate Aitana, Temperature in the room was far too hot Tried in vain to adjust the thermostat but it kept going back to the original setting Our TV did not have any sound despite trying everything to correct As we were there only one night it wasn t a big deal, Restaurant was very good and the upstairs bar with its selection of unusual beers
347487,Room Mate Aitana, The location of the hotel is a little far from the city center, The breakfast was rich and included a wide variety of choices Rooms are quite spacious and very clean
347488,Room Mate Aitana, Room was very cold About a 20 min walk from the city center No trams there You have to walk it s not long but in the winter it s super cold , Beautiful hotel Very good staff Rooms are very nice and modern and clean Beautiful view 
347489,Room Mate Aitana, Coffee not replaced if used corridors light color is terrible yellow lights which makes u feel like u in phsyco asylum Balcony cannot be opened even though there is a glass after the balcony, Bed is comfortable Nespresso coffe Rooms view
347490,Room Mate Aitana, Thrers nothing I didn t like I would recomend putting the Dont not disturb sign on the door if you don t want the maids coming in at least 3 times a day asking if you need coffee or anything cleaned But that s good service for you , The hotel was very stylish The staff were very helpfull We showed up 2 hours before our check in time but Room Mate still had a room ready for us You can also check in your suit case so you don t have to drag it around Amsterdam The location is good about 15 minute walk away from Central Station and about a 30 minute walk away from Amsterdam Square This is a very nice hotel to stay in I would recomend 
347491,Room Mate Aitana, Bit of a walk to the main centre but it wasnt a major put off It s still located with great views, Upgraded room to corner room Views were amazing 
347492,Room Mate Aitana, The room was not as comfortable as I expected The hotel is so close to another building that I had to close my curtain during my stay , Location is great The breakfast is excellent as well 
347493,Room Mate Aitana, I didn t like that the rooms were very dark There was very little light there , I liked the Location and the modern style Also the food was very good 
347494,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, Location is very nice away from the crowds but you can still walk to Dam Square and many attractions The front desk employees are very helpful they gave us many recommendations on where to go and what to do during our stay Breakfast is expensive but there is a Bagel restaurant facing the Hotel that has amazing view and yummy cheap breakfast Rooms are big in size compared to Europe Hotels
347495,Room Mate Aitana, Wifi was a little weak at times especially in the bar upstairs Had a cleanliness issue in the toilet that wasn t dealt with Both issues did not spoil my stay however, Amazing staff Friendly helpful and knowledgeable Great breakfast Location close to everything
347496,Room Mate Aitana, Theroom was changed to a much tighter one on the second day , The room alotted on the first day which was given to us ahead of time which was really great and soothing for us after an over night travel
347497,Room Mate Aitana, N a, Just back from a lovely trip to Amsterdam Hotel exceeded our expectations perfect location friendly staff spotless room and super comfy bed Will be back
347498,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, The hotel was absolutely amazing the staff was very helpful and friendly Everywhere was exceptionally clean and tidy and The location of the hotel was convenient i would definately stay here again 
347499,Room Mate Aitana, Breackfast is Ok but in oposite of hotel is nice place were you can have better and cheaper one , Very good located nice hotel Very good value for money We com for sure back 
347500,Room Mate Aitana, Nothing at all, The location of the hotel was perfect for us not right in the centre and only less than 10 mins walk from the station There was a bike rental place across the road from the hotel with an underground bike park which was ideal and also a lovely healthy bagel shop if you didn t want to spend the extra and go with the B B option We will definitely be returning and using this hotel as our base next time we visit Oh yes the dinner in the hotel was really good too 
347501,Room Mate Aitana, The rooms wasn t as clean as it should be Many items such as toothpaste slippers and tissues were not available in the room , Quick check in and check out comfortable room 
347502,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, This hotel was amazing The staff was very friendly and knowledgable They even had a free wifi device that enabled you to have wifi everywhere you went 
347503,Room Mate Aitana, My only complaint very small is that the breakfast was probably a little bit expensive for what it was , Locations was great little bit out of the city centre only 15 minute walk but beautiful Staff were very attentive and the room was great 
347504,Room Mate Aitana, Can t do anything about the location so bear in mind that its a 10 15 minutes walk from the central station especially if you need to lug heavy luggage It was OK for us Taxi was not happy taking us for such a short distance and demand extra The hotel can do something about the dim lighting in the room Lights used are very dim low wattage its difficult to see stuff Others may find this OK , The hotel is new beautifully designed clean Value Good service Good wifi 
347505,Room Mate Aitana, It s fair a bit walk from the central station It s a bit pain walking in the wind carrying with heavy luggage And too short for taking a cab , Morden decoration clean bathtub 
347506,Room Mate Aitana, Room service was a bit slow , Excellent check in and check out service Very friendly and helpful staff Nice location with 15 mins walk from the central station and the city center 
347507,Room Mate Aitana, It was a bit of a walk to the action but I actually liked being 5 mins away It was still in easy reach , Beautiful view nice room Close to train station price 
347508,Room Mate Aitana, The location was a bit far from all the attractions walking was 20 30 minutes to reach Dam Square For those who can use the tram then walking is not an issue as the central station was really close by Taxi will charge you 50 to 47 Euros for one way airport Hotel transportation Didn t also like their Christmas dinner menu paid 60 Euros for one person yet I left feeling hungry l, Room was clean spacious and well designed Staff were nice and welling to answer your questions Taxi booking can be done easily by phoning the reception and it will be outside waiting for you in 5 minutes 
347509,Room Mate Aitana, i genuinely cannot fault any part of my experience of this hotel breakfast was also lovely and bar area was very comfortable, Queen roroom was absolutely superb excellent bed wonderful view and the bathroom and facilities were excellent Staff were friendly welcoming and went the extra mile to make my wife s birthday even more special 
347510,Room Mate Aitana, Payed for a queen room and was give a room on the 3rd floor and was very expensive , The room is clean and very nice Shower is perfect Service is class 
347511,Room Mate Aitana, Be careful walking over the bridge if you have had one too many , Great modern hotel Large rooms Decent price Good staff This hotel has got everything right 
347512,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, Easy to get to everything but the hotel still was very clean beds were comfortable and rooms were really quiet Some hotels know people will stay there for location and tend to slack off on quality to the customer because they think they can get away with it 
347513,Room Mate Aitana, Nothing , We stayed five nights over Christmas week The staff esp Daniel on the front desk ensured that we were comfortable and he made time to check we got any advice we wanted It is a very stylish hotel indeed We upgraded to a corner suite well designed and large We had one meal in the hotel it was excellent The position is about 10 minutes walk through the back of the railway station so handy for the sights The WIFI was efficient and worked all over the hotel not just in the room 
347514,Room Mate Aitana, the room we got was different from the photos posted on booking com it was underwhelming it was definitely not worth 400 for 2 nights At ALL good thing I paid almost half of it because of discount but still we were not satisfied, location is fine
347515,Room Mate Aitana, Very windy causing loud banging noises all night I think this is due to how the balcony glass is with gaps between sounds like a train next door I spoke to other guest who had the same problem I was kept awake most of the night because of this someone needs to rethink the design thanks, Very comfortable beds And good Internet signal
347516,Room Mate Aitana, no faults this place rocked, Our 4th stay in Amsterdam and we were very pleasantly surprised Usually we stay at smaller boutique B B s And I was a bit worried about the location but it was perfect Walking into town was a breeze Biking would ve been even better but we only stayed a night Safe friendly easy parking below the building warm room and bed well thought out lighting Cant think of any faults I wish we d stayed longer 
347517,Room Mate Aitana, We had to wait for more than one hour after the designated Check in time But it was worth the wait the place is amazing , Staff were all fantastic and efficient The window in our room offered a nice view The bed was big and very comfortable The hotel is very new and modern and very clean 
347518,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, very clean rooms cleaners do a great job front of house were polite and efficient kettle wasn t working and was replaced very swiftly great stay overall great value nice views and big rooms 
347519,Room Mate Aitana, It s about 30 min walk to the city centre might not be good for everyone , Good location parking right next to the hotel Overall very good brand new hotel friendly staff and a nice room 
347520,Room Mate Aitana, parking for more than one day was a bit of a pain since you have to get a new card for each day, room design view the restaurant even though the food was a bit limited the bagel store in front
347521,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, This a new and very clean hotel a little far to the central station but worth staying Staff was so kind and the views of A dam is just great from the corner suit Willing to be back again 
347522,Room Mate Aitana, None, Excellent check in Staff able to recommend places to visit with maps and tourist info Good location 10 minutes walk from Amsterdam Central and 20 minutes from picturesque Jordan area 
347523,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, Great location Good bar and food facilities Good gym facilities And as our stay progressed the minimalist nature of the bedroom furniture really started to appeal 
347524,Room Mate Aitana, The lifts were broken when i was leaving the hotel on the 7th floor I was woke up one morning with a cleaner trying to come in the room at 08 15 And the hotel was a short walk out of the city centre , The cleanliness of the hotel the size of the rooms the staff couldn t have done more 
347525,Room Mate Aitana, Very noisy room air climatisation makes to much noise and can not be stoped , Nice hotel in a good location close to train station an to the Jordaan the best part of amsterdam Facilities for car parking nice modern rooms cool young bar and restaurant
347526,Room Mate Aitana, A shuttle to central station would be appreciated greatly in situations of rain or when you got a luggage to carry, Frontline staff were polite and helpful
347527,Room Mate Aitana, Tooth brush and paste not provided unless requested and were not replenished Coffee and creamer were insufficient for a business traveller who spends more time working out of the hotel room , Frontline staff were extremely polite cheerful and helpful Makes one feel at home 
347528,Room Mate Aitana, Nothing serious though a shuttle to central station would be appreciated greatly in situations of rain or when you got a luggage to carry , Great Value for money comfortable beds nice breakfast and excellent staff Nice location near to central station just 5 10 mnts by walk Free wifi device for visitors absolutely free of cost 
347529,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, Could not find a fault with this hotel The only thing that wasn t the best for our group was the location but that s just picking at stuff Excellent stay here with a group of 8 lads 
347530,Room Mate Aitana, Not much going on near the hotel A couple of restaurants and cafes outside the hotel But then you can take the bus directly to Amsterdam city centre and have lots of fun , Near the Amsterdam Train Station and easy to get Bus 48 to stop very close next to the hotel Lovely area in the newly renovated western docks iDocks Hotel has nice restaurant and cafe near the mini harbor Quiet calm area near the waters Lovely ceiling to floor windows in the room to see city view 
347531,Room Mate Aitana, Walk to central station is a bit long no complimentary water available , Its a designer hotel architecture and interiors and the room set up is very modern 
347532,Room Mate Aitana, Bit strange that most of the staff doesn t speak Dutch Very dry air in the rooms , Excellent hotel Spacious and silent rooms with comfortable beds tasteful design spacious desk minibar with wide range of beverages and snacks perfect shower Delicious breakfast almost brunch with nice view Good service at the reception 
347533,Room Mate Aitana, Check in was slow and issues with getting my room The Bed in the room was blocking access to the minibar the wardrobe and safe which made it hard to move around in room 344 Cups smelled of stale water Minibar was not cold enough I was charged the wrong city tax on checkout No bathrobes or slippers I had to go back to reception to request these which was honoured Seating in room 344 was not so good due to the layout of the room which is like a triangle and bed occupies most of the middle of the room , The bed was really comfortable and I got a great nights sleep Lots of pillows Bathtub was comfortable to use except the shower due to glass screen in the way breakfast was excellent Sit by the windows for view of the yachts get eggs made for you exception is benedict eggs views from room ok 
347534,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, Great staff all Spanish talking who all gave great service and with a positive attitude in all aspects The room a family room was great next time we will opt for a suite for more space Breakfast was yummy and poached eggs were made upon our request 
347535,Room Mate Aitana, Location on the waterfront is picturesque but it is out on a limb as far as accessing the main attractions of Amsterdam easily, Nice modern hotel with all expected amenities
347536,Room Mate Aitana, The room is not bright enough even with all lights turned on especially when working at the desk Also maybe add a small table desk beside the bed as there is enough room space but not working space , Everything was good All details are very well thought of Great view from the window And good sound isolation which is rare almost anywhere in Europe 
347537,Room Mate Aitana, just the second curtain could have been a bit lighter so i still could enjoy the view without having a feeling being looked by the opposite buildings houses, design toilet amenities
347538,Room Mate Aitana, Checking in and checking out is long and cumbersome due to a slow system and very lengthy and customer unfriendly processes Staff is friendly enough but speed doesn t seem to be an important goal , Modern design hotel great location
347539,Room Mate Aitana, The lighting could have been better I had read this in other reviews prior to our stay so had expected it You do get used to it but it could be improved Also it would be nice to have some more toiletries provided , We are fairly familiar with Amsterdam and love the Oud West area Close by to Museums shopping Vondel Park and cute boutiques The Room was cosy and comfortable nice bed and had a fridge which is always useful 
347540,Room Mate Aitana, I think the doubletree is an overall better deal Better service and a slightly better location My room was an executive room however the space was limited due the shape of the ceiling The chair looked good very modern but totally uncomfortable and therefore useless I travel with Apple TV especially in foreign countries and can not understand why they disable the HDMI options on the TV The Aitana does not provide VOD movies which is fine but the TV programming is pretty boring on a very stormy and rainy day , New hotel so everything is in good to excellent condition Service is ok but not great and has not improved since a previous stay 
347541,Room Mate Aitana, We stayed in a handicap accessible room because our room wasn t ready yet when we arrived and we didn t want to wait The bathroom was all white tile and felt more like a sterile hospital bathroom than a hotel , The staff left a very kind hand written birthday note and gave us vouchers for two free drinks at the lounge and I never even mentioned that it was my birthday 
347542,Room Mate Aitana, Not much entertainment around the hotel It s a 15 minutes to walk to the center of Amsterdam Parking is not free No switch for alerting staff to either clean up the room or do not disturb ,No Positive
347543,Room Mate Aitana, Generally the hotel is overrated for me When we arrived our room wasn t ready even though we had booked it two months ago and we had to wait until 18 00 or stay for the night in another room obviously inferior to ours and then go to ours without a discount or something similar for the inconvenience The room was nice but overpriced I ve stayed in much better hotels with the same price , The location was good and the staff was friendly The view from the room was also very nice and the room was always clean 
347544,Room Mate Aitana, Air conditioner was the loudest thing I have ever slept with , Lovely place took some very interesting photos of the building 5 minutes from the station looks great at night We had great views from the 8th floor Room service and bar were excellent Also it was our anniversary and they put rose petals on the bed and a lovely congratulations card 
347545,Room Mate Aitana, At night room is so dark little light inside rooms some corners of the rooms so dark Little furniture in room and spaces not used leaved empty Corridor light was terrible red and yellow in 6th floor, Spacious rooms Nice colors inside rooms Nice view on marina Nice lounge and lobby Quick in check in check out Breakfast hall with view 2 bars avalible and nice cocktails
347546,Room Mate Aitana, The toilet seat is on a much higher height than normal, The hotel looks very nice from outside and inside Feels like a 5 stars Staff are friendly and helpful
347547,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, My room had an amazing view and the staff was great I also like that this hotel had a gym which wasn t at all crowded when I used it This hotel is also located right on the water which is beautiful and is not far from some of Amsterdam s attractions 
347548,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, We loved to stay at Room Mate Aitana just because the hotel is wonderful very quiet and comfortable the staff is amazing and Amsterdam is one of the most incredible places on earth Also you must enjoy the restaurant I Dock very beautiful and with a simple and tasty food 
347549,Room Mate Aitana, We liked almost everything there except the place of the extra toilet paper that was located right next to the toilet brush which is not sanitary , Location Nice view Excellent breakfast
347550,Room Mate Aitana, Breakfast not included and quite expensive We did not try it Rooms are very small too small actually otherwise the hotel would be great , Very modern and comfortable hotel 
347551,Room Mate Aitana, Just a comment about shuttle to airport that is not a service of The hotel but they can reserve with a company named connexxion this shuttle service is not a deal for more than one person for two costs almost The same price as a taxi and a lot more time of travel We almost lose our flight since the shuttle stops in at least two other hotels to pick up people and The driver simply waits and waits until people decides to go into The shuttle affecting others But The Aitana is really excellent , Great hotel Excellent location a few steps from Central Station
347552,Room Mate Aitana, A little far from town centre got lost few times trying to find way back to hotel late at night , The view from the room on the 12th floor was amazing facilities in the room were good did not try food but plenty of places to eat nearby 
347553,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, As a regular customer of Room Mate Aitana I asked for and was given a room upgrade It was wonderful and much appreciated after a long business trip 
347554,Room Mate Aitana, We asked for babycot for our 1 yrs old boy but there was no available so if you want one let them know as soon as you book , about 8 10 mins walk from central station the place itself was very beautiful and modern The room was nice and clean could walk through the central station or jordaan to the city which will takes around 10 15 mins both way but the surrouding area is very nice by the water 
347555,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, Love the Hotel modern great staff beautiful view really close to the Jordaan 5 min walk but far enough away to be really peaceful Restaurant offers fantastic food 
347556,Room Mate Aitana, Small room you barely have any space to walk around the furniture Useless shower water splashes all over the bathroom because the glass wall is actually on a side of the shower not in front of it, Very friendly and helpful reception staff Nice and trendy bar and reception area Delicious food in the restaurant
347557,Room Mate Aitana, The location is a bit of a walk away from the main sights and restaurants etc but it was very convenient for central station , Beautiful clean and spacious room Comfortable bed and great shower Staff were very approachable and helpful at all times 
347558,Room Mate Aitana, Restaurant staff unattentive when I had dinner there on night of 20 October Bar lounge staff gave very poor service on night of 21 Oct no one was at the bar when I arrived had to wait at least 5 minutes and staff did not come by to ask if I wanted a refill I had to go up to the bar myself Lighting in the rooms is poor I stay at Roommate Aitana for business so need more and brighter lights when I am working , Front desk staff cleanliness and layout of room gym
347559,Room Mate Aitana, Tissues and face washers should be available , We upgraded to an executive room and found that the two televisions weren t operating We were not charged for the upgrade 
347560,Room Mate Aitana, We have been going to this hotel over the last two years and while there has been no changes to the premises except more tourist groups prices have more than doubled They increased about 10 pc from July to October and this is hard to understand a rate of 350 euros in October there, Location is very nice a bit outside Jordan and centre Rooms are very spacious 
347561,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, very helpful staff spacious and modern room great block out curtains lovely dining room convenient location for the start of my river cruise comfortable bed
347562,Room Mate Aitana, First experience at their restaurant was not good 6 for a bottle of water is extortionate Cheaper to drink wine than water is an insult when wine is not an option pregnant Faux pas , i love this hotel and stay here every time the price allows when I am in Amsterdam
347563,Room Mate Aitana, Nothing at all , Great location and an amazing property Comes with a lovely view and away from the madness in spite of being in such a central location 
347564,Room Mate Aitana, Eeven though i booked in advance when we arrived they only had a room for the disabled meaning the bathroom was stripped of many things they offered to upgrade my room if i would pay extra i find that incredibly in poor judgement they should have given me a better suited room without extra charge the prices are incredibly high in this hotel , if you skip the expensive 20 euro per person breakfast you can go down to the cafe outside of the hotel 10 meters away and get a very nice breakfast for much less 
347565,Room Mate Aitana,No Negative, The hotel was very new clean and in good condition Room was spacious and comfortable Its located on its own little island with a short walk to the railway station Walking distance to the center is about 10 15 mins 
347566,Room Mate Aitana, I paid the evening before leaving to avoid hurry at departure but it turned out that I still had to pay for the last night shortly before the transport to the airport arrived , Nice hotel good location friendly and helpful staff Price probably normal for central Amsterdam Transport to the airport could be ordered via the hotel 
347567,Room Mate Aitana, Bit of a walk into the main part of town partly under the railway lines which isn t very pleasant The hotel was filming a promotional video when we were there which they didn t warn us about and which essentially closed the restaurant for the evening meaning we had to walk back through the rain into town to get something to eat , Lovely room with good views from upper levels Very modern hotel with nice interior design features 
347568,Room Mate Aitana, Please work to upgrade the wi, We were especially impressed with the quality of the staff finding them to be very patient and helpful Special recognition goes to Emily for her friendly and very competent service Thanks 
347569,Room Mate Aitana, The receptionist Give me a small room for people with special needs which is not my reservation room and when I refused this room they suggested for me Suite at a price much higher than the price of my reservation and I refused and i told them that I want the room that in my reservation only and they said there is no available rooms right now and I have to take the small room for people with special needs But I insisted and I request to meet the hotel manager after that they give me my reservation room , Close to the central station and damrak Street rooms are spacious and clean
347570,Room Mate Aitana, The restaurant service was rather late , The people staff was very helpful happy and hospitable The location was just perfect and the view from our room fantastic 
347571,Room Mate Aitana, Not much of english TV channels nor pay movies No in room dining No watch in the room or iphone docking The only restaurant breakfast has many pork ham foods Beside you to commute by bus to reach the city center , Modern design and plenty of lobby seating with views Dine outside at boats docking in sunny days are fabulous 
347572,Room Mate Aitana, I booked through you guys booking com a sea view room wuth the highest rate but unfortunately the hotel offered me a marina view not a sea view What a shock ,No Positive
347573,Room Mate Aitana, Slow complicated check in check out slow unorganised without experience staff Breakfast is exceptionally expensive without offering something extraordinary , Modern design everywhere wide comfortable room with a lot of light 
347574,Room Mate Aitana, a little bit farther away from the central station but compared to the price it is a very cost effective choice , very spacious room and comfortable bed convenient location
347575,Room Mate Aitana, NOTHING, Every thing was as usual more than excellent the staff are top professional we were lucky to see marta from the reception staff and she remembered us from last year dear all this hotel is the best of the best in XXX
347576,Room Mate Aitana, Amsterdam hotel prices are a little over the hill Time for more competition and more value for money, Location Style of furniture etc Breakfast good Ambience in building View at the room over t IJ
347577,Room Mate Aitana, Hotel and Booking com informed me about absence of parking places in public parking garage nearby only when it was already not possible to cancel reservation 24 hours Even more disappointing was the fact that personnel in the garage explained me that Aitana management didn t reserve parking places for its visitors upfront even thou parking offered to do it This is for me sign of lack of customer care Second disappointment is beautiful view of Amsterdam Even from top 12th flor all you will see is gray block of buildings other side of the street train line and some other elements of city landscape that with all imagination I can t advice to anyone as something valuable to see Just a waist of money , Fresh new hotel good rooms very good bedding relatively good location 
347578,Room Mate Aitana, The only downsize is that the nearest tram is at the Amsterdam Central witch is not that close to the hotel, Excellent beautiful hotel located at a 10 minute walk from Amsterdam central Nice and modern very friendly and helpfull staff rooms are very clean and confortable the bed was perfect 
347579,Room Mate Aitana, elevator system was extremely slow in the morning and it was difficult to take the stairs past the second floor So this could slow you down during leaving checkout , Nice clean roomy rooms Great view over amsterdam

347586,Room Mate Aitana, No swimming pool Embarrassed at checkout when I challenged the extra city tax charge almost 40 only to be told 5 charge is notified by Booking com checked email and there it was 5 city tax not included I believe Booking com could ve have made this specifically clear this had to be paid at checkout instead of the way it was worded , Great views with floor to ceiling windows great surroundings quiet and safe area extremely friendly and helpful staff
