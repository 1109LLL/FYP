499054,Acevi Villarroel, Would like to have the Jacuzzi hot tub area open all hours they closed at 10 or 11pm sometimes when you come back from dinner or going out it is nice to relax in the hot tub or take a midnight swim , The room was spacious The hotel is in an excellent area very close to so much it was perfect It has a swimming pool and spa with Jacuzzi our stay was too short to use these things but will in the future

499056,Acevi Villarroel,No Negative, Loved the size smallish boutique like hotel with large doubles Easy walking distance to the action and airport city bus in a midtown neighbourhood with good restaurants and real tapis bars filled with locals not tourists Front desk staff were very helpful at all hours requests were met with friendly responses and assistance Especially appreciated their effort to get us to the airport on time when the taxis went on strike As my Spanish is bad being able to communicate in English Good breakfast buffet It was quiet at night 
499057,Acevi Villarroel, A few odd things like no main light in the room just lamps by the side of the bed no toilet brush only one garbage can in the bathroom none in the room the shower was only either warm or very hot not fun on a hot July day no electric sockets by the bed glass door on the bathroom that doesn t lock so it doesn t feel private , Very helpful staff who speaks English proper double bed bathtub big bathroom swimming pool place for cooling down minibar cameras made it feel safe quiet area good location

499060,Acevi Villarroel, The hotel charged me full fee upon arrival They had been paid in full through Booking com Although they told me they would refund me as of yet I have not received the Euro1 200 that they owe me This is most unsatisfactory Please let me know how to promptly resolve this issue as Booking com facilitated the initial transaction ,No Positive
499061,Acevi Villarroel, I ask the staff to call the airline for me to change the ticket but they said I have to do it my self while I faced some issue to deal with Spanish English No welcome drink or even water Everything chargeable , Very clean and suitable for a very nice room with sound system

499063,Acevi Villarroel, The room didn t haven t any conditioner so bring it with you and the bed only had a sheet there was a blanket in the cupboard but as a cold person I definitely could have done with some sort of duvet The pool also needed more seats and loungers as we couldn t get a seat , Good transport links and easy to walk everywhere we walked right into the city every evening Room service was nice and clean and the bed was very comfy The pool was a nice size and wasn t too cold 
499064,Acevi Villarroel, TV not properly tuned and took an age to get fixed Poor quality air conditioning Room looked straight out over back of many apartments and had no net curtains so obliged to keep curtains closed most of the time Slow internet connection Breakfast expensive,No Positive
499065,Acevi Villarroel, The AC leaked the first night which caused us to have to switch rooms The pool is quite small and shallow which I understand is typical in Barcelona but not compared to other places , Great location Nice bed and staff 
499066,Acevi Villarroel, Very low staff Bad housekeeping department if you wanted towels you had to go to front desk and get them , This is a better hotel for business travelers Not for families Very low staff 
499067,Acevi Villarroel, View first room back alley Second room noisy road No tea coffee tray or complementary water on arrival, Good size rooms Clean Pleasant staff Photos on line give a good representation Restaurant expensive and service bit slow Initial teething problem in rooms power sockets nonhairdryer remrdied and rooms stopped Lots local places to eat Short walk las ramblas
499068,Acevi Villarroel, The hotel is a bit outdated the fitness center would need more space and newer machines the staff is nice but not very experienced left the laundry at the reception and they forgot to tell me that there was no laundry that day and they return my clothes at check out the day after I dropped them off dirty a message in the room would have been a nice touch, In a calm area of Barcelona nice little pool on the second floor 
499069,Acevi Villarroel, Booked a double room was put in a twin Went to reception and complained after a lot of back and forward was moved to a double room which infact was two single beds together with a double bedding on it I was not offered any compensation and they refused when I asked the breakfast selection was terrible and was stone cold I had to ask for it to be microwaved Awful,No Positive
499070,Acevi Villarroel, first room was designed by a blind man nowhere to move put anything down ridiculous we changed rooms desk was very nice second room better but still weird sink so shallow water splashed everywhere no outlet by bed shower handle came off in my hand etc worst was breakfast coffee from a machine that belongs in an office super slow and tiny quantities a line developed quickly we actually skipped breakfast and went out instead , size of room was ok design was poor front desk was very nice roof deck was nice 
499071,Acevi Villarroel, Internet connection could be more stable especially if you want to do work through VPN but for emails and Internet surfing is good enough , Great location and very helpfull personell Quick check in process Big rooms 
499072,Acevi Villarroel, The description says they have an extra large bed not 2 beds Mentioned that request in my comment while booking I need 1 large bed not two small ones And they gave me 2 beds side by side Disappointing, Jacuzzi was a nice bonus
499073,Acevi Villarroel, The rooms are not as in pictures they are very old and needs renovation we were promised to get a Queen bed and got 2 single beds they promised to fix it the next day ana did nothing about it they just care on being paid on time not a 4 star hotel maximum1star, We didnt like anything
499074,Acevi Villarroel, Awful breakfast Even when you come on time not like 10 min before closing food looks like leftovers Not a big choice Need to put toast through 3 times to have it nicely done Good thing it wasn t busy when we stayed Swimming pool is like a puddle just over my knees so don t get too excited about good swim in there But good for kids Swimming pool area was nice again just cos it was quiet as it s really small Parking just like everywhere in Barcelona expensive 22 per night 24h and you can take it in and out any time without extra charge which was good other carparks will charge you for hours you re actually parked and tiny If you are renting a car be careful not to damage the car in their carpark Back and forth to park and to get out of it Thin walls You can hear your neighbors especially their arguments in the middle of the night , Hotel is nice and tidy 
499075,Acevi Villarroel, Very HARD beds in room phones did not work each floor computer did not work yet they were left out to use as if they were operational Only one computer on lobby level worked but was missing the sign had to be installed each every time one used the key board entire hotel needs updating refurbishing breakfast buffet not up to standards AGAIN staff wonderful but owners need to visit invest in keeping up hotels details as expected by international guests, Friendly staff
499076,Acevi Villarroel, Booking com asked for special requests when I made the reservation even though I asked for an early check in after an overnight 10 hour flight the hotel did not work with my request The hotel had a weird system of needing the key card to operate lights in the room and no explanation of this was given at check in the wifi was spotty at best and the toilet did not flush , There were some great restaurants near the hotel and the front desk was helpful with setting us up with a bus tour for the day of sightseeing 
499077,Acevi Villarroel, nothing, This hotel was very central and only 15 mins to central station and main shopping areas Walking to to beaches is possible The hotel breakfasts were good but often ran out and the tables were often not reset Almost help yourself The room was outstanding comfortable and clean The staff were always helpful and very friendly 
499078,Acevi Villarroel, i felt like in a labyrinth having one of the rooms far away from the elevators and having to bend 3 times around the corner to find my way out i was given a 2 storey room for 4 people which felt a bit weird being there completely alone the view outside my window was not only an inner yard it was blank concrete and no view at all but i got the room for a very good rate so i guess this is what you get when you pay an extra good price i am sure they have nicer rooms and for a family of 4 accommodation would have been great despite no view so if i come back with the family i for sure will ask for this explicit type of room, bed are very comfortable bathrooms in green marble where clean and nice everything functioned 
499079,Acevi Villarroel, First room plaster board falling in on the shower moved rooms new room 2 am someone kicked our door and tryed getting in with a key my wife was so scared seen reception asked for manager told wasn t available twice no apology air vent hanging down from ceilings tiles around bath disgusting handle on window broken no lock for a four star hotel 1 300pound for 1wk b and b we follow the f1 gp around the world never felt so ripped off an un welcome Just so happens that my wife works for trip advisor so I don t know how that s going to work out yet I shall be telling all our friend s in the f1 blogg not to stay thanks Daniel PS have lots of photos but won t upload, Joyce in the breakfast room she is a star
499080,Acevi Villarroel, This hotel is situated in an excellent location and the staff are lovely However it is not a 4 star hotel and it is expensive for what it is The facilities are very dated in particular the bed and pillows are extremely uncomfortable the mini bar fridge is very hot does not chill the contents at all and is not properly installed so it comes out of the cupboard when you open the door the air conditioning unit is SO NOISY that it would be impossible to sleep with it on luckily I had earplugs the wardrobe door was broken the furniture is very dated If you want a basic hotel that is in a good location the Acevi is great however don t be fooled it is not a 4 star hotel ,No Positive
499081,Acevi Villarroel, I could start my day early knowing my luggage would b held b4 check in Was not told , Safe location Holding luggage for the day helped very much Thank you 
499082,Acevi Villarroel, Should have been told that the hotel room floor is being renovated strong paint smell and scaffolding not pleasant to look at on a holiday Requested large double bed instead two singles were put together meant was gap in middle which was awkward to sleep on Bathroom hot and cold water knobs difficult to use to get temperature correct takes a while to figure out ,No Positive
499083,Acevi Villarroel, Nothing good this isn t a 4 stars hotel at all No value for money we paid 138euro per night not even a breakfast not enough towels TV poor nothing good about it Will never use it again Regards AB,No Positive
499084,Acevi Villarroel, Just a few minor remarks the furniture in our room was a little bit worn and some damaged around the edges It s old furniture so that s expected We also requested if possible a room with a double bed but in the end got a room with 2 single beds put together to look like a double bed Not a big deal but just another remark I would still recommend this place , Great location at the heart of the city Spacious rooms 24H reception Friendly staff
499085,Acevi Villarroel, Some things were not spot on I believe some parts of the rooms should be renovated as they are a bit worn out sink furniture etc , The staff was super nice professional and welcoming
499086,Acevi Villarroel, Our toilet struggled to flush, The hotel is quite central to amazing restaurants and attractions The rooms was neat and clean The staff is always available
499087,Acevi Villarroel, The bed was not comfortable The staff did not speak English properly when we had issue and were asking for help they could not understand us and didn t help us , Good located nearby the hotel bus stop and good restaurants 
499088,Acevi Villarroel, ac was on all night found out how to turn it off the day after lot of noise from the street getting little bit old, Decent breakfast good location nice spa good price
499089,Acevi Villarroel, Although the room was spacious the walls are extremely thin I was in a room that had a door to the room next to me and although it was locked hearing the persons conversation in the room next door made it feel like they were in my room Needless to say it kept waking me up in the middle of the night , The location was pretty good Atmosphere seemed good Staff was friendly 
499090,Acevi Villarroel, The pool is extremely small and only 1meter in depth The double bed was made from 2 single beds which kept moving apart making a whole in middle Unfortunately they were also doing refurbishments whilst we were there so woke up to the hall being plastered sanded and painted on several mornings , Maid service was good rooms were clean Friendly and helpful staff Only a short walk to the local metro station which was the easiest way to get around
499091,Acevi Villarroel, Pillows weren t as comfortable as you would expect of a hotel like this, Room looks nice clean and shampoos etc are provided and nicely packaged
499092,Acevi Villarroel, No breakfast included with the room had to pay extra for a spread that was totally mediocre However plenty of places to eat in the neighborhood in the morning , I overall loved the hotel and the location The room was a very good size with a comfortable king size bed and view of the main street There was no noise problem The WiFi worked very well The housekeeping was superb I loved the bathroom with the separate tub and shower set up There was climate control in the room There was a tiny refrigerator with mini bar items that had just enough space for additional items The location was excellent being three block from the Urgell Metro Station L1 There are also a variety of International cuisines to choose from within a block or two away I would highly recommend this hotel because it was definitely the best deal I could find in Barcelona especially in Eixample Happy Travels 
499093,Acevi Villarroel, Not a lot Perhaps longer opening times for Sauna massage would have helped to be able to use these facilities Not all rooms have the standard layout ours had the bedroom straight off the corridor bathroom set beyond Had to be careful when getting out in as beds were visible , Very welcoming and helped with all queries we had day to day as first time tourists to Barcelona Chloe who had just joined from UK made it easy re language typical british quirks but all others in reception too were very helpful Location was great 3 block from the Metro and typically not more than 3 or 4 stops to all the touristy places of interest Managed to see experience many of the delights of Barcelona in 3 full days Beautiful city friendly people
499094,Acevi Villarroel, The first room we were given was awful needed doing up and was smelling of smoke But once explained to staff we were moved to a much nicer room The room was a bit too hot and the air on was not going cold and as we we re on the road we couldn t really leave open the window as it was soo noisy Maybe the temperature could be looked at It didn t stop us enjoying our stay still had an amazing trip , The staff were really friendly and very knowledgeable Thanks for your help
499095,Acevi Villarroel, Value for money was poor but driven by late booking for MWC Bed was not very comfortable but room shower etc all perfectly comfortable , Staff were excellent dealing with taxis that failed to turn up during MWC and helping me a lot as a blind person travelling alone
499096,Acevi Villarroel, i didnt like the way the windows opened in the room , after arriving checking in late friday night I was happy to find a spacious bath that i could relax in soak Bathroom was very clean nice 
499097,Acevi Villarroel,No Negative, The stuff was wonderful very kind and helpful every thing that we needed was taken care in a minute The location of the hotel is not in the center but by walking 10 15 minutes you are in the center and in the katalunia plaza We didnt eat in the hotel because we eat only kosher food In front of the hotel there is a super market to buy what you need The taxi stop us in front of the hotel The rooms are clean and comfortable and quite Hope you will enjoy
499098,Acevi Villarroel, Wouldn t come in summer as false advertising on swimming pool more like a paddling pool Not worth paying for breakfast if you turn up after 9 30 or 10 food not restocked and most of time coffee machine wasn t working , The room was ideal for a family with 2 teenagers
499099,Acevi Villarroel, For 4 star hotel there should be coffee tea facility in each room but there was none , The Staff was very friendly and helpfull all the time great location and barhroom sparkling clean spa is always a bonus 
499100,Acevi Villarroel, The pool was closed not something that was clearly stated in our booking We chose this hotel for its Spa and Welness facilities but without a pool at its additional cost of 15 euros per day it was not worth it The shower head holder was broken but was fixed as soon as we reported it Walls are like paper so if you are hoping for a sleep in you won t get it here staff walking the halls sound like they are in your room Air conditioning was very loud and uncomfortable We didn t eat in the restaurant menu wasn t to our liking , Staff were very helpful offered good recommendations for Brunch close by Oma Bistro check it out and offered remedies to minor issues 
499101,Acevi Villarroel, Two single beds pushed together with double sheet as double bed Connective door between rooms allowed in alot of noise from neighbouring room , Hotel was very nice staff were very pleasent room looked very nice
499102,Acevi Villarroel, nothing , Staff went above and beyond getting us what we needed and helping us with directions Place was exactly as stated in the description and super clean 
499103,Acevi Villarroel, Room layout is peculiar When the shower is used the entire room smells like mold the room needs better ventilation Also the decor needs fixing updating the bed slides from the wall while you are on it I informed a desk employee twice that one of the bedside lamps cord was frayed and that the lamp was sparking and asked that it be removed or replaced This was never done More attention to detail would improve service , Location was great 
499104,Acevi Villarroel, Breakfast was not good and very boring One day cleaning of the room was not done The employees in the restaurant can not speak english or french Their service is mediocre , Receptionists were helpfull 
499105,Acevi Villarroel, Because my room infront of the elevator a little noise in the carry door in the morning I am not sure was that by house keeping or guests any way genral speaking is amazing hotel,No Positive
499106,Acevi Villarroel, The comfort in the room could have been better The bed was noisy the toilet wasn t working very well and the windows were broken we couldn t close them , The staff was excellent Great people working there 
499107,Acevi Villarroel, No fresh air no chance to open a window Hey guys this is Barcelona and not the US Very sorry but if you don t change this stupid policy I won t return , Very friendly and helpful staff clean place nice rooms but lack of fresh air everywhere 
499108,Acevi Villarroel,No Negative, The facilities were fab the spa was open until 11pm which is great when you have been on your feet all day Although it is small so if it was busy then that would of been a issue and more lighting should be thought about especially by the stairs to the whirlpool as they are not lit at all and sign for the step into the steam room Rubber mats should also be considered for the floor when wet as very slippery Could not complain about the room very comfortable and excellent size Would return Helpful staff 15mins from the city centre
499109,Acevi Villarroel, The bell at the bottom of the cavernous and tight ramp to exit the underground car park was irksome since by the time you had reached the exit point the automatic gate closed very quickly It would be much better if this bell to contact reception was located near the exit point, The quality of the restaurant food was good 
499110,Acevi Villarroel, Old Hotel with broken bathrooms cold water non function aircondition Much to expensive for what we got , Location is perfectly in the center of gay area 
499111,Acevi Villarroel, Weak Wi Fi signal Could not skype at room 507 I would appreciate a better Gym , Execellent breakfast included Great service Gym is available small but had the multi trainer Metro is rather close 15 minutes walk to city center 
499112,Acevi Villarroel, Wellcome and check in didn t start well with the receptionist very cold and poor on information Then got better with other ladies very kind and willing to help and they changed my room Breakfast was always always the same with no possible extra , Room quite big and silent Nice parquet on the floor and marble in the bathroom Really near the red line of the metro the main one station Urgell 350 metres on foot Wellcome and check in didn t start well with the receptionist very cold and poor on information Then got better with other ladies very kind and willing to help and they changed my room 
499113,Acevi Villarroel, i was shocked the last time i was there by the attitude of some of the staff in particular in the bar restaurant extremely rude over a bucket of ice i have stayed so many times there but for the first time i was asked to pay for ice but then that was not the problem but it was for the attitude of the bartender i dont think i will return there, this was by far my favorite hotel in Barcelona location is great and always use to get good rates
499114,Acevi Villarroel, I have booked standard double room but instead of that the room was for disabled My feedback is really very negative I am not recommending this hotel , location
499115,Acevi Villarroel, The room had no comfort only a kitchen chair not even a picture or rug Didn t like sink in bedroom the bath was DANGEROUS couldn t move the screen so had no room and had to stand in the bath to reach the taps , The bed was good and staff were very helpful 
499116,Acevi Villarroel, The hotel is a bit old fashioned Minor points the toilet which was not fixed properly to the wall and I missed an electricity plug in the bathroom to use my own hairdryer The bathroom was clean but around the batthub I noticed lots of chalc The douche might have been a bit more powerful to rinse schampood long hair Also you hear the noise from neighboring rooms , The hotel has many facilities but we did not use them all We enjoyed the diner in the restaurant The meat was very tender and tasteful Friendly staff 
499117,Acevi Villarroel, There was no mention on hotel website nor on booking com that it cost 15 per person to use the spa facilities Very expensive , The spa facility was good
499118,Acevi Villarroel, Wi fi took hours before I was able to connect Room was fine but a bit shabby everything looked a bit worn out When last I visited breakfast was included this time it was not The house wine in the bar was terrible , The staff are excellent so helpful and friendly I like the location it is a bit far from everything but perhaps that is best any closer would be noisy When in the bar we received nice snacks a lovely surprise Will stay again if ever we have the pleasure of returning to Barcelona 
499119,Acevi Villarroel, If you have a child you should not stay in Villoreal You have to prefer staying La Rambla Hotel cleanliness is so good but bathroom can change a swimpool after having shower Toilet door is made of glass but it is not closed because of wrong dimensions Everbody sees you in front of the door Foods and breakfasts are poor Room was so dark and has no good aircondition All of us are ill now We are not satisfied at all , First check in personal 
499120,Acevi Villarroel, The hotel claims to have a gym and it does not It has two outdated cardio machines e g the treadmill did not fully or properly function one old weight bench 2 sets of weights and a ceramic tile floor This does not constitute a gym , Staff was very friendly helpful and accommodating Location was just outside popular tourist areas which involved a slightly longer walk The trade off benefit was a quieter setting that still had plenty of excellent cafes and restaurants to choose from in addition to those on the Gracia strip 
499121,Acevi Villarroel, I paid 150 night and received muld in the bathroom and desk looking like it was bitten several times , Clean rooms although should be refreshed muld on bathroom ceiling Good location although not quiet at all 
499122,Acevi Villarroel, everything else was very poor The building is falling apart I received the worst room in the hotel and didn t look anything like in the pictures the room was number 203 so don t let them to put you in that room the ceiling was broken the shower was broken and a lot of water went on the floor as it was a filtration from the base of the shower they even had to evacuate the room below us as it was water everywhere when i was leaving the shower and because of the amount of water that was on the floor i fall on the floor hit my back and cut my hand a completely disaster I have never wrote a complaint before but this was beyond anything , Just the staff they were friendly and tried to help the meal we had in the restaurant was also good 
499123,Acevi Villarroel, We booked and paid extra for spa which needed to be told 30 min in advance if we wanted to use it No slippers or dressing gown in the room , It is very well decorated and spacious
499124,Acevi Villarroel, NO COMPLIMENTARY WATER PROVIDED small bottles of water below 330ml are 2 35 Euros each We tried to visit the SPA and we didn t have the best experience The card key provided for entry to the SPA didn t work so I had to go back and forth to the reception twice in my spa attire no comfortable for a lady When we entered it had been left in a state by what I could only guess was another couple They d left bottles and champagne flutes everywhere and no staff had come to tidy up I presume the refreshments were acquired through the hotel so why not clean up There were NO TOWELS in the SPA When I asked at reception for 3 towels to be provided I was told I could only have 2 even though I needed one for my hair and body ROOM SERVICE on the 2nd night we ordered room service I ordered steak topped with fois gras but there was NO FOIS GRAS on the dish and no discount was offered for a substandard meal Our dirty dishes were moved outside our room by the maids the following day but the TRAY REMAINED FOR 2 DAYS without anyone collecting it I have photos as evidence There was a sign in the bathroom stating if you need anything like cotton wool or a sewing kit etc then to ask at reception I did this and there was nothing available apart from some tissues This doesn t reflect the standard of a 4 star hotel and I plan to write a letter of complaint This room costed over 600 Euros and 3 nights This hotel is NOT GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY , A lovely male receptionist was able to recommend a late night restaurant when we arrived late at night Room service was quick 
499125,Acevi Villarroel, Air conditioning unit leaked and has clearly been a problem for a long time as the wooden floor beneath it is warped to the point it was actually a trip hazard Shower only had luke warm water no tea coffee facilities or even free bottled water in the room all available in the expensive minibar Wasn t asked on checkout how the room was probably because they know the answer already Certainly not the worst place in the world but over priced and I wouldn t rush to go back , Room was spacious and bed reasonably comfortable location is good with most of the key tourist attractions within a 20 30 min walk or short metro trip Building is fairly modern and was quiet and safe Free wifi was appreciated and a decent speed 
499126,Acevi Villarroel, It ll be great to have better coffee and tea for breakfast Early breakfast for weekends is desired We have a morning flight so leaving the hotel at 8 00 Sunday when breakfast was just started And in general a little bit more is estimated from 13EUR breakfast , Responsive and friendly reception good location
499127,Acevi Villarroel, The breakfast is very poor and limited and items often run out and are not replaced The bed was not that comfortable Location is poor, nothing really it was all just ok
499128,Acevi Villarroel, Two things bothered me during my stay The second floor had a damp smell in the hallway and the bathtub in the room I was in had rust showing about 8 cm long on the wall side of the tub which I believe could ve been clean with a new silicon seal but was ignored , The location of the hotel is convenient The double single bed was comfortable I didn t interact with the staff members much but they seemed friendly 
499129,Acevi Villarroel, Everything was perfect , The staff was excellent Juan the bartender was wonderful he was trying so hard to teach us Spanish words Miguel the Desk Clerk was also wonderful He treated every guest with courtesy and patience He also helped with our adventures in Barcelona 
499130,Acevi Villarroel, The bathroom door was flimsy so you didnt have privacy Sometimes there was a sewage smell The bed was comfy but the room was a bit small , The breakfast and lobby was nice not too far from the metro
499131,Acevi Villarroel, The bathroom door was made of glass and wasn t sealed or sealable Unless you are into sharing the sound and odour of defecation would suggest that it s hardly what romantic dreams are made of , Efficient helpful staff Good location nice decor 
499132,Acevi Villarroel, The staff unhelpful Didnt like how dark rooms were plus our shower broke and aircon was hard to work We paid 830 for 4 nights and just was not worth it , Like that our room was cleaned everyday well
499133,Acevi Villarroel, Breakfast too expensive we didn t use it Safety no one checked who went in or out the hotel even most of the times we did not see any reception officer Room windows could not open airconditioning made loud noise shower was very dark shower head could not be fixed at the wall attached slide toilet did not flush well smell of cigaret smoke in the room Payment though the appointment was that my creditcard would not be charged pay by bank card at check out was the appointment it appeared to be charged already on the 6th day I was surprised and not happy with that All together price to quality is not what we expected from 4 star hotel , Location is good spacious hotel clean friendly cleaning ladies we met a very friendly reception chef at the last day The restaurant chef was very helpful to heat our bread rolls
499134,Acevi Villarroel, My room the walk in shower is ok but after taking a shower the whole room was wet and we have nothing to wipe the excess water away so we had to use our towels And too noisy and dark Depressive , I like the cleaness and the reception
499135,Acevi Villarroel, The shower had mold in it and the ceiling above the shower needed some attention For such an expensive hotel almost 200 a night this should not happen , The staff is very friendly and attentive 
499136,Acevi Villarroel, no, Everyting is good Specially the reception is very kind He helped a lot when we were in Barcelona I m very satisfied with this hotel and will stay here again if I come to Barcelona 
499137,Acevi Villarroel, Not enough sun beds around pool and paint smell from adjacent workshop very strong at times Fridge did not get cold minibar expensive The double wardrobe with only 1 set of hangers No tea coffee kettle in room , All staff were helpful separate shower bath good Interconnecting rooms useful Outdoor swimming pool although small shallow Nice to have a fridge Reasonable choice at breakfast but did not change Short walk to 2 Metro stations and supermarkets A few good restaurants nearby 
499138,Acevi Villarroel, the pool is not up to expectations and surrounded with buildings, u always see people cleaning the reception is very helpful in terms of directions and transport the room is cheap but comfortable evthg was just great
499139,Acevi Villarroel, This hotel is functional at best the towels were threadbare they even had holes in they d been cleaned so many times The fridges in the rooms we had connecting rooms both fridges ineffective were effectively heating the contents useless Breakfast was pretty basic but OK but a single coffee machine was pretty bad and there was always a queue On the first night I asked for a glass of wine at the bar and was told all the house wine was finished so I d have to buy a bottle At nearly 200 per room night it s expensive for what it is If you are looking for a special experience I wouldn t recommend this hotel , Friendly staff we didn t meet any unfriendly people in Barcelona good sized rooms which were very clean and whilst it s a good 20 mins walk to the action the public transport is very convenient
499140,Acevi Villarroel, Very basic NOT 4 star Sockets falling out of wall No tea coffee in room View like a prison bars on window onto derelict car park No atmosphere bar and restaurant empty Poor wine no choice at bar Coffee atrocious at breakfast Beds very uncomfortable Air con didn t work Not enough hangers Sink in room when bathroom was big enough to accommodate , Functional Pool Pleasant staff 
499141,Acevi Villarroel, Don t expect a lot from the swimming pool , Bed was very comfortable and wifi connection good Staff was kind and helpful Location was not the best but good enough 
499142,Acevi Villarroel, The spa which consisted of a small gym sauna and hot tub was not included which it would have the cherry on top , Staff was very friendly and accommodating 
499143,Acevi Villarroel, The toilet would not flush staff corrected the problem quickly Nosy fan refrigerator I was booked for an extra night by mistake Desk was understanding Management was not and over charged me twice what I should have paid Disappointed by the hotel s attitude So it was over priced and noisy Otherwise ok , It s a very comfortable room Lots of room Close to cafes and metro 
499144,Acevi Villarroel, The room was very noisy Even with the air conditioning off there was a constant humming noise coming from the ceiling of the room There was also a lot of noise from the corridor and from other rooms clearly there is no sound proofing at all There was a room service menu in the room which states that room service is available from 8 to 12 in the morning However when I call at 11 30 I was told that it finishes at 11 When I point out that my menu says 12 I was told that it was a mistake and there was nothing that could be done This is dreadful customer service I would not recommend this hotel ,No Positive
499145,Acevi Villarroel, No immediate nice restaurants nearby but only 10 15 minute walk away or shorter taxi Pool area is nice but overlooked by residential properties not an issue for us though , Lovely staff fine location 10 min walk from Las Rambles North End Nice clean neat room Relaxed and quiet swimming pool 
499146,Acevi Villarroel, Pool and door between rooma, The door between room is not very comforting and put solo traveller on unease regarding security Also the pool is big enough for a dip and not necessarily for swim 
499147,Acevi Villarroel, Toilet was not flushing properly Hairdryer was not working properly Filthy bathroom outdated decor Have stayed in far better places for much cheaper ,No Positive
499148,Acevi Villarroel, Rudimentary gym should not be called as such very misleading Extra charge for Sauna and Steam room excessive charge Room cost not worth it s value , Helpful staff and fairly good location 
499149,Acevi Villarroel, The room we were allocated was on second floor and was noisy so asked to be moved which they did promptly as soon as room became free The rooms were both the same sat out but more designed for business traveller with a desk We would have preferred a larger room with separate single beds as mum and daughter trip No relax chair or drawers to put clothes on just a wardrobe Bathroom was of a good size Pool was a disappointment not being on the roof and was overlooked by lots of high rise flats It was much smaller than expected and only 0 9m deep , We liked the breakfast and the location as was easy access to the metro 
499150,Acevi Villarroel, That you had to pay for jacuzzi etc at 15 per person Never ever stayed at a hotel where the facilities were not free considering it was a 4 hotel and was very expensive Very disappointed with that Also there was a function on until 2 30 am loud music very noisy which prevented any sleep after a long day of traveling No discount was offered whatsoever Even though first night was ruined by this , Lovely big room good breakfast Friendly staff 
499151,Acevi Villarroel, The walls were thin and you can easily hear people in other rooms or the hallway , The hotel was close to several restaurants laundromat convenience stores and the metro bus airport bus 
499152,Acevi Villarroel, Actually I didn t dislike anything though I didn t try the gym nor the breakfast so I can not judge them, The cleanness room design size bathroom
499153,Acevi Villarroel,No Negative, Staff very helpfull Checked us in 2 hours early as we arrived earlier than expected Massive Bed Knew the area for cash points and directions to points of interest given in English Ordered a taxi for the airport on check out 
499154,Acevi Villarroel, Breakfast Could of been better Cant really say they have a gym Could hear other rooms and people , Nice Big Beds Clean room Friendly staff Good spa Nice bathrooms
499155,Acevi Villarroel,No Negative, very good location close to tourist attractions and metro and at the same time quiet area no problem at night with the noise Very helpful staff Breakfast price seemed for us a little too high but there were plenty of places around to have a morning coffee with sandwich or croissant 
499156,Acevi Villarroel, A bit hot in the room would of liked to be able to open a window no kettle in the room we were out of season so the bar wasn t really happening or swimming top bar but I imagine in the summer it s very busy a little way out if you ve got small kids as the walk was long but nice, It was quiet on the 4th floor nice walk to the centre comfy big beds very clean and great size bathrooms and lots of wardrobes in the rooms 
499157,Acevi Villarroel, Had hot water issues the first 24 hours When we notified the front desk they pretty much ignored the problem Eventually the hot water got better but never extremely hot , Loved the layout of the family 2 story room Comfortable beds Clean bathrooms 
499158,Acevi Villarroel, Stayed in the junior suite which was a mistake The dvd only worked in the saloon not in the bedroom and the only thing to relax on in the saloon were 2 small not very comfortable armchairs no sofa On top of that the shower door wouldn t close properly and as we were only staying one night it couldn t get fixed in time the compensation for this was 2 bottles of water from the mini bar In general the room could use a bit of maintenance some lights were broken the bath robes had holes in them etc I m sure the hotel is ok if you just look for a place to sleep rather than actually spend some time at the hotel and if you re in a normal room rather than paying for a suite with money that could give you a much better hotel in Barcelona ,No Positive
499159,Acevi Villarroel, There were two complaints from us 1 The first night we arrived late in the evening and asked the staff about a place to dine nearby The guy pointed to the one that they advertise which was far far away from the hotel We walked for 10 mins with a toddler but still weren t even close the that place So we settled for one of the many places along the route The strange thing is that there were other streets with other options he could have pointed us to and save us time and effort 2 The air conditioning did not work properly Even if set to max cold it was blowing slightly warm air When we called the reception they changed something but the issue then was that even when set to max heat it was blowing cold air All through our stay we had to call them 3 to 4 times just to get the AC adjusted Then why have the dials in the room at all , The staff was very helpful Initially we were given a room which was attached to the bedroom of the next room and our son was poorly on the first day so he was noisy the first day Our neighbours didn t like this and came to us to complain We immediately reported it and were given another room by the staff later that day The staff made it clear that our neighbours had no right to complain to us directly and should have contacted them in the first place They also said that they have a policy to not give such room to families with young children but something went wrong in the booking process The breakfast was also excellent 
499160,Acevi Villarroel, Breakfast not included Lack of staff around We were given a connecting room and there was a child in the next room who was having tantrums Wrong to give a room like that , Lovely beds
499161,Acevi Villarroel, Swimming pool not available and room view facing interior patio area , Location Walking distance from the centre barri Gotic Sant Antoni Poble Sec and metro station 
499162,Acevi Villarroel, The air conditioning or other plant noise kept us awake otherwise the room was quiet We didn t like the lack of a proper door to the bathroom , The staff were helpful and friendly The location was ideal Lots of bars cafes and shops nearby Close to the tube and airport bus stop Good value for money 
499163,Acevi Villarroel, Terrace is on second floor and there was no service Whether this is seasonal we are not sure Terrace in general wasn t very appealing Room photos on booking didn t match room we had , Checked in earlier than anticipated 
499164,Acevi Villarroel, The hot water was on and off so we had to have cold water showers in the last couple of days , Excellent value for money The staff was most friendly and helpful Very decent breakfast 
499165,Acevi Villarroel, The rooms get very warm and the air con doesn t seem to fix that , The hotel is in a great location to everywhere The staff were very friendly and the rooms were a great size
499166,Acevi Villarroel, I came without a kettle so a hot drink in the room would have been nice The bathroom had toiletries etc but a box of tissues would have been nice The TV has virtually no English channels, After we walked away from a disappointing Air BnB we made a spur of the moment decision to book this hotel The rooms were very clean and fresh which was our priority our first room became very noisy due to some men and machines working in the street outside but there was no problem to move us to a quieter room Staff were excellent to help us in any way we mainly eat out but had breakfast at the hotel on our departure day and this was very acceptable we used the gym and spa which we had to ourselves We had hoped to stay in the gothic area but even though this hotel looked to be more than walking distance to the centre a bus stop opposite the reception meant we could be there in minutes all buses are frequent and traffic flows well with multi lanes operating in one way systems there are no great room views but as a base we couldn t fault our stay I will return again with no concerns 
499167,Acevi Villarroel, The fridge did not seem to work , Had a comfortable and relaxing stay The hotel is well suited for a weekend trip Close enough to the strict center to quickly reach all places 
499168,Acevi Villarroel, The fact that the pool was closed was a little disappointing The location was good as there were places to eat around and we truly got to see the real Barcelona by walking around but it was a little far from the actual tourist zones Still lovely hotel , Absolutely loved the little spa bit and the room bathroom were lovely and very clean The staff were also very pleasant but the language could be a little bit of a barrier I liked the atmosphere 
499169,Acevi Villarroel,No Negative, i went there with my family and friends 11 people in total for the weekend for the fc barcelona match and also for sighseeing the hotel was close by everything and the services were amazing the rooms are clean and comfy the space you had in each room was more than enough you have a supermarket just infront of the hotel and also a pharmacy you have a small restuarant infront of the hotel who was very cheap but delicious all in all i will deffinitly return to this hotel if i ever get the chance to go back to Barcelona 
499170,Acevi Villarroel, All the rest Location is OK but hotel is over priced Not very clean rooms are old and partially falling apart Breakfast is a joke Wifi didn t work well , Service was good 
499171,Acevi Villarroel, Walls was thin so you can hear the occupants next door if they are noisy Lucky we had quiet occupants next door , Rooms and bathroom are big and comfortable We were on the fifth floor and there was no noise from the street below 
499172,Acevi Villarroel, Room 1 Had to fill the bath using the shower For some reason no taps on the bath Room 2 temperature control on the taps didn t work so couldn t use the bath No kettle or tea coffee making facilities in room Very limited TV Only 1 British channel Would not rate as 4 Probably wouldn t stay here again , Location
499173,Acevi Villarroel, Windows are fixed There is no natural ventilation in the rooms This maybe very dangerous for allergic guests I do not like the door panel of WC which is made of glass, Breakfast menu have great options for every type of diet
499174,Acevi Villarroel, Matress was rather soft no complementary drinking water or kettle were provided The rear lifts had an unpleasant odour, The hotel is undergoing a major upgrade some rooms lavailiable at a lower price although they are not so comfortable as the modernised rooms
499175,Acevi Villarroel, Nothing, Excellent location and price The gym was small but other than that I couldn t fault the hotel The staff were friendly the rooms were spacious and clean Very enjoyable stay 
499176,Acevi Villarroel, Bathroom not very private can t open windows in room, Very helpful staff great location quiet street but a short stroll from Las Ramblas the prot and restaurants
499177,Acevi Villarroel, When we went down to eat dinner one night there was no restaurant staff there We waited for approximately 20 to 25 minutes for someone and we even asked the front desk staff about the restaurant staff So we left and ate out , The staff was very nice informative and friendly The hotel was very quiet and peaceful 
499178,Acevi Villarroel, The facilities are outdated Torn uncomfortable chairs in living room pin missing in shower door with temporary sticker used to hold door in place waste and overflow in whirlpool tub worn dirty caulking no tissues one soap for basin bidet tub and shower No small towel in bidet no WC brush pity on the maid who needs to clean this nightmare of a bathroom with glass sink that looks dirty even after it is cleaned , Breakfast was good Receptionist very helpful and friendly 
499179,Acevi Villarroel, The beds were extremely uncomfortable We were in room 304 and the beds were some of the worst I ve ever known Did not have one night of good sleep because of this There was a constant smell coming from the sink There was wood missing from the floor by the bathroom door The shower leaked into the bathroom floor every time it was used I asked about using the gym one evening as I d seen a poster in the lift saying the Spa was free and the guy on reception was really rude and dismissive saying the poster goes on to explain this is only for people booking direct on their own website He didn t even offer use of the gym for a price The cost of water from the minibar was crazy Go over the road and buy it , Miguel on reception was fantastic Housekeeping were great and the hotel was really clean Location is excellent 
499180,Acevi Villarroel, No coffee making facility in our room Noisy room A little bit far from central Window locked for a security purpose , Good WIFI connection helpful staffs Two metro lines are within a 10 minute walk We can choose the lines depending on our destination Supermarket is in front of Hotel 
499181,Acevi Villarroel, There were no tea facilities , We were siblings on a 3night xmas break ages 12 28 The location was good it gave us a chance to tour like a tourist without a tour guide The Metro s were about a 5 7minute walk on either sides of the hotel depending where you were going Everything is more or less self explanatory if you have used a tube before everything was colour co ordinated The staff were very very helpful even on Xmas day they were still smiling always ready to help and they spoke good English too On our last night we decided to eat at the hotel restaurant and the food was very nice good portion and great value for money 
499182,Acevi Villarroel,No Negative, It was a fantastik hotel to live in Very help full staff all of them specially Miguel Very very good standard breakfast in the hotel restaurant Clean and big rooms with all modern facilities and bed for our litle boy in addition short distance to senter of Barcelona Ohhhhh ofcourse the Spa We Loved it 
499183,Acevi Villarroel, Wi fi was of very poor speed Difficult even to read mails not to mention videos , Hotel is excellent rooms are clean and comfortable and interior is excellent Staff are very professional and cleanness is on very high level All in all looks very expensive but it is not 
499184,Acevi Villarroel, Nothing really although gym was poor a few pieces of equipment not really a gym Apart from that very goo hotel , Location very good Close to Metro and not far to walk to some of the attractions Nice restaurants close by which are very reasonable priced 
499185,Acevi Villarroel, The spa was not available to us because we booked thru bookings com It was advertised as free at the hotel but we were required to pay and additional fee , staff was friendly and helpful 
499186,Acevi Villarroel, poor breakfast for that money bathroom does t have ventilator and on the ceiling was mess no hot water for bath uncomfortable blanket for bed, kind stuff location
499187,Acevi Villarroel, Although minimalist Boutique Hotel No basics in room ie teas maid tissues in room toilet flush needed 30 sec hold for full flush phone rang only in bathroom and breakfast not included for a not cheap room rate, Smoking rooms available

499189,Acevi Villarroel, Bad insulation , A decent hotel The lady who greeted me at reception spoke Russian Good staff overall Nice decoration of lobby with Salvador Dali pictures 
499190,Acevi Villarroel, Location is slightly too far away from the center Hotel not very clean and in need of a shine up Our room overlooked the swimming pool leaving little privacy Could hear everything from neighboring rooms , Helpful staff at reception Good breakfast 
499191,Acevi Villarroel, Normally one could pre book breakfast Here you could not and the breakfast was so expensive that we felt obliged to go somewhere else to eat for one week With an old grandmother that was not what we would have preferred , Some of the staff were exeptional to us and some other were average 
499192,Acevi Villarroel, Except permanently locked windows entering to small about 3x3 m internal yard Climate control system was still efficient enough but would prefer more natural view and ventilation when desired Especially for the rate , We had a duplex with two restrooms two TV s comfortable beds pretty enough space Very convenient in general for the family of 4 
499193,Acevi Villarroel, The lighting in the room was awfull the window looked out onto a brick wall not pleasant The bathroom floor flooded every time we took a shower not good , The staff were very helpful and always had a smile 
499194,Acevi Villarroel, Air conditioning in room difficult to control , The location is walking distance to the gothic quarter but sits in an attractive street from the 1900s in Eixample While I was there they were fixing the wifi but that actually the fastest free wifi speeds I ve ever had If they kept that up I d be going regulatory Also had a great desk so working was no problem 
499195,Acevi Villarroel, The true mark of quality is its quality of service Alas Acevi Hotel Barcelona you have failed that test Thanks for the lies lack of customer service your indifference your ability to rescind offers due to staff changes , The location is great for the Eixample but that s about it
499196,Acevi Villarroel, A little bit far from centre described as 4 star more a 3 in my opinion perhaps overpriced, Clean property friendly staff reasonable location for metro
499197,Acevi Villarroel, Above shower leaked onto us in shower discusting and an old problem when we complained they fixed up stairs but did not address our disgust Room dirty with stcky residue from previous drinks Breakfast not up to standard Warn out floors, Good helpful staff and good location
499198,Acevi Villarroel, Our room was not cleaned at 4 00 pm and because we complained the Homophobic Manager launched a tirade of abuse at us Totally uncalled for The most ignorant manager we have ever come across Absolutely disgusting behaviour Also in the restaurant half the dishes were not available and what we ordered did not appear The Homophobic Manager said that he would not be charging us for it He was told as we had not eaten it we certainly would not be paying for it , Nothing about this hotel to like 
499199,Acevi Villarroel, Can t fault the place , Excellent spa facilities Just what you need after a busy day Rooms are clean and well maintained 10 min walk to ramblas Little caf and amentites are local

499202,Acevi Villarroel, I was there on business and only upon arriving was I told that there was no business centre on each floor as advertised Not impressed They were not willing to let me use their computers and I had to pay out of pocket to get important work done elsewhere Additionally we are a non smoking family with two young children who booked the family suite which very nice Unfortunately we were told this was a non smoking facility and NOWHERE on your booking form does it say this is a smoking facility Well apparently they DO allow smoking on the first floor which passed through the ventilation system and made all four of us quite nauseous and ill Interestingly they said it was a ventilation issue but there was no smoke noted whatsoever in the main lobby If I would have known these issues beforehand I would have selected another hotel ,No Positive
499203,Acevi Villarroel, The wifi connection was unstable and slow in all parts of the building Connection sufficient for low quality Skype calls and browse the net , I stayed there for a small break after my holidays in Costa Brava Good location on C Villaroel 15 minutes walk from Pla a de Catalunya My room on the 6th floor was large and quiet with a very comfortable bed Staff were polite and helpful The small swimming pool provided relief when it was too hot to walk on the Barcelona streets I did not have breakfast there
