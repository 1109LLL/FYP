366395,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, When we checked in we were given information about breakfast which made us think that it was included in our stay Of course this was our mistake but to find out after eating that it was 18 Euros each was a shock , The staff kindly offered a complimentary upgrade as we were staying while on our honeymoon 
366396,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, non, Breakfast is amazing The hospitality was amazing The rooms are big and clean air conditioner is good The Hotel is close to the center by Tram of underground U there are few restaurants around The area is very quiet Wifi is very good and free Go there You want be sorry 
366397,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, if you bring a lot of luggage with you the elevator is small, allowed early check in provide umbrellas if it is raining bake cake on premesis every day which is availible for room service shower has good water pressure
366398,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Initial stairs up to reception not ideal with heavy suitcases but it s an historical building so scope for change probably limited The toilet had no sink in it and you had to walk back through the bedroom to the shower room to wash hands Plenty of room for one in the toilet itself seems a bit crazy not to have added one there , Room was very comfortable and well furnished Staff were all very helpful gave us a good recommendation for dinner Breakfast was great amazing selection of Austrian cheeses Good value for Vienna the design d cor made us smile 
366399,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Slight disconnect between room staff and reception leading to a mistake in our bill that was quickly rectified , Lovely hotel helpful staff The wine tasting option was not explicit The breakfast seems expensive but really we were only charged the mid price which was reasonable 
366400,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Nothing , The staffs are very friendly helpful and accomodating The hotel ist clean and cozy The breakfast buffet is excellent My husband cant get over with the cheese at the buffet lecker The location is just 15 20 Minutes walk from the city and tourist attractions 
366401,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Hard to find because of one way traffic and certain streets not going all the way through Nicer map online probably would help people with cars like us No iron in the room Shower design was a little funny with almost no privacy and water leaking through the door if head isn t pointed only in one direction , Nice bedding large room in the middle of Vienna with quite modern amenities excellent neighborhood very safe even at night Rather quiet even though bars and restaurants stay open half of the night 
366402,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, the room was large and very confortable breakfast was great lots of fruit breads cheese location is very convenient close to downtown lots of museums and restaurants within walking distance easy access to public transport I strongly reccomend Wein Design hotel 
366403,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Nothing It was great , Staff was wonderful friendly helpful Appreciated their excellent English Hotel room was super clean and bright Loved the shower 
366404,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Although it was ok to have the toilet separately from the rest of the bath a small basin in the toilet would have been perfect but this is a small thing considering the rest of the facilities quality of staff etc which are excellent , Staff extremely nice and helpful Breakfast superb big selection including healthy organic stuff including for vegans salmon excellent porridge available without milk etc Everything tasted like it was from a farm eggs cheeses The design of the hotel very inspired Big room very comfortable and big beds Very good restaurants nearby the hotel s recommendations are v good indeed The location round the corner from Vienna s English Theatre few min walk from the Museums Quarter 15 min from Hofburg palace 25 min walk from St Stephen square 
366405,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, No coffee maker in the room You can call reception and they bring you a coffee but that is of course not as convenient as having the machine in the room But that is the only comment I can make everything else was very good , Nice location very nice room and friendly staff We truly enjoyed our stay at this hotel 
366406,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Overpriced and very bad rooms 140 for a small motel sized room I just booked into the park inn for 110 and the room is big clean and new This is a big rip off Wifi never worked , Nothing 
366407,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, This hotel is truely unique fantasticly designed rooms each sponsored by a wine maker and with their own individual design Incredibly friendly staff and a relaxed atmosphere Walking distance to some great bars and restuarants and a great wine bar onsite to come back to 
366408,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, I like everything , I was not for the first time in this hotel And I hope I will return in the future Helpful personal nice atmosphere good location Very important comfortable beds silency You really can have a wonderful rest after walks in Vienna but also perfect place for the rest in case you are business traveller Rooms are big that makes your stay even more comfortable You not only want to go out to the city but also to return beck and to spent some time in the hotel 
366409,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, I think our group mught have liked something closer to Stephenplatz but we did use the underground frequently Rooms were kitchy with wine themed rooms but the hotel was clean and the beds were tolerably comfortable The staff was incredibly helpful in recommending restaurants looking up information for tourists ,No Positive
366410,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, NOTHING, Everything Great friendly staff best customer service I stayed at Room 003 ground floor yet it was so quiet It s in a quiet neighborhood just walking distance from the old city center The room has cool cool hip design and it s so spacious And not to mention very clean too I am definitely staying here again when I go back to Vienna 
366411,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Not a complaint but Hotel was older style than I had anticipated but nice none the less , The area the quirky old time lift was a novelty ran so silently it couldn t be heard 
366412,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Nothing The location is a little way off the center of Vienna but there are many public transportation near the hotel such as tram and subway So I didn t feel discomfort , It was an excellent hotel with very kind staffs and wide and clean room Also I could get the convenient transportations from and to the airport because of the positive helps of the staffs Thank you so much 
366413,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Nothing , Very good location right beside the museums quarter and ten minutes walk from the old town The hotel was excellent very friendly and helpful staff Can t be faulted 
366414,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, No 24 hrs restaurant facility Need to carry luggage for 12 steps Small lift Small hotel with no other facilities , Reasonably bigger room Clean Good location Good shower Good restaurants nearby 
366415,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Take care if booking any events or tours with the staff we found their understanding of English made things unclear and we ended up paying for a tour we did not ask for there was no acceptance on their part it was there fault tho my wife and I both were very clear Beds are extremely hard , Nice Eighbourhoodmwith some good restaurants
366416,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Maybe the bed is a bit hard for me And if there was a soft couch in my room I would not even want to leave my room st all , I stayed for 5 nights Nice and cozy all the way through facility location staffs Breakfast costs 18 which is expensive but food is wonderful and provides lodgers energy and pleasant mood to start a day s journey If you like wine it is more the reason to try this hotel because the owner appears to own a winery too 
366417,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Didn t find anything particular, Very comfortable Clean and modern great Wi Fi and nice location Overall good value for money compared to other places in vienna
366418,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Need shelves drawers in the bedrooms for clothing Modern concept just taken that step too far and lost sight of the fact that customers are travelling with luggage and need to unpack Hated the single duvets , The wine options and availability excellent Breakfasts were fab Cheeseboard first class especially when washed down with a classy Red All staff exceptionally pleasant and helpful 
366419,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, We stayed at the hotel for two nights and the room is spacious comfortable and very clean The staff is helpful at check in and kindly helps us arrange a late check out on the day we are to leave as well as offer to book us a taxi to the airport The location of the hotel is also excellent It s a short walk from two underground stations There is a very nice playground near one of the stations as well as supermarkets so it s ideal for the family with small kids like ours Moreover there are a few restaurants within the walking distance We tried two restaurants as per the suggestion of the hotel staff and found that both places serve very good food Though not far from the city centre the neighbourhood of the hotel is quiet and safe What s most impressive at the hotel has to be the breakfast buffet The variety and quality of food provided is even better than some five star hotel we stayed The food is nicely cooked fresh and very delicious There s also a range of gluten free and dairy free food you can choose from which I think is very considerate of the hotel 
366420,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, 1 Even though the breakfast was very good quality I would have appreciated more options such as omlettes and bacon eggs 2 The room design included a two seperate bathrooms one with a sink and a shower and a small closet like one with only a toilet I had no problems with that however it seemed unusual , Central location Very close to the city center The room was modern with an elegant design and was very clean The building was renovated and most of the furnishings were new This is especially important since many other hotels in the area are old with outdated facilities The staff were warm professional and were also accomodating I had a request to check out a few hours late they were able to facilitate that request The hotel did not have many facilities like pool or fitness center that however that is to be expected from a 4 city hotel Who needs such facilities when you have the city on your doorstep Very good value for money 
366421,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Wish we could have stayed longer , Staff were fantastic so helpful and friendly Hotel in a great spot really modern and well situated Easy access for everything Wine lovers will be in heaven 
366422,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Nothing it was perfect Tea making facilities in the room would have been nice but not essential , This hotel was amazing The staff were so helpful and the location excellent The breakfast was of very high quality with carefully chosen artisan foods I would definitely go back

366424,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, Very great comfortable stay Within 5 minutes walk from Rathaus station Well Designed room settings including useful amenities Staffs are all friendly and helpful We feel very thankful for letting us early check in and late check out which makes our journey more comfortable A hotel with warm mind Highly recommended 
366425,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, The modern designed bathroom offers no privacy at all in a family room Plus our room had a theme of a vineyard whose owner s looks are challenged His photo was placed so that he kept looking at us taking a bath It was eery , Good design very helpful and friendly personnel Excellent location central Vienna few feet by foot or subway or tram Nice and clean 
366426,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Four years ago the mattresses 2 singles in room 208 were heavenly Never slept so well since This time round they have replaced the singles with a king size which felt much harder and unfortunately I did not sleep that well Also the heating felt a bit high at times , Very good varied breakfast options Love the wine theme Nice and quiet Very clean Friendly helpful staff This was our second stay at the hotel We had the same room as four years ago which was nice 
366427,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, Comfortable stylish hotel in a location about 20 minutes from the town centre Rooms are thoughtfully schemed to relate to local wine producers so it s a good place to try Austrian wine Hotel is welcoming and casual and in an area where there a several reasonable restaurants Good value for money 
366428,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, LOVELY COMFORTABLE AND VERY CLEAN ROOMS THE MOST KIND AND HELPFUL STAFF EXCELLENT LOCATION AND A REALLY NICE LOUNGE TO HAVE WINE AT GOOD WI FI CONNECTION

366432,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, Very helpful staff excellent location not far from Vienna Landmarks modern style Every room have a unique design and very lovely furniture The hotel surrounded with many shops in 8th district the locations in the middle between 2 famous underground stations voleks theater and Rathaus around 8 10 minutes walk 
366433,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Can t think of anything I did not like , Staff were friendly generous and attentive Room was large and bright by boutique hotel standards Breakfast wine list were outstanding Great location 
366434,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Some of the little details let this place down a bit for us The wine theme is fun but a bit overdone e g all the wine themed toiletries In a hotel like this I d expect shampoo and conditioner not just red wine shower gel that leaves you smelling like booze We struggled to work the heating and the blankets they give you are tiny Perhaps this is a common thing in this part of the world but when it s 5 outside you need a proper duvet and more than one medium sized towel per guest In the mornings our room stank of cigarette smoke but the hotel staff never figured out where it was coming from , The staff were great and very helpful The hotel is in a good location for visiting Musuem Quartier and things near there Having a nice selection of local wine in the fridge is a very welcome alternative to the usual minibar fare Food consists of plates of bread and cheese but that suited us quite well 
366435,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, The location breakfast and relaxed friendly staff made our stay very comfortable Very relaxed vibe for a city centre hotel I would highly recommend this hotel 
366436,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, The rooms were all unique and wine themed featuring local vintners and the wine was excellent The hotel was in a side street only 5 10 minutes walk to the Christmas markets at the Rathaus in one direction and to the Museum Quarter in the other Good cafes and restaurants at walking distance We particularly enjoyed Cafe Eiles Also well connected with trams and underground just 5 minutes away 
366437,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, This is a great hotel Walking distance to the rathouse city center We arranged the round trip airport transfer through the hotel We are already planning to come back for a longer weekend stay 
366438,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, The location is great for discovering the city centre Surrounding Josefstadt and Neubau are full of nice restaurants and culture For wine lovers the hotel is a walhalla The breakfast is one of the best and most inventive that we have ever encountered The rainshower will blow away any cobwebs in the morning 
366439,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Lift was very tiny so only one of us could get in with pram other had to walk the stairs and final flight was stairs only so had to carry pram No kettle in room However free coffee and tea available on request from room service , Hotel staff were brilliant Very helpful and set up a cot for our 2 year old Nice big room with lovely rainfall shower 
366440,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, The shower was a little odd for us It s huge But there s a long window on the side of the shower It goes in to a hall so it s not like anyone walked past just a little less private , I can t think of anything I didn t like The building is beautiful We received a friendly warm helpful greeting They directed my husband to the parking garage while we went to the room The room was gorgeous and huge Lots of very nice little touches Very artsy Close to the Christmas markets Easy to get to via car then east to get around the city Very safe neighbourhood
366441,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Nothing The lift was slow but the stairs were great exercise , Great location excellent staff and a lovely quiet but friendly hotel Nice breakfast too 
366442,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Nothing it met all our expectations, Very nice design and practical room Good wine and amenities in room 24h bar service Excellent buffet breakfast served until 12h Late check out
366443,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Several steps from the entrance to the reception desk which makes it difficult to haul up luggage But staff offered to help , The location friendly staff spacious room cleanliness very good buffet breakfast not included in my room rate 
366444,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Initially the room was warmer than we liked Evidently only the heater works in the winter air conditioner in the summer However opening the window and turning off the heater was all it took In room wifi was slow hard to connect at times Also be aware if you order tea to your room during the evening it is free If you order it in the dining area and take it up to your room it is not , Wonderful place to stay in Vienna Within walking distance to cafes restaurants museums and shopping in the Zentrum and the Naschmarkt The Hotel Rathaus is also very accessible to public transportation bus train tram underground subway Our room was spacious and clean While the bathroom did not have a tub the shower was immaculate large and had the most wonderful showerhead It felt like standing in a soft rain No problems with hot water and we both enjoy relatively long showers The breakfast buffet was delicious and filling short of a small snack we didn t want to eat again until dinner From oatmeal hearty homemade breads 6 types of muesli jams cheeses thinly sliced meats relishes vegetable garnishes and even pastries to regular and decaf coffee plus more varieties of hot tea than I knew existed The staff was wonderful thank you Eleanor and Julia knowledgeable helpful and cheerful regardless of the hour or how many questions I asked The hotel conveniently arranged our pick up from and return to the airport Boris our driver was friendly and very informative He was waiting for us at the airport when we arrived and at the hotel on our return This was our first trip to Vienna and we couldn t have been more pleased with our choice of accommodations 
366445,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, price value quite steep minibar prices minor in this season only an aircon to heat the room , well designed room nice view 24h wine service 
366446,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, The internet in our room was not that good for business use but this inconvenience is compensated by the overall pleasure of staying at this hotel The location is good but it takes some time to get to the major places of interest which is not a big problem if you enjoy Vienna by walk , A very comfortable hotel with extremely customer oriented staff They are ready to provide you whatever you need with a smile and rare sense of humor They respond by mail promptly and make you feel comfortable even before you come The hotel is located in an old building so it s calm and beautiful inside and the rooms are clean and quiet The breakfast is vast and tasty with pretty big choice They provide breakfast till noon which is very good for leisure travelers sleeping till late and you will find the same choice even so late 
366447,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, The weather but that has nothing to do with the hotel , Wine in the room Wine bar Spacious room Unique boutique hotel Staff helped us choose and book a tour 
366448,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, It rained every day , From the our 1st contact with the hotel staff were welcoming attentive and helpful Breakfast staff and food excellent Rooms large very comfortable 
366449,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, except for large cheese selection breakfast rather poor Room design not functional no night tables limited space for clothes no coffeemachine , helpfull very friendly staff hotel location good Josefstadt 
366450,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, There was some building work on the street front with some noise in the morning obviously not under the control of the hotel , Small boutique hotel on the edge of the Vienna ring Very handy to the museum quarter and a short walk to the Metro to travel to the centre of town We were given an extra large room as we stayed 6 nights each room is wine themed and the staff are very knowledgable about the wines served in the bar Good breakfast available in the morning
366451,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, Can t give this place a good enough review A perfect little boutique hotel themed around wine with huge amounts of character and quirky rooms Located just outside the central ring road meaning it s out of the tourist highways but close enough for a pleasant walk into town and close to a lot of great local restaurants with prices and quality much better than what s generally available in the city centre The staff were wonderfully helpful and even made sure we were given a top shelf room when I informed them by email that I d booked a special trip for my girlfriend and I Highly recommended 
366452,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, The breakfast over priced even though they had three options Three eru for one coffee and croissant Not friendly staff Never offered additional coffee Found out was available when we complained at checkout , Okay nothing outsiding 
366453,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Air condition of the room was not good it is not in the city Center it s two stations with subway or 20 minuets walk But Vienna has a good transportation system so you can go to different places if you get the right information , Staff
366454,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, The walking distance to the metro and tram station , The service was great Everyone speak English so communication was excellent The staff went out of their to help the guest 
366455,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, The elevator is small and outdated There s a small flight of steps you have to climb to reach the receptionist but no big deal, The breakfast is to die for delicious The staff is very friendly and helpful The location is perfect close to all the major attractions The rooms are spacious and modern 
366456,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Nothing, Lovely atmosphere in this hotel staff are very warm and friendly and go out of their way to help room was spacios and comfortable decor was bit different but made a nice change from the norm 
366457,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, None Would stay again if given the opportunity , Superb and friendly staff Great breakfast options Very generous rooms Good recommendations for near bye restaurants and nice selections of wines in the room and the dining facilities 
366458,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Minor gripe we found the heating air conditioning controls slow but opened the window to solve the problem , Attention to detail Friendliness Individual style and design detailing Fresh coffee tea served complementary in room on request was great 
366459,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, The room was noisier than other hotels we have stayed in this trip 4 weeks so far but Vienna is also the largest city The elevator was small but that didn t bother us because we always took the stairs , The neighborhood was amazing There were small locally owned restaurants everywhere At the end of our street 1 block was a cobblestone alley where there were 2 quiet outdoor restaurants one Italian and one nouveau cuisine Our room was huge with 20 ft ceilings and big windows that opened up We walked to all the attractions even to Schonbrunn Palace but we took the tram streetcar and U bahn subway at night to concerts There were lots of transit options 
366460,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Dining room is not the most comfortable location for lingering over glass of wine I appreciate space is limited but perhaps furniture could be rearranged to make it more atmospheric, Design features Excellent breakfast Great wines by the glass
366461,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Just one issue The building is of course old This means that the heating cooling system is limited our room was really warm and we couldn t cool it Turns out the A C was essentially switched to heat mode according to the front desk as it had been cooler in the city prior to our arrival We had to sleep with the windows open as the room wouldn t cool and on the first floor we were exposed to street noise and worse cigarette smoke from the sidewalk below Not good when your wife has a lung disease , A lovely hotel Beautifully designed terrific room layout helpful staff great location Arranged parking very nearby through the hotel was a big bonus Would definitely stay here again though off street on a high floor 
366462,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Our only problem was that the air conditioning system had just been turned off prior to our arrival but the weather was still quite warm Opening our windows wasn t an option because of several street lights We were moved to a room at the back away from the lights and were able to keep our windows open at night We appreciate the extra effort to solve our problem and found our accommodations very comfortable , Outstanding and helpful staff We also enjoyed the outdoor courtyard for the wine bar 
366463,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, They didn t advertise the fact that free tea and coffee was available all day I only found out on the web , Lovely bright and large room comfortable bed helpful staff and excellent choice and quality for breakfast Handily located within walking distance of the city centre 
366464,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Nothing, Quirkiness of the room and it s individuality and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly LOVED the bath and the fact it was attached to the bed 
366465,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Nothing , Wonderful comfortable and spacey room great taste excellent bathroom integrated in the room Great quiet location in walking distance to the nicest parts of town 
366466,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Common space is somewhat narrow and cramped as its an older building but lots of character , The room was AWESOME Very large high ceilings modern and good quality and of course the mini bar filled with wine Each room has a theme Austrian wine maker with full blown photo of bottle on the door Breakfast is lovely Staff are super friendly and not pretentious at all when sharing their knowledge of wine One of our best hotel experiences We will be back 
366467,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Parking place is in a nearby street it is problematic if you have much luggage I missed a plug from the beds side , Very friendly and helpful staff nice well equipped rooms with cool design 
366468,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Nothing , They offered to organise airport pick up Once I got in after 11 pm I still got a lovely glass of wine at the bar area The room double had all the amenities for a great stay Breakfast is a highlight with an excellent choice of coffees and teas plus delicious cakes in addition to all the usual Western breakfast foods In summary it is a relaxed perfect place to unwind after the stresses of the day 
366469,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, Charming and helpful staff high standards but relaxed atmosphere comfortable bed and good sized rooms Also good position for visiting the galleries and less than a ten minute walk from the airport bus stop at Rathaus Safe peaceful area and supermarket across the road 
366470,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, Hotel situated close to the historical places and museums also close to the undegraund stations At the night no any noise very comfortable bed So you have perfect sleep Breakfast very good but also around the hotel many cafees and restaurants supermarkets also with bio products and on the weekend on the same street have a fantastics small bio market with local vegetables fruits cheese etc Personal exceptionally friendly and helpful 
366471,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Location isn t the best Far away from the city center made me feel isolated You walk and walk and don t find a soul around even during the summer Staff is alright but not exactly friendly Nobody makes an effort to make you feel welcome As a matter of fact I felt like aswering questions was a bit annoying for them , Wonderful and I mean wonderful breakast The room is spacious and super clean 
366472,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, The confusion regarding breakfast tariff , The hotel is quirkily fab Beds comfy rooms spacious and immaculately clean Staff cannot do enough for you without being overbearing Having robes and slippers adds that little bit of luxury 
366473,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Would have preferred a private bathroom at first but got used to it , The whole experience was first class The little thoughtful touches were wonderful
366474,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, stayed in this lovely hotel for 5 nights the room is very spacious all the staff we met were very friendly and helpful walking distance to the old town great breakfast etc highly recommend 
366475,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, Very convenient location for the Innere Stadt and a really nice individual room Love the concept of the hotel too And having tried some of the wine our room was named after the Markowitsch I can recommend it too 
366476,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, The breakfast was too limited There were no gluten free options , Everyone at the desk was very friendly and helpful and made us feel welcome We enjoyed gathering in the courtyard pictured and sipping some of the fabulous wine offerings 
366477,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Funky room layout design like something a bit more traditional Noise from above and below Little bit away from beaten path but not too far , Friendly and helpful staff Good restaurant recommendations Language no barrier Flexible in room accommodations 
366478,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Nothing Some people may dislike that the bathroom is open plan to the bedroom area a dividing wall but no door but it has a separate toilet with a door If you weren t a couple but wished to share a room with a friend colleague it may be a bit intimate for some , The room was spacious well designed both in function and aesthetics The staff were wonderfully helpful and friendly We didn t eat there so cannot comment on that but the eating drinking area looked very nice and relaxed 
366479,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, The room deco was not quite our taste The flooring material felt cold and hard A bit worn out furnitures Would have liked a proper seating area there was only one armchair althoug there was plenty of room Toilet and bathroom very distant to eachother had to walk across the whole room to wash your hands after going to the toilet not very practical or hygienic In a walking distance to the inner city but no public transportation stops very close , Best breakfast ever totally worth the 18 euros Very nice personnel 
366480,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, The beds were not all that comfortable but not all that surprising considering that seems to be the norm in Europe The size of the room its amenities and services makes up for any deficiencies of the bed , The hotel is located near many attractions on the edge but a short walk or transit The staff were wonderful and helpful they helped book a tour for me helped with directions and even played nurse doctor when I cut myself The rooms were large and spacious The wine selection in your room is wonderful or you can try from their menu on the terrace courtyard The overhead shower was magnificent 
366481,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, Good location very good restaurants near by espcialy the Greec restaurant 150 m walking distance to atractions the stuff is very kind and helpful
366482,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Probably just put some hair conditioner in bathroom , What is there not to like Love the location but I think small things like the attentiveness of the hotel staff make our trip memorable Heading back again this weekend 
366483,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Nothing comes to mind, The breakfast was sublime Extensive selection great coffee and the service was excellent this is consistent as we stayed at this hotel once before and it was equally wonderful 
366484,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Nothing, Everything was fantastic the staff and conceirage were extremely helpful in organizing various tours and help securing tickets The breakfast was a feast and staff were courteous The rooms were eclectic and comfortable 
366485,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Lights by the bed were not suitable for reading A bit confusing way to reception add additional marks please , The location within walking distance to the central tourist spots 5 min walk to underground U2 convenient and reasonably priced shuttle service from airport 37 EUR is very reasonable price as usually we pay 45 50 EUR if take taxi from the airport to the 1st district Romantic inner yard Nice style of the room Large room a lot of space in the room and in the shower Wonderful selection at breakfast I took the sweet breakfast which costs 12 EUR 
366486,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, I would have liked an in house restaurant for evening meals I think they had a light room service But I knew they didn t have before I stayed so it wasn t a surprise but it would have made my stay even easier Although I did try some food outlets I may otherwise have not seen , Staff and service was excellent I liked the character of building Location on a side street was excellent and quiet easy walk to inner city attractions that I could see from my window 
366487,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, I wouldn t change anything , The hotel is great fantastic breakfast lovely wines and nothing was any trouble from any member of staff there would definitely make this my number one choice to stay in Vienna 
366488,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, The room was very large but the lounging furniture was small and slightly uncomfortable, The shower was very good the rooms very clean and the location was nice
366489,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, The bathroom arrangements are a bit odd modern and clean but odd The sink is across the other side of the room to the toilet and the shower has a glass door into the room I don t think it would necessarily suit friends who are a bit bashful but as a couple it was fine No coffee making facilities in the room but they will deliver free tea or coffee to the room on request , The staff were very friendly and helpful Our room was spacious clean and comfortable with lots of good storage space The bed was very comfortable We liked all the wine references and the hotel bar in the evening was a friendly welcome retreat after walking all day Close to the museum quarter trams and some good restaurants We didn t have breakfast but it looked good and was popular 
366490,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, Everything is perfect I would like to thank each member of wonderful team of this hotel Excellent service comfortable rooms delicious breakfasts super Austrian wines perfect location 
366491,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, excellent location very friendly staff comfortable room excellent buffet breakfast but with fresh coffee bar with large selection of Austrian wines also per glass
366492,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Surely a simple breakfast could be included in the price per night therefore not value for money no coffee making facilities in room Not a room with a view when out of room not always possible to charge camera batteries phone iPad etc, Friendly staff always answered our needs provided maps advice laughter coffee bus tram tickets the Champions League coverage comfortable room good location great restaurant Trilogie almost next door
366493,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Nothing, This is a tremendous hotel the staff are so welcoming and friendly The location is fantastic and the room was brilliant I do recommend this hotel to any one who wants to discover the charming Vienna 
366494,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, The staff here could not be more accommodating and friendly Their recommendation of wine and food was first class The quietest hotel we have ever stayed in perfect for a good nights sleep Wish we had be able to stay longer 
366495,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, The room and all facilities were of a very high standard The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever found in a hotel The breakfast selection was exceptional Staff could not have been more helpful The location was quiet but close to tram stops and underground stations meaning everything was accessible 
366496,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, no complaints, Staff paid attention to our needs We had an unfortunate incident involving theft on OBB and the staff did everything they could to cater us including calling OBB s office to see if they found our stolen items They were super friendly and the facilities were top notch The food was also delicious 
366497,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Nothing in the hotel Location is a little distant from the main centre so be prepared for a 15 20 minute walk, Staff were excellent throughout our stay particular mention for Martina Terrific rooms Clean spacious great shower firm bed and lots of storage The toilet without a wash basin is a bit odd but a minor quirk Breakfast is good though a little expensive Wine choice and staff knowledge of wines is excellent Wi Fi is excellent through the hotel 
366498,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, The hotel is great designed very nice with a lot of thought in every room However on our last day before our departure we were waiting just to check pout and the lady at the desk was busy with other couple but didn t even look at us just to say I will be with you in a moment as if we were not waiting there We felt it s not a nice way to accomplished our lovely stay at your place
366499,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Separate loo with no wash basin you needed to walk across the whole huge bedroom to the wash basin , Lovely big rooms very clean excellent continental breakfast with the biggest cheese board ever So many extras at the breakfast table including eggs bacon olives pastries fruit yogurt variety of rolls etc etc
366500,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, Very kind staff much above average Roomsize hygiene wine concept gives a true added value Quiet neighbourhood and noise free rooms Good quality breakfast 
366501,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, the only missing thing was the sun so we couldn t enjoy having our morning coffee sitting in the patio under the sun but i guess they cannot create a micro climate so nothing , everything was really great like really i mean depending on everyone s expectations some would find something to criticize but it s not my case go 
366502,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Bed was more like two singles than a double but was comfortable , Excellent location Friendly staff Great shower Open plan modern room which was quiet at night Lots of choice at breakfast but costs extra 
366503,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, I loved the individually styled room it was a very nice space to inhabit The bar too is excellent with a wide variety of wines and knowledgeable waiters to help you navigate through the list A glass at a time 
366504,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, The unique design of the room made it feel quite large and airy The location was terrific for walking to the tourist areas The staff was extremely helpful We would stay here again if our travels were to take us to Vienna 
366505,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, There was no shower door so sharing the bathroom with people was a little bit weird Might be specific to my room though , The location and hotel itself were great The front desk staff were so helpful in helping navigate the city and language Would definitely come back to enjoy the outdoor space when its not freezing 
366506,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, The toilet was on the other side of the room from the sink and the shower While I liked having the toilet separate from the shower I didn t like it separate from the sink Also I don t care but you might there is not a coffee maker in the room and they only gave us one roll of toilet paper , Great location great room great staff Loved the free glass of wine and computer downstairs to print off my boarding passes Nice towels robes and slippers Huge room with awesome shower Also the room was very quiet despite facing the street There is also a late check out option YAY 
366507,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, Spacious rooms complimentary delivery of tea coffee staff go out of their way to assist loved the 3200 power hairdryers never found one like that before most hotels have pathetic weak dryers 
366508,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Nothing bad or that we didn t like My brother would have liked a gym on site if we were being picky but there was one across the road if you are that desperate to use one , Beautiful bedrooms each one individually dedicated to a Viennese wine maker Centrally located around a 5 minute walk to the Museum District and 3 minute walk to rail station Wonderful staff who were happy to help give us advise and tips and gave honest opinions on tourist traps v local delights On a quiet street which doesn t draw in hoards of tourists So if you like a lively bar at night this might not be best for you however just a minutes walk away is an amazing roof top bar which is buzzing for us this was the perfect combo The bar at the hotel is open 24 7 so we often ended the night with a couple glasses of wine whilst chatting to the night staff 
366509,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, No way to close off the bathroom from the bedroom Not great when the parties are on different schedules , A wonderful spacious well appointed room Great staff and breakfast 
366510,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, there was nothing we did not like about this hotel everything we needed or wanted was provided with a smile , probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in wonderful place 
366511,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, I adored this hotel The larger room was great especially compared to the smaller rooms we had in other places in Europe We loved the wine concept It was so nice coming home after a full day and relaxing at the bar w local wine and cheese We stayed here 3 nights and I wanted a couple more It was also cool to be in the less touristic Spittelberg neighborhood where people live and hang out I would definitely stay here again and recommend to others 
366512,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, Simply everything As a bonus we got a free glas of wine upon arrival from a selection of excellent Austrian Wines 3rd stay and staff ever so friendly and helpful 
366513,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, We just loved this hotel Only one problem was locating the hotel when we arrived late one evening it is not near Das Rathaus , The courtesy and attentiveness of all the staff especially those on Reception It was great to have hot drinks brought to our room on demand We also like the flexible choice of breakfast We will be back 
366514,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, The staff were all very friendly and helpful Their suggestions of which Christmas markets to go to for quality items and those that were prettiest at night were spot on Room was spacious and we enjoyed the unusual touches like having the wine of the producer our room was named after in the room

366517,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Nothing, We missed our flight and did not arrive until the next day The hotel provided brunch with a half bottle of wine in our room for our arrival A welcome sight after such a stressful time Staff and hotel just perfect 
366518,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, I checked the bed for bed bugs and while I didn t find bed bugs the mattress was dirty with a lot of hair all over it It looked like someone cut their hair on top of the mattress It was gross , The room was large and comfortable and the staff was awesome They were helpful and gave good recommendations 
366519,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, I really didn t appreciate the non mentioning that the breakfast was a separate cost At the reception they said that breakfast was included Then we got charged at check out , I LOVED the space and bathroom 
366520,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, nothing, excellent helpful staff lovely room very spacious and clean fantastic on suite shower excellent location would book again if coming to Vienna cant fault hotel in anyway

366524,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, The staff members were very friendly and helpful The hotel is located close to public transportation and there are many nice restaurants and some entertainment venues nearby During our 4 day stay we managed to eat Austrian Italian Mexican and French food nearby We enjoyed ending a couple nights with a glass of wine in the hotel s wine bar I recommend strongly that you become familiar with the public transportation system as soon as you arrive We could have saved time if we had done so 
366525,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, No privacy in the room if the curtains are open The rooms surrounding the glass covered breakfast room below have no privacy When renovating the windows installed should have been windows that you cannot see into the room Closing the drapes or blinds leaves the room too dark for getting ready spending time in the room etc , Spacious room friendly and helpful staff and a fabulous breakfast 
366526,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, Spacious room attractively designed VERY comfortable bed The staff were exceedingly courteous very helpful in arranging for tours Their wine lounge is stocked with excellent wines that put a delightful finishing touch on long day of walking the Vienna streets museums

366531,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Nothing to complain about We made a great choice and would choose it again , We were here for 5 nights We loved the room and its d cor It was smart and very functional Beds were great There was enough room to move around and be comfortable in The staff were very gracious very quick to respond to a couple of requests and knowledgeable as well The windows in the room opened all the way A big plus for us as we keep them open at night We loved the location of the hotel It was close enough to the U Bahn the Ringstrasse and MuseumQuarter without being on top of it and within 10 15 minutes walking distance of several very good restaurants i e Glacis Beisl Kokora coffee houses Caf Sperl and the MariaTheresestrasse shopping district all by walking the side streets Getting onto the tram system from the hotel was a breeze Plus it was in a residential light commercial neighborhood meaning it was quiet 
366532,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Air conditioning could have been more efficient , Size of room and open plan space A bath would have been good although the shower was good Wine in room a good idea prices reasonable Very quiet day and night Ring for tea and coffee to the room efficient and great quality Staff very pleasant and helpful 
366533,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Our room had only view of light shaft, Very friendly staff Nice Wine bar in the lobby Very clean Breakfast good if a bit pricey Quiet street just off the Ringstrasse Very good restaurants in walking distance 
366534,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, the fact that the breakfast was not included in the room s price although it was extremely rich and various we both loved it , The lovely couches next to the windows the fact there was no door for the bathroom and the pure yet sophisticated style of both the room and the hotel Very beautiful and charming I would recommend the hotel to everyone who wants to visit Vienna and stay at its heart 
366535,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, In general for American travelers the mattresses and pillows just tend to be different in Europe If you re sensitive about your Bed situation you may consider asking for an extra pillow but this wasn t unique to this hotel Overall it was probably the best hotel we stayed at out of 7 , Our room was sleek modern stylish and very clean Each room is named after a bottle of Austrian wine which was fun The breakfast was top notch with just about anything you could imagine included with the room fee We also appreciated that you could purchase public transportation passes at the front desk 
366536,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Nothing , Very quiet but convenient location The staff was exceptional and helpful with all requests that we made Breakfast was delicious and bountiful and worth the money One of the best that we had in our 2 weeks of travel The room was large and comfortable with great large windows and delicious wine we had the Ernest Triebaumer room Wine was also reasonably priced We had a lovely bottle of chardonnay for 25 euro 
366537,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Didn t have breakfast due to price, Well located clean modern rooms with all expected facilities Exactly like the pictures loved the wine theme specific to each room 
366538,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, A bit hard to find and a 10 min walk to the Ringstrasse , Size of room and warm welcome from staff before during and after our stay Breakfast had a good range of items that included unusual varieties of condiments that had a wine theme 
366539,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design,No Negative, This hotel was so good that it changed my husband s attitude about travel in Europe I love to travel He usually prefers the comfort of home He gives it 5 stars and that is saying a lot I ve described the decor as upscale design with a sense of humor It was quiet comfortable and clean but these descriptors don t do it justice The front desk people were helpful efficient and friendly all of them and all of the time If we travel to Vienna in the future we WILL stay with them again 
366540,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Loved everything about the hotel , Very stylish room The idea of themed rooms seemed a little strange at the booking stage but we loved it in practice Staff could not have been more helpful and attentive Wines were lovely and breakfast superb Secure car parking was also arranged for us very close by 10 minutes walk from the nearest art gallery and about 15 minutes from the Hapsburg Palace

366543,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Climatization is awful Rooms were very hot , Specially Martina was very kind She really knows about wines She was very polite with us Breakfast is good 
366544,Hotel Rathaus Wein Design, Got in late and our reserved non smoking room smelled like smoke Was given a new room which was much smaller for the same price The room had almost no storage space double bed was actually 2 twin beds and the bathroom had no privacy You could see from room right into the shower There were also hardly any outlets Went to the bar and there were 3 loud business men who were talking very loudly about work We could not hear each other talk over the men so we took our wine back to our room , Nice staff and nice breakfast
