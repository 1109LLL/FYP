90107,Hotel Indigo Paris Opera, We are given a smaller room that what we reseved because we arrived early and we had to take a rest and this is what was available The hotel saud there is no difference in the price which is strange, We like the little sink in the toilet seat room Because you have the chance to use the water and to wash your hand before coming out of the toilet They gave us a small gift at time of departure

90110,Hotel Indigo Paris Opera, They blocked 800 euros on credit card at check in which was more than the cost of our stay Then they charged the cost of stay in addition to the blocked amount It s been two days since check out and they still haven t unblocked this amount Today we called the property and we had great difficulty getting the staff to understand and acknowledge the problem They were unhelpful and showed no interest in solving our problem What they said was something along the lines of this is how we operate we cannot say when we will unblock it it will be at least a few weeks We will definitely be avoiding this hotel chain in the future ,No Positive

90114,Hotel Indigo Paris Opera, Our only regret was to only stay for one night we wished we had more time to enjoy it Next time , We usually go to Paris at least once a year and we kept changing hotel hoping to find one we really like We both decided to make this one our future pick every time we visit Everything was great The location is fantastic The room was very specious clean modern and comfortable We loved it The staff was also particularly friendly and helpful being a ballet fan I loved the theme of the hotel and was even gifted mini ballerina shoes by the reception staff when they overheard my passion for classical dance Attention to details was very much appreciated The bed was also very comfy and the bathroom extremely modern and well equipped We also appreciated the access to the car park which can be a real inconvenience in Paris

90138,Hotel Indigo Paris Opera, Getting the shower hot enough for my liking was not an option Dial it up a bit , This was a repeat visit I always love the stylish and spacious rooms and perfect location in the hear of the shopping headquarters of Paris The lighting in the rooms is great and the free minibar etc appreciated The staff can t do enough to help you either Beds are comfy and bathrooms and accessories much appreciated including the manicure set 
90139,Hotel Indigo Paris Opera, A few suggestions to improve the bathroom from being more form over substance 1 if you want your guests to recycle the bath towels for being kind to the environment please at least provide towel hooks for hanging the used towels 2 the water pressure for the shower is not strong enough hence it takes a long time to wash my hair 3 the floor should be heated as the small radiator is not effective at all 4 the wash basin is made of wrong material which slows the flow of the water and resulted residuals constantly left behind which is extremely unpleasant , The excellent location which is central to everything yet quietly tucked away in a cobble stoned cul de sec The modern contemporary and cozy design especially the duplex that we stayed in Friendly and very helpful staff

90151,Hotel Indigo Paris Opera, while the room was excellent the hallway between the rooms has a stale smell and could use better ventilation, the reception staff were very friendly welcoming and patient the hotel is ideally located in a vibrant part of town the rooms were clean were equipped and comfortable
90152,Hotel Indigo Paris Opera, when you go tobreakfast their are several left overs of room dinners on the floor by returning at 3 pm they are still there hope that no rats are in the area but for this hotel a change should take place also we do not want to see the used bed sheets when going to the room , good breakfast some presentation changes recommended as we were not the first time in hotel we liked room 312 and appreciate to receive it next time
