224922,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, To begin the room they offered us wasn t what we booked nor was the second one they offered The third room finally met our requirements a double bed and a sofa bed the first two were missing the sofa for our daughter The next issue was the fact that the shower head was broken with water coming out the sides We checked in on a Wednesday night I told the front desk about it on Thursday twice on Friday and again on Saturday Every time we were told a technician would come to look at it We checked out Monday and no one came to the room for inspection and or repairs Additionally there was a green stain mold looking section on the floor right in front of the shower that was mentioned every time I asked about the shower head it was still there when we checked out While the location was good the ability of the staff to keep their room equipment functional and clean is questionable ,No Positive
224923,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, At night I wanted water and room service replied there s a vending machine down you can get from there , Not like a Novotel Property that I have earlier stayed Not the Novotel class and bathrooms were also highly ok 
224924,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Bathroom Room is very narrow Uncooperative staff I request to arrange for early check in as my flight reatched 8 am but I can not find any cooperation from the hotel staff I have to sleep in reception till 2 pm to take the room, Location
224925,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Sofa bed for kids not prepared when we arrived room was prepared but no cups and for some reason used cups of other guests left in the corridor not removed even by the next day , Great location access to indoor pool breakfast Helpful staff

224927,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Extremely disappointing pool visit with 4 staff members at the reception including the so called general manager trying hard to keep us out of their pool on 3 occasions Really unhelpful arrogant and just interested in their permanent members not interested in tourists or hotel guests in their facilities This is unacceptable , Great location very good hotel
224928,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Room Service Cleaning Not Good Breakfast Restaurant was very poor in variety of food Poor service staff some times the service not clean Very poor facility for Self service which is not accepted as I am coming to the hotel to be served and relax not to serve my self , the location of the hotel the view in front the seine river
224929,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Sink in room wouldn t drain properly Breakfast should run until 10am , Good sized room for the money Nice modern hotel Great customer service by all the staff
224930,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Wasting my night time trying to convene receptionist cigarettes smell is unbearable , I was checked in a room and as soon as I took a shower the room smelled like a butt of cigarettes Problem was first half solved with air fresheners but in half hour later it smelled like a cigarette hashtry Reception first claimed not to have an alternative room but after 1 hour argument and taken them up to the room receptionistadmitted that he wouldn t Let his family sleep in that room and that was how he decided to switch me There was no good reason to waste a two hour sleep at my first night to convene the receptionist of the issue 
224931,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Space in family room was not enough After opening the sofa bed there was no space for walking It seems that double room was changed to family room , Location of the property is good Walking distance from Eiffel tower 
224932,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The shower over flowed when you used it but this was more of a mess for the staff than bothering us , Really enjoyed our stay at the Novotel Paris the staff couldn t have been more helpful and friendly especially the concierge he went out of his way to help us and we didn t even buy any tickets off of him because we had them booked before hand not because we are mean lol The location is also a major plus as you can walk to the Eiffel tower in 10 15 mins but you have a metro less than 10 mins away We would really recommend the Novotel Paris its fab And the beds are really comfortable 
224933,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The lobby was nice but the rooms were terrible Floors were not vaccummed the shower leaked there was a stench in the room I wanted to vomit it was disgusting ,No Positive
224934,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, As above, It s very disappointing to see such pathetic staff and poor conditions of room disgusted house keeping Broken tiles in toilet along with stinking and stained room carpets Concierge service standards were below average Only good part was location close to Eiffel Tower and rest all ZERO

224939,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The family room had a great view but the watercloset was separate from the shower and lavatory, The breakfast buffet offered rice Location and availability of taxi Great view 
224940,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Very few good restaurants within walking distance Gym and pool were disappointing Hotel breakfast was only slightly better than economy class airplane food , The price was reasonable for Paris 
224941,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Original booking requested a double fold out bed Our first room offered was only a single The hotel was dirty and quite damaged and dated needs a refurbishment The pool rules were excruciating and tedious correct trunks and cap must be worn and the overall set up was poor cleaning equipment by the pool and unused gym equipment stored in the corner , Staff were friendly and helpful and resolved issues well
224942,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The room old dirty carpet taps in the bathroom not working properly very small for the family with two children sofa bed for children age 7 and 11 not big enough Piling paint from the wall in the bathroom small fridge with the only one bottle of water The room was not prepared for four people not enough soup 2 not enough shampoo 2 not enough tea 2 etc , Bed was very comfortable location was excellent views of the river was very nice breakfast was sufficient also 
224943,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The last morning a cleaner walked in without knocking apparently presuming we had left For my wife who just had come out of the shower that was not pleasant We complained but the management just said that it cannot have been that bad and basically did not seem to realize that that it might be a problem if a man walks in when a women just comes out naked from the shower They thought we should have locked the door but as in all hotels the door obviously only opened with a key and we for one would normally not lock it from the inside for safety reasons in case of an emergency To summon up it was generally a good hotel but this experience was totally unacceptable and we would not recommend anybody to stay here ,No Positive
224944,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Cleanliness the carpet sofa bed are old and too dirty Many germs and mold were on the bathroom wall Breakfast was same thing every day and the products were low quality Room facilities we were three but they put one of everything in the room Room service they brought services with so much delay And also there was no one before 7am to help us for carrying luggages Pool was closed and hotel didn t let us know about it before reservation Air flow in the room was awful because the windows were fixed we couldn t open them and toilet fan didn t work correctly , Just location and view of my room
224945,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, It s a pity we didn t know the pool would be closed for it s a annual emptyng We had a disappointed 5 year old with us Does the pool always close on the same dates each year , Reasonably priced restaurant for a hotel Room good size with sofa bed for children Quiet rooms Loved the little shop where we could buy wine and snacks 
224946,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Pool was under construction and nothing was mentioned ahead of time about it , 30 second walk from shopping mall restaurants 5 10 min walk from the Eiffel Tower Over room was on the 21 floor so we had a good view
224947,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Little bit too small shower, Very nice people on reception desk Breakfast OK good bed Location very good I had view on river 15 minutes walk to Eiffel Tower Wi Fi OK
224948,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, My room was pretty small refrigerator empty minuscule closet without door Asked for a king bed and received two single beds Could not take a shower without flooding the entire bathroom , The location is not so close to the subway needs a 6 8 min walk But overall it is good The hotel has good facilities for sports and is in front of the Seine allowing easy place for jogging 
224949,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, It s a nice modern hotel but it s starting to show wear and tear Carpets are getting old baseboards are scraped and even coming off in some parts Beds and other furniture were clean and the hotel had routine maintenance done well enough except for our shower That space could have been scrubbed a bit better , Location was fantastic Everyone on staff was super friendly and helpful Ernesto in particular stood out We had a west facing room and the view was great I liked how bright and sunny the large windows made the room feel Even though they didn t open the air conditioning worked well enough to keep the place comfortable Plenty of space in the room for our family to have a small breakfast and get cozy at night to hang out and or watch some tv 
224950,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel,No Negative, I have travelled many places for other work and leisure But I have never ever found a hotel which is worst than this Staff at the hotel were completely rude zero hospitality in the name of service No one to assist for luggage to the room no one to assist to the room while checking in Worst part people at the reception trying to fool and cheat by offering different room than committed at the time of booking They show pictures of room booking com which is completely different from the actual room which was offered Despite of complaint to both booking con and the Novotel team they didn t do anything Ad my credit card was charged I didn t had a choice but to accept their all nonsense It doesn t gets over here Next day morning breakfast again the same rude behaviour of staff toaster machine not working no hospitality service at the breakfast as well Breakfast timing I was in formed was till 10 AM to my surprise they closed reliance breakfast at 7 30 AM without any prior intimation I would strongly urge people to avoid this place even hotels lower than Novotel offers you a better service and hospitality and don t chat people I would also like to highlight that booking com which acted as an agent to facilitate this booking didn t do any thing despite of my complaint to them which was quite dissapointing Will be sending a detailed complaint mail to the Senior management at both Novotel and Booking com 
224951,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, We booked a double room with a sofa bed in two places meaning there is a partial wall separating two areas which we got at another hotel on our previous trip to Madrid But when we arrived we where told that there was no such type , The concierge was very helpful
224952,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, I didn t like how they separated the toilet from the rest of the bathroom It was a hassle to complete a simple refreshing task in the morning , Great view Close to a mall and Monoprix is right under you for a quick morning coffee and supermarket needs 15 minutes walking to the Eiffel Tower The hotel is attached to a mall which I found very practical 
224953,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Initially we did not get the kind of room we booked since the hotel was completely packed So we had to do with a smaller room Later the room was flooded due to leak in bathtub and had to change the room at midnight of the first day Moreover the Hotel staff present at that time on call was least bothered or did not try to help in finding a suitable room where we could move After arguing at the reception desk other staff helped and got us a room in another floor with no view Moving room with family from one floor to another at midnight is not fun for sure when you are already tired of driving 6 hours and a walk in the city Over that multiple visits to the reception to sort out the room issue was not pleasant either While the parking space is ample the lift from the basement does not work with the key cards provided This made us wait for long Since we have a child on a baby pram it was difficult to use the alternate escalator from the front of the Hotel But we were there during Easter and must admit that the hotel staff were overwhelmed by the tourist rush Some really tried out of their way to help and accommodate , Superb position to explore Paris on foot or public transport Some rooms have a very nice view of the river especially on top floors 29 30 31 Some staffs are very helpful and professional but the same can t be said about all Food was good but we only had once Breakfast was also OK but too crowded at times 
224954,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Very small room Dirty ground not nice walking on it without shoes In general hotel is not very well maintained , Top location close to Eifel Tower 
224955,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Cockroachs are everywhere at the main restaurant for breakfast even inside the food itself we complain to reception restaurant s stuff but it looks like that they already know and taking no action so disgusting , Good location
224956,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The hotel is huge and the rooms a bit tatty Breakfast was chaotic and the staff all quite abrupt and unfriendly , Beds were very comfortable and the pool was nice 
224957,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, There was only one available outlet in our room for charging our phones otherwise we had to unplug a lamp or the tv Needed more electric sockets The escalator was broken and it took forever to get an elevator when we needed to get to the train station It took 20 minutes to wait for an elevator from the 15th floor to the ground level at 8am Unacceptable , Room was spacious for Paris Staff was friendly Walking distance to Eiffel Tower and a few blocks from metro 
224958,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Rooms aren t the biggest Waiting queues for breakfast , Check in was hard job as room wasn t ready lady at reception wasn t very professional in apologising for Situation Although second receptionist carloine was more courteous gave us vouchers for drinks while we were waiting Room aren t spacious when you ve sofa bed being used as well We were on 25th floor facing river siene the view was just breathtaking Room have got huge flat screen TV with multiple channels including English Beds were possibly the most comfortable I have ever slept on in a hotel Strangely toilet was separate to main bathroom Tea coffee making facilities are available in room It has very good working wifi signals free of cost You also have safety locker in room as well Breakfast had good variety although you may have to queue to get into breakfast area if it s busy Swimming pool is of decent size along with gym It s 10 minutes walk to Eiffel tower as well to nearest metro station If you are visiting Effiel this is the place to be ask for river facing room 
224959,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Slightly expensive, Beds supercomfy had booked a superior room with city view really enjoyed the river view from 25th floor pool was very clean though sauna was bit small 
224960,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The room we stayed in was 2906 the bathroom has an awful stain on the floor The included breakfast on level 3 was second rate the room seated over 100 people there was a single DIY egg station with 4 tiny fry pans many of the food items we regularly out of supply , The hotel location is great the rooms are adequate in size
224961,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Escalator not working I am waiting for a knee operation and trying to walk down the escalator was painful Used the hotel bar and the one night we actually received our bill it said euro 76 when the change came back with the bill it said euro 56 the first bill was correct next to some of the drinks on the 2nd bill it had offret I spoke to the bar man he said wrong bill I took bill to front desk and explained it was not me who had been diddled but the hotel I heard no more back, Room Pool 
224962,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, There were other members of family staying and they paid 100 less for same type of room Our view of the Eiffel Tower was tiny , The proximity to everything was great We had food by room service and it was delicious 
224963,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The pool was very tired looking and no spa The whole area was in need of drastic refurbishment the sauna was weirdly through the gym reception not even hot and the changing rooms were also very shabby The classes and staff were good though Don t forget your speedos These are compulsory , It was in walking distance to the Eiffel Tower about 15 mins and 10 to nearest tube Modern and smart looking We had a view over the seine 
224964,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, we have returned several times to this hotel over the years and this year it was evident it was really starting to show some disrepair especially the carpets and the bathrooms tired and in need of a refurb , excellent location in Paris serious large tourist hotel so not for anyone looking for the real local Paris experience Able to walk to most points of interest very close to the Eiffel Tower but no view excellent breakfast and over all pretty good value for money 
224965,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Rummet var litet Toalett utan handfat Tr ngt badrum D lig frukost utan gr nsaker Liten pool i ett annat hus S sm f rvaringssk p , Bra l ge N ra till Eiffeltornet floden och nya k pcentrum 
224966,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Bacon looked disgusting Just a pile of intertwined fat Scrambled eggs too runny Limited healthy options Didn t see yoghurts til we were leaving , There was a poor selection the hot food did not look at all appetising and the room felt quite chaotic and messy If we returned we would definitely not choose to include breakfast 
224967,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, We were walked in on by another guest while we were in bed Our room was rented to someone else while we were still there The guest walked in while we were still in bed The front counter fixed the room issue but we were offered a free drink at the bar There should have been at least a 50 euro credit to be used as we wanted This was highly unacceptable and is why staff was the only below rating , Breakfast food was not good Some of that is just because it is diffetent from what we are used to in US Also bar prices should be slightly less I know things are expensive in Paris but there is no reason to victimize your guests 
224968,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, no lifts to get from main entrance to reception floor we had a pram and we had to bring it via elevator a few times we used lift for disabled people but in order to get it working you need a staff card but there is not always staff around and you also need to go through the back doors and carpark to get to that lift Swimming pool was very outdated and cold It is also a bit of walking to the swimming pool so its not great if you have to walk with small kids as we did , Everything was spotless friendly staff great room very warm
224969,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The swimming pool and changing facilities are quite old and need updating But they did the job and the children had a swim, The staff were very friendly helpful and humourous The position of the hotel for the center of Paris is fantastic and it had parking for 29 Euro a day The room was wonderful with a fab view over the River Seine I cannot recommend this hotel enough Will definitely use it again when we go back
224970,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Very clean and tidy Hotel staff were helpful and the location is great 10 minutes walk from the Metro and Eiffel Tower Also lots of shops and restaurants a few minutes away Great stay 
224971,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Toilet was in the closet whit no lock on the door and no sink on the toilet you had to go to the shower room to wash you hands after toilet business NOT hygenic I booked a room whit view over the river but when we arrived they said they uppgraded my room but they really didnt i think i booked superior whit river view and the uppgrade was to family they said but i see it as a overpayed downgrade whit perfekt view over 2 other buildings and they placed us whit view over 2 other buildings as far away from river view you can imagine And dont bother put the dont disturb sign up they come in your room anyway and do their thing Parts of the hotel really needs some renovations I dont know where the 4stars come frome I ve stayed at 3star hotells that has better standard The rooms are abit overpriced set to the standard even tho its an expensive city , Nice beds Good location Big TV but loss of connection to the eng speeking channels around every 30min 
224972,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, There is an issue with the bathrooms Water damage was very evident from leakage through the shower door onto the floor baseboards carpet Enough that we had to change rooms The staff was very accommodating but two other rooms had a similar issue including the room we changed to Toilet is separate from the bathroom I would recommend a hand sanitizer option you must return to the toilet off the bedroom to wash Sofa bed mattresses need replacing Springs were prominent and uncomfortable for my daughters A little more decoration e g Photos of Paris monuments or scenes would compliment the contemporary and neutral decor Not a complaint but a suggestion based on similar type properties I m used to as a business traveler TV monitor was updated but interface was slow , Exellent location to Eiffel Tower two Metro stations shopping right around the corner This also includes two grocers Mono Prix Marks Spencer a real plus for families to manage food costs and have local conveniences Staff at this hotel are very friendly professional have multi lingual skills The restaurant was satisfactory and the common areas very well maintained Security was always present in lobby area leading to escalators reception Housekeeping did a very good job and kept the amenities stocked for our family Rooms are of good quality and have reasonable features e g outlets no USB refrigerator storage etc but no iron Bathroom space is tight but not unusual to Europe Taxis que is right outside
224973,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Local rule not allowing use of Bermuda shorts in pool resulting in pool being unavailable Rule not understood and could be OK if pre communicated , Location room was comfortable
224974,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, the response whenever you make a complain especially when it s the bathroom that has mildew that is just nasty , The Hotel location is awesome It s with in walking distance to any public transportation taxi bus rail etc the staff was cordial and the security that was in place through out he hotel entrances was great it gave my family a better sense of security
224975,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Property is badly managed The carpets are old and awfully smelly Service is pathetic Breakfast spread not great , The location is good The view from the room was good The concierge was helpful Wifi was excellent 
224976,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The door of the bath room for showering is not good and the floor get wet every time I take the shower, The breakfast is good with the view of river side and it s close to the metro line 6 and just 8minutes walk and 12minutes walk to Eiffel tower
224977,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, There was nothing we didn t like maybe a bottle opener in the room , We arrived over an hour before scheduled check in but that was no problem We had also requested a room with a view and we could not have been happier Top floor with the river and city view fantastic 10 minute walk to the Metro and Eiffel Tower 
224978,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Air in rooms is very dry and stuffy Difficult to sleep because it was so dry The pillows were also not of the highest quality , The staff were friendly and helpful The check in was swift and efficient It went downhill from there 
224979,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Men must wear a Speedo in order to use the pool So we did not use the pool What kind of rule is that No wonder the pool was empty , Great view of Paris Walking distance to the Eiffel tower 
224980,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Had to change to a different room as the first we were given was on the 22nd floor had wet carpets and you could smell the damp I m not sure how long it had been empty but it must have been more than a couple of days Overall the carpets in both rooms as well as the corridors looked a bit worn dirty and in need of replacing Toilet was separate from bathroom and not ideal , Room generally nice with a very comfy bed memory foam mattress and clean bathroom Sofa bed for the kids OK Hotel is in a great location with friendly staff and about 15 minutes walk from the Eiffel Tower Good breakfast worth paying extra as we had kids with us Overall very nice 
224981,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The pool was closed The reception was very slow and unfriendly on both check in and check out The concierge was closed from 6 30pm When we called reception from the room the phone was just left to ring we saw reception also ignoring calls when we were checking out The escalators didn t work the phone chargers in reception didn t work the room was damp with paint coming off the walls The walls were thin and we could hear next door even though they weren t noisy ,No Positive
224982,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The location is OK good for tourists who want the Eifel Tower right around the corner But always consider some 15 20 walking to the next Metro station and some changing to get to places like Louvre Hotel de Ville and so on Annoying was the noise and bass from the club or whatever on saturday night at 3am that was bothering I tried to call the reception twice for some other reasons and never got an answer Furthermore the staff at the reception always seemed a little overwhelmed and too busy At check out they were not responsive at all to my attempt to complain about the nightly club noise , It was a decent room nothing special not bad but also not spectecular 
224983,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The houskeeping not accounting for number of guests in the room not putting any shower gel or shampoo Even when i complained they sent me 1 bottle of each It was a family suite we were 4 , The space of the room that accomodated my family not common for paris
224984,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The shower was leaked and I ask them to look 3 times and always tell me they send the technician to fix but every when I get back the shower was the same , They have a good breakfast
224985,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, I didn t like the fact that hotel staff charged my credit card before I actually arrived to the desk I didn t had that card with me and there was a problem First of all I want to have a full control over MY cards and hand permissions myself I wasn t late This never happened to me before hotels usually wait for customer arrival And I DO ALWAYS USE different cards for safety reasons But thankfully it was sorted smoothly Paris some tourist areas is being close between 14 18 on Sunday for car traffic Which blocks all town Avoid those hours to drive , Very Good centre location Walking distance to The Tower Loads of tourist attractions available in the doorstep Seems to be very safe area Excellent food and service in downstairs coffee 
224986,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The only area needing improvement was the consistency of the maid service The room was always clean but the coffee service items varied as did the water bottle we should have received each day instead of only on the first day , The staff was very accommodating and supportive The location was great The room was very comfortable 
224987,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The bed was extremely uncomfortable Selection of television channels could have been better with more english available , Great location and staff were fantastic

224990,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Checking in took an hour and a half as the Receptionist was trying to tell us that they had no notification of the 10 rooms we booked via Booking com They then found it and slowly checked everyone in They then tried to tell us that they had no booking for a table for 22 for dinner which was prepaid in full A very tiresome person who was very unhelpful and let the hotel down Breakfast too again was fraught as Booking com gave no option to book for breakfast so we came down expecting to pay and was met with the same sullen faces who eventually found somewhere for our people to sit and take breakfast The hotel was great in all other aspects once you get past the staff ,No Positive
224991,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, No comment there r many , Break fast is not at all good for an Indian Costomer Rooms are good but house keeping is not up to the mark as they have not changed toiletery as soap shampoo body wash rtf There were no glass for drinking water the glass which they have kept were disposal Now tell me one thing paying so much amount for room what the service they give In short we can say nothing But overall the Person who checked in me was superb 
224992,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, We can t window open But hotel is so high , That was amazing trip Hotel is very good for us a lot of smile and nice people who work there We have got amazing view from our window at the photo We live at 31 floor

224994,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel,No Negative, When we opened the curtains in our room WOW what a fantastic view of the seine The room was clean and the bed very comfortable we liked that our 15 year old daughter was just out of view around the corner giving her the privacy she needed Highly recommended would stay again 
224995,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, The reception area is spacious modern and the staff welcoming The rooms are a different story altogether We were a family of four the first room smelt of cigarettes We were moved to an alternate room The carpet was heavily stained and old pieces of fruit grapes and apples under the bed was disgusting The bathroom was appalling mould on the ceiling the mirror was falling off the wall the shower door closed but when you had a shower the water leaked to leave the bathroom like a swimming pool The rooms in this hotel are in need of some serious modernisation , The hotels location is fantastic A twenty minute walk to the Eiffel Tower Five minute walk to two metro stations and multiple shops and restaurants It is easy to get anywhere in Paris from this hotel
224996,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Perhaps the swimming pool could be improved by having more relaxed rules I e Not having to wear swimming hats Overall there was nothing that we didn t like though , The property was absolutely amazing We stayed on the 30th floor in a room with a wonderful view The staff were very helpful and welcoming and the room was very clean I will definitely come back as the location is great very central around 8min walk to the Eiffel Tower and right next to a shopping centre I wish I could go back right now 
224997,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Our room was not cleaned and no tea and coffee replenished We took 3 attempts to get what we actually wanted coffee and milk Men can ONLY wear speedo trunks into the pool No shorts They do sell the speedos in the shop Very expensive to drink alcoholic shorts in the hotel 12 for a Bacardi and 4 95 for a coke , Great location Eiffel Tower is 10min walk to the left of the front of hotel there is a huge shopping mall Children eat breakfast free with every adult also the evening meal for children is really good value 9 50 for main course with side dessert and a drink I ate Thai green prawn curry and it was delicious 
224998,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, Nothing I did not like about the hotel amazing but booking combis my problem, Every thing was amazing best location and easy to get around staff very helpful special cause I was over charged 1 room by booking com but now I need to deal with that

225102,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, No bad points except to say that the separate toilet had no wash basin so you had to go to the other side of the room to wash hands in the bathroom The bar did not sell wine but there was a shop within the hotel which did, very friendly helpful staff Arrived at 9am even though we knew we wouldn t be able to access the room the reception staff completed the check in formalities so that upon our return from day sightseeing we just had to pick up the key We were able to leave our bags All very efficient 10 mins from Eiffel Tower
225103,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, There is no elevator on the ground level difficult if you have a pram you will have to call the security and wait until they come and open the service elevator for you that was not comfortable for me some of the reception staff need to learn how to handle the busy times concerige are not open 24 hours In room food service are not available 24 hours Buy something before stores close the batch chair is in a separate place and inside the bathroom the room service and housekeeping staff dont understand english i asked for a teeth paste and they got me tea , The location of the hotel and the view on the river
