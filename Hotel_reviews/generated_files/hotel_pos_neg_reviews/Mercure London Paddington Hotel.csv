51497,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Every thing is too small I had to put my luggage in my friend room as he has bigger one No copourd my cloths always wrinkeled and througn on floor I asked to move me from mine to bigger standard one and I found it the same Sheet sting Not worth money spend for 4 nights , Location only 
51498,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, When I arrived with my adult daughter I was informed that their system was only expecting one person and that it was a double room there was no apology and I felt their attitude was extremely unhelpful especially when my booking clearly stated it was a twin room for 2 adults and I showed that to the man on reception again there was no apology or any offer of discount all that was said was we are fully booked and this is the only room available The bed was a very small double in a very small room I paid a lot for this room so we would be comfortable and well rested for our early start the next day so much for that I would not stay again having been treated poorly by this one staff member who needs to understand the customer is always right especially when they have an email to prove it , Convenient location to Paddington Station 
51499,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Paid for a standard double room but was placed in a very small room on arrival at the hotel Inadequate for purpose after a long haul flight Very off putting and food for thought for future bookings ,No Positive
51500,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The breakfast was at a sister hotel unless you used garfunkel next door bar closed at 10 50 and not 11 00 as stated room was very noisy with air conditioning on and get very small, Location to transport links
51501,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The rooms are fairly dated and small but have everything you need for a one night stay, The staff were excellent I had a package delivered and they went above and beyond receiving and holding it for me They were also very helpful at check in making us coffee and helping us to our room The hotel is incredibly well located by the entrance to Paddington station ideal if you re going to from heathrow and want a base in London
51502,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, I stayed in a standard single room and it was very small I returned to the hotel after a short trip to Europe and booked a double single room which was a bit bigger however it was still really small Funnily enough by the second day it felt very cosy and a nice retreat from the hustle and bustle of London There is no bar fridge Although the hotel is located in a very busy area the windows appear soundproofed and the hotel leaves you earplugs on your bedside table I had no trouble sleeping due to noise The rooms were made up everyday refreshed with clean towels and water bottles and amenity bottles The gym is small but has everything you need Only one treadmill for running so you need to time your visit The lift also broke down during my stay which I personally didn t find a problem Staff happily carried down all my luggage on check out day , This hotel is located right next to Paddington Station Paddington Underground and London buses So easy to get around London and I love Bus 23 which will take you past Oxford St Regent St Picadilly and down to St Pauls Cathedral The breakfast restaurant Garfunkels is very good for both breakfast and dinner There are plenty of pubs and cafes nearby with Tesco a short walk away The hotel also gives you a free phone which has an internet connection I used it every day to check maps directions and even made international calls All free Very very useful and I was impressed The front reception was friendly and helpful There was security in the front lobby at all times As a solo traveller at the end of my visit I found this very reassuring 
51503,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, I did not like the lady from reception who did not understand my situation and was rude and unkindly I specify that next day at the reception it was a girl from Romania who was very kind and it was huge difference of attitude I have booked a room of 20sqm standard tween bed and I have got a SMALL standard room with double bed Lady from the day I have arrived on 1st of July at about 8 pm from the reception did not even bother to treat with understanding and kindness the situation and worse tried nervously to convince me I am wrong She even assumed very naughty that maybe this is my first trip abroad Unfortunately she did not know to whom she had spoken All these happened in front of my young daughter When I have shown her the pictures she separated somehow the beds in the same room She could have done it at least from the beginning without her confusing and misleading words Finally she admitted it was no more availability left I have paid 314GBP through booking com for another type of room but no reaction on that I have not got any penny back , The bed
51504,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Position, Well positioned very close to Paddington Station made it easy to connect after a long flight The facilities are very modest poor beds poor quality and outdated entertainment could not connect to the wifi in my room Its all about position 
51505,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, I was very disappointed in this hotel especially considering it was quite expensive I wanted a full service hotel near Paddington and could not justify the expense of the Hilton The location as all I got The building is dingy the entrance was a walk up and the lobby was miniscule and the service was at best so so The room was tiny barely large enough for two twin beds and was depressisng to stay in I had a one day layover in London and thought it would be more convenient to stay in the city than at the airport Wrong On my next one day stay I took a hotel at Heathrow popped into the city and then back out The airport hotel was half the price of the Mercure was much more comfortable and had a huge lobby overall four times the value besides being cleaner nicer and with more professional staff I am glad I had to endure the Mercure for only one day a longer stay would have been awful , The location near Paddington was its only virtue 
51506,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Room was very small and traffic noisy Fortunately I had my own ear plugs as those provided were inadequate My husband had surgery so we needed a taxi to get to the airport The one booked by the hotel did not arrive so they hailed one from the street that cost us a lot more Room was overpriced compared to previous London accommodation ,No Positive
51507,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Nothing significant The small room size expected in London A little expensive and breakfast extra , Perfect location by Paddington station and restaurants Comfortable if small room 
51508,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The first room was too small for two people and two suitcases , We stayed at the Mercure twice The first time the bedroom was very small for two people but the second time the bedroom was perfect The staff especially Rupinder were very helpful Rupinder went out of her way to help us with the internet general information and giving us an upgrade for the second stay 
51509,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The hotel room was very small given the price we paid We booked a small double room Initially when we arrived we were put in a tiny room with either a very small double bed or a slightly larger single bed pushed up against the wall on one side without any room for luggage We asked to be put in a larger room and the hotel kindly obliged however our next room was only marginally bigger on the plus side the bed was large enough for 2 people Given the cost of the hotel I would have expected at least what I would consider a standard sized room even though this is a busy part of London , The location is excellent right next to Paddington train station and underground Also very close to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park Staff were very pleasant and accommodating Rooms were very clean For a very busy part of London the room was nicely quiet windows must have been sound proofed The shower was excellent 
51510,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, breakfast not included had to pay 10 each for breakfast which was excessive for what was served , Paid 200 for 1 night in a double room Room was small but adequate

51515,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Specifically booked a standard double room but got a very small room instead with hardly any space at all at a higher charge than the booking price on the booking com website A totally useless receptionist who said people have slept in that room before Unhelpful staff tiniest room ever which wasn t what I booked and a non functioning A C summed up my stay ,No Positive
51516,Mercure London Paddington Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly staff very comfy beds Good value for money Modern interior Spacious room and bathroom Very good location across from Paddington station and walking distance from Hyde park and Oxford street Best hotel in it s price range I ve stayed at in London so far definitely coming back

51521,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, In spite of requesting with much advance an early check in I had to get ready for a conference there was no availability That was unfortunate but understandable if all the rooms were in fact full the night before However the hotel did not have any kind of bathroom facility where I could get changed let alone shower and I had to use the tiny freezing and not particularly clean toilets in the basement of the restaurant next door Garfunkel s That was really not a great start for the trip , The members of staff were helpful and in particular the concierge porter The location is obviously very convenient both arriving from Heathrow and to move through London with the tube 
51522,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, We took a double bed beware it is quite small , Took small double room good value for a place just next to Paddington Had all the stuff like kettle hot chocolate soap etc etc Comfortable bed
51523,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The room is really small and I would say it s very similar to a Japanese hotel in Tokyo I understand it s tough to have the hotel right in the excellent location with acceptable rate and good size room I guess you can t have everything you want , Location location location 2 mins from Paddington Station which is the easiest way to and from the airport 
51524,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The room was TINY making it difficult for two people to walk around the room at the same time without bumping into each other The bathroom was also very small but manageable with nice toiletry items The bed was comfortable but the double bed was quite small A couple used to a Queen or King bed would find the size of this bed inadequate We felt this hotel was a poor value for the price of the room , The staff was excellent from check in through check out and holding our luggage The reception staff and housecleaning staff were really great The breakfast was plentiful and good We chose this hotel for its location very close to Paddington Station

51526,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Very limited sitting space in our outside bedrooms Breakfast room is also open to passing trade on busy street , Helpful and friendly staff both in restaurant and reception Although their system did not show the Booking com reservation this was sorted out promptly and we were offered an upgrade from small to standard double and early check in Standard room is still small typical for this part of London but well designed so easy to use and good standard of furnishing Right next to Paddington station but well insulated from noise

51529,Mercure London Paddington Hotel,No Negative, I only stayed one night before I headed for a wedding in Oxford I really liked the convenient location The room was quite small but it had everything I needed for a 1 night stay The location was great just outside Paddington Station and there was access to a fair number of underground trains 
51530,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, No iron ironing board in my room but staff were quick to bring one on request , Very helpful staff rooms a step up from most of the myriad hotels just outside Paddington Station though still typically small London hotel size 
51531,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Rooms a little on the small side , Location ideal for train and bus connections Easy to reach from Heathrow and that is a real bonus after a ten hour flight 
51532,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, There was very little space in the room everything was mostly cramped together The breakfast was very disappointing the buffet table very limited with poor service The croissants were also not pastry just bread with the shape of a croissant , The location is great only a 2 minute walk to Paddington Station 
51533,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, We expected a small room so no complain here Room service was slow busy restaurant kitchen on Saturday evening we were told , Very nice staff we asked for a room in the back and the lady at the front desk really was helpful 
51534,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, very small room air conditioner too noisy terrible breakfast in Garfunkel s booking com reservation did not arrive in system for 12 hours had problems whether breakfast was included etc , near paddington station
51535,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The room was tiny understandably I suppose Ceiling slope meant extra care needed not to hit head Towels were for two but space just enough for one ,No Positive

51539,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Room was a little to small to be described as double There wasn t even room to bring my cat and certainly couldn t swing it , Closeness to Paddington station and tube Value of room
51540,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The room was a bit noisy but there were ear plugs provided Small details were overlooked as if the room had not been used for some time a bit of dust left over and one of the boxes with earplugs was empty , Location was great and staff at the Reception attentive I would stay again mostly due to customer service which is generally an issue in London regardless of the brand
51541,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The breakfast was a real let down all miserable looking staff who kept gettign the orders wrong and was finally served with runny scrambled eggs and really greasy bacon We gave up and Opted for a croissant each instead, The beds are really comfy
51542,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Our room was very small the TV was in an alcove which meant that it could only be viewed from one position Poor planning It was also noisy but that s to be expected on a main street , Would recommend the breakfast omelettes even though it could have been hotter 
51543,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The room was too small and it doesn t worth its value , The hotel is next to the underground and there are a lot of shops around Wifi is free and the speed is fast 
51544,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Lighting in the bathroom Poor for makeup and no mirror in the bedroom as an alternative I am very tall but I would think the average lady would not have seen her face in the flexible mirror, Very good pillows and mattress good for a 3 star hotel
51545,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, there was very little I did not like the bed was too hard for my liking but that s just preference and not a problem with the hotel or its facilities, the location was very good being right outside the tube station exit made it very easy to find The staff were always very cheerful even at the end of a very long day they maintained their helpful attitude which made the stay much nicer
51546,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Being very close to Paddington there was quite a bit of street noise from a busy station I slept well but it not might suit light sleepers who might favour something in a quieter street , Very close to Paddington railway station Friendly staff The room was small but I ve been in bigger rooms and felt cramped A great use of space and low cost room for overnight stay Much cheaper than the Hilton opposite 
51547,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Lift was broken down 3 out of the 4 nights we were there Created a bit of a problem as I had elderly parents with me who couldn t climb the stairs very well The rooms were quite oddly shaped and small even though I selected the larger sized room Not sufficient space to open more than 1 luggage , Great proximity to paddington station where Heathrow express stops Staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful Lift was down when we arrived and one of the male staff helped to bring 4 big heavy luggage up to the rooms via the stairs 
51548,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The single bedroom was very very small Far smaller than the average single room in central London It had everything you needed except space and I looked at a wall having asked for a room with a view The kettle with tea and coffee are always welcome, I did not have breakfast as I prefer to have something later I liked the location and friendly staff The hotel is right next to Paddington station which makes it easy to use the underground and use the Heathrow Express I could also walk to many interesting places There are many good restaurants in the street and that area
51549,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Absolutely tiny room very small apparently they have smaller Lift not working breakfast was in attached restaurant and given a special smaller breakfast that normal customers Not worth the money Better hotels for better price very tired and shabby , Not a lot
51550,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Poor visit this time Normally stay here for work as it s close to my office several of us use this hotel On this occasion however I received some poor service I couldn t get through to order room service after trying for 30 mins I decided to go downstairs to order from reception directly as I was having issues connecting to wifi too I was on the 4th floor and went down in the lift in which I got stuck the lift broke between floors I was in there for approx 15 mins and had to be helped out I received a hurried apology from reception staff who didn t know I had been stuck was told I could order from her for room service and that was it I received no formal apology no discount I wasn t even offered my room service as a gesture nothing I will seriously consider staying here again if this is the poor service on offer the lift was still broken when I left 2 days later , The location is perfect for work I have stayed in this hotel quite a few times now I return as I am always happy with the service

51561,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The breakfast was basic and not served with especially good grace I would not pay for that again Coffee had been in the pot too long and the cold breakfast was basic and uninspiring , The room had a blackout blind Marvellous Why can t all city hotels do this to stop light coming in when you re trying to sleep I was also impressed to see ear plugs provided though to my happy surprise the room wasn t noisy at all despite the location The only noise I got was a loud woman in the room next door Hint please don t shout in hotel rooms

51594,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Bedroom very small we could barely get around the bed uncomfortable hot and noisy Expensive for what it was but I guess that they can charge a premium because they are next to the station Extra cost for breakfast that was in the adjacent Garfunkles , As we were catching a train in the morning it was perfectly placed near the station

51599,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Disappointed pictures looked much more spacious than the actual I could have booked at Hilton for a slightly more comfortable stay My worst experience is to have a really unclean room no details needed there , Its literally walking distance from Paddington station Loads of shops around the area 
51600,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Air Conditioner in the room was leaking water and dripping all night Room carpet was very dirty and dingy looking I was propositioned by a hooker when I got off the elevator on the 2nd floor at 10 pm at night , Excellent and convenient location Front desk staff were very friendly
51601,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Typical London hotel over priced for a tired old building Tiny room They refused us breakfast as they said it was not included in room rate they were wrong but there was no time to argue , Handy for the station 
51602,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, On the first night the Air Conditioner wasn t working and as the small room faced south it was very stuffy even with the window open The next day the staff moved us to a north facing room which was fine , Next door to Paddington Station so position was excellent for access to Underground 
51603,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Not worth the price AC was broken and our room was degraded but our money was not refunded The breakfast was dreadful long wait for a substandard food not up the name of the hotel , The location is decent Rooms were clean 
51604,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, For this price there should be a refrigerator mini bar in the room also breakfast should be included for this price , Great location friendly staff and comfortable bed

51608,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Room was tiny for a couple literally a shoe box we had to get ready for a wedding and no space to move This is a one person room yet there was two of us and it s wasn t worth the price at all Bed was tiny and for one person not two Air conditioning in room was non existence Lift two small as well ,No Positive
51609,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, After reading the reviews we booked a superior room we got a king size bed in a small room The air con was pathetic the free Wi Fi was ok when it worked and the glass we accidentally broke was left for 2 days and so were the shards of glass in the carpet Breakfast was in the adjoining Garfunkel who were more interested in the walk ins than the hotel guests Needless to say we will not be staying here again , Close to Rail Tube and bus services
51610,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The rooms were way too small could not even walk in the room properly , The location of the hotel is excellent and is very convenient to commute via underground 
51611,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Hotel does not have printing facilities or a business centre for business related travellers Rooms were quite cramped, Excellent location and very good staff
51612,Mercure London Paddington Hotel,No Negative, Great location for arrival at Paddington main line or Underground stations Found a room for an early check in Surprisingly quiet once last Tube train had gone Although the restaurant for breakfast is the adjacent Garfunkels this was fine Well equipped and comfy room 
51613,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The hotel is not clean at all Room is old and dirty It doesn t deserve 4 stars or to hold Mercure brand AC is not working They changed the room but still same dirty and very small room It is stated on booking that the size of room is 290 ft which is certainly not true The pictures shown on booking are misleading This hotel should be 2 stars at the maximum I highly don t recommend it , Nothing Never trust Mercure brand again 
51614,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Feels mean to complain about this as it s unavoidable because of the location but it was LOUD And we couldn t open the window due to outside noise so it was a bit hot and stuffy , Lovely room and friendly desk staff
51615,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The executive King room was on the 5th floor and was very cramped Getting in and out of the bed was very difficult as it was so tight The bathroom was a joke being no more than 3 feet wide No window in the bathroom either so very hot All in not good value for money , The bed was comfortable Nothing else was good 
51616,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The cleanliness of the room Executive Room carpet didn t appear to have been really cleaned for awhile I don t think I should have needed to have washed the crockery on a daily basis after the room had been serviced Breakfast was a disappointment connected to a Garfunkels small buffet and cooked selection The hotel didn t appear friendly at all only one member in the reception area smiled let alone said Hi , The location to Paddington Station Hop ON OFF bus and Tube My bathroom seem modern and updated 
51617,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Room wasn t ready on arrival and when we did get in it was very very hot , Location was great for Paddington and breakfast in Garfunkels next door was great

51619,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Size of room for 230 Peculiar sized en suite so tiny I had to get in the bath to turn the tap on Hotel bar shut after show was sent to another hotel 15 minute walk this was closed too the male staff on duty arrogant rude So much money for very little in return Breakfast was really nice Shame about the waiting staff I even received a tutt after ordering an orange juice unless you re a group of 7 guys who came in off the street they were treated very well Also why was the hotel fee reserved 2 days before from my account I use booking com because no money changes hands until I check out , Breakfast
51620,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The walls are too thin that I can hear the mother next door yelling and children screaming, It s just 3 minute walk from the Paddington Station and there re many different kinds of restaurants around the hotel Everyone would find the one that suits his her taste 
51621,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, I would never recommend anyone to stay in this hotel 1 Staff 0 knowledge and they never know how to charge the Pre authorization amount 2 for on shift supervisor i am going to complaint and escalate her to there higher management so that next time she wouldn t behave such behavior with anyone else and let management to give her some training about hotels 3 room are very very very very small you cant ever walk in the room 4 charging high price with 0 service 5 NEVER RECOMMEND TO ANYONE , Nothing to like in this hotel 
51622,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The rooms and bathrooms are very tiny The lift was broken on the third floor and we had to carry our own lugguges up the stairs no lugguges trolley Then why is it a 4 star hote Sometimes the restaurant staff make you feel like you are having their breakfast for free so they treat u differently than those who walk in, Liked the location
51623,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, We invited the standard room that was 20 sq m in the hotel description But we got the room of 12 sg m only , The room was very clean and nicely decorated The toilet was new with a lot of toiletries The bed was comfy

51625,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, micro bed shoebox room size air conditioning blowing air on your face extremely noisy no isolation from the room door with the corridor , location very very close to train station clean 
51626,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, It would be great if all British accommodation could accept that it is warmer at night during summer and not provide heavy bedding Easy enough to remove the doona and use the cover just seems unnecessary , Amazing location Only metres from a bus stop which gave great access to so many places And just 50 metres from Paddington station Spoilt for choice with many different eating places Staff were a highlight as they were genuinely friendly and welcoming 
51627,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, rooms are a bit small but you expect that in London Price was a bit high too, beds were really comfortable and accommodation was close to all amenities
51628,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Very small room tiny bathroom and that was an upgrade Hairdryer in the bathroom Taps and plugs etc in the bathroom needed replacing At least two of the lights didn t work Very hot and air con too noisy to use Biscuits were open and only one pack Pillows were lumpy Very expensive , D cor was ok and bathroom had been recently retiled
51629,Mercure London Paddington Hotel,No Negative, The most convenient location in London Heathrow Express 2 minutes walk away Run in Hyde Park in the morning Great tube and bus links Fast and cheap cab to Oxford Street and West End Quiet rooms despite city location Five minute walk behind the station and you can stroll along the grand canal to Little Venice The rooms are smallish but clean and comfortable and in line with the price much better than Paris and who goes to London to sit in their room anyway 
51630,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The room was uncomfortably hot , The staff were delightful the location to Paddington trains couldn t be better the rooms nice but super super hot How we suffered The air conditioning said 19C but it was at least 25 in that room and we were quite uncomfortable as a result We tried opening the window but the noise was unbearable with the window open Apart from that it was a great stay with warm helpful staff so I hope they can fix the room temperature as the staff deserve a 5 star plus award 
51631,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, No room service after 10pm , Had booked small double Was told I d been upgraded to double Room was fine but small so can t imagine what small double would have been like We arrived back from concert at 10 15 and there was no room service Had to go and find take out Hotel or adjoining Garfunkels could not provide wine either as it was a Sunday Not great for a hotel 
51632,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The staffs are very unfriendly May be I am a Chinese lady from Singapore They do not communicate properly I waited at the lobby after being told that I may only able to get a room till 1pm despite of room available I observed that 1 of a guest got his room once he was at the counter n I got up n approach the front desk ladies n they told me that they didn t noticed that I was waiting for a room It was a lame excuse because I was there all that while I don t think I was that transparent for them to not see me , its location is perfect for solo travellers Transportation are convenient 
51633,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Breakfasts were the worst we had in 6 weeks away Cold food on a hot plate Unimpressed , The location is good for transportation off the Heathrow express and in your room a few metres later
51634,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The wifi didn t work The double room was so small it was difficult to walk around the bed The ensuite was again very small No hot water Only one PowerPoint on the other side of the bed which made it very difficult to put up an ironing board which was a waste of time because the iron didn t work , The staff were very polite 
51635,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, breakfast was disgusting Cold coffee single egg pre cooked bacon and sausage sad soft white toast more like warm bread, Space in mini fridge for own stuff
51636,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Tiniest room I ve ever stayed in especially considering we d been told we d been upgraded Not worth the money , Great location plenty around it late night barman was a particular hero 
51637,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Nothing really , The room is very small Be or prepared for that There is very little room to move Apart from that the place is excellent Nice and friendly staff Clean room Good sized bathroom with nice fixtures and power style shower Right next door to Paddington Station so it s ideal if you need to catch the Heathrow Express 
51638,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, This hotel is 2 star At best It s Fraudulent to claim 4 stars The only elevator holds 3 people maximum The bar is little more than a shelf in the tiny lobby Management refused to meet and explain how they can claim 4 stars Shame on Booking com for repeating this claim See the pictures, Location Very close to Paddington Station
51639,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, the room was extremely tiny with almost no space around the bed Noisy hotel Thin walls and above all we could hear and feel all the tube trains running under the hotel ,No Positive
51640,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Hotel looked good on the Booking com but turned out to be a small room limited Wireless had to jump over the toilet to get to shower Very poor value for money, Location
51641,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The price for what was basically a room the size of a cupboard Couldn t even have the space to open my suitcase properly without blocking a door, Closeness to train station
51642,Mercure London Paddington Hotel,No Negative, Warm welcome Help with the luggage as the lift was momentarily out of service speedy efficient check out Very quiet rooms and spotless well serviced rooms with complimentary mini bar 
51643,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The size of the rooms is ridiculously small there is barely any space around the beds niot sure how to manage 2 cases in a room Breakfast at nearby restaurant is very average , Location is perfect especially if you are travelling via heathrow express 
51644,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The air con while nice to have was way too noisy Room was pleasant but not very roomy , Excellent location next to Paddington Station and the windows were excellent in drowning out the street sounds
51645,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Staff at breakfast grumpy badly organised had to go for my own cutlery come on guy s basics Room was VERY small noisy plumbing meant I heard every time someone went to the toilet or had a shower worst London stay ever , Nothing 
51646,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Air Con was noisy did wake up a few times with it meant room was quite stuffy during the night But could easily be fixed, Good size room great breakfast which was given after we had to wait 30 minutes for our room Staff very accomadating
51647,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, There was no fridge which was frustrating and if the window was open it was rather noisy but apart from that it was fine , Lovely location staff were friendly and the room was small but perfect for myself and my boyfriend as we were out a lot of the time It was comfortable clean and my second visit to this hotel We will be going back 
51648,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The location of the hotel is ok, According to the amount of money that I paid this hotel is one of the worest hotel that I have never been see a hotel like it The Front desk manager wants to talk the amount of one night two times The Staff do not know any things about the different between holding amount and withdrow the amount The chick in and the chick out talks about 1 hour Know I must to wait two weeks to returned my amount for the mistak withdrow by the manager of the front disk My opinion is do not wast your time stay in this hotel becouse may will charge you two times for one night like what happened with me 
51649,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, lift not working key system not working staff didn t seem to care and got pissy when after 36 hour journey from the other side of the world I wanted to get into my room straight away Also annoyed that they had to store bags and help lifting them up and down stairs because their lift was out of order unacceptable, location is good
51650,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Can t think of any , Location is very strategic next to rail station Heathrow Express underground station Food outlets aplenty close by Room that we stayed in was very comfortable quiet and as what was requested during booking 
51651,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Room was very bijou not much room for my one suitcase , Fantastic location if you want to stay near Paddington Station its right next door Pubs and eateries all close 
51652,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The Hotel Lift does not work at all had to climb up and down despite of several complains nothing was done about lift in my full 10 days Stay , Location
51653,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Room on 5th floor has sloping ceiling so awkward for tall person to use that side of bed Rooms are small but quite adequate if you are only using hotel room to sleep , Excellent location if travelling from Paddington Station Freshly cooked breakfast 
51654,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The room was fine for one person for one night but for more people or a longer stay I would go for a larger room The airconditioning was not very effective although the weather wasn t particularly warm , Speed of check in Room available at 11 00 Free WiFi Plenty of towels and toiletries Bed comfortable 
51655,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, We booked a small double room Did not expect it to be that small considering the price More of a cupboard Just enough room to squeeze in a double bed Could only access the bed from one side and no room to open a suitcase Earlier in the week we stayed at the Hilton 5 minutes down the road and had a large newly refurbished room with a great view over London for the same price we paid here at the Mercure , We stayed here as it is next door to Paddington station and easy for us to get to Heathrow
51656,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Hospitality we spent 1 hour to check in at 11pm with 2 small kids the elevetor didn t work during the whole stay we were at the 5th floor I skip the rest , Location
51657,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, We had Booked Two Executive King Rooms from 21st April till 1st May 2016 and again Two Executive King Rooms from 6th May till 10th May 2016 From the very first day till the last day of my second lag stay from 6th May 2016 till 10th May 2016 The lift of the hotel was out of order and Me and handy cap person and my aged wife as well as my two aged sisters had to climb 2 3 floors of the hotel three to four times a day Despite of complaining several time no action was taken by the hotel Yes in my last leg of the stay the hotel did offer us to use the service lift at the back of the hotel IT SHOULD BE NOTED that the service lift is in very miserable and dangerous condition which is NOT AT ALL fit for use AT ALL I have taken some photos of this lift to be forwarded to the respective Law department to bring to their attention I recommend the head management to once in a while go and inspect the conditions of the hotels in the back side for safety and for the safety of the staff as well as for hotel guest THE MOST IMPORTANT thing is that hotel should inform the guest before they check in and before taking payment and they should put a notice in BOLD writing so that in coming guest should know It is very surprising that a simple lift could not we repaired in 21 days despite UK to be known to be one of the advance country of the world Repairing Lift is No rocket science this days and absolutely not for such an advance country like UK The worst part is that the hotel management had no decency to offer any copmanstation to any guest of the hotel for not been able to provide facilities This amount to defrauding and cheating in the eyes of law , Location Only
51658,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, In all our 14 Nights stay the Lift of the hotel never worked and despite of my handy cap ness I had to climb three floors as I had booked the best rooms of the hotel, The location
51659,Mercure London Paddington Hotel,No Negative, The location is perfect to get easy access to London Paddington and the Heathrow Express For the area and proximity to station it s also excellent value for money 
51660,Mercure London Paddington Hotel,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and amazing My room was like a clean and peaceful haven and I had a great sleep The location being soo close to Paddington station but it was still nice and quiet in my room 
51661,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, There was a mix up with the reservation different smaller room type than reserved and no breakfast included Quickly sorted out when I showed them my confirmation got breakfast and moved to a larger room Very noisy with the windows open and keeping cool with the windows closed involves a steady stream of cold air blowing on your face all night I imagine this would be a great place to stay in the winter in the summer not so much , The staff was very gracious and accommodating and the hotel is quite convenient to Paddington station Very quiet with the windows closed even though the environment is very noisy 
51662,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The elevator did not work throughout my stay 5 days I was on the fifth floor more like enforced exercise, The location is ideal for London first timers And transient passengers as it is close to Paddington train station
51663,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, For the second time in 5 stays the elevator was not working However staff carried my large back up to the third floor for me , Great location next to Paddington Station for Heathrow Express
51664,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Nothing , The hotel in 1 min walk to Paddington Station where you can get Heathrow Express The staff is a very attentive and helpful There is a very cozy cafe in a ground floor 
51665,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, It was unfortunate that the lift was out of order but the staff were extra helpful , The proximity to the station and shops and church The friendliness of all staff 
51666,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The guy selling tourist bus tickets inside the hotel will give you face if you don t buy it for him he doesn t take credit card he offer you 2 discount if you pay cash by the way isn t true The tickets cost 32 all over We bought it cross the street and right there is the bus stop , Great location and good breakfast 
51667,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The room was absolutely tiny I could hardly wheel my case in as the space was so tiny The lifts were not working Breakfast was not included with the very expensive already price Overall I think it was poor value for money , The room was very clean 
51668,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Staff were miserable Hotel is so overrated and expensive when in reality is no more than an Ibis standard in their group not a Mercure , Location for Paddington Breakfast was okay 
51669,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Nothing to dislike, I liked the closeness to the Heathrow express at Paddington as the hotel is only a 5 minute walk which was perfect after the long journey from New Zealand plenty bars and places to eat and local shops I would defiantly stay again 
51670,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Was given the wrong room from what we originally booked wasn t able to change as hotel was full Breakfast wasn t that great not much to choose from If you stay on the first floor it s very noisy,No Positive
51671,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, a bit small rooms but quite comfortable fire alarm was beeping with no reason bad soundproof of the rooms, great location value for money clean rooms great breakfast
51672,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Despite being single I booked a Small Double Room Just as well The room was indeed small and I do not think that a couple s marriage could survive even for more than a day in those confines However I accept that we from Australia Canada etc expect large rooms even from mass chain hotels such as Mercure Ibis etc but that is not the way it works in London , Adrian at the Reception was most helpful Internet worked fine 
51673,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Too much noise on the upstairs room I couldn t sleep all night I wouldn t recommend this hotel to anyone , Nothing I had an awful night because in the upstairs room they were doing too much noise ALL night I informed the reception and they did nothing 
51674,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, We got upgraded on arrival to a standard double as we had a small child I d hate to think what size our original room would have been as this was very small , Right next to Paddington Station and tube stop so easy to get to Lots of cafes and restaurants on the same street and a short walk to Hyde park too 
51675,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The restaurant recommended in London Road Brassier was not very good Food quality poor and service not timely Not worth the 10 discount , Location and service Rooms were OK
51676,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Rooms very small indeed Mine had a broken toilet seat and a dodgy hairdryer The desk staff are usually courteous but the staff in the bar are always a bit rude , Location is perfect for Heathrow Express This is why I use this hotel
51677,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, gafunkels breakfast slow cold eggs voucher system from hotel generally below whats expected noise from underground through the building , convenience to station
51678,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The room was very small and the bathroom was extremely small It wasn t an expensive rate for the room and i was only there for one night so this is an observation rather than a complaint It might be worth paying the extra to get a larger room , The room was very modern Good standard of cleanliness in fact the room was spotless The bathroom had the usual toiletries that also included slippers and a bath robe The location to Paddington station was excellent and as i was in the back of the hotel I didn t hear any noise 
51679,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, No cucumber in the cocktail bar In itself completely understandable bud not react to query since this was not corrected on the following night , Genuinely friendly staff
51680,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, If you re planning to wind down by watching TV you ll be bitterly disappointed by the highly inadequate choice of TV equipment in some rooms , Right next to the Paddington Station surrounded by restaurants and pubs Good public transport connections to the rest of the city Slept well despite the noise from the streets and the railway station 
51681,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Nothing specially , The location was amazing just in front of a bus stop and a train station That made connection to the other part of the city easier 
51682,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Receptionists way when I asked for the cot they rejected they received the request from booking The cot was very dirty When I asked for another one they said this is the last one they had The value not match the price The bed size is bery small , Location
51683,Mercure London Paddington Hotel,No Negative, Staff very friendly rooms very clean and comfortable location of hotel is excellent for local transport links Have already recommended this hotel to friends
51684,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Accessibility to have a shower as it was very difficult due to my rheumatoid arthritis to try and climb into the bath This would have been impossible without the help of my daughter The hotel were aware of my circumstances but did not offer to help in any way Did ask reception if it would be possible to use another room just for a shower but were not accomodating , Location location Comfy Bed
51685,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The room was on the smaller side The fire alarm went off late at night possibly because someone was smoking in the rooms Window looking out onto a light well ok if the room is on the upper floors as it was but the back rooms on the lower floors might be much darker Not an issue if you staying here just to catch an early flight though , A 2 minutes walk from Paddington station so ideal for an early morning train to Heathrow the trains to the airport are frequent and fast 15 to 20min depending on terminal so staying in that hotel is a good alternative to the airport hotels especially as it is just minutes away from central London s restaurants and attractions The room was very quiet at the back of the hotel and the bed comfortable with a choice of pillows including down Checking in and out was quick and fuss free Plenty of places to eat on the hotel s doorstep 
51686,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The fire alarm went off twice the night I stayed at this hotel first time at midnight and second time around 1am When I called the reception to ask what was going on the answer I received was this is a false alarm and as I told you the first time the alarm went off there is no problem I had to explain to the person answering the phone that perhaps there was no fire but there certainly was a problem given that I was a paying customer staying at an hotel being woken up in the middle of the night by fire alarms It s great that we live in a time where quality matters and differentiates it would be good if the hotel management would follow this up with customer soft skills training because I felt no empathy from the personnel dealing with this issue , The bed was very comfortable and outstanding location 
51687,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The fire alarm went off twice once at 12 30 and once at 1 00 a m Couldn t get through to Reception on the phone to find out what was going on In the morning they told me that other guests had been smoking which set off the alarms Broken sleep as a result , All fine very small room but I did book a small double for one person Good location for an early train from Paddington Would have been quiet as well if the fire alarms hadn t gone off 
51688,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, no issues what so ever other than the guy at the front desk told me to go left instead of right but just means I got to sightsee a little more , location off the Heathrow Express was incredible usually hotels in that location are road weary this one is top notch 
51689,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Fire alarm scared me at night but they apologize The rooms small but comfy small hotel , Opposit paddington tube station bus stop in front of the hotel food everywhere around the hotel hydpark walking distance edgwar road walking distance and st mary hospital where I came for five minutes walking tour bus stop in front of the hotel staff friendly 
51690,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Wasn t much not to like although we don t know how much a Standard room normally costs compared to a small double but on this occasion we def got VFM , We had booked small double but got upgraded to a Standard room Stayed in an awful lot of hotels over the years including London and the quality and facilities were definitely above average All the extras including flannels and dressing gowns 
51691,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Struggled for 2 hours to get an iron brought up to room Noisy neighbours in hallway 5 30am not unsurprising given proximity to station for early trains, V handy if you want something relatively cheap for London are arriving late at Paddington
51692,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Rooms are small but it s London Lower floors you can feel hear the tube below you and a few sirens as its right by s hospital they give you free earplugs though , Front desk staff were great room was a bit noisy and they moved me and bags in seconds
51693,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Couldn t fault it, Excellent helpful staff location very useful next to Paddington station Room was spacious and very clean we upgraded and the bathroom was large too with an oversize bath Also good range of independent restaurants within 5 mins walk offering a good range of food
51694,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The rooms was so so small double room was too small for us and noise everyday morning but j don t know from where I will never stay in this hotel again becouse I paid 268 pound for nights which did not worth 100 pound It was a very big disappoint for me and for my neice , Location only
51695,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, We are not sure if it s true due to safety regulations in the UK though We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights Afterwards we went off to Sheffield for 3 days We planned to come back to London 3 days later then leave the country going back home We wanted to store our luggage one piece only at the hotel but they told us not possible to store it for over night We had to store this at the Paddington station for 3 days and spent some extra 27 quids We do not know if it is always like this in the UK In Japan we have no problems doing so , The location is superb It s only across the street from the Paddington station And the bus stop is near by The breakfast was great Pretty dining area and warm staff 
51696,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Staff where poor My Mum booked this hotel for me and my partner and paid for it up front but the staff did not listen and wanted us to pay for the room again and then return my Mum s payment which she had paid 2 months before the trip They appeared to have no common sense and no I would not say here again ,No Positive
51697,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, We would have used the bars and possibly the gym but we weren t advised by the reception staff where they were , The room and bathroom were clean and tidy The surrounding area was pleasant 
51698,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, They lost my reservation I had to wait for 20 minutes for their reservation office to retrieve it Although I reserved one of the largest rooms it is a bit small , Next to Paddington station You can easily go to anywhere in London from there 
51699,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, The room was very small but I can deal with it because the location and friendly staff My problem was the cleaning crew chatting and laughing loudly outside of my door every morning that just bothers me so much as I tried to sleep in on a Saturday morning after long week working in London It happened again Sunday morning I gave up I had no idea what they were saying because I didn t understand their language so I couldn t laugh with them , The staffs and location are big selling point for me It s right by Paddington station which is perfect for traveling anywhere taking the underground train or Heathrow Express to the airport just perfect 
51700,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, Some people might object to the train rumbling sound but we quite liked it , Comfortable bed really excellent shower Pleasant staff and we were able to leave our bag there both before and after checkout and check in The location suited us as we come into Paddington station There is a Garfunkels attached to the hotel which does a good breakfast at a reasonable price 
51701,Mercure London Paddington Hotel, On Friday the 29th me and my partner came to London to celebrate her 21st birthday we booked with the Mercure due to location and it s modest views it cost us 120 pound which to me for London is adequate for a 4 star hotel with breakfast However no where did it say there was no bar which was disappointing as it s on he pictures online the lift wasn t working which to be fair they offered to take our belongings upstairs for us that s not a major issue We could see they were having works done on the hotel that s not a problem it was the safety of the guests When we got back from the there we had to wait at the bottom of the stairs well a builder was chipping away at the glass with no cover what so ever it was falling on to the stairs it quite easily could of been someone s face also the banister was that lose on the stairs it come off when I mentioned the stairs all the member of staff did was kick it back in We then went to bed where next door a young child was crying for the best part of 2 hours and I get young babies cry but why put a young couple next to a family and children I called reception two times and no answer After listen to the child we eventually went to sleep The next morning we were provided with breakfast by garfuncals and was appalling the bacon was dry we had a spoonful of beens and the tomatoes were cold We did mention it and was offered another but we went else where When we got back to the hotel to collect the thing they then baracaded the stairs off and said lift only which to me I was dubious as it was down 3 hours before the place just looked like a building site Considering I was trying to make my partners birthday her 21st special it was ruined by the hotel Paying 120 pound for just a room and a rubbish breakfast is awful you go to places like London for the experience What was I paying for you had no bar or restaurant , location
