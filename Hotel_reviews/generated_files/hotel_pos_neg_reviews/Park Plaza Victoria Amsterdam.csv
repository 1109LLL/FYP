306918,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Disappointed that the hotel was having renavations carried out and unable to use main reception Room keys not working and therefore had a member of staff have to access rooms each time ,No Positive
306919,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Nothing really they charged us for a meal which we didn t have However as soon as I said it was a mistake they took it off the bill This is not the first time that this has happened to me in Amsterdam I don t think that they have anyway of checking that you are the occupier of the room you are buying the meal on Now there s a tip for you , The bed was huge and was extremely comfortable The room was modern and clean and the bathroom was excellent The location was great just opposite the main station It was within walking distance of everything really 
306920,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, When we were staying there was building work going on above us So if you ve had a late night then this is so annoying as they started from he beds are very comfortable 7 am and we could not get any sleep due to the bangs and the noises I really think they should start from 10 am onwards However I m pretty sure the building work is not going to be there forever , Location is great Friendly staff Roms are clean and the beds are very comfortable 
306921,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, First they gave us a room on first floor which was very dark Electric kattle was not working properly sink drainage was blocked For water bottle you have to pay 5 Euro where as in other hotels of this value you get complimentary , Location was good After first night complaint got better room for secondnight 
306922,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Unfortunately there is a fair bit of renovation being completed and because of this we were disturbed on our last day in the morning by work being completed Mini bar facilities are just too expensive , The hotel is in an excellent location Staff are polite and helpful The room itself was good The bathroom although very clean and presentable watch a touch too small too Sauna and swimming facilities are A class 
306923,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, A little inconvenient to take two different elevators to get to the room but not a big deal , Location was perfect Room was a good size and very functional with a comfortable bed 
306924,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Behavior of one employee from reception during phone discussion regarding double charge but at the end the accounting department solve the issue promptly , Nice hotel great location friendly staff 
306925,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Nothing really The hotel was under construction at the time but it did not interfere or affect our stay in any way , The hotel is located just across the Canal from the main train station It is therefore right next to the canal boat tours and a short walk to other sights The included breakfast was very good 
306926,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Long walk from reception up two lifts to get to the new wing Also a unique bracelet went missing from the room reported to reception and security but wasn t found , Really comfy bed nice hotel 
306927,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Only thing i can say was the room service took an hour after what they said woukd be half hour , 3 seconds away from the train station at the centre very big building rooms were spacious beds where comfy 
306928,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam,No Negative, The location is perfect just beside the train station The reception is extremely helpful with some troubles we encountered on the train Room is cozy with big space and comfortable beds 
306929,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Noisy construction in the Hotel The hotel seems to be going through renovations right now and the the noise will start from the early morning I had a nightmare trying to sleep, The Hotel location is superb right next to the central station and near all the shops and restaurant
306930,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The property seems to be undergoing a renovation which we weren t informed of The reception is dark and dingy and it doesn t seem like you re stepping into a 4 star Hopefully this is temporary , This is by far the most conveniently situated hotel in Amsterdam Right where the fun begins The first hotel you spot as soon as you walk out of Centraal Station The room was comfortable The bathroom was small but clean which is all that matters to us 
306931,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Bed was comfortable but the plastic lining on the madrass made it warm and sticky , Great location for us New and crisp Good recommendations for activities and restaurants 
306932,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Badly maintained expensive poor linen creaky floors steep steps very very old dripping faucets in bathrooms Not worth even 50 a night , Location Nothing else at all 
306933,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Room was next to the ice machine which at times was noisy Also near the lift also noisy Solved this problem by running the air conditioner for some white noise to cover the sounds I got a huge surprise when I checked out with the cost of a local call of 4 minutes costing me 23 euro So beware even though I asked if it was a local call and was told yes they did not tell me that it would be so pricey Lesson learnt Hotel entrance was down a little alley as there is major construction going on in the old part of the hotel This meant you had to lift suitcases up 5 stairs if no one was there to help you to get to reception which was very small and when busy very long waits , The bed was bigger than a king but the doona was not big enough to go over the sides The staff were nice Problem solved by asking for another doona which was supplied 
306934,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Because of the renovation in progress guests have to climb through 2 stairs plus a connecting bridge to access their rooms Air conditioning permanent noise even when OFF had to put a towel inside the hole The r ception staff did not act upon my request was supposed to send someone no communication no message under the door, The concierge was VERY helpful The neighboring Art Hotel s Sauna and interior pool are open to the Park Hotel guests 
306935,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Room wasn t fully cleaned prior to our stay Hotel was having work done which we weren t informed about prior to our visit Didn t replenish our tea and coffee in the room even after we asked ,No Positive
306936,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, There are two parts in the hotel one has older and very traditional decorated rooms which actually are less clean and one has the newer and modern rooms which are actually quite nice As a result of the ongoing building activities in the hotel there are some minor annoyances to be expected i e signage towards the new rooms The door from the breakfast room being open and flies coming in to enjoy the buffet before I could wasn t a good thing ,No Positive
306937,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Nothing The hotel is under some renovation so I think the hotel will maintain its excellence , Fantastic hotel I arrived to celebrate my 30 birthday and chose park plaza and the hotel did not disappoint The bed is comfort Breakfast is excellent with good hot and cold choices The gym and the pool are very good Staff is so nice and helpful The hotel sent to my room some chocolate and a baloon as a birthday gift The view from our room was fantastic We will return for sure 
306938,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Hotel was undergoing renovation It should have been informed to me at the time of booking I faced lot of difficulty including foul smell I would not have booked had I known it earlier Its highly unethical and fraudulent So much money is charged by the hotel and this kind of fraudulent behavior is displayed, courteous staff
306939,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Hairdrier wasn t very powerful Major Building works were in progress However we were not pre warned before our stay , Excellent location Comfortable and clean beds Wouldn t stay anywhere else in Amsterdam 
306940,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, This was the most expensive hotel of my two month tour of Europe but it was worth it , Easy walk to the Centaal Station great neighborhood friendly staff and A facilities 
306941,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The hotel is undergoing refurbishment and even though it is not really felt there is a long and arduous walk from the reception to the room involving two lifts and long corridors I am sure this will be sorted out soon The hotel is in a very central location and so there is some noise from the street at night in the rooms facing the street Breakfast could have been included for the price we paid which was not cheap but in line with prices for quality accommodation in Amsterdam , A very pleasant hotel in an excellent location just opposite the central station and within walking distance to all major sites The room was spacious and comfortable 
306942,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Hotel in process of refurbishment which took the edge off the experience The swimming pool was Out of Order Rather disappointed Got locked out of our room on second evening as Key Cards only encoded for just one It is our 20th Anniversary and we stayed in the hotel around that time and this was supposed to be a special treat for my wife , Staff service levels where excellent

306945,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The room was not ready that afternoon and the wait at the front service desk was a bit too long twice , I was bumped up to a better room because my room was not ready so I have no complaints 
306946,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Nothing I wish I could have stayed longer , Great location very modern and nice rooms and extremely help and pleasant staff Also the atmosphere vibe in the restaurant and bar was very happy and inviting 
306947,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Unfortunately the property is undergoing major renovations so not all facilities and lifts are available It is great to see this iconic hotel undergoing major refurbishment and I would be very keen visit to enjoy all the changes We found our original room in the older wing run down and unsuitable When we discussed this with the staff we were moved to a room in the urban wing Staff were extremely helpful and polite during this change and we were offered a complimentary drink , The location was great however this area is very busy with people moving to and from Central station bus lines trams canal traffic Tour groups meet outside this iconic hotel so be prepared We were moved to a room in the urban wing which was very clean and comfortable with magestic view out to Central Station and the canals All the staff at the hotel were super friendly helpful and attentive Overall we were extremely happy with our stay here 
306948,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The room was dark and no reference to my request to have a frint facing room for ne night The safe did not work and the tea and coffee making condiments had no milk , Location and staff were helpful and friendly
306949,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Hotel under renovation and we were not warned Received unsolicited telephone calls each morning and our rooms were not cleaned until very late in the day We will not be back,No Positive
306950,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The air conditioning did not work as well as we would like to This was a small inconvenience which we overcame by opening the window in the night and it did not erode the overall positive experience we had with the hotel , I liked Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam and would recommend it for several reasons 1 The location was excellent This applies to those of us who do not wish to spend too much time and effort navigating in search of the booked accommodation The hotel was located opposite the Amsterdam Central Train Station and all it required was a 5 minute walk from the station to reach the hotel The options for shopping and dining was plentiful in and around the vicinity of the hotel and this offered unparalleled convenience 2 In my interactions with the hotel service staff be it the front desk or the concierge they were consistently courteous helpful and professional in the way they carried out their duties We were also delighted when the hotel prepared a small but lovely surprise for my partner and I as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary in Amsterdam They also paid attention to our requests on Booking com and onsite and all of these made us felt very welcome 3 The Executive King room was spacious and the view was great The bed was comfortable and the hotel provided high quality bath robes and sandals 
306951,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The hotel is right opposite the Train Station Good location but a very busy area which I didn t really like The bedroom was nice but quite dark as it faced the lane way to the side of the hotel ,No Positive
306952,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The corridors to the old wing are a bit off putting but I know you are refurbishing so hope this is something you aim to change The floors throughout this wing are stained and bumpy , The breakfast was excellent lots of choice and plenty of it The staff friendly and helpful We had to change room as the first was not what we had booked the staff were very quick and helpful in changing this and sorting us with another room Couldn t ask for more
306953,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, A little confused initially trying to find the room but staff very helpful , Great location straight across from the train station within easy walking distance to everything Very comfortable room with all mod cons 
306954,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The coffee machine in the room was difficult to use which was the only problem we had during our stay, It was a fantastic location and the room we were allocated was excellent thank you x
306955,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Long walk to room No view Unable to have breakfast at 6 30 Saturday when leaving for an early flight as breakfast didn t open until 7 No outside smoking area Would have been nice to have tables outside of hotel to smoke and have a coffee, Lovely staff great location 2 mins from station room ready a lot earlier than expected Great concierge helpful with booking trips and transport to airport Room in urban suite lovely Great bed soooo comfy fab breakfast and room service Definitely recommend and will stay again If you re taking taxi from and to airport get hotel to book as alot cheaper
306956,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The room we got on the first night was small very dated we looked out at 3 walls there was a loud generator sounding noise We rang down to move or pay for an upgrade we were told they had nothing for the first night but would change us for the second night into an executive suite I asked how much and they said it would be free great Went down the next morning to be told that nothing was on the system I explained so the lady gave us a different room in the upgraded section of the hotel with a King Size bed ok that s grand They said by the time we get back our room would be ready and they would transfer our bags from the old room to the new one We had to ring reception 3 times to get our bags it took roughly 2 hours The room on the second night was lovely modern airy looked out onto a side street but 600 we were very disappointed at the room they originally gave us IF you have an option to upgrade before your arrival I HIGHLY recommend you to do it as the old rooms are old , The gentlemen at the concierge desk were fantastic nothing was a problem They were so helpful and informative Reception bar area pool area s are really nice and modern 
306957,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Pool was very small and kind of chemical too much chlorine, Top location near Amsterdam Central Urban room was perfect and everything was brand new Bed is like heaven Personnel is quite busy but always responsive and friendly 
306958,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The rooms were slightly small as international travellers we had a big and small bag each but nowhere to have them open , The location was perfect across the road from Central station a 10 min walk from the Adam Square and shopping area as well as the Red Light district 
306959,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Older building under construction Had an issue with housekeeping throwing away a shopping bag that had original receipt and tax form that my fianc e and I had to spend an entire morning resolving and the hotel did not do much to help rectify the situation , Convenient location
306960,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The construction and renovations were terrible we had to take two elevators and walk a long winding narrow and dirty hallways to reach our room on the second floor It is like a maze we followed the arrows to the Urban Wing every time we came in and got out to the street It was depressing Had we known that we would not have made reservation at this time with this high price of 250 night , The location the rooms are clean the new bathroom 
306961,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, It s a tourist spot so every time you walk into the hotel or walk out there s loads and loads of people standing right outside the hotel entrance That was rather annoying because it meant having to walk on the road where all the bikes are constantly coming passed or struggling to get through passed all of the people Hopefully it s doesn t happen everyday Because I m sure to go back to the hotel and this didn t ruin the experience , The location is amazing it s got the perfect surroundings to make it a good holiday Close to Dam square red light district bakeries and coffeeshops The staff put a happy birthday balloon in my hotel room along with a big bottle of water and some chocolates on my birthday which was lovely and kind of them 
306962,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam,No Negative, Beautiful hotel and luxurious room Staff were very welcoming and friendly couldn t of asked for better customer service Great location and perfect for a mini break would highly recommend 
306963,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, there is construction going on and was very disturbing though our room was changed when we complained but this should have been mentioned earlier, location can t be better
306964,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam,No Negative, Great stay renovations were taking place at the time but we were out all day so it didn t really bother us Decor was dated but that was obviously being dealt with Great room well done
306965,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Nothing , Hotel was close to the main station Facilities were excellent Parts of the hotel are being refurbished Staff were friendly and helpful I got a great deal on the room price I have been to Amsterdam about 10 times and always wanted to stay there 
306966,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The bathroom I get it is a older hotel but the tub area was icky , The location is unbeatable Three staff was super helpful Concierge was great The room faced some of the canals and Amsterdam central The sauna and spa area has to be one of the best I ve come along
306967,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, They are doing renovations on the hotel such as painting around my entry door It was a little bit of a hassle The public areas are still in need of refurbishment ,No Positive
306968,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The beds were very uncomfortable The TV was difficult to use and we couldn t book a movie The first room we had had wet carpet so we were moved rooms to the new section The room was very dark We called house keeping for an extra pillow and a spare doona and were told no pillows and the blanket never came There was renovations going on through the entire building it was really noisy they kept working with drills and jack hammers until 6pm one day I hope they renovate the new section as well because the rooms are very black and red it s depressing , The position and the breakfast were great The room service was quick and delicious The staff were helpful and polite except the first girl who checked us in The pool was very cold but nice after a long flight We were given free breakfast for the carpet being wet for the first night The rooms are huge 
306969,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, I normally stay at the Crown Plaza but that was fully booked so this was the next best thing but this is not a 4 hotel At the Crown Plaza you get a good breakfast if your paying for breakfast I d expect the food to be cooked to order Not a buffet which is dry and cold the selection was so limited Perhaps the Dutch believe that everyone eats scrambled eggs chicken sausages over cooked bacon and beans The cereal had a limited selection and 2 options of pastry s I asked the waitress if it was possible to have Porridge because I wanted something healthy light and she laughed and said no I didn t realise I said something funny There was one small toaster which only takes two slices of bread at a time and you do it yourself which was a bit of wait as there was a queue The room itself was okay they had options for coffee tea in the bedroom but nothing free like bottle of water or biscuits go with your hot drink , The good thing about this hotel was the location It was opposite the main Central Train Station I asked about the parking nearby and I was given a postcode for a secure underground car park Please note there is no free parking with the hotel They also have a small gym which does have a good facility s I e treadmills bikes and weights bench up to 100kg arms and shoulders Also a small pool but this more for couples who want to left alone for privacy you can t do lengths due to it s size 
306970,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We would not open our balcony door as it had been screwed closed and having no other window in the room we would not get fresh air into our room which was very warm during the day Looking out was great but there are nets draped over the balcony to stop birds from sitting on the railings and I felt even more closed in and it actually spoilt the lovely views The bathroom shower should have a glass shower door and the old shower curtain should be removed as the bathroom was lovely except for that ugly shower curtain , The hotel is in the best position to catch all for public transport Canal cruises bicycle rentals trams busses and trains Within close walking distance to all shops bars coffee shops and a lot of the attractions The staff were all friendly and extremely helpful Our rooms were neat clean and very spacious The bed was very big and super comfortable We overlooked the train station and canal which always makes for good crowd watching TV channel selection was good The heated pool was marvelous and a great treat We ate dinner in the hotel and the meal was excellent in presentation and taste Breakfast we did not have as we chose to seek such else where each morning but we did sit out on the pavement terrace from time to time having a drink while catching a breath between all our many activities This hotel is a must 
306971,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Old carpets and strange layout of the building The property was very expensive considering it clearly needs refurbishment My room was ok and had a nice view but the price made it difficult to live up to , The staff were very helpful and friendly The location was pretty good and very convenient for people travelling to Amsterdam by train 
306972,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam,No Negative, Everything was amazing the staff were so helpful and lovely and the room was exceptional I was very impressed by the swimming pool and gym and the room was always so clean thanks to the cleaning staff The location is just perfect I can t fault this hotel
306973,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, This is a popular area plus with commuters that is very crowed around the hotel, While an older hotel it still retained a certain elegance Nice large room Very nice wait staff at breakfast The concierge Igor helped me find a laundry a restaurant and sold me tickets to two tours He explained the tram system as well If arriving by train it is a three minute walk from Centraal Station
306974,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Nothing it was great place to stay , Was great location to town and Train station room was clean tidy the beds were comfy and clean too all facilities were great Highly recommend 
306975,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Can be a bit loud given the foot traffic to from Amsterdam Central When I was there Ajax was playing Man U for the European Cup and it was crazy But good crazy , Excellent location across from Amsterdam Central Station and close to Dam Square It is a classy place and sometimes you can find a good deal on line 
306976,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Room feels old and has a musky smell On the second night i have to request for room to be clean trice and made a trip to the reception twice to follow up I then just requested for fresh towels to be send instead as it was already late at night at 10pm And fresh towels came only 30 mins later Breakfast was very minimal Other than convenient location choose other hotels instead , Convenient location just infront of central station
306977,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The hotel is quite old and it gave the impression that it s not very clean On one of the day I was there housekeeping didn t clean my room completely They didn t throw out the trash in my room So there doesn t seem to be a lot of attention to details You would expect more considering it s quite expensive Also the shower is not great Basically I think you are paying for the location Don t expect much for the room , The location was great 
306978,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The staff were polite however on Saturday evening we asked if we have breakfast with our booking they check and confirmed to us that we did have breakfast Sunday morning we provide our room number to the lady before going to sit and she says that we do not have breakfast we go back to the front desk to be told No we do not have breakfast included We were also not the only guests that had been told the same late Saturday evening , The location was excellent straight off the train and into the hotel Walk able to all major tourist locations 
306979,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam,No Negative, Very good location so easy to access from Schiphol Airport via train as it is directly across from Centraal Station Short walk from Red Light District and various other attractions 
306980,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, interior room lighting was terible dull bulbs Bathroom was inadequate for two people and there as a major step up to get in to it my wife has a slightv handicap with steps and jit was very awkward ,No Positive
306981,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, There was obviously a lot of work being carried out within the hotel and assume are being modernised a couple of floors were out of use due to work being carried out the rooms were a bit dated but very clean the staff and bar area was very pleasant although during parts of the day there was an awful sewer smell which spoilt few moments, The hotel is a beautiful building and the bed was very comfortable
306982,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Glue smell Rubbish shower Noisy Bad hair dryer All for 260 PN Why do some hotels insist on hairdryers where you have to keep your finger on the trigger Worst thing however their systems were down at check out and she wanted me to write down my card details on a bit of paper , Friendly concierge Bed comfortable Room quite large
306983,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We were charged two bottles of water which we didn t consume which would mean when the room was prepared for us to occupy the minibar was not properly checked by the staff We didn t scrutinize our bill at checkout so it s also our fault Having said that if things were always done perfectly we wouldn t have the need to check would we This is not a complaint nor a negative and didn t mar our stay at Plaza Victoria We will come back to stay when we next return to Amsterdam , Staff are helpful and engage guests with professionalism The location is clearly the major draw The room is well appointed and the bed is surpremely comfortable for us 
306984,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Superior rooms are not good changed to an Urban room which are much more modern Building work at the hotel started at 7am every morning very noisy , Staff very friendly
306985,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Crowded people due to its location but it was okay, Location It is close to everything and especially to central station Some of staff are super nice 
306986,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Our room was really old and tatty And it wasn t the cleanest I understood the hotel was under construction To improve the hotel but didn t get told that before we booked And we were in the old room it wasn t with the money per night The condition of the room I would stay at this hotel again Just a shame we were in one of the tired rooms hopfully all rooms would have been re done for future trips x, The hotel was perfect location Staff fantastic very helpful
306987,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Not one to moan however on this occasion I was very disappointed I found the staff were not helpful and on numerous occasions came across very rude We also had a member of staff let there self into our room when it had the Do Not Disturb Sign which is unacceptable It is not good value for money and I certainly will not be returning to this hotel There was also construction work taking place which we was not made aware off , Beds were very comfy and I liked the layout of the room That s about it 
306988,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Nothing all good, Great dinner and wine in the evening Held two Breakfast meetings and the staff were considerate and gave great service Lovely breakfast with delicious coffee
306989,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Some bar and restaurant furnishings were a bit tired I was expecting a great breakfast due to the cost and while it was good it was nothing special, Staff were always happy to help Wonderful pool facilities Modern Bedroom bathroom Great location Would definitely recommend to our friends just the perfect base for our break in Amsterdam
306990,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, I walked right past the entrance could have been better signposted with the hotel name, Perfect location just over the road from Amsterdam Centraal Comfortable room friendly and helpful staff 
306991,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The room I got was old and fashioned as a wooden two floor attic which made it uncomfortable as I had to use the steep stairs to get to the bedroom the overall space was cramped albeit clean The bathroom was very small and the pillows were somewhat flat Meanwhile the reception staff were polite but not very friendly and welcoming with the exception of the breakfast staff who were nice and accommodating For 350 Euro per night the price is too expensive for the experience , Very convenient location from the Central station 
306992,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, 50 of the hotel is partitioned off for refurbishment and this includes both the main lounges and the whole of the restaurant and breakfast area Breakfasts are crammed into the former brasserie area hot and cramped Ask for tea and your given a cup of hot water tea bag and sachet of milk powder The hotel toaster is a two slice domestic cheap item that can t cope Disgraceful situation , Nothing
306993,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, My room supposedly an executive room was old and tatty and the bathroom was very small and was also old It was actually a really odd room with 3 single beds and felt much more like a dormitory than an executive hotel room I felt the hotel was very overpriced for the quality of the rooms , The reception concierge staff were friendly and the breakfast was nice 
306994,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Bedroom and bathroom are very small carpet was very dirty and stained Bed sags before even laid down my body I only weight 160 pounds No coffee machine they only provide instant coffee And the coffee tray was dusty Wash bath towels were very low end product only a little thicker than gauge Would be nice to provide free bottled water like the nearby DoubleTree hotel where my friends stayed , Excellent location within 5 min walking to central train station and restaurant Its onsite restaurant food was very good too 
306995,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The room was a bit dear for only sleeping and getting ready Mini bar should be included with hotel price which states on booking and no dressing gowns slippers which was also stated things were ticked on the booking but doesn t mean your entitled to it without paying extra, Fantastic location staff very friendly
306996,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, I expected a modern posh hotel for the price Our room was what I would call vintage and it grew on me in no time , We had a beautiful view of the train station the canal and all the people going to and fro The bed was super comfy and there were extra pillows to chose from 
306997,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Windows in superior rooms are fixed I mean it is not possible to open is The air condition is outdated and smelly , Hotel staffs are polite flexible and helpful Double rooms are excellent 
306998,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, WIFI connection is not so good too expensive, location is perfect staff is friendly let me checked in 4 hours early great service good room iron and ironing board are provided in the room
306999,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam,No Negative, The manager Marie Angelina was the best and most helpfully manager I have ever had contact with as we wasn t happy with our initial room however the resolution to our problem was instant and no issue at all a pleasure to stay in there hotel with the best location and views from the room
307000,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, When booked it said breakfast included arrived no brekfeast Cost of room per night used a bottle of water got 5euro bill Very upset over cost but no frills, Bed was comfy excellent view from room
307001,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The downside is that the gets very noisy outside so if you are a light sleeper you may have some issues , The location was great really close to everything and central station They are also in the middle of renovations so the hotel is going to improve in the future
307002,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, It was during the busy tourist season and the streets were very very busy, We booked the hotel because we wanted to be near Amsterdam central it worked perfectly
307003,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Room is a bit outdated For the price we paid expected better furnished room , Excellent location The Amsterdam Central Train station is just opposite and it s a great base to explore the city 
307004,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Hotel is looking a little tired and needs freshening up to decorations We were in Amsterdam for Kings Day which was an experience although from a tourist point of view on a limited city break this was a wasted day as the large shops and most tourist attractions were closed , Well located hotel with friendly staff
307005,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Room decor slightly more dated than I thought Construction work was going on which was a little disruptive at times Also as we were situated in the old part of the hotel we had to walk across the hotel to get to the swimming pool as it was in a different building , Spacious room and excellent location Room was kept clean Overall it was a comfortable stay 
307006,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We requested a quiet room in advance however still received a room facing the street in addition we stayed in the urban wing new wing and our room had a radiator pipe which kept making noise which was mentioned when we went to dinner and when we came back the problem persisted and changed rooms during the night , The concierge team did a fabulous job in all of the recommendations positive attitude The location of the hotel is perfect and easy to find just infront of the station The room was clean 
307007,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Housekeeping might be better in service and prompt demands , Hotel manager solved the problem immedietly our first room was an uninspected room and was not clean 
307008,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Bed was just okay , Location is excellent Right across the street from Centraal Station Our room overlooked the square and was great I would definitely go back 
307009,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We were in room on the fifth floor There was a constant noise above us It sounded like a tank filling up with water Think we were unlucky with room It was the only negative experience we had , Breakfast really nice Great selection of hot and cold foods Staff very friendly and helpful 
307010,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We were not advised before travelling by either Booking Com or the hotel that there is an ongoing refurbishment of the whole hotel Noise of drilling and hammering started just after 7am on the first morning and when we complained to the Manager we found that they were drilling out a metre of concrete in the basement to fit in a crane The facilities are somewhat limited at present with no real residents lounge just some chairs in the lobby The location could not be more Central but because all the tour coaches drop off and pick up outside it is often difficult to make your way through the crowds standing outside to actually get to the hotel door , We found all the staff to be very friendly and were pleased to have received free upgrades to Executive Rooms after having to complain about the noise from the building works in the Hotel See below 
307011,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The concierge area was impossible to get through which you needed to get in and out as large tour groups just took over with their baggage and no one from the hotel seemed to be able to get them organised Breakfast is too pricey , The hotel is perfectly located for all activities and sightseeing Rooms are clean and tidy a bit dated 
307012,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Rooms are a bit outdated Carpet was old and should be replaced soon , Staff was super friendly and helpful Bathroom was a good size Bed was comfortable Location was perfect Literally the first street after leaving the Central train station Within walking to distance to everything 
307013,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, It is not a grand entrance for the hotel In order to get to the room it needs to take couple of elevator , The staffs are amazing Understood the needs of travelers

307015,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Rate is about too expensive especially for traveller from weak currency Asia , Location is in the center of amsterdam and located just 2 minutes from central station of amsterdam
307016,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, the noise in the morning started at 8am carried on throughout the day dust all over the furniture cleaning is a issue there clearly, was a nice location thats about it
307017,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Old rooms old furniture non comfortable beds poor breakfast no free water in the room dirty coffee mashine tram sound starts at 5 am under your window, Location is good near train station good if you go to the airport with the train and also allows you to go to the city centre quickly
307018,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The pool was smaller than expected and we would have like to see a jacuzzi and a steam room rather than the huge sauna m, Plenty of choice at breakfast We had an upgrade room but had to sort out a breakfast issue which was easily dealt with by reception staff 
307019,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The room was dark The bed was lumpy Decor in the room and corridors was in need of refurbishment, Excellent location great for access to the train station and airport Also very good base for exploring Amsterdam 
307020,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Location meant it was very hard to get in and out of the hotel at times as many groups waited outside for coach tours There was no view from the room as it viewed out to more building This meant not much natural light could get into the room The decor needed updating as it was very brown but as before a very nice room nonetheless , Staff were very friendly and the concierge could not have more helpful on the first day telling us which tram we would need and giving us a city map Room was set over two floors with stairs down the bed very nice Very large room and comfortable bed Location was perfect not too far for any attractions and opposite central station to pick up any trains trams and buses 
307021,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We were never informed that the hotel was undergoing renovations at the time we made the booking and were awoken by drills each morning of our stay plus the beautiful resident s bar was part of these renovations and therefore unavailable to us We have stayed here before but really would not want to stay here again until all works have been completed I really felt we got very bad value for our money on this occasion ,No Positive
307022,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, I spent a total of 9 days on the road in northern Europe and of all the hotels I stayed at the Park Plaza was by far the most expensive but the room and hotel amenities were the worst of all my stays The location is great but the hotel is under construction and still charging beyond premium prices Small room and small bathroom The bed was uncomfortable and to get to the fitness area required a trip down the elevator across the lobby up an elevator across a hallway and then back down another elevator Overall I would recommend looking elsewhere , The location is right in the heart of Amsterdam 
307023,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Rooms are showing their age Carpet needs to be replaced in rooms Entry into hotel room needs better cleaning , Paul our front desk concierge was wonderful Our original room was terrible cramped no closet space and the room was aged Paul came to our rescue and moved us to an executive suite the very next day He was cheerful helpful and there for all of our needs a wonderful employee Great location but buffet while good was to expensive 
307024,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam,No Negative, The Park Plaza is such a good location literally across the street from Centraal Station and a short walk to the Jordaan or to othersights like the Anne Frank house and Dam square 
307025,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Everything Horrible property The bed was found dirty on check in and wasn t cleaned after informing them even when we got back at night The housekeeping in charge misbehaved with my wife when he came to check if our rooms were actually dirty , Nothing at all

307027,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Nothing for us although some building work going on but did not impact on us but depending where your room is coulocated impact, The staff were so pleasant Can not fauLt the service Gym staff very pro active Problem with air conditioning in room sorted very quickly and given a new room
307028,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We had to ask for toilet roll a number of times as our room was not cleaned for a couple of days , The location of the hotel is great it is close to everything Very friendly and helpful staff The room was a decent size with a nice view of the station The bed was comfortable and there was a good selection of UK channels on the TV 
307029,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, I was told i was being upgraded but if the room I was given was an upgrade I dread to think what the original room I booked would have been like the room was very small and the bathroom was terrible with a glass door and it felt as if there was no privacy , The Bed was comfortable the bar was very nice and the staff were very friendly and helpful 
307030,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, hotel is under renovation Nor hotel website provides any information of under renovation nor the booking com and the executive room which was on second floor room no 209 where iwas staying and that particular corner was getting renovated and work would start morn 8 onwards till 5 pm in evening and it was really annoying , location was excellent
307031,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, They way you let us pay 900 euro to stay at a construction site for 4 nights I was woken up by drilling hammering the whole time I was there no warning about this at all ruined my trip it was meant to be a relaxing time off work which turned into getting no sleep for 4 nights We was rushed and kicked out the room that we paid for because the maid wanted to clean it so she could go home Maid was very rude and we felt rushed out of our own room ,No Positive
307032,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, I hated the service as soon as I enter red my urban suite there was lady hair on couch on the basin sink in the bath tab Additionally I had requested to give me two rooms next to each other a month in advance but on arrival they gave us separate floors and rooms far away from each other The room I was in no 236 was not cleaned properly at all I visit Amsterdam 4 times a year and this is he first time I have stayed at this hotel My experience was horrible , Location
307033,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, It s time to change the windows still wooden and quite old As the access to the pool and sauna is free for all then it would be great to provide bathrobe for all as well It was not very convenient to go to the pool in normal clothes and change in the locker room , Concierges were very helpful and quickly helped with all the questions Breakfast is very good Swimming Pool and Sauna are clean and convenient Location is perfect 
307034,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Didn t like that there was works going on while are stay there and the rooms weren t anything special consider your paying good money could have stopped in a ibis for a lot less but same comfort, The staff were nice
307035,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Should have king bed instead of 2 twins pushed together or queen would have been ok , Good variety at breakfast excellent check in and concierge staff 
307036,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Building seemed to me very old also i did not appreciate the 2 elevator that i have to change to reach to my room it was very strange Room Although it was reconstructed refurnished but i expected more , Breakfast Excellent Staff Nice Pool and fitness center Excellent It is not really easy to find property in central station with pool Cleanness Excellent
307037,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, N A, Tim Arthur Diana and the wider team were very welcoming and helpful as always with the organisation of logistics for me during a very fast moving business trip This is the main reason I stay here Thanks team 
307038,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, I paid 182 for 1 night for a queen superior room not worth that money at all very standard room bathroom wasn t really appealing or nice, The reception and bar
307039,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The interior took me a bit by surprise it looked beautiful from the outside and then once inside it became very dingy The room was lovely but the double bed was actually two single beds pushed together which was uncomfortable and annoying for a couple to sleep in , The location was excellent right by the station and right in the centre so it was easy to get too and from everywhere The staff where very nice and polite It was also super safe as you couldn t get into the hotel after a certain time without taking your room number and name 
307040,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Had a great stay and the staff were friendly however after paying 529 for 3 nights I would expect breakfast complimentary or a little cheaper the hotel charged another 120 on top if I wanted breakfast Also I would expect a basic human need such a water to be complimentary almost 5 for a bottle is kind of outrageous , Friendly staff and great central location Clean hotel with lots of good facilities Would recommend 
307041,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The room is smaller than we were expecting for the price The location was handy but had none of the charm as some of the smaller neighborhoods near the canals Also there was painting going on in our hallways while we were there and loud talking in the hallways early in the mornings The entry way to the hotel is not very welcoming warm , La piscine et sauna sont top et la personnel tr s gentils The pool and sauna and all personel were great The hotel is just next to the train station as well which is handy and we were surprised how quiet our room was even though it was such a centre location 
307042,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam,No Negative, The location was amazing and so easy to find we d never been to Amsterdam before and it was right in the middle of everything Perfect for a few nights away
307043,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Didn t receive a top floor as originally requested and no city views as suggested Living room furniture was old they forgot our wake up call and their excuse was they only had 2 hands for all the wake up calls Given the cost for the 4days the value wasn t there , Location
307044,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam,No Negative, The bed was firm yet soft Perfect after a long day of travel and touring The room was spacious so we didn t feel cramped and crowded Just like home The location is so convenient to everything we wanted to tour and see Absolutely lovely And we ll stay here again on our next visit back to Amsterdam

307049,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We had a room on the 6th floor at the urban wing facing the Centraal Station view was great except that the windows are not noise proof so there will still be a little bit of noise from the traffic just outside especially if you are a light sleeper Apparently some renovations for the urban wing were still going on above us and we experienced some drilling and knocking noise in the mornings when we were there Otherwise the staff were very friendly and helpful esp Ms Ine the desk manager who offered to compensate us for the discomfort we experienced during our stay , Location was great as it was within walking distance to the Dam Square and just across from Centraal Station with the trams and buses all nearby You can easily get food all around as well 
307050,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We paid to upgrade to the refurbished room as was extremely unhappy with the condition of the superior room which in actual fact did not look anything like the airbrushed pictures on the website The superior room was dated cramp and very hot I was also looking forward for a swim but felt unsafe to do so as the gym pool was shared with I assume gym members who can assess the gym facilities from a back door which opens up to a busy high street , Location very convenient Just a hop away from the train station and tramlines The concierge team was really friendly and helpful to recommend places to visit and good nearby restaurants We were happy with our upgraded room which was modern clean and spacious We also had a great view of the beautiful Amsterdam Centraal station building from the room 
307051,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, When we used the pool at night about half 10 the lights didn t come on in the sauna or the girls toilets , The room was big and spacious Breakfast was good

307055,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The fact I didn t get the room I booked and had to chase the reception staff for the right one The cost of drinks was very high encouraging me to drink elsewhere , Friendliness of staff and location 
307056,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The pool was too cold to use but only a small issue, Ideal location Very comfy and spacious room Staff were fantastic especially one of the evening security he showed us around and was very kind 
307057,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam,No Negative, Amazing Staff are very friendly and welcoming and they surprised us with the room as it was our birthdays we got a upgrade Couldn t ask for a better service 
307058,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Our room Bed too low not the ordered double but a twin and very uncomfortable No decent chairs in the room or anywhere , The bathroom was designed by the devil the furniture likewise 
307059,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The room temperature was unbearable until I discovered the a c controls , The free drinks vouchers for waiting 5 mins for our room to become ready was a nice touch
307060,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Am very disappointed with this hotel We were asked to give a 75 deposit at check in which we were told would be refunded It is 3 weeks later and the money still has not returned to my account I have tried ringing the hotel several times and each time and put on hold and never picked up again I have tried emailing booking com and calling them and have gotten no reply there also ,No Positive
307061,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Nothing at all , I have stayed at this hotel for leisure For business I travel weekly so I have seen many many hotels However I have never met such great personel as s hotel The attention help willingness just great Great pool perfect breakfast and location We loved it and definitely come back again when staying in Amsterdam 
307062,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Hotel used to be nice and old fashioned Now expanded and new rabbit Warren rooms added I was in newer section Room small fairly well refurbished but rather cheaply done No plug for sink Clanking radiator all night which odd as room airconditioned Down stairs reception a bit of a mess but staff very helpful , Modern Bathroom good shower Comfortable bed 
307063,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Bad grumpy stares from the staffs whenever we walk into the hotel Room is too small for the price Toilet seat never stays up shower head holder not in a good condition A double bed made from 2 single beds , Great Location just 3 5 minutes walk from Centraal Station Free wifi
307064,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Carpets in the corridors and room very dirty and needed either cleaning or replacing Didn t eat breakfast in hotel as thought it was overpriced No spare toilet roll left so we ran out on the last morning and 2nd morning maid only left us one towel so we had to ring for more towels Think hotel slightly overpriced as we have stayed in nicer hotels for less , Location was excellent for train station and local attractions Bar was relaxing to have a drink in after a day sightseeing Bed comfy and extra pillows were delivered within 10 minutes of us requesting them 
307065,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, the spa facilities are a let down Overpriced hotel for what this offers No tea coffee facilities in room as this was stated when booking but none available Had to wait ages to book luggage in and collect , food was nice in restaurant however this is very pricey Location 
307066,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The hotel the rooms and decor were extremely tired and lacking Cleaning standards weren t great we took drinks up to the room and the cleaners hid them in the cupboard instead of removing them The photos were misleading very disappointing I wouldn t recommend I think you can get much better for your money else where So disappointing as we decided to book the 4 as a treat and for a bit of luxury but wasn t worth it , The only good thing was the location the hotel was within walking distance to the train and the famous areas Red Light District China Town and the Canals The bar tender was really helpful and suggested some good places to eat Baton 
307067,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The heater made a loud drop noise in the room so were given earplugs by staff so we could sleep and they messed up our reservation again as we were promised adjoining rooms and that did not happen their staff overall just seemed confused , The manager fixed an issue with our reservation and was extremely helpful we were very appreciative of his help 
307068,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Our room was very small and this wasn t reflected in the images on the site It was far from superior For the price we paid I felt that we could have gotten somewhere nicer We must have been below some sort of water boiler as it was very noisy at night time resulting in a poor sleep , Great location Friendly staff Pool area was nice
307069,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Windows didn t provide much effect in cancelling the noise from the street and tram outside Mini bar was quite expensive 5euro for a bottle of water is way too much however there is a shop close by which we used instead , Executive suite was fabulous 
307070,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We had 2 single beds pushed together a nice double bed would have been better , Polite friendly helpful staff Beautiful hotel we got a free upgrade to one of their refurbished modern rooms Excellent location Not sure what the basic room we had booked would ve been like 
307071,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The fact loud noise coming in room could not sleep night manager said to get ear plugs this was not ok so no sleep all night day manager and maintenance team said fault in air duct so they moved me to another room long way from my son who was in next room which was not same standard no offer of refund given or implied travel ombudsman will be contactacted if I still get no reply, Location
307072,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, I cant think of anything i didnt like , We loved every second of our stay The view was perfect The staff were lovely helpful It was our anniversary while we were there and we got a free upgrade and our room was done beautiful with rose petals love heart balloons cake wine on ice

307075,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The supreme room selected was two double mattresses pushed together and the shower wasnt consistently hot Room probably wasn t worth the upgrade amount , Good customer service and friendly staff
307076,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Very expensive in regards to Food and Drink if you don t have breakfast built in and fancy ordering it can cost you 24 Euros each for a basic breakfast when next door you can visit a caf and get it for 10 Also the rooms are quite dark and the bed is the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept on that much so that it spoilt my nights out as I was so tired as I hadn t got a lot of sleep when in the room , Great hotel Good location as right across from main station bus tours and canal tours staff at reception were brilliant so friendly and willing to help with every request 
307077,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, reception booking in was wrong so put us in a twin room but booking com which I had the paperwork showed a double they did rectify and upgraded us to a sweet all be it with no view but was nice small issue with cleaning one day but rectified spa is not very big and pool not very warm, general nice hotel good location friendly staff

307081,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, First room we were given and corridor smelled of vomit Hotel was tired ripped tatty wallpaper and threadbare stained carpets To get a drink in the bar we ordered cocktails on both nights took over 30 minutes, the check in was quick and easy Location really good 
307082,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Our bedroom was old tired and the bed was uncomfortable the bathroom too was very small for two people sharing the clarity of choice of room s when booking was poor and the imagery was not very clear we booked Superior and it certainly was not that had I known and it was more clear at booking stagethat I was getting an older room and paying nearly 500 I would not have booked I did mention to staff on the first day after arrival the young man on reception was dismissive and handled my concern poorly , Locality to town and travel links was good
307083,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Too many steps in the hotel Very hard to get a buggy into the hotel as there is no proper lift Sauna was out of order when we stayed I had specifically picked this hotel because of the swimming pool and sauna facilities, Excellent location Hotel looked great with a nice swimming pool

307087,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Bad smell in the old building they should let any new guest satying in it until they solve this problem specially when we asked reception to move they were very welling to do and some confirmed the that smell is really bad then why from beginning you let us stay in Some of the elevators was not working all the time though maintainence kept fixing them all time but even though they fix during day long and it broke down during night for nearly three days , Staff was really friendly and helpful 
307088,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Price of the hotel per night I paid quite an amount to stay for 2 nights in a superior double room and ended up with 2 single beds pushed together very outdated room looked very different online The price of the things in the mini car was ridiculous and a funky smell was on the floor we was staying on wasn t very pleasant , Loved the location of the hotel and the staff were very helpful and happy espically the staff member who manages the luggage room The shower was amazing with different settings and the sauna and swimming pool was lovely 
307089,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Didnt like our view it was not what we had asked for Our bathroom was very small and our shower tray and doors were filthy , I liked the overall location 
307090,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, I didn t like how the bed was actually two beds next to each other They kept moving apart and was just weird Also housekeeping left random things in the hallway like packs of toilet paper and there were two mugs sitting on a stand throughout our entire stay no they weren t decoration , We loved the location and were able to walk to everything Also the rooms were very nice and clean I think we had an urban room 
307091,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Was disappointed our room was nice just shame shower was hot one min then freezing also we paid extra as we wanted to use the spa and sauna however it was closed out of service for the whole stay when we asked the lady was very rude to us stating it won t be opening for a week The floor 3 smelt really bad of sewers carpets were fility We couldn t even eat the breakfast too as it looked like it had been standing out for a long time Very disappointed won t be staying again , Very pretty hotel looks good and sounds good didn t live up to extentions

307140,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The room was very basic and extremely small We have been to this hotel about 7 or 8 times now and this was the worst room we ve ever had The air conditioning unit or something was right outside our window which was really noisy there was no view whatsoever Which was awful considering it was New Year s Eve so we could not see any fireworks from our room we could see ABSOLUTELY NOTHING a very poor room, The location of the hotel is great for everything After travelling which can be tiring the hotel is a very short walk from the station after freshening up your then ready to go and everything is just a short walk away
307141,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, the swimming pool is small and inside the sauna is not hot at all the shampoo bottles in the room omg you have to be hercules to open their lids, everything was perfect about the hotel we had to pay 60 euro more to upgrade our room to the urban wing but it worth it because the first room we were offered was an ancient one the hotel left champagne and pedals on our bed as it was our honeymoon which was a really nice gesture
307142,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The Lady at the breakfast lounge on the 1st at 1145 was very worried it seemed that I would not pay our breakfast I walked in she told me there was no credit card depo told her no we left a cash depo wanted to sit and eat had already given my room number was asked to fill out a form I did but told her anyways my husband would pay cash I must say though the lady has no clue about basic good service or manners if you go in any restaurant you pay after not when you walk in also after not a single waiter came to clean up the plates when they asked me due to the buffet closing if I still wanted anything I said no but that I would apreciate if someone could clear up my husband hardly even had place for his expresso in general this restaurant personel left a bad impression, On the 31st my Beef Sirlion which I had in the restaurant with the fire was excellent medium done just as should be our Waitress I believe she was Italian sugested which wine as well Was very friendly actually in this restaurant all staff very friendly

307144,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, That a 75 euro holding amount was taken from my card upon checking in It was refunded upon leaving but is still not in my account 300 plus rooms equates to over 22 500 euros of YOUR money in a bank account , Great room Executive Double Room on 2 levels 
307145,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Hard to find any faults with this hotel at all , Well placed Hotel being only 50m opposite from the railway station which offers a frequent and inexpensive service to the Airport The room was exceptionally clean it was quiet allowing a good nights sleep The hotel staff were warm and friendly and all spoke English The breakfast was excellent with a good choice of hot and cold dishes we had a really good meal in the brassiere in the hotel which was not only tasty but offered real valve for money Be advised to make a reservation though

307148,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Furniture interiors are not that nice otherwise all good , Very good location just opposite central station and few minutes walk from the Dam We took the executive room which was very spacious and has a big window with a beatiful view of the lake and station very nice and cozy restaurant and very nice and hightech gym and sauna pool facilities
307149,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The swimming pool is a bit too small But I understand as its the centre of Amsterdam , Location is fantastic It s a great place if you get around the Netherlands and Belgium by train as its right opposite to the train station 
307150,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Nothing everything was perfect My boyfriend and I enjoyed every moment of this trip , Best bed I ve slept in Super central to everything Will stay here again 
307151,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Carpets on the coridors very old and smel s very bad at the check in staff sound very rude and arrogant with explaining hotel rules making you sign the regulation form asking for imediate payment protection charging amount for the room bar Very uncomfortable feeling at the begining of your stay there They should do better and is the shame that first impresion looks bad Other than that location is in very good place staff is very friendly food very good Shame that for the activities like in big city like this after all day shooping you need relaxation and the sauna and swiming pool are closed at 10pm Overall fair experience , Good location
307152,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The breakfast room service was awful Even expensive every morning the breakfast was incomplete and poor not being served most of the items which were ordered the night before , Besides location we had the opportunity to meet Mariangela member of the hotel staff an excellent professional and a very kind person which did everything possible to help us with some issues 
307153,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Rooms can do with some serious updating Bathroom was tiny Found it very overpriced for the room considering it was in Amsterdam, Brilliant location Staff are so friendly and helpful
307154,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Odd odour in the corridor heading to our room on the 3rd floor, The location is ideal within a 2 minute walk from centraal station and just around the corner from the damrak

307156,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Genuinely thought that breakfast was included in our rate but it wasn t hotel bar was a little on the small side , Fantastic location good facilities and the consierge was great 
307157,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Two annoying things really In our room there was no traditional bedside lamp but instead individually controlled spotlights above the bed This looks good but it makes it harder for one person to stay up and the other sleep the spotlights are just too bright and harsh Also at the main entrance the only one we saw there are four steps inside the door We had to lift up our son s stroller and carry them up and down the steps Now there is a fold away lift for disabled people but I think you would need to ask the staff to set it up for you It would be a hassle and would slow you down for that reason I probably wouldn t stay here again unless I was comfortable using steps , Can t beat the location if you don t mind the noise Just across the street from central station big comfy room and a good price The staff were very helpful and friendly 
307158,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Hotel needed a little TLC our room had ripped and marked wallpaper and iron burns in the carpet Unfortunately our room was also next to the staircase and so every time someone went down the stairs with suitcases it would echo into our room which made sleeping a little difficult I also requested a room with a good view we were given a view of the room opposite which was disappointing , Location was perfect next to the station and centre of the city Staff were very helpful and friendly 
307159,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, If you re a smoker don t stay at this hotel They do not cater for those addicted to nicotine I appreciate smokers are the lowest of the low but we can also decide who we give our money to For this reason we will not use it again Everything else is great I would recommend to everyone excluding smokers , Centre of Amsterdam great as a launch pad to the city 
307160,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Room and hotel generally was too hot We turned radiator off in our room when we arrived and kept aircon on but it was not that effective Please turn the heating down , Every single member of the team were friendly and efficient Drinks were great Ambience amazing I have stayed in many Radissons but based on this experience I would choose Plaza every time 
307161,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Didn t honour our request for extra large doubles Gave twins and tried to put us in rooms that were not executive rooms at 250 per night Rooms were full of dust Totally spoilt our trip , The location
307162,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Superior rooms, Had to ask and pay for an upgrade as the superior room was far from that and was small dark and tired We upgraded to an urban room which was modern light and airy However I begrudge paying for a bottle of water in the room especially when the room rate is high The bar was good didn t eat In the hotel so can t comment on the quality 
307163,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, nothing really , The spread at the breakfast was awesome The location is just a visitor would want The staff extremely cordial and willing to assist with a smile 
307164,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, swimming pool a little cooler than we like so only used the sauna, Breakfast in brasserie much cheaper than in main restaurant and very good value for money
307165,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Poor value for room rate and type Executive room Should have included breakfast and complementary bottled water Room and hallways require new carpeting worn and musty Expected more from a top tier hotel brand , Excellent location in central Amsterdam and room view overlooking central square 
307166,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Booked superior double room with double bed we had two single beds pushed together which moved so you could fall down the middle separate bedding so two single duvets There was an adjoining door in our room which was open upon our arrival we had to ring reception wait for them to come to lock it before we could leave room again Cleanliness was poor shower room in particular was not cleaned properly , Location was excellent

307176,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Meals below standard breakfast the worst ever for 29 room state of repair shocking not clean once not cleaned at all nasty little bug in my bed No practicable exit in case of fire Apology received meanwhile did not at all ring true almost insulting , The staff with whom I had actual contact very pleasant indeed great 
307177,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, I asked for a double bed and hot 2 singles pushed together also asked for a room with a view as I booked my stay months back and I asked for a balloon or any birthday gesture cause I seen pictures that the hotel done this Shame I never got any of these things would of made a difference , It was in a very good location and the room was lovely 
307178,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Overpriced for facilities 350 Euro night Marketed as executive room however impossible to stand up straight in the shower due to sloped ceiling narrow stairs to bed in the loft and huge hotel air conditioning unit outside window which had only a view onto air conditioner , Location was great and breakfast selection good 
307179,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The hotel is old poorly maintained I had sellotape sticking wire together in my room bulbs that never worked I ve been to this hotel 15 years ago and it is exactly the same decor , Location 
307180,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Others have described the rooms as past their prime and this is true We rather expected it given that this is an old property in Amsterdam but it was not just the d cor some simple maintenance issues needed to be addressed as well This made the value for the price seem off , We needed to get to Amsterdam Centraal very early in the morning and the location made that simple Staff was unfailingly polite and professional

307189,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Sometimes a little noisy but to be expected due to its central location , Easy check in clear price guide for any extras Room was immaculately clean and cleaned daily Great central location with great transport links Staff were very informative from finding us a great restaurant to storing our luggage on our final day Hotel restaurant was also very reasonable priced for great quality food 
307190,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Parking to unload luggage can be an issue if you do not find a place immediately in front There is so much traffic so you need alternatives for new visitors , Your hotel is perfectly positioned in the heart of Amsterdam close to all the bars and restaurants and attractions 
307191,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Breakfast was expensive , Hotel was in a great location and very central to everything Room was big and comfortable with a nice bathroom Would stay again

307194,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Hallways are looking tired The beds were really uncomfortable and only one pillow each Omelettes are not nice really over cooked The mini bar was a complete rip off 4 50 euros for a small coke didn t realise I was in some expensive nightclub , Was good to have a decent sized room Best cauliflower soup The spa area is small but has a nice and relaxing feel
307195,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The modern wing is the place to say think it is called the studio wing All other rooms are dated and of a poor standard when compared I had to request a room change as a result , Amazing location Great staff Reasonably priced
307196,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Mould on ceiling above shower grubby old carpet starting to look dated 5 for a bottle of water For the price we paid we dont feel like we got good value for money Perhaps due to the season but having stayed at another hotel further up the road in the past in retrospect we would have paid more to stay there , Very close to the station and a lot of tourist attractions Staff were helpful and polite despite being obviously busy on a weekend 
307197,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The only downside was a couple of the lifts were out of order so finding our way to and from the Urban Wing for the 1st time was a little confusing and we got lost But once we bumped into a member of staff they showed us the correct way and we fine from there on , The location of the hotel is very central right opposite the main train station Great for people like us who were only in Amsterdam for 36 hours and didn t want to spend ages travelling into the centre The room was lovely and clean and the bed was so comfy The staff were friendly and approachable They even added a little birthday balloon and some sweets chocolate for my boyfriend at the time of booking I said we were celebrating a birthday

307200,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Moving around in the hotel is a bit hectic They could use an update in furniture Not many things to do within the hotel itself Not many options for english speaking people on the tv , Nicely located just across the amsterdam central train station and damrak near many of the restaurants and amenities walking distance from some of the main attractions
307201,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Noise especially the rooms facing the main street and the bus party stands in the front of the hotel with loud music , Location facility and clean property

307218,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We liked it all We chose not to buy the breakfast at the hotel so I can t speak to that , Everything We liked that the hotel was close to Central Station because as we toured the town we could always find street signs guiding us back to Central Station and hence the Park Plaza Victoria Hotel The staff was truly wonderful genuinely helpful and always pleasant i thought the room was great What I need in order of priority is clean 2 beds and a shower the spaciousness of our room 505 was a big bonus I read reviews of this hotel before choosing it and numerous people made comments that the room decor was tired I don t need a newly decorated decor when I m on the road I put priority on that at home On the road it s cleanliness proximity of beds and a shower and this hotel was a 5 star for me in those categories

307228,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, I did not feel as welcomed by the staff as in other hotels I had stayed at The room and the bathroom were TINY I had to stand back to be able to shave because the wash basin area was too tight to maneuver so was the shower The window in the room opened up to the middle of the building so there was zero view I should have booked the Urban Room but for the price I paid for the Superior it was definitely not worth it , The only good thing about this hotel was the location right across from the main train station and at the beginning of the Damrak means that you are well connected to everything 
307229,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Nothing I didn t like , Ideally located 100 metres from Amsterdam Central Station Can travel to all the tourist attractions from this central point Trains trams buses boats and taxis all ready available 
307230,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The carpet in Room 519 was very old and dirty I guess that s why they gave us slippers , Excellent location across from the Central Train station and very easy walk to town square

307232,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, It is not wasy to move around as it looks like a maze if you don t pay attention where you go more signs needed for sure Room service tray stayed from midnight till afternoon at the door They need to renovate some of the bathrooms, Very close to everything you wish to see in Amsterdam i didn t use any transportation means except for a city tour and the trip there starts less than 50 meters away from the hotel s gate It was my honeymoon and i found a lovely surprise in my room a great gesture
307233,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, A 4 place Did not change towels despite asking Reception staff no clue where local chemist was They were friendly though , Excellent location Clean rooms 
307234,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Room in desperate need of updating Mattress thin and base of bed wasn t dressed Bathroom very dated and small Wall paper pealing in places overall the hotel did not live up to any 4 star expectations and was grossly overpriced for 2 star Accomodation, Bar man was very pleasant
307235,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The suite showed on your site is new while the one they gave me is very very old When I asked they said we have new suites on the other side Also the ice machine was not working and they knew about it but never fixed it I was on the 5th floor and had to go for the 2nd floor to get ice, The location

307253,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, amsterdam to crowded red light district a nightmare to walk around re idiots on mopeds scooting onto the footpaths you would need eyes in the back of your head to avoid getting run over , good location and new part of hotel quiet hotel has a good gym
307254,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Some of the staff were a bit miserable and rude The pool was broken for a few days The superior rooms need to have their names changed as there is nothing superior about them They are ridiculously small They count the bathroom in the room dimensions In some rooms you have to shuffle past the foot of the bed or commando roll over it to access the rest of the room They should not be advertised the way they are I feel as though it is false advertisement and they certainly are not big enough to fit in a double bed which literately had the head against the wall the foot almost touching the opposite wall which was also the entrance to the bathroom and was placed immediately where you open the door to the room Simply not good enough , Location
307255,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We were not satisfied with our room there were maintenance issues it was not as clean as I d like and we had one pillow each I was asked at the front desk if I wanted to upgrade for 50 EU I declined as we were there less than 12 hours Didn t see or was able to partake in any dining or bar When I rated the hotel poorly the response was that I should have informed them however I feel a hole in the carpet one pillow per guest are aspects they should be aware of , The location was prime The historical aspect of the hotel was nice The check in staff some were nice 
307256,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Had a problem with the reservation process couldn t fix it due to hotel policy which I m totally fine with I called the reservation desk and the guy who answered my call was making fun of me in an unprofessional way and was rude to me his name was Patrick , The hotel location is perfect close to the central station Staff at the reception are super friendly Easy check in and check out process Would definitely recommend it and will always stay there
307257,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, At first we were given a room that looked like it belonged in a cheap motel After requesting a change we were given a decent room with a nice view The room was a bit dated and worn but it was much better than what we were first shown It s a big busy place and staff is quick and impersonal because there is always someone waiting behind you to get their turn It looks like a beautiful building on the outside I was expecting the same on the inside , Location was ideal Great view of partial canal 
307258,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, I had a problem after I did my reservation and I called back the hotel reservation department directly They couldn t help me with my problem due to hotel policy which I totally understand but making fun of me and being rude on the phone is not acceptable at all My reservation was non refundable so couldn t do anything about it though I would never stay at such place after being treated on the phone like that I called the hotel 3 months before my arrival and I still remember the guy name due to his rude and disrespectful answers PATRICK, The staff at the reception were super friendly and nice Check in and check out process were smooth and easy Used the gym at the hotel it was great and convenient The room is great though I didn t stay that much in the hotel a lot of things to explore in Amsterdam it s a wonderful city

307260,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, It was horrible Hopefully the next stay will be better since there is a no cancellation policy Horrible hotel, My room was not available They gave me a Room with three twin beds It was horrible 
307261,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The hotel took 75 euro out of my bank account for a security deposit which was refunded when we checked out but they never told us it was being taken out , Location was fantastic 2 minutes from the train station Everything was in English so it was very easy to buy train tickets Everything was in walking distance 
307262,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Waited for concierge for 20 minutes to come back to their desk during this time not approached by any other member of staff Room was ok bottled water should not be priced at 5 00 in a 4 property At one stage carpets were pulled up outside our bedroom and we were walking on underlay Another suggestion is doors should have a soft close as doors were banging loudly around us during the night , Could not fault the location staff were very nice Bar staff excellent good cocktails and nice touch with range of peanuts etc provided with drinks Very good levels of cleanliness 
307263,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The hotel was rated 4star but showed quite a bit of wear The receptionist must have been a trainee because she told us our room had a view of the central station we were on the other side of the hotel with no view Swimming pool was out of order due to a technical issue which was a pity , Location was excellent Staff was very professional and helpful Can t comment on the breakfast as we ate out 
307264,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, There was a distinct lack of information regarding the basics to ensure the guest is aware of all facilities available to them for their comfort Upon arrival a small but detailed pamphlet to inform guests of these essentials would be helpful with an explanation There should not be an assumption that all guests are aware or know how to work all components of your hotel The hotel wasn t especially clean or special to justify the prices it sets poor value for money oh and breakfast is set at a ridiculously pretentious price as are the sundries in the fridge lack of attention to your guests completely extremely poor customer service for 70 per person per night , the huge mosiac stained glass tulip celing in the entrance
307265,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The bed only modestly comfortable Given how everything else about the hotel was so strong I had high expectations for the bed and bedding which was average at best , Location was great the service and the people were excellent the Wifi was strong and the breakfast spread was good 
307266,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The beds could have been more comfy and the rooms slightly more modern for the price you pay, The locations was perfect and the staff were very friendly
307267,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The date we checked in the two staff was rude and upon asking for room on the spot they said they are all booked where as I got it booked on booking com in just 5min rite after they said no The rest of the staff was good but those those two specially need to get some lessons of hotel management and needs to know how to treat a guest The two people were a lady name I don t remember and man whose name starts with M, Still I would say the hotel was nice and great location Would decently recommend everyone 
307268,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Finding your room is a challenge , The pool and sauna were great The staff in the fitness center was also good The staffs in general were not bad 
307269,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The Windows could have opened a bit more would only open less than inch but would not stay open Probably health and safety , The view from our room over the canal 
307270,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Booked a taxi at an agreed price of 47 50 as per what the posters and concelierge said charge of taxi came to 65 Not impressed with this Apart from this it s a lovely hotel , Friendly staff great location and good facilities Loved the ice machine on our floor

307275,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Double bed was just two twins side by side with individual bedding Instead of a double bed comforter we each had our own twin size one Also images show baths in bathrooms however our room didn t have one which was a let down , Rooms were big and comfortable Staff were friendly and more than happy to help Great selection at breakfast 
307276,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Rooms in the older part of the building are overly hot in Summer but we got moved when we asked for a cooler room, The hotel is well located and staff very accommodating and friendly Excellent pool and gym too 
307277,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Most of it The room was old probably decorated in the 1980 s the corridor was dark and the carpets were old and had a must smell The bath was too short to use and the towel rail was at head height about 1 ft away when taking a shower The hot breakfast was poor with hard bacon and waffles being kept in warmers too long the staff in the restaurant were not friendly or efficient when I complained about my room I was told there was a more modern one available but the bed had separate mattresses Very poor value for money I wrote a complaint to the hotel and the response was to justify rather than correct, The location The bar area
307278,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Room is far from the entrance need to use 2 elevators, The location just in the middle of every thing The staff friendly Pool and gym are just what we need
307279,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam,No Negative, location is great straight across from centraal station and close to attractions like dam square and red light district Room is great size and very comfy
307280,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Booked because had stayed in new part of hotel previously and loved it Came back and booked again only to be put in a room in the old part of hotel with stains on the floor stains on the bed a room where you had to go up a set of stairs and then down a set of stairs to get to with a view of a wall barely any natural light and a nasty smell Was moved after we complained but to a slightly better room the first night and then a nicer room the second night due to availability Also had to put down 75 euros as a deposit upon arrival as well as signing a disclaimer which seemed pretty unfriendly Was told if I paid it on card it would have to come back in cash and only in euros so you would be screwed by the exchange charges of your currency isn t euros I wasn t aware of this before arriving so wasn t happy The breakfast was below average for a 4 hotel Often queues at the desk The old part of the hotel is pretty tired and scruffy Bath was small and shower not powerful I wouldn t go back , Some staff excellent but not consistent Location is fantastic 
307281,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam,No Negative, Absolute joke I reserved a room in this hotel but when I got there the police had the entrance blocked and there had been no signs or staff to tell tourist alternative routes by this stage I started to my battry was going dead and it was get late I went to a hotel across the road for a similar price so everything wa s grand until I checked my bank account the next day and saw that the hotel had taken the money for the room even though i didn t stay when I went to hotel I was a told by a snotty stuck up bell hop who tought he was the dogs ballox just said it is wad it is absolute joke could of slapped the head of your man cheeky Lil welp fuming 
307282,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Check in staff and policy made me feel like I was being treated as a criminal with their ID cleck and pre authorization of charges for the mini bar in the room on my credit card I do not think I ll stay here again , Location to the central train station and trams is fantastic 
307283,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam,No Negative, This hotel was in an excellent position The room was clean and a good size The bar bistro was great as was the Hotel bar in the evening The hop on hop off bus is directly opposite the hotel and a great way to see Amsterdam especially if time is limited Red light district is very close as is shopping Would definitely stay here again 
307284,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, nothing everything was great, clean respectable place and central location in the middle of everything yet quite you can t hear all of the hustle a bustle of the outdoors until you leave the hotel premises
307285,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, A little pricy for the services you avail breakfast is an additional hit on your pocket and sounded expensive to me and also they don t even provide a complementary water bottle in the room one has to pay Euro 5 just for the water , Friendly staff excellent location near the centraal station and also close to many attractions room cleanness 
307286,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The staff Had a bad experience even after booking in January I arrived after lots of flight delays and paid a full rate of 475 euros including the deposit When I arrived I was very confused as I had stayed previous in January and my girlfriend must of sorted the deposit out or I was not told as I had no idea about the 75 euro deposit as it WAsnt very clearly displayed on booking com until after I booked and check an email with small print That was fine but I was told I could not sort it out then and the guy told me to take a seat and come sort it out in a min as I was holding the que up I suffer with severe panic attacks and anxiety I started to cry and panic as all staff looked at me as if I was doing something bad My mental health was quite bad so decided to go on holiday as its my birthday Monday and I m turning 24 I booked wig Victoria as I go to Amsterdam a lot on business and to see friends The moment I arrived at the hotel I felt unwelcome and unwanted and kept being told to take a seat so the other guests could not see me cry eventually after panic I handed my phone over to the receptionist who told my mother who I ring in panic that I could not use her card for the deposit I was told he would just take today s money but I didn t want to just book for one day Incase I didn t have it sorted the next day and if I wanted to get up before check out I eventually had the money transferred and felt the staff to be extremely unhelpful and rude unlike when I stayed the first time This was not a great start to my holiday and paying 5 euro for a can of drink for the mini bar is not what I expected either I was not pleased with the room as there was a step infront of the door and I tripped falling into the door and hurting my head The second day after popping outside for some lunch and a ciggettette I arrived to the whole road being shut with no access to the hotel no money on me and all my stuff inside the room , Slept well quiet rooms and enjoyed the view apart from the wire all over my window

307294,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, All the people for some reason that were hanging around out the front, Was a lovely hotel right in the centre of town easy to find from the train station
307295,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Windows should be able to open fully and there should be a smoking rooms the furniture is old but not bad, Great location and good staff I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel
307296,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Cushions thick but they replaced them Cleaners very smelly and room stank of perspiration when they finished cleaned Far from where we wanted to be so walked about 30 kms per day getting to action , Nespresso machine lovey Directly opposite station Good WIFI No view whatsoever We were cold and they brought extra blankets 
307297,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Had a long wait to check in and out took ages , Felt really relaxed and great breakfast Stayed in an executive room and well worth the extra money Nice big room loads of space Excellent location 
307298,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, As mentioned above the calamity with our room upgrade was annoying And then the rooms themselves were appalling The service from the first guy who checked us in was bizarre He droned on and on making small talk failed to make up for their own system error told us he had checked us into the best of the superior rooms and it was just awful The rooms and decor are extremely tired with chips and chunks out of walls skirting boards and doors Ugly furniture Just horrible Absolutely depressing The floor we were initially on before paying for an upgrade smelled awful like mould or mildew or something just horrid As others have said the floors are like rabbit warrens You can easily get lost The rooms are quite noisy being right on the street front Way way way over priced Aud 300 per night for that No thanks Never again Worst value for money To me this hotel is more like a 3 star The only 4 star part is the lobby The rest is so far below any 4 star I ve ever stayed in its not even funny How they can get off charging the rates they do I don t know Also their ad on booking com is misleading I will post a photo Makes it sound like spa use and massages are included when in fact by spa they mean everyday normal hotel facilities like the gym and pool haha Shameful Absolutely misleading We booed this 4 star at an outrageous price despite the photos hinting it may be less than our idea of comfortable on the basis we would each have a free massage at the end of a long holiday to make up for it No such luck This place was a total let down on all fronts I urge you not to stay here There are much nicer places to stay in Amsterdam for literally half the price We chose this one for the city location being only a one night layover on our way home but we re kicking ourselves for it now Should have stayed out in an inner suburb like we did last time , There is not much to like about this hotel We paid over AUD 300 per night for one of the worst rooms in one of the ugliest stinkiest hotels I have ever stayed in Awful value for money and I m not sure how they ve managed 4 stars I ve stayed in a lot of 4 star hotels in my time and this is by far the worst Looked more like a 3 star to me The ONLY good thing about this stay was the trainee receptionist who upgraded our room for a small fee because the first one was so hideous and on a floor that smelled like mould and mildew and had a tiny and dirty window that let in hardly any natural light We had her again on check out and she is just delightful but the guy who originally checked us in I think I even heard him say he was the duty manager was terrible I had confirmed to purchase and uograde of our room which hadn t come through on their end apparently and he made no attempt to fix this Just said sorry you ll have to have a superior as booked Superior these rooms are not You expect a lot more for 300 per night 300 per night in most cities gets exceptional quality Not here Not even close 
307299,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, very expensive breakfast As all the hotels in central Amsterdam the breakfast is too expensive Accommodation is expensive it should at least include breakfast , I had a nice urban room with a fantastic canal view 
307300,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Beds far too hard , Location is perfect for any part of the city right opposite central station for trains trams buses Staff were friendly and helpful rooms very clean only fault we had was we found the beds too hard and ended up with bad backs in the morning Overall an excellent hotel to stay would like to see prices dropped a little

307304,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, the reception staff were new and the one that did seem to know what she was doing gave us inaccurate information about deposit charges They assured us that the 75 euro deposit was a holding fee but actually it was taken out of our account and then refunded so if you don t have a Dutch bank account watch out for hidden fees , Location was perfect for what we needed but wouldn t be so great if you re staying more than a night or two as it s bang in the middle of tourist central Value for money was exceptional 
307305,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Milk provided with tea and coffee in the bedrooms, The bed was ideal two singles we had plenty of space The facilities pool and sauna gym perfect Staff were so helpful and friendly I had plasters given from hurting my foot at a local festival Thankyou

307307,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Asked for a double bed but got two singles pushed together Not a massive deal though still very comfortable, Very helpful staff great location lovely facilities this is the second time we have stayed and probably will not be the last 
307308,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, There was a bottle of water in the room with 2 glasses Upon further inspection it had a tag on the neck saying it was 5 euro I just think at the price we were paying the water ought to have been free of charge , Prime location just over the street from the station A grand Victorian building that really stands out Upon arrival a really helpful Paul on reception upgraded us FOC to an executive room room 402 It was wonderful We had a triple aspect with views over the station the street the canal Loved the round windows Very clean with bathrobes slippers an awesome coffee machine Comfy bed with fresh clean linen a lovely bathroom with a full size bath We will definitely return to this hotel

307313,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Seemed expensive but I m sure I was paying for the very central location Hotel is a little dated and there was a maze of stairs and hallways to my room , Premium location very good water pressure and the shower was hot
307314,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, some pieces of furniture would need a little facelift f e bedside tabels , amazing location nice and clean room with spacious shower friendly and smiley staff 
307315,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, There was not one thing we could fault about this hotel , We had fell in love with our room I had taken my partner for her 21st birthday and upgraded the room last minute which they were more than happy to help out with Best choice I had made Also asked questions on wether I d like flowers cake ect to make our stay a little more special The different coloured lights in the bathroom had made it extra cosy with the mood lighting too The bed was AMAZING the struggle to get out of such a comfy bed but the electronic curtains had helped us get out of this king size bed with a balcony of the greatest view Amsterdam central Perfect location and the staff were brilliant with answerin questions and politeness This is going to be our hotel to stay every time we are visiting 
307316,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam,No Negative, Fun to be in the downtown area Buses trams and train station right across the street We could walk around area and there are nice restaurants near by The hotel is beautiful and has very friendly and helpful staff We took the tram to museums Bought a 48 hour pass for tram which worked out well for us 
307317,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We had to pay to upgrade Our original room which was a superior double was unacceptable Bed was caved in the middle Bathroom was dirty and the carpets had stains everywhere it was so tired Upgrading was easy but still extra money on what was already an expensive stay , Swimming pool and spa facilities were lovely although locals use it as their regular gym and didn t seem too happy we were there Good location right opposite the train station but a distance from the museums We upgraded our room to the newer part of the hotel and it was worth every penny Lovely and modern good mini bar clean Staff were very helpful and information desk made it easy to book things to do with good advice and good discounts 
307318,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The lobby bar should be open 24 7, Location is excellent right on Dam Square easy to find if you get a bit confused on the town Very comfy beds and good bathroom We stayed in the Urban Suite and it was very peaceful at night 
307319,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The breakfast buffet should have been topped up more regularly as there was no bacon for ages even though we told a member of staff However due to complaining about this they waived the 17 each for the breakfast and apologised , Had the swimming pool to ourselves so took our three month old swimming for the first time she loved it Told by staff that the swimming pool would be shut at 6pm but if we wanted to use it after we could get the key off of them and have it to ourselves 
307320,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Disliked the location very near central station and red light area the Expensive room cost of breakfast other add ins the lack of good hangout facilities in the lobby , Liked the swim pool breakfast spread and comfortable bed 
307321,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Upgraded the room at check in to what was told a recently renovated part of the hotel Tab in shower was broken kettle lid was broken and fell into tea Chair in room was squeaky and the night light surrounding room had a very annoying loud buzzy sound The manager at check out did apologise and took a small amount off the upgrade price and said the faults would be looked into , Clean hotel with friendly staff and location was perfect 
307322,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam,No Negative, Really nice place to stay staff were very helpful friendly Paul in particular needs a special mention would 100 stay again recommend room 202 purely for the view at night goes perfectly with a tub of magic mushrooms 
307323,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, No comments here , Our stay at Victoria was superb the menu for breakfast was great well balanced Being just across from Central Terminal meant easy access from the Airport The staff in general was great but I must mention Desk Manager Ine Geurts thank you for your part in making our stay a great one 
307324,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The room is veryyyy bad for a superior room that i paid for its under the ground going down and up on the stairs with my luggage no ac bad smell , Only the location
307325,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Wished I could have stayed longer , Great location very clean and good rooms Had water leaking from the room above me and was immediately changed to a bigger better room without me even saying anything so great customer service 
307326,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Need to change the hall way carpets makes the Hotel look scruffy and out of date kept been ask to move out of the way by Hotel staff for business party s in the bar Not good when you have been out walking all day and just want to relax with a drink, Breakfast was very good lots to offer including smoked salmon Staff where very friendly and helpful
307327,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The rooms are so old and do not justify the price Whereby at the same rate I could have stayed in the amazing W Hotel The GYM was a labirent to get to in between two building using two elevators and it was packed, Location was great 
307328,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Quite satisfied, The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable especially the concierge The location is excellent for a first time visitor or someone on a short stay as it is directly opposite the train station and quite convenient for tours etc 
307329,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The carpeting in our room was badly stained The furniture was old and very worn The first room they put us in was abominable The hotel needs a major renovation A TERRIBLE value for the money 790 for 3 nights ridiculous And it got good reviews on Trip Advisor , After they moved us into another room it was large and spacious The first room was horrific Dark and smelled like fried food with the only window looking onto an industrial corridor 
307330,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The pool was small and u had to walk through to the other side to get to wasn t child friendly at all Could do with some fresh decor I understand that they have a urban section but they didn t have a executive version hence we picked the original style , Staff were very nice we went as it was my partners birthday and our anniversary plus it was the 1st time traveling with a infant and staff made us feel welcome and even decorated the room for us with balloons and towel swans sweets and mini bottle of red wine with no extra cost Location was good if u wanted to stay near red light but far away from shopping districts and vondel park where we took our son a few times so i would think twice about staying if u like the other end
307331,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, they havent understood that hotel comes from hospitality because we have been arriving late i had emailed them to make sure they would reserve a room with bath tub for us well they didnt i told the receptionist that i had emailed when we checked in but all he cared was why i thought his colleagues had made a mistake i can live without a bath tube but their attitude is regretable the last morning the maid banged against our door before 10 am informing us that we have to check out official checkout time is until 12 pm i told them in their survey about this and they responded quite nicely offering us an upgrade next time however they insisted that it was our fault that we arrived late to sum it up they dont really care about their guests we travel a lot and stay in all kinds of places so it is not about the comfort and friendliness and hospitability can make up for much yet they lack these qualities in my eyes since the place is a bit outdated and truly clairaudient i cannot recommend , location is great for a city trip
307332,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The room was a bit dated and need to be refurbished We picked this hotel because of its central location and spa swimming pool otherwise we would have chosen a hotel which was cheaper Also it didn t have any parking for bicycles which meant we had to leave the bikes at another hotel the Movenpick which has excellent secure bike parking ,No Positive
307333,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, the shower water is hot and cold not fixed The housekeeping left a wipe in our room and took our room key card every time , Concierge service is pretty good 
307334,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The room construct was difficult to navigate with steep steps up a slippery ladder to bed Not suitable for the infirm certainly but hazardous for others too , The location
307335,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam,No Negative, The hotel is in a very centralized location Right across from the train station and the hop on hop off bus route is literally out the front door 
307336,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, One of the pricier hotels in the city centre but no worse than comparable hotels in other cities Breakfast was 24 euros per person per day 19 if booked in advance bit pricey but good quality and plentiful It might work out cheaper to take the breakfast included option when making the booking There are plenty of cafes restaurants bars nearby if you want to go even cheaper Watch out for the option to get a 10 reduction on food if you forego daily towel linen replacement this applies only to evening meals and bar in the hotel not to breakfast which is charged separately , Directly opposite Amsterdam Centraal station so nice views and plenty of activity with buses trams taxis canal boats bikes people but good soundproofing so no disturbance overnight Good choice of breakfast cooked cereals croissants rolls fruit meats tea coffee fruit juices from 6 30 10 30 Perfect location for public transport around city 
307337,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, N A, The staffing was excellent supportive courteous and over all very friendly very helpful and totally enjoyed our stay Looking forward to seeing them all again 
307338,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam,No Negative, Staff were very cooperative clean rooms and location was excellent almost near to every thing We loved this Hotel and whenever I come to Amsterdam I will always be in this hotel
307339,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The hop on hop off bus boat service whilst nice to get orientated is expensive at 23 per day when compared to the 7 50 per day for the whole tram system In my view buy a map and use the trams , I was concerned to read some of the views expressed by other travellers around the difference between the original Victoria Hotel and the new urban wing The room we had was an Executive in the original wing and was large comfortable and well equipped I accept that the d cor and design could be considered a little dated but as someone who has spent more than 1000 nights in hotels over the past fifteen years there was in my view very little to complain about The location of the hotel is ideal as it is just across the road from Centraal Station the tram and bus hub as well as being close to the harbours for both canal tours and ferry connections Indeed public transport right across Amsterdam is frequent and offers good value for money Adjacent to the hotel are two of the main roads Damrak Nieuwezijds Voorburgal leading to many shops and a restaurants One those recommended was Het Karbeel in Warmeostraat offering a diverse menu good wine and great service Had a blast only glitch was getting home and would definitely stay at the Park Plaza Victoria Hotel again 
307340,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Room 229 was not suitable for older people The beds were up steep stairs in a loft the shower was useless as it was tucked under the stairwell and you could not get close without banging your head We moved to a normal type hotel room the next day , Close to station trams and buses Staff were very friendly and helpfull Concierge service was excellent 
307341,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Rude staff improper key system which made us change our keys SIX times and even with accusations from the staff that it is our fault that the key is not working Poor breakfast buffet , Only the location
307342,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Rooms looks like very old type and need to be renovated , It is very near to the Amsterdam central As well as cruise boat place Most of the shopping spree are covered near by area 
307343,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The fact that at the price we paid it didnt have the regular luxury hotel amenities such as a swimming pool or steam room or a gym, The location and the ease of access was amazing The place was clean
307344,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Our room allocated on the first night was difficult to get to and pokey We were moved after complaining to a much better room for the remaining 3 nights , Very helpful and friendly staff especially the concierge 
307345,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Room was small and no luggage rack and very little storage Kind of quirky the way rooms wind around Not as good a value as other hotels on our trip , Loved the location Close to train station shopping etc staff was nice 
307346,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Breakfast should be included in price executive room booked upgraded to suite but suite a little dated paid over 800 disappointed in upgrade, Excellent location lovely lobby bar
307347,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Paid for a double bed and 2 single beds had been pushed together not a great view from the window Also a bit overpriced for what you get , The location was great
307348,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We booked the hotel because we thought the rooms looked so nice in pictures and we wanted to have a romantic luxury stay when booking I was asked if i prefer a room with a sea view and uppercase I marked yes I even booked the more expensive room We got a room 116 on the first floor The room was ok but nothing compared to any pictures we had seen the bathroom was tiny and hair drier was not working As we were only staying there for one night we didn t have time to ask them to move us to a different room , The location of the hotel was excellent the staff was professional
307349,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The hotel ran a little late with our room readiness eg check in time but they did work to expedite the turn over and did offer some unsolicited amends to our delay , Friendliness of the staff and willingness to help problem solve 
307350,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We were offered a room in either the traditional or more modern wing of the Hotel and given the opportunity to change if we wanted We chose the traditional wing and stayed in room 418 Whilst it was comfortable and clean it was quite a depressing looking room with Windows looking at back of house walls right up close We weren t going to be spending much time in the room over the two days so didn t bother to change , Having arrived from the airport by train the hotel was in an excellent location Stay was very pleasant Staff were very friendly and welcoming Gin and tonics in the cocktail bar were the best 
307351,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Deceptive advertising of 4 Star rating that can only be described as a tired run down hotel worthy of no more than 2 stars The cost for three days can only be for the location because there was nothing else worth mentioning We we given a small back room with a very worn out bed after complaining we were moved to another room which although better was still worn and tired The hotel has two sections one obviously newer and better appointed There was no mentioned of the difference between hotel room standards on Booking com except the room description e g Superior Room Clearly there is no quality checking done of hotel premises by Booking con Very disappointed and spoiled our first visit to Amsterdam , Location and toiletries
307352,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Room could have been cleaned and mini bar and toiletries replenished, Room was very dusty didn t replenish the toiletries or towels or mini bar had to keep asking them to do it and still after requesting still wasn t done They also billed us 150 for smoking in the room which did not happen
307353,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The bar wasn t opened during the day for a coffee sandwich I was looking to have a coffee in the morning as we had selected accommodation only disappointed it was closed , The location couldn t be better 
307354,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, But we had two single beds pushed together so in the night they would push apart and I would wake up in a little gap, Very modern room which was really clean Also big wardrobe with a generous amount of hangers Lovely bathroom All round lovely place
307355,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Bathroom lighting like many European hotels was dark Bathroom door allowed noises to be heard by all in room Not great if you re bashful about bathroom duties , Location is excellent for access to Centraal Station Urban room was relatively modern and clean No view quiet room so we were fine with that 
307356,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Price is slightly high however overall 10 10, Staff very welcoming and helpful and attentive but not overpowering Concierge Peter excellent Location excellent 
307357,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Nothing Everything was perfect , Excellent free toiletries room cleaned each day nothing was too much trouble The staff made every effort to make our stay wonderful and memorable 
307358,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Room is very very small and old Shower room is also very small while water pressure is extremely low and I took at least double my time for shower Hairdryer does not function well and power will switch off 10 seconds after runnung in strong mode due to overheated Room is dim as not sufficient lightings and lamps , Location which is close to Central station
307359,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam,No Negative, Service was great facilities were also very good We were also upgraded at no extra cost Would certainly recommend to anyone going to Amsterdam Location was also excellent a stones throw from Cental Station
307360,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Spa is over a bridge and a little difficult to find , Room size is large Bathroom good Nice toiletries product in superior room Near to central station Staff very helpful Bed is nice 
307361,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, a The check in was a disaster and the staff was condescending and not helpful at all b Not flexible staff and hotel c I check in late and incur 1 night no show fee and even then the staff tell me to wait for my room when i was suppose to already be in the room d un necessary upsell, a only location
307362,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Hotel s in a great central location but this did mean some traffic noise but not enough to detract from enjoyment of stay , Staff were excellent and hotel generally had excellent facilities 
307363,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The poor wifi system The cooked breakfast though great choice good have been warmer also the dishes were hot for yogurt and fruit , The room was very good towels good and the bed was comfy
307364,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We booked an average room which in general was ok however compared to the photos we looked at when booking it was tired and a little dismal , All the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful from arrival to departure Good location I would definitely stay here again
307365,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Breakfast is OK but there are cheaper options in the city with a better breakfast The gym is pretty small and water is only available in glasses not ideal if you use the treadmill , Hotel is situated just next to Amsterdam Centraal trains to from Schiphol Airport It is as well close to most attractions The room has a good size 
307366,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Rooms in the old wing need a refurbish Carpet had burn marks and room smell a bit musty Need a ramp for rolling heavy luggage to the lobby , Location very convenient just across the road from the centraal station The canal cruises start opposite the hotel and is the pick up location for most tours Good view from the room Right room temperature Much Larger rooms compared to some others I have stayed in Amsterdam 
307367,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The waiting time at the check in desk was excessive I checked in early in the morning and my room was not ready however to get the key I had to wait for a almost 30 minutes after my meeting which risked putting off my dinner arrangements The room d cor is somewhat tired and would need updating very soon It is quite expensive as a hotel although most hotels in Amsterdam are , The location of the hotel is excellent basically walking distance from all the main attractions and meeting venues The staff where nice and provided all the necessary assistance 
307368,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, while we checked in the hotel blocked the full amount And when we checked out they took the amount again said that this is pre autorisation and money will be unblocked soon But my bank said that hotel had blocked money for 30 days and they cant change it ,No Positive
307369,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, overpriced hotel given the medium standard of facilities the entire hotel feels somehow outdated particularly in respect of rooms with smelly old darkish carpets everywhere the place has no atmosphere tiny bathroom no sound protection, location gym sauna shared with nearby Arthotel is ok but opening hours in the evening are limited
307370,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Unhelpful staff that chose to just see you struggle with luggages and baby strollers up the steps to the hotel reception and down the steps to the hotel exit door every day I was there for 5 days and no offer of help Front desk personnel was cold Imagine coming in from a 5 hr travel only to be told that you have to buy a bottle of mineral water as the hotel do not provide any complimentary water This is the first hotel that I know of within the same categories of hotel that does not provide a complimentary bottled mineral water in the room The checking out time is 12 noon and not even a slight extension till 1pm is allowed This I can understand and most of the time is due to in coming guests checking in at 2pm thus require the room but to be told that I have to pay for that hour of extension just reaffirmed my belief that service is last on this hotel s list , near to the Centraal Station which we will be arriving and departing from 
307371,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, All perfect , Perfect location staff very polite and helpful My room was amazing they even upgraded me without my asking Excellent value Had an amazing stay Nothing to note on the negative side 
307372,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Room at Victoria wing really need refurbishment Room s lighting is dark Floor board squeaking sound Carpet looks dirty and stained Very pricey for 209 per night Without breakfast , Location close to central station Tea facilities in room 
307373,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We stayed at the hotel years ago and it did not disappoint this trip in fact it is better than we remembered , The staff service was outstanding The location was perfect The restaurant was very good
307374,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Breakfast is overpriced but i have to say is very good , Concierge was great sorted us out with tickets for the Anne Frank house at the last minute He was so friendly and helpful 
307375,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Breakfast too expensive if all you want is coffee and a bowl of fruit Alternative facility didn t open until later in the morning , Great location reasonable sized room 
307376,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, First room was a disaster Heater was on walking in holes in the curtains stains on the carpet and a terrible bed , After having seen the first room I asked for an upgrade which I received free of charge It was better however definitely not what I thought I would get for paying over 260euro s a night 
307377,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Nothing, The hotel location was superb The staff were extremely nice especially the manager PETER he even allowed us to keep our luggages when we left for Brussels It s so convenient Even when we came back to Amsterdam we stayed at AirBnB He even called us the cab and gave us access to freshen up at the hotel s toilet before we took off for our AirBNB apartment We were amazed at their hospitality We regret for not staying at Park PLaza Victoria for the rest of our stay We should have I really recommend the place
307378,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, This hotel is nowhere near a 4 star hotel I don t think it s worth a 1 star The room smelled the floorboards creek throughout the room I was in and above the sheets were like sand paper and bed very hard and lumpy The front desk staff was very unfriendly doing you a big favour I wouldn t recommend this hotel and I have stayed at many a hotels in all my years of travel , Location
307379,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, i was very happy with the hotel so i decided to extend stay another 3 night when I approach the reception staff lady call Jane asking for extension rate she gives me double price of my first 3 night stay when i asked why price has jumped that much she claim that hotel was full house while the floor where i was staying almost empty during my stay the most disappointed think make me walk away decided not to come back in this hotel again here reply to me when I ask here for better rate as i already stay 3 night she reply take it or leave it this is free world i felt this is not proper way to speak with customer , location only 
307380,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We had a girl in front desk She was checking us in on Monday evening 4th of April She was unprofessional also no information about anything I mean breakfast because we had included and spa facilities Need more training , I really like it room We got upgrade on the room Because our previous room wasn t clean Duty manager her name Mariengela she fixed everything so fast big thank you for her 
307381,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We were located in Victorian wing executive floor which I believe needs major renovation Carpet bed and bathroom need to be changed and renovated Heating was just reasonably well Wish had a better view of Amsterdam , Breakfast was enjoyable Location was good Hotel has its own history Pool and Gym were good 
307382,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Room probably should ve had a bath for the cost and the bed was twin not a double, Fantastic staff brought my fianc a present as it was her birthday during our stay
307383,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Breakfast was quite expensive at 24 so we ate out instead The spa area is is very small and only consists of a sauna and a few chairs to lie on with a small pool That said we didn t spend a lot of time there , The location could not be better right in the heart of Amsterdam close to all forms of transport and easy walking distance to all the sights 
307384,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, I think that the overall cost was higher than a number of other hotels with similar facilities, Very helpful staff Location Breakfast and availability till 11am 
307385,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Nothing, Staff of hotel are very professional and helpful room is very large and comfortable and hotels is located in best area which it is close to every thing
307386,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Hotel room that was advertised on their website wasn t what I received being offered an upgrade through email I accepted was totally shocked as to what I was given room was very dirty carpets bathroom bed very uncomfortable very bad smell throughout a short time in the room was alerted to banging on the door and group of for men and one woman were standing outside accused me of smoking in the room which I wasn t was made to pay a fine of 300 felt totally intimidated by rude and arrogant staff breakfast each morning of our stay was cold and the room was freezing was promised a bath but hence no bath was promised a view which turned out to be a brick wall I would never recommend this hotel to anyone worst experience I have had staying in The PARK PLAZA VICTORIA AMSTERDAM, Why I booked hotel it was close to all points of interest
307387,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, I was on my engagement with my partner so we had the do not disturb sign on door on the 2nd day of our stay in the afternoon the room telephone had rang several times then got woke up to heavy banging at door then heard keys trying to open door so I jumped up and opened it and there was a female and male member of staff the male was very arrogant he said they wanted to know why the do not disturb sign was on my door for over a day I told them I was on my engagement that s why so then he started threating me with 300 euro fine if was caught smoking in room which me and partner had not had 1 smoke in that room while we were there then he demanded to enter the room to check for smoke so let him in and he didn t look to pleased there was no sign of smoking so they left I was very annoyed at this after getting woke up, Location was perfect for central station damrak etc Room was nice but bed was very old and soft not very comfortable at all for a executive room
307388,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Wish the lounge bar area was open in the daytime Slow service in Brasserie Variable internet speeds , Urban rooms are a good size with bathroom having a large walk in shower Active club pool small but very tasteful Brilliant selection at buffet breakfast Concierge very helpful 
307389,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, There was not anything that we didn t like , King size bed very comfortable room and was upgraded free Shoe cleaners and ice machines in the corridor Nice pool and spa area which was free to hotel guests 
307390,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Certain areas of the hotel could stand to be updated and smelled a bit funny , The hotel was very well situated in the center of town the beds were reasonably comfortable and the rooms were quiet a non trivial feat given that it was in the middle of Easter weekend which is one of the most crowded times of year 
307391,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Expensive breakfast We went to the nice bars and restaurants near the hotel Very good breakfast in a half price , Very good location All famous and popular attractions are very close to the hotel Very nice hotel Absolutely recommended 
307392,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Altough the breakfast buffet was very tasty for 19 per day and per person a larger choice and more variation over the days would have been appreciated Some parts of the Hotel and rooms are getting quite old and should be refreshed e g the moquette overall in the Urban wing , The location is top just in front of Central Station Most of the staff was very friendly and competent The room was not available as requested but we obtained an upgrade to a Junior Suite in exchange The breakfast was always very tasty The beds were super confortable 
307393,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The threshold on the bathroom door was lethal Elderly or frail guests could well have a nasty accident especially at night , Excellent helpful staff in every department Very good range of choices at breakfast Very convenient location 
307394,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The older section of the hotel smelled musty, Close to Central Railway station canals and within easy walking distance of attractions Good value for money
307395,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The room could have been cleaner Cigarette ends on windowsill The decor is outdated but that wasn t that much of an issue Lighting in room was poor , Location was perfect as I came via Eurostar Not far to carry bags Staff were helpful and pleasant I needed a taxi and they sorted it for me 
307396,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, There was nothing I didnt like then again I didnt like the fact that I had to leave but Ill be back again hopefully , The bed was extremely comfy staff very friendly hotel easily accessable
307397,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Jurgen on reception made us feel cheap and a little bit criminal because we hadn t appreciated the hotel required 75 euros as a deposit for any added sundries incurred What if our trip had been a present and we only had enough money to spend on the weekend He was unpleasant unhelpful perhaps homophobic Will not be returning , Beds were comfortable
307398,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Told that the Superior Room is in fact their Standard Room Very disappointing , Very small room Carpets throughout are dingy and tattered 
307399,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The bed was two singles pushed together not a problem but the mattresses kept coming apart making it very uncomfortable , The location was perfect the staff were soo lovely 
307400,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We asked for a toothpaste 4 times and it arrived on on the 5th time I asked to talk to the manager and she didnt seem to care a lot That is the only bad experience we had during our stay , The rooms were very clean Good facilities Good location 
307401,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The front desk personnel very rude unfriendly we have had arranged to check in at 9 am instead of 2pm with their written confirmation They ignored our request and their written confirmation we waited 5 hours at the reception for the promised early check in after 9 hours travel from Toronto Even if the expensive room was payed in advance you will not get in without paying in advance a guarantee of 75 euro for the theoretical minibar consumption You may lose the room if you do not want to pay the minibar before you even eat the peanuts and drink the mineral water It was very cold in the room even with the radiator set at level 5 The shower drainage was stopped it was almost a bath instead of a short shower This hotel is only wanting your money without offering some good service instead ,No Positive
307402,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, They were painting the hallways of the floor we were on but they were quiet and respectful of noise in the mornings , Fantastic right from the start From the check in even though we aren t Club members we were treated very well The rooms were clean and neat we were lucky enough and they gave us an upgraded room which was great cleaning staff another great Just one of the few hotels we stayed at in our month long trip through Europe that lived up to and surpassed expectations We used to stay at the Renaissance around the corner for years the couple of dollars you may spend extra here will be well worth the quiet rooms The laundry charges are a bit much but you can always walk down and do it at the laundry mat that they were happy to point out to us 
307403,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, When the receptionist discovered I was travelling alone I was allocated a very poor room with 2 single beds stained carpets and in the attic I refused this room as I had proof of advance payment for a superior room which the receptionist chose to ignore on my arrival I had to complain before I was allocated the correct standard of room Also the housekeeping staff appeared just after 0900hrs on my departure day and asked me to vacate the room 0900hrs on a Sunday morning , Very comfortable room although the domestic staff were slow to make up the room after the first night of my stay After 1500hrs before that happened 
307404,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The rooms were tired and smelt a bit damp musty My room was freezing cold and my colleague s boiling hot not easy to regulate No irons in the rooms although reception said there were should know their product They auto charged credit cards despite being asked not to , Location and restaurant bar team they have good service skills
307405,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We did not notice any fire Exit signs though fire extinguishers were evident , Location comfort and the staff were helpful and informative There was a no smoking policy Our room 267 was pleasant with a large comfortable bed 
307406,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Slightly over priced compared with other hotels of similar standard, Breakfast was excellent room was clean and comfortable shower and bathroom ticked all the boxes room service was consistently good
307407,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, When I booked this of the website of booking com it says that they have parking place but When I went there there was no any parking place there and I have to park my car far from Hotel Second problem was that the room that gave us first on first floor the drain stink and smell very bad They changed our Room and give us another room on second floor This Room has not a good view to outside Bed room was on second floor and the space for shower was very small and the hight of that was very short, It was in center of Amsterdam and exactly against Central Station

307409,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, This has to be the worst experience I have ever had in a hotel in my life of travel I ve been offended the receptionist tried to rob me and the rudeness of the staff unbelievable except Tania the duty manager she is the nicest person in the hotel or in Amsterdam Just to get your attention to the problems I faced 1 I got scammed with the room I booked an Executive Double room through Booking com which is not the cheapest room there but I want to treat myself good in my long waited vacation The room is AMAZING in pictures however the room that they gave me was an ancient room really old and does not look like the room in the pictures So I talked to the receptionist her name is Ine about this and she started to convince me that my room is a good room and that it has a coffee machine in it I said that I appreciate the gesture but no thanks so she tried to push me into paying for an upgrade and she kept insisting on it After she failed convincing me she gave me an Urban wing room smaller and cheaper room with no sort of compensation other than breakfast coupons for 2 days not even for the full stay 2 Smoking in the room On the first night Marieangela and her colleague came to my room with a bad attitude felt like I broke into the hotel not paid for the room She kept shouting about me smoking in the room I told her that I respect the rules and I asked at the front desk if the hotel does have a smoking room and they said no so I didn t and will not smoke in the room She threatened to call the police and throw me out of the hotel if I didn t pay the 300 fine So I had to comply as I have just arrived from a long day of traveling and I didn t want to sleep in the streets as all the other decent hotels are either fully booked or triple the rate for such short notice Mariangela has shouted at me threatened me and gave me the attitude of you are not welcome in this hotel , The location is superb

307457,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, I paid 200 Euro for one night It s very expensive for a so old Hotel with old and gloomy rooms It s a 4 Star not 5 Star Hotel Never again , The location is very good 
307458,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Make sure you check the full amount before putting your card in as they will charge extra hidden charges Even though my room was great the smell that came from the drains need sorting the smell was so unbarring that i had to keep the balcony door open and heating on blast , The location of the hotel was amazing and loved the fact that there was a balcony facing the station I also loved that fact that you had a fantastic choice of tv programmes In English and also the same plug sockets from England which helped us out as my friend forgot her adaptor The staff members that are there to help by the revolving doors are AMAZING always happy to help great personalities and made my stay extremely pleasurable I would defiantly come back to this hotel because of the men at the doors and the location

307465,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The room was extremely basic and dated the bath was to small lol I was expecting a bit more for the price we paid Breakfast was 19 euro per person Considering the cafes do a lovely one for 7 euro you would need to be able to do a few runs at the buffet to justify the cost The gym was very very basic and upon arrival we gad to pay an extra 75 euro as an insurance for the room which if you had budgeted for the cost of the room only youd be sunk Value for money id advise looking elsewhere , The location is superb Directly opposite the train station Very easy to find and close to most of the sights

307474,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, There was a loud banging noise the first night After talking with reception they swapped our room which was much better The first room we had was a little dated for the amount we paid for it I feel that the hotel was a little over priced for what we got Location was brilliant ,No Positive
307475,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam,No Negative, I stayed here in December with a group of friends and we all agreed it was a great choice It is located at the Central Train Station and is within easy walking distance of sights and nightlife The staff were very helpful for those unsure of directions or places of interest and had plenty of suggestions for food and entertainment without just trying to get us to only spend money in the hotel There seemed to be two staff members in the door for this The rooms were comfortable clean and well appointed as were the bathrooms with quality toiletries Dinner was very good if a bit expensive All in all a great stay here Would definitely return and also highly recommend to others 
307476,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, There s quite a few stairs to pull your heavy suitcase up before you get to the reception desk and there wasn t anyone to help The lad on check in wasn t the best when I paid he told me there was no PDQ slip and when I told him there must have been he produced the scrumpled one he d just thrown in the bin , The contemporary room style The pool The location

307485,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, the tea and coffee kettle are right up the cupboard hard to reach if you are average size and not easy to see since it is behind closed door , the pool was nice the double bed very comfortable Excellent situation just opposite the train station you can leave your baggage with the concierge on the last day of your stay and see a bit more of the city without having to take your case everywhere 
307486,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The only minor detail is that they ask for room key when comingr back late weird but hey all for safety right , Awesome location right across main train station Minutes away from major attractions like Anne Frank s house the canal boats and the Rijksmuseum Van Gogh museums 15 20 min walk Not in red light area yet close

307491,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Staff were miserable and unprofessional at check in and check out They seemed more interested in registering guests to their loyalty scheme than actually talking to people Staff allowed people to push in the queue when checking out which was very frustrating , Hotel in an excellent location opposite central station and 5 minutes walk to Dam Square and the shopping district Fantastic toiletries they use Elemis

307500,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, I secured my room via Booking there was a box available to check if I desired a quiet room What this really means is you will be placed in the old wing of the hotel Yes it s quiet but it is also greatly in need of refurbishing Definitely not worth 150 200 per nite , Location is ideal as its directly across from the train station central metro Staff is friendly Facility is clean 
307501,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Urban rooms are located in other building with no exit you have 5 minutes until you get out of the hotel no smoking allowed so if you are a smoker or weeder you have to get dressed and take a 5 minutes journey until you get you cigarette I think that the hotel should warn about it, the location is great value for money Urban rooms are beautiful

307514,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, the lobby is very small without any place to sit while the reception is busy If the rooms are give in the urban block then we need to walk a bit to transfer to the other block , Very good location 
307515,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We got a Superior room and now I regret I didn t book an Urban room The room was cold and there was no view whatsoever The other part of the hotel was literary 2 meters away For the amount of money I paid for 2 nights I thought I d get a much better room , The hotel is very nice Top location just opposite the Amsterdam Central Station and very close to Madame Tussaud s and other attractions Breakfast was really good Didn t use the sauna and pool so I can t comment on it 
307516,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The d cor was not reflective of a 4 star hotel The bathroom was dirty with hair and dust on arrival and the paint was chipped on the walls all over the bedroom The smart television did not work for the internet and although it had a USB point into it this did not work either This is quite surprising for a hotel used to accommodate business clients , The staff were helpful although the queue to check in was 8 people deep when I arrived and no one apologised for this taking so long The hotel was in a prime location 
307517,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Way overpriced the swimming pool was cold and the spa too small Breakfast for 19 euros Seriously people The mattress was, Location was perfect good view and room The employees were smiling and ready to help
307518,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, A 4 star hotel absolutely overpriced the room crying for some make over to bring it into the 21st century Staff was rather arrogant than service oriented starting with the check in and ending with the concierge But the clue was that you have to beg if you want to use the rest rooms in the lobby area They are locked by card to avoid tourists using them which is understandable But I believe the easiest way would be to contract more people controlling the access to the hotel a bit better For the security of the guests but also to grant an atmosphere different to the one you have opposite in the railway station And if guests than complain you should not give them a lecture that s how I felt I stayed in lots of different hotels in Amsterdam that one was with distance a really bad experience , Honestly Not much the building is nice and location ok Next door caf is amazing 
307519,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, When we arrived we were told we could take a very small room or could have a larger room but with twin beds not ideal When we looked at the small room it was tiny and no bath We went back to reception who then miraculously found a decent sized double room We took it Then we were in reception later that evening we heard the reception staff pulling the same stunt on another couple Would have felt a bit cheated if we had not spoken up , the location is fantastic
307520,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The size of the rooms also it wasn t the pictures that was on the site when I purchased the room Poor bathroom with a weak shower and no room to move , The location was excellent
307521,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Not comfy bed took extra 60 off us wifi not too good in our room location near central station which was quit long walk to canals super cold pool almost no channels in tv two days in wasnt working at all asked for balcony to smoke and got balcony which doesnt even open ridiculous bad view, Big rooms sauna and gym
307522,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful check in was prompt and there was no problem leaving our bags with concierge after we check out We did not use any of the facilities however they are looked great 
307523,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Very bad smell in the room bathroom is dirty everywhere somebody s hair uncomfortable bed Room is too small and old After one night decided to move to another hotel, Good location nice staff
307524,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam,No Negative, Excellent location superior hotel with friendly and helpful staff Room was spacious and comfortable with the added bonus of a balcony Food excellent especially the breakfast 
307525,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, There wasn t anything I didn t like , The rooms were great and the bar in lobby had excellent service I loved the view from our room and the robe and slippers made for a very comfortable stay 
307526,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Bad experience with room mini bar The bottles had been used and recapped filled with water Bottles had a white green scum floating in the end of them Very unpleasant which made my partner physically sick after drinking before realising , The location was great Check in was pleasant 
307527,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, I had arranged a upgraded room which took till 5 30pm to be able to check in too I also asked for a breakfast to the room as it was my fiances 30th birthday which was completly forgotton on the day even tho they told me it would be without fail be recognized and they would do there upmost to make it special ,No Positive
307528,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The room was dark no light at all and the view was showing the fire stair case The bed sheets were not properly clean and in front of the bed there was a second door blocked with some white tape Someone walk in the room couple of minute after we were checked in and after seeing the luggage next to the door left without even apologise Most of the wall paint was falling down next to the bed and behind the night table Besides the poor conditions of the room we also felt left alone after the check in Was hard to catch the attention of the staff no one showed us the way to our room and We also had to take the luggage to the room is not what to expect from a 4 hotel , The location was good and the staff we met at the check in desk was friendly 
307529,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam,No Negative, The hotel was in the perfect location is in beautiful internally and externally Staff were extremely helpful and the hotels butterscotch martini was to die for 
307530,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Charged on credit card also held my booking for fullamount on my visa card bedroom was good but you could not move in the bathroom it was so small, Location staff food
307531,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, i reserved a room with central station view and was given last minute by a trainee another room with the worst view ever looking into other buildings Very disappointing, prime location
307532,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, A few things about the hotel are unfortunately quite negative General The hotel looks run down and like something that is barely surviving on the value of its location and name Beyond that it is quite dark dingy and dirty looking Better alternative is the Arthotel right next door part of the same group Specifics about the rooms and experience Room 1 Nr 227 We booked a room with two single beds We arrived and it was a double room The room we had received was dirty i e the bed looked like someone lay in it and towels were lying on the bathroom floor Room 2 Nr 416 Thankfully we complained and were given another room but In this room the minibar didn t work We told reception this who promised to fix it the next day This didn t happen The carpet was in need of serious cleaning , The location is incredible Decent selection of international television channels 
307533,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The price was very expensive No breakfast The room still had the last occupants dirty socks and rubbish left in The room was too hot and the window didn t open so struggled to sleep , The location was good 
307534,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Nothing really , A well located hotel with courteous and professional staff the urban wing was perfectly modernised and the rooms were spacious Breakfast had nice variety 
307535,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The netting across our window building Although I know this is for health and safety , The bar swimming pool sauna Able to store bags before our flight home Very helpful Clean 
307536,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Very minor but the check out line was ridiculously long Maybe more staff at this time would have helped , This hotel was in a perfect location with all main attractions within walking distance We stayed in the new wing the urban room all decor was modern and clean and the facilities were great Delicious breakfast with lots of option as well Beautiful hotel overall 
307537,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Room 157 is very noisy There is a service door which cleaners use and where other staff come and go regularly each morning The door bangs very loudly continuously which is very unpleasant Each morning I asked the staff to close the door quietly but without any success , The Urban wing is much better although you will pay more I would return to this hotel as the location is excellent 
307538,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, some noise coming in from street below and I had a quiet room at the very back of the hotel so at least no noise from other guests corridors etc showing their age but it is a historic building , friendly staff excellent albeit expensive breakfast very central location 
307539,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Bit far from Rembrandt where the clubs are, Good central location to dam square and red light district and also directly opposite central station Staff very friendly and willing to help
307540,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Coffee machine not working No milk No biscuits Did not restock the toilet roll Fire exit signs not very good The lift not marked properly Breakfast not too hot , Location excellent
307541,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, I found the afternoon evening staff a little unwelcoming After I returned to the hotel one evening a lady asked me what I was doing in the hotel and if I was lost I can only assume she thought the hotel was too good for me which I find quite rude It may have been because I was wearing a rugby top but who knows I told her I was staying in the hotel and she looked me up and down and said oh right and left Quite rude , Hotel was lovely and clean Most staff were lovely especially one guy on the concierge desk I didn t get his name but he was chirpy every day 
307542,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Slow but free internet The view was the worst I have ever seen from a hotell room Beyond terrible I liked the hotel and would stay again if they could give me a room with street view instead of ductwork and no daylight , Great location Walk to Central train station Near restaurants and shopping Nice small room Plenty big for one Old building Good breakfast Hot water Clean Friendly staff 
307543,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The location was loud the beds we re extremely uncomfortable our mini bar was never replenished Also our room wasn t available at 2pm when we we re supposedly allowed to check in ,No Positive
307544,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Simply not the best value for money For your money s worth you can get much better in terms of room facilities etc , The location is perfect the train station is right across the hotel and you are in the heart of Amsterdam where all the shops and restaurants are in walking distance 
307545,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The sunlight was very intense on the days I stayed It revealed all manner of dust and dirt on the walls of my room I was not impressed , Good location
307546,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The hotel room was very dull and dirty looking I book a junior suite and it was nothing like the the pictures that were shown on the website basically well over priced, I liked the location but not much else
307547,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Zero , Excellent location immediately across from Central Station Tour Boat docks Hop on Hop off bus stop immediately down the street from Dam Square Perfect location Staff were exceptional Concierge helped with many tasks storing luggage securely while we waited to check in assisted with tour tickets and most importantly assisted with securing a doctor when my wife became ill Doctor came to the hotel room twice Sidewalk caf outside the hotel was excellent spot for people watching nice waiting staff cold drinks all very nice Room was very clean and kept that way Bed was very comfortable with nice pillows Our stay was very great 
307548,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam,No Negative, friendly staff room got upgraded for free spacious walking distance from most attractions coffee shops and the red light district great view from window where we stayed
307549,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The bathroom was old and did not suit my expectatios it differed from the pictures on booking com , The room was quiet clean and comfortable I did not expect the ledder in the room it was 1 5 floor room but as far as I did not have kids this did not cause problems Breakfast was not bad 
307550,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, It would be great to have a reasonably priced breakfast , Great location near the train station Helpful and friendly staff Great bar area Very good restaurant Clean rooms 
307551,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, No sliper for the toilets when i request from the room service they said it is available for suits only Although i book superior room with view But later they bring me the sliper just to tip them It seems no proffisional in this act, Location was perfect 
307552,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The internet wifi was a bit confusing to set up I think the internet cable in the room was redundant Would be good to remove it or make this clear , Friendly efficient and helpful staff Room was large and comfortable
307553,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, I stayed at the old wing Old fashion room noise from floor when walked I killed 4 small flies inside my toilet Most of the staffs are not very friendly While we were gathering for dinner in the lobby the concierge staff came and shouted to us for no reason Even we present our room cards he refused to apologize and suggest us can make a complaint , Good location but very crowded once you step outside the hotel main entrance
307554,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We booked an executive room but it was very dark with minimal natural light The cleanliness of the room was also on the poor side, Location and friendly staff
307555,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The wifi didn t work in the assigned room so the staff were really obliging and moved us to another room The room we end up was not large but it was clean and comfortable , Central location close to hop on hop off boats and buses 
307556,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Breakfast was not included and expensive even with pre booking as I was travelling on business expenses I had to eat nearby instead but there are some lovely places to do so , Reception staff were absolutely superb and welcoming
307557,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, As above, Just too expensive for what it had to offer the place was tired poor carpets corridors and reception area needed uplift tray table at dude if bed was filthy
307558,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Carpet flooring is old and smelly , Location just a few meters away from the main station the dam and the red light district is perfect The concierge can give you some tips on the what and where
307559,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Weak WiFi the room cleaning service could use a bit of improvement as the carpets were a bit dirty and furniture sometimes dusty But nothing too serious , Location is excellent the stuff is very helpful Large room with a big bed and comfortable pillows Even tough its near the central station the room has good soundproofing 
307560,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Everything was PERFECT , Good location nearby car parking very friendly staff so impressed with the house keeping work diffidently recommend staying here if visiting Amsterdam 
307561,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Nothing, Perfect location You take the train from amsterdam schipol airport and after 3 stops you are at the central station Just right infront of central station is this luxurious hotel Its walking distance to everything you need to see and tram stop is steps away Will come again every time am in amsterdam Go for the executive room v spacious and great view 
307562,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The wifi was a little spotty couldn t connect 1 2 the time , The hotel was within walking distance of just about everything shopping restaurants museums and attractions and very close to the train station 
307563,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The cooked breakfast was a slight let down The chicken sausages were very strange , The hotel was beautiful It was spotless and comfortable The best thing about it was the staff Every single person we dealt with went above and beyond their remit in order to help us I will definately be going there again A lady called Ine on reception was very kind and helpful to my family 
307564,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The rooms were old looking and worn down but at the end of the day did their job The wifi connection was very weak in the room and lobby , Very well located in Amsterdam Centre Across the road from Train Station and trams with direct trains to Schiphol Airport every 15 mins The AC worked perfectly and the room was nice and cool 
307565,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Room was directly next to restaurant kitchen and smelled like old yucky grease It permeated everything even after spraying air freshener Had we stayed more than one night I would have moved , Convenient location GREAT location actually 
307566,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Too far from museum quarter and good parks zoo restaurant shopping Location good only for central station and dum maybe for canal tours , Brasseries good food breakfast good Swimming pool but lock was broken and a last few days couldn t get it without an assistance that had to wait a bit in a stuffy small corridor Bed very comfortable though mattress and mattress cover flame resistant which is not good for you if you know what I mean Stuff helpful people very nice in general in Amsterdam
307567,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Staff not very Polite and need to be slightly more Hospitality minded House keeping needs to pull up their socks , Very Good Location Walking distance from Central Station and the CitySighSeeing Bus virtually originates from DoorStep 
307568,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Restaurant closed i think around 9pm Breakfast to dear not standard charge plus disorganised I didn t realise there was a pool facilities not explained on check in, directly across from train station Beds so comfortable Elemis toiletries Staff really nice and helpful
307569,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We can hear all the noises and the door knock all around our corridor, Location was perfect also the breakfast and the breakfast room Our room was very big we really enjoyed
307570,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, dated tired rooms mine looked out to another wall with other windows looking in at me Suspect that these types of rooms are reserved for Booking com and other hotel websites you may think you have a bargain compered to hotels own rates but you haven t so be warned , Location was near to railway station and only 10 mins from central shopping area
307571,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Some attention to detail lacking on a couple of aesthetic features such as paint on skirting and bottom of room door having some wood chips , Staff were very friendly our Executive room was very spacious and the location is perfect 
307572,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Housekeeping left much to be desired The bed was just pulled up with a crumpled bottom sheet dirt and fluff were in all corners of the room , The position was close to all amenities The concierge was very helpful 
307573,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Not much Probably higher tempeature in sauna would be better , Really friendly staff the best in 4 hotels I had stayed this time Good location nice pool 
307574,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The superior room didn t live up to the name I would have hated to book just a double cause it seemed that s what it was or less, Central location from train station helpful staff regarding tourist info etc
307575,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Changed rooms because bed in first room had springs sticking out This was done without issue but left us thinking that if they know the bed is dreadful they should replace it , Location is fantastic 
307576,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The WI FI was so so so bad like there wasn t an Internet inside the room and I complained many times to the staff and there wasn t any solution for these problem, Its location was very good
307577,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Lack of friendliness of staff in particular housekeeping and breakfast waiters waitresses , Great location value for money comforatble room The gentleman by name Peter at the Concierge was very helpful and friendly 
307578,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, They need to get both computers linked to the printer it s crazy to have to wait to use computer 2 if you want something printed out The person who was hogging 2 didn t even need to print anything at all , Concierge was brilliant he made our stay all the better with help on day trips etc 
307579,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, They charged me for breakfast when I clearly said j don t want it during checkin They refused to credit the difference even though we never ate their breakfast, Location

307582,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Filthy carpets in corridors and room French window doors closed so no way to get fresh air View obstructed by security net Rate to high in relation to poor conditions of room , Location
307583,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, the room smelled like cigarrettes even though it was a non smoking room sometimes can get noisy since it faced the tram and the canals but at night its okay, the reception at the staff were very friendly i had an executive room which was very spacious and overlooked the canal the bed was huge and very comfortable
307584,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Everything was up to the highest standard No disappointments , Lovely breakfast ordered the same one every day because it was so nice Beds and rooms are very comfortable staff was very welcoming and polite Will be staying here again 100 Very happy customer 
307585,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Bed was two twins pushed together it had a hole to fall into which I did We were in the Urban wing which meant we had a bit of a labrynth to navigate to get to our room from the hotel entrance exit it involved traversing two elevators and walking aross a bridge not a big deal but just a bit annoying after a long night on the town The urban wing was nice though , Clean roomy nicely decorated great location next to train station and downtown Walking distance from almost everything if you re OK walking a couple miles to the museum only minutes from red light district Friendly staff 
307586,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The mini bar was quite expensive so bring your own , The staff are a credit to the hotel friendly and informative and nothing was too much trouble The room had everything you could possibly need on a short stay 
307587,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, A bit noisy on Saturday night in rooms over looking the street , You will not find a nicer more helpful staff They were awesome And an unbelievably convenient location 
307588,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, We were disappointed that our deposit on a travel card of 75 euro Has not been refunded as we had nothing from the mini bar and left the room tidy makes the stay very expensive, Location and cleanliness
307589,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Location in a busy area busy and difficult approach Not so good facilities spa is only a sauna Breakfast standard room standard Overrated hotel , Very good staff 
307590,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, The hotel decor is a little tired Some carpets room furniture and decor could do with a refresh This did not at all take away from our stay but could really give the wow factor when you arrive in the hotel , A charming hotel in a fantastic location The staff were really friendly and with a great sense of humour Very close to the main rail station canal tours and city centre sights Plenty local bars cafes and restaurants Sorry to only stay one night We were fortunate to be upgraded to a suite which was very comfortable Breakfast was good quality food if not dazzling presentation 
307591,Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam, Wrong assignment of room Bathroom light didnt work, I opted for double bed room but at the time of check in i got single bed room Also the room i got was very small and i paid for a bigger room Not recommendable to anyone except for the location which is very good
