364767,Lancaster London, The bar fridge was connected to reception and if you moved anything of picked it up for more than 20 seconds it was charged on the bill and it mounted up to quite a lot of money and did take a fair while to have it sorted out on checkout and taken off the bill If you were in a hurry to check out this could be a problem Next time I will ask them to remove everything and just put my own drinks wine in it The hotel was still in the process of the renovations but they did not start work until 9am so it did not bother us , Our room had been renovated and redecorated and although the room was compact it was very well designed and laid out and had everything we needed The bathroom was great and the shower fantastic The bed and pillows were very comfortable We had a great view over London and Hyde Park was opposite The tube was right around the corner with great access for the bus as well A thoughtful bonus was a gift of guest of the day of an afternoon tea for two with a glass of champagne The afternoon tea was delicious with a great variety of teas I had never heard of a delightful experience I will definitely stay there next time I am in London 
364768,Lancaster London,No Negative, The hotel has undergone a full renovation of rooms and public areas My room which was an upgrade was tastefully furnished comfortable bed and good amenities 
364769,Lancaster London, There is current refurbishment taking place and the builders started a little early The hotel were very apologetic and upgraded us to a suite on the other side of the hotel for our second night which was amazing Cannot praise ALL the staff highly enough, The executive room was excellent Plenty of space and the bathroom was amazing with both a bath and large walk in shower The staff were fantastic and looked after everything making the stay both welcoming and relaxing 
364770,Lancaster London, Disappointed that breakfast was not included in price for weekend stay but plenty of good options close by , Very convenient location a few steps from tube station Lovely staff and comfortable room with every amenity and lovely view over Hyde Park 
364771,Lancaster London, There was nothing not to like , Great iconic hotel super clean staff and concierge extremely helpful they had a room available so we were able to book in early Refurbishment going on but didn t upset stay Really good all round 
364772,Lancaster London, The room was far to hot had to shower and leave the room as it was far to hot to sit and relax for a while the rest of the hotel was cool but room far to stuffy, It was a lovely clean hotel probably because of the refurb I could not fault them on the fact you could not tell a refurb was taking place 
364773,Lancaster London, The fridge door opening time without charging after 30 seconds is most inconvenient for those of us who need to refridgerate medications or even fresh milk It seemed a shame not to capitalize on enlarging the room size slightly during the alterations Friends are not entitled to a special rate if not booked directly with the hotel , The view the blinds the heated bathroom floor in particular and the refurbishment in general but most of all the friendly and obliging staff which was a noticeable and welcome change from previous visits Although not used the offer of a free afternoon tea was very nice 
364774,Lancaster London, Nothing , The location is absolutely perfect for sightseeing shopping and getting to the west end The staff are really lovely all of them we came in contact with helpful and courteous Our room was perfect bright and airy with great views This was our second visit and I think it will be our go to hotel in London 
364775,Lancaster London, We booked an airport transfer through the hotel cost ended up being nearly 20 pounds more than we were quoted by the hotel staff , Wonderful central location right across from Hyde park 
364776,Lancaster London, Somewhat a bit noisy with the refurbishment works outside however bearable if spending most of the time out visiting the surrounding areas , View cleanliness pleasant staff good evening meal proximity to the park comfortable room 
364777,Lancaster London, That breakfast had to be paid for as an extra it should have been included in the price , The view was excellent even though under renovation staff went out of their way to make my husbands birthday special 
364778,Lancaster London, I have stayed in one of the newly renovated rooms There is NO ROOM to keep your clothes and personal belongings The design of the locker cabinet is very poor with several wasted little areas here and there that can do the difference Kindly review the cupboard design and its layout and do the needful to improve it We shall keep coming to LL for several years to come hoping you work on this issue , Strategic location where you can enjoy doing business since the accessibility is there to everything while continue enjoying the romance of the Hyde park and London itself 
364779,Lancaster London, The hotel is currently being refurbished and much of it is behind wooden construction hoardings We thought we d booked a room in a derelict building instead of a 4 star hotel Lift access to our 17th floor room was limited and always busy , The room had a good view and the modernised facilities are better than they were 
364780,Lancaster London, price, Staff was great the room was impeccable a little on the pricy side but with a tube stop under property currently close until August it a great hotel
364781,Lancaster London,No Negative, The Renovated property is excellent the service and welcome staff are excellent one point is that there are no smoking room available for guests I am planning to stay one month in summer at this property if no smoking rooms will be available I have to change my plan and find a different property regards
364782,Lancaster London,No Negative, The staff were some of the best I have experienced in London refurbished room on the 17th Floor larger than most with all the amenities expected of a central London hotel 
364783,Lancaster London, No parking due to renovations however was able to park across the road which during the week and on Saturday during the day can only park for 4 hours note I parked late afternoon Saturday and only had to pay for 4 hours so after 6 30 was free until Sunday , Since my last stay at the Lancaster the hotel was under renovation but the rooms were completed My room was spacious clean and updated The decor was tasteful A huge improvement on my last visit and a pleasant stay They had an express check out meaning I could leave promptly with no queuing 
364784,Lancaster London, there was so noisy sounds because there were working people and the rate of price high Also there were so frequent check from the housekeeper for room service Also the key of the room usually shut of and not working and I need each time to go down to activate it, I like cleanliness was so great location the external view of the room lovely staff
364785,Lancaster London, No complaints at all , We were extremely happy all the staff without exception were 1st class couldn t do enough for us Have stayed here many times before will be back again soon 
364786,Lancaster London, There was extensive building works going on which lead to the reception area not having functioning IT equipment and they couldn t locate our booking for some time and the lifts weren t in use so they had to use the service lifts There was no warning of this on making the booking which is disappointing given the cost of the rooms , There was an event being held in this property so the location was perfect for my CEO and his colleagues
364787,Lancaster London, The steak wasn t a good idea but breakfast made up for my awful dinner , The rooms were clean and tidy we got the upgrade to the executive room because they are still renovating the place 
364788,Lancaster London, Drilling on Sunday morning a little annoying, When I arrived I was welcomed by happy staff who carry all my bags to the room and apologised for the building works which was fine
364789,Lancaster London, Half of the hotel is under construction so some rooms are new some is old And unfortunately our room is the old one In the midnight bathroom door lock suddenly got broken and didn t open it was around 2a m we called the guest service then 2 guys came and try to open the door during 30minutes like a nightmare But rest of the stay was good breakfast was very good stuff are helpfull and rooms are very clean ,No Positive
364790,Lancaster London, Nothing wrong with the hotel but the fact that Lancaster Gate tube station is closed is a small inconvenience at the moment, Newly refurbished rooms Great views Really friendly staff
364791,Lancaster London, The hotel is undergoing renovation so there was quiet some noise during the day in my room with the air conditioner, The hotel is very clean and the beds very comfortable The rooms are sizeable unlike other hotels i have visited in the UK The staff are very friendly and i was also selected guest of the day so i got to enjoy the very sumptuous afternoon tea with was very tasty and filling I loved it very much
364792,Lancaster London, This was a 50th Birthday treat for me completed by a booking at the on site Thai restaurant Although refurbishment works had been mentioned in the small print I hadn t been aware of the extent of these works My Addison Lee cab had to drive around for 10mins to find the alternative entrance On checking in I was told the lifts weren t working and I d have to go up to my room in the goods lift My Partner and I had a great meal at the restaurant however we were then woken up by the fire alarm at 6am we both live outside London and work in London and had booked this hotel so we wouldn t have to cut short my Birthday meal to get back home and actually have a lie in until 8am for once so being woken up at 6am by a screaming fire alarm wasn t a great thing particularly as it went off a few times after the initial burst We ended up leaving and going to work early This hotel will undoubtedly be great once the refurbishment is completed but for 149 without breakfast this was disappointing , The staff make this place fantastic and they should be commended for their helpful professional and cheerful attitude They couldn t have done more for us incredibly lovely and good natured even shepherding people through very cold corridors and fire escape stairs from rooms to lobby and back because the lifts weren t working 
364793,Lancaster London, Hotel struggling to operate as normal not very convincingly, Very good staff renovations are making their life v difficult Lifts didn t work false fire alarms constant daytime noise 
364794,Lancaster London, Construction work going on They start drilling walls at 9 am and finish at 5 or 6 pm I wasn t informed about their construction situation neither by reciption nor Booking com Nearby Lancaster Gate underground station closed until August 2017 ,No Positive
364795,Lancaster London, Hotel was being upgraded It takes away from the usual ambiance Rooms very noisy for some reason Nearest tube station temporarily closed which made the location awkward, Lots of staff and very attentive 
364796,Lancaster London, The Lancaster Under ground station was closed for Renovation and this interfered with my movements to my meetings because it meant i have to take a cab and face the traffic jams , Every thing was excellent even though the hotel is under major renovations 
364797,Lancaster London, The plug in the bath would not open properly so the water would fill up whilst showering meaning the other person had to wait a long time for it to drain before getting in the shower Sounds petty but it s not ideal if you have plans and need to be somewhere for a certain time , The bed was probably the most comfortable we have stayed in The staff were very welcoming and kind Cannot fault much at all 
364798,Lancaster London, Only one lift in operation beyond the 7th floor at present, There is a fair amount of refurbishment going on but it had no impact on our stay We were upgraded to one of their brand new executive rooms on the 17th floor we were the first to stay in it It was superb way beyond our expectations 
364799,Lancaster London,No Negative, Depsite the hotel being in the middle of a major refrubishment then staff and management managed to make me feel very welcome The room was very nice and comfortable The hotel has constructed a temporary reception area that works well I did not fee inconvenienced and the special rate during the refurb was welcome 
364800,Lancaster London, The hotel is currently being refurbished and they have only two very small and highly unreliable lifts out of the original four running You wait a very long time but with lots of luggage the stairs are not an option The room was very bijou small A single shot of brandy at the bar cost 14 PLUS a service charge of 2 25 for pouring it ouch The doorman was never there when we were moving in and out with luggage etc Lancaster Gate Tube station is immediately adjacent but closed for renovations and refurbishment currently There s a moderate amount of building noise to contend with during the days but it was not too intrusive in our area of the hotel , The location is excellent within easy walking distance of Paddington Hyde Park the main shops of Oxford Street and within very comfortable walking distance of all the Kensington museums and facilities For the location facilities and cleanliness the room price was very reasonable presumably as compensation for the renovation works The receptions staff were all lovely and very friendly The general ambiance of the hotel was pleasant subdued elegant and understated rather than brash and loud The room was clean and the bathroom spotless with lovely fresh towels and pleasant toiletries 
364801,Lancaster London, The room was a bit small hopefully that will be addressed as renovation is in progress Also the wifi wasn t fast as expected , I liked the comfortable beds the caring staff and the good location I loved the biscuits and bottomless milk offer Lancaster is a hotel i d recommend and would probably return to especially after the renovation 
364802,Lancaster London, The pictures I seen on Booking com was not what the hotel looks like Which was slightly disappointing as I did not see anywhere on the page that there were renovations going on , Loved the beds Close to Hyde Park 
364803,Lancaster London, Air conditioning was very loud, Excellent location right next to Hyde park and Lancaster Gate Tube All staff were very friendly and helpful Hotel clean and nice sized room Received a lovely surprise for my daughters birthday they had put balloons and cake in the room upon arrival Room service was quick and food was fantastic Also ate in the island grill restaurant one night which offered grear service and lovely food 
364804,Lancaster London, The breakfast service was poor staff did not know what side to serve from tables were wobblely and items were forgotten from the breakfast sereved Not worth 20 00 Staff at breakfast seemed as though they were not experienced at service and waiting The corridors were very cold not sure if they had a heating problem Also there was a drilling noise of which we were not made aware of , The bed was comfortable room was clean however very small Reception staff and porters very friendly Reception area was welcoming Good location next to a tube station 
364805,Lancaster London, In my request I had asked for an extra bed in the room At arrival the extra bed hadn t been provided Even worse the room was actually too small to put an extra bed The only option was to take an extra room for an additional GBP 150 per night And this despite my written advance request The breakfast is relatively low value for money as the options are really no longer up to date for an increasingly healthy focused travelling community , Location of the hotel close to tube station and in walking distance from Oxford Street and Harrods
364806,Lancaster London, There was construction work going on which were not told about at the time of booking however the staff made up for the inconvenience with their excellent customer service , The staff were excellent Jose and Vlad made us feel very welcome The food in the Thai restaurant was delicious 
364807,Lancaster London, Noise We were not aware that a major refurbishment of the hotel was underway until our arrival Not good Booking com Only two lifts and one was out of service throughout our stay , Location Close to Oxford Street and Paddington station and only a 15 minute walk across the park to South Kensington 
364808,Lancaster London, Wasn t really a park view But still round the corner from it literally, Stayed in superior double room with park view Bed was amazing Comfy clean and huge 
364809,Lancaster London, A test of responsiveness and practical help from hotel services Arrived without any cuff links can you help A cursory no Managed with some paperclips, Comfort and courtesy as you would expect for the price tag We opted for superior room nothing to write home about
364810,Lancaster London, The fact that there is only one left operation to service the whole hotel is absolutely absurd We had to wait for a lift for more than 20 mins on more than one occasion and there are no stairway facilities to the ground floor We arrived early and were told that our rooms would be ready at 14 00 When we arrived back at 14 30 our rooms were still not ready , The location is very convenient the hotel is comfortable in general 
364811,Lancaster London, We ordered the full English breakfast which was very disappointing and small considering the price 22 50 We found the breakfast staff to be very slow and non attentive had to ask 3 times just for coffee Go to the lovely little caf round the corner and eat for 5 95 , The reception bar door and cleaning staff are amazing super friendly and helpful The breakfast staff not quite so Our room was very clean and comfortable and they decorated it with balloons and left for us complimentary champagne and cake for my husbands birthday which was such a lovely touch If you plan to eat or use the bar in the hotel sign up to the Friends program before you go and save 20 on your bar restaurant bills 
364812,Lancaster London, So much construction work outside the hotel Construction noise inside the hotel although we were warned of the noise by the staff and to be fair they started working at convienient times Bathroom was a bit crampy , Flavored water at the reception Very friendly staff Comfortable room Good location 
364813,Lancaster London, The room and bathroom are very tired so no need to expand on that Also only one lift but that comes under the renovations The bed was comfy but the bedding possibly the mattress top made for a very hot night , The food was splendid the evening meal was delicious breakfast scrambled eggs cooked to perfection tasty coffee wonderful porridge with the bonus of choosing how it was cooked 
364814,Lancaster London, The room we booked was not available we were given an alternative room which I m sure wasn t a superior room However we were given a complimentary breakfast by a very helpful member of staff , Very comfortable bed Good shower Good coffee and tea available 
364815,Lancaster London, i would prefer stand shower than bath thats the only thing i didn t like , like the new layout and refurbishment very helpful receptionist very welcoming felt so special when they recognised their regular guest in room service very fast good food quality
364816,Lancaster London, I booked a double and the room was a twin The room was also very small I had a park view but it was mostly buildings , The food was lovely and the staff were really attentive and helpful 
364817,Lancaster London, Nothing, We had a birthday and the staff provided a Fantastic if not the best ever cake with bubble and balloons thank you again to all the staff Can t wait to stay again 
364818,Lancaster London, Not worth the money, Bed was comfy but rooms very small for price you pay I m stayed in premier inn and holiday inns which are more value for money Will not return or recommend
364819,Lancaster London, There wasn t anything , The staff were so polite and kind We were so lucky to be offered complimentary breakfast as it was my birthday We would never have expected that such a lovely surprise The food was delicious and looked out onto Hyde Park Amazing 
364820,Lancaster London,No Negative, We love staying at the Lancaster we find to be a friendly relaxing and very comfortable hotel The location for us is central and we are looking forward to seeing the refurbishment of the hotel next time we stay 
364821,Lancaster London, Traffic around the hotel is terrible The evening was fine however the night and morning it was very noisy They started drilling in the stairwell next to our room whilst we were having a lay in 9am And it was teeth rattling loud Even though I complained it continued for nearly an hour Really was annoying, It was clean
364822,Lancaster London, The room was a little cold and we had an issue with the door which was too narrow for our twin baby stroller to fit through , Extremely helpful friendly staff at reception the concierge and in the Nipa Thai restaurant The location is great for Hyde Park and Oxford Street 
364823,Lancaster London,No Negative, Excellent location Hotel brilliant room housekeeping excellent staff helpful and provide extras for my daughters birthday Cannot praise enough would defiantly stop again x
364824,Lancaster London, Unfortunately they are in the middle of renovations however the staffs approach really made all the difference , The attitude of the staff was just outstanding Always happy to do what ever one requested 
364825,Lancaster London, At one point in the night the room started to smell like cigarettes But we were never able to tell if it was from the vents or the hallway or the room next to us It was quite bothersome , The hotel is beautiful and the lobby is particularly stunning The room was very nice and the bathrobes and slipper made us feel fancy The best part was how the staff was incredibly kind and helpful and accommodating 
364826,Lancaster London, It s a building site as the hotel is being renovated If I were booking something it that area then I would definitely wait for the renovations to complete Stained carpets and quite dated, Nothing really stood out as great
364827,Lancaster London, room 701 was freezing cold and took a long time to warm up too many windows fittings were old and dreary no power points near mirror for drying hair bed lumpy,No Positive
364828,Lancaster London, The breakfast was average better head to Sandra for sandwiches or taje a bus to bayswater even Paddington or Notting Hill has many great choices, Location and decent room size with London Eye view not to mentionthe white company products and the coffee in the room there are a samall cokd store to buy water and data card for 20 or 10 pound Loved everything during our stay
364829,Lancaster London,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble The facilities were good and it was a comfortable place to stay in an excellent location 
364830,Lancaster London, Price for breakfast 200 bedrooms are being renovated but was not bothered by noise but then I stayed on the weekend , Close to Lancaster Gate tube station and Hyde Park Nipa Thai restaurant One of the best Thai meals I have had outside Thailand Polite and helpful staff 
364831,Lancaster London, Nothing I will definitely be back on by next visit to London , The location in front of Hyde Park around the corner from a Central Line Tube station and just a stroll away from the shopping area at Oxford street is perfect All the staff from the doorman to the reception ladies to the personnel at the restaurants and even housekeeping they all make you feel very welcome The food is delicious unfortunately the Thai restaurant was fully booked but no doubt that it is wonderful as was our dinner at the Island Grill You should definitely have an afternoon tea in the Lounge it was an experience to remember The rooms are very comfortable and the shower was very pleasant enough water and pressure and no loss of pressure when other rooms take a shower which normally happens in many hotels 
364832,Lancaster London, Our room was a ok but the shower wouldn t drain properly in the bath so ended up having a very full bath whilst showering Quite a bit of drilling noise on the first morning we woke up from all the work being undertaken Guessing that s why the we got a good deal as there is a huge renovation going on on site But if your looking for a good location then perfect but will be noisy on a mid week stay, Bed was comfy and very friendly staff
364833,Lancaster London, Building work going on at the moment and lobby to lifts dirty heavily stained rugs , Staff friendly Coffee etc topped up early evening aswell as morning and maids friendly Location good for Hyde Park 
364834,Lancaster London, Some noise from work outside from 9 5 thought it was the heater making the grating noise before member of staff explained I was on the sixth floor , Beautiful big comfortable bed Also on arrival to my room there was a strong smell of cigarette smoke The reception staff apologised and immediately offered me another room without any quibble which was excellent 
364835,Lancaster London, Over bath shower great but narrow bath meant no flat place to stand means it s an unstable place to shower Air conditioning sounded like a jumbo jet readying for take off Impossible to stand for more than 10 minutes and certainly not overnight , Good location for anyone coming into Paddington with easy access to all parts of central London and the Albert Hall short walk across the park Clean comfortable room Good shower with reservation see what didn t like Nice helpful receptionist and concierge Building works daytime only so didn t have any impact on my stay 
364836,Lancaster London, Nothing, The hotel was ideally located between Paddington Railway station and Hyde Park Room was spacious clean with excellent room service Underground was outside the hotel with easy access to central London 
364837,Lancaster London, The facility and the furniture are definitely old and worn out It needs refurbishing The price is for a modern hotel Difficult to find the entrance it seems it is a temporary entrance , Despite an old facility and furniture I guess from the 80s they make any effort to keep it in good shape and they quite succeed Nice scents of the air in corridors and room not excessive good room equipment with good quality coffee tea soaps In general a full 4 stars hotel Everything was working well Nice breakfast 20 GPB for the buffet no hot meals and 25 GPB if you want to add some hot meals which you order from menu I took only the buffet it was enough Metro station Lancaster Gate 70 meters away in the same block Paddington station at 5 mins walking 
364838,Lancaster London, Building works made getting cab tricky Room by lift so a bit noisy , Really friendly flexible and helpful staff Arranged early checkin after I baled early AM from a dreadful place nearby Comfortable room 
364839,Lancaster London, Poor staff communication We booked a table for the restaurant with the hotel reception and the booking was never received at the restaurant Likewise a triple room was requested but not processed , Location of hotel for Hyde park was brilliant Rooms were lovely 
364840,Lancaster London, the noise, I was in a room right next to the lifts on the 7th floor constant nice from people entering lifts on top of that building work started at 8am with drilling and banging i wouldn t have stayed there if i had known i was in the middle of refurbishment
364841,Lancaster London, I extended my stay by 2 nights but I found out the hotel charged me more than the price in Booking They charged me 279 pounds per night while it wad 200 in Booking com, Location friendly staff
364842,Lancaster London, One of the loudest air conditioning systems I have ever heard drilling in a nearby room at 9 30am no soaps or shampoos in the bathroom all round very poor , Nothing the bed was ok that s about it 
364843,Lancaster London, Work was being done at the hotel and while our concerns were addressed swiftly if thinking about staying in the coming months check to see where the upgrade work is at then request a room away as it can get noisy, Great location lovely staff thank you Rose 
364844,Lancaster London, The breakfast was absolute rubbish It was cold no toast tea not topped up Very small portion for the expensive price breakfast staff ignored us The room was dated and the bathroom was so small I burnt my knee on the radiator , Location was good 
364845,Lancaster London, The breakfast was not what I suspected and there was no honey due to construction , Two minutes walk from lancaster gate tube Easy access to many areas and safe for late night out 
364846,Lancaster London,No Negative, The position is great as we could walk from Paddington and the Tube was around the corner Staff on the desk very helpful and polite l Loved the Thai Restaurant Good buzz and the food was good 
364847,Lancaster London, Decor is a little tired look forward to the refurbished rooms in the near future , We were chosen as guests of the day and had a lovely afternoon tea on the hotel 
364848,Lancaster London,No Negative, Amazing stay The staff just cannot do enough for you I now wouldn t stay anywhere else in London Special mention to Stephanos who sorted us with a wonderful birthday cake for my nephew We had arrived to the bar area after a late flight ruined our dinner plans and we ended up having a wonderful birthday meal thanks to the kind and attentive staff We had 5 rooms in all yet the staff managed to keep our families together with rooms close by to each other Breakfast too is delicious our teenagers loved the waffles and American pancakes delicious Location was super too can t wait to go back Thanks Lancaster
364849,Lancaster London, Booked a twin superior room and initial given a double No problem to change though TV didn t work but engineer got it working again Extra 20 per head for breakfast was a little steep No parking available , Room was comfortable if a little small 
364850,Lancaster London, Des te of assuring me That the reconstructiona works are only Gill Friday on Saturday morning the works and elevator tart r even before 8am, Room clean and confortable Complementary water appreciated Good location 
364851,Lancaster London, Nothing , The location very close to the undergroud There was free wifi access in the room And the room was quite big and bathroom was good There were free water cookies tea and coffee in the room All was great 
364852,Lancaster London, The hotel rooms could do with being updated Noise from roadworks was mix up with billing breakfast room service 27 60 booking in advance 40 for two people significant price difference Booked because of views of hyde part but didn t experience that , Very comfy bed excellent quality tv friendly staff Good location Inquired via email about birthday packages for partners birthday When arrived had nice surprise of balloons champagne and chocolate covered strawberries in room compliments from hotel Ginger biscuits are scrumptious exclusive to the hotel

364854,Lancaster London, Laud construction works in the hotel top floor only It was mentioned when we checked in and we were awake anyway when it started in the morning but could be disturbing , Perfect location great staff and one of the most comfortable bed I ve ever slept in Really good value for money Thank you for the nice stay 
364855,Lancaster London, The room was supposed to have a park view which it didn t The Hotel was undergoing renovations which made the room uninhabitable during the day The renovations were not disclosed at the time of my booking , Very helpful staff and the location was great right on Hyde park and with easy access to the Underground 
364856,Lancaster London, The bed mattress was very old and not flat The duty manager kept promising to replace it and never happened The welcoming atmosphere is nil The sales manager was so unhelpful to change the room or even extend flexibility Staff hospitality is also nil The AC noise very loud Slamming doors 24 7 Some work going on the upper floors and drilling never stop I would NOT recommend this whatso called hotel ,No Positive
364857,Lancaster London, Booked a superior twin room Offered a room at check in which smelt strongly of cigarettes which was totally unacceptable We then had to wait over an hour for another room to be ready Would have been nice to be offered a complimentary tea or coffee instead of which had to pay The hot water in the shower was difficult to control Glad I didn t book an ordinary room ,No Positive
364858,Lancaster London, The description was misleading it did not have patk views Directly looked at houses and apartments Disappointed and misleading , Comfortable bed and spacious room
364859,Lancaster London, The room was decor was dated and tired looking The sink and bath drains were blocked creating a damp smell in the room , The hotel was very stylish from the entrance to the lounges 
364860,Lancaster London, Absence of price list for the well stocked mini bar despite being requested More Tea coffee and milk without having to request it , Rooms spacious and well equipped Robes slippers complimentary fruit and water Massive TV
364861,Lancaster London, Shame bar does not have natural light but a small quibble really , Generous check out timings noon and breakfast timings until 11am Really enables a good night s rest and a leisurely start to the day Breakfast buffet a la carte and service were great 
364862,Lancaster London,No Negative, It was my wife s significant birthday I informed the Hotel on my booking email I had only purchased a standard double room They upgraded us free of charge to a superior room over looking Hyde park They had filled the room with balloons and presented my wife with a cake and a bottle of wine The whole stay and the staff was just excellent 
364863,Lancaster London, Cold water tap run hot 90 of the time Very small room Room was very basic in what it had Felt like we were going to incur hidden charges just for breathing Bathroom was tiny as a 6ft guy my knees were touching the towel rail when sat on the toilet Also 180 per night and to try charge an extra 15 each for a continental breakfast per day C mon , The location was excellent so close to Hyde park and the tube station was right under the hotel
364864,Lancaster London, I think a curved shower pole is an easy fix to stop the clingy shower curtain experience And the bar is a great space but very quiet with little buzz Maybe a review of some of the bar prices particularly a glass of wine maybe in order , Super hotel in a great position overlooking the park Great selection of buffet and cooked food on offer at breakfast Room very comfortable and quiet All staff were very welcoming helpful and attentive Two on site restaurants with excellent food on offer 
364865,Lancaster London, Bed was poor very hard Bathroom needed major refurbishment Hotel turned off the air conditioning with little notice The hotel is sold with parking available i then get an email charging me 45 per 24 hours for valet parking apparently they don t use the hotel car park for guests for security reasons Absolute rip off , Staff were helpful
364866,Lancaster London, One thing I would like is a bed with a top sheet I find duvets very hot and end up sleeping on top the the covers which doesn t lend itself to a good night s sleep , The Art tea which we were lucky enough to be awarded as guests of the day was fantastic and the gentleman who served us treated us like royalty Amazing experience 
364867,Lancaster London, The room was too small Damaged blackout curtains the sun Wakes me up very early every morning They do not refill complete bathroom amenities eveyday you have to call and ask for it every day Lobby sofas are very cheap and not well maintained , Good location 
364868,Lancaster London, Hotel is currently under renovation with the top 9 floors out of action This means concrete drilling and construction noise from 8am It also meant that our Superior City Views booking was meaningless and instead got us a nice room on the 5th floor overlooking the carpark The woman at the front desk was friendly and upfront about it giving us complementary breakfast as a sweetener Not a deal breaker , Nice 4 Star hotel of the old school variety Staff are all lovely and helpful and rooms are comfortable and nicely appointed if in a slightly dated style Great location in Paddington around the corner from Lancaster Gate station

364870,Lancaster London, Due to a family problem we had to leave on Friday so we informed the hotel when checking in We felt we could have been offered a credit to be used towards another stay , LOCATION Friendly staff
364871,Lancaster London, As above otherwise all okay staff very polite , Needed to change clothes on arrival as heading to show by 2pm no room available Needed late check out on Sunday morning also not available Disappointed as my 3rd time to stay here 
364872,Lancaster London, Disgusted Had a dreadful night s sleep The air con kept us awake all night We called reception at 11 30 and someone came to deal with it but it was so loud and still couldn t be switched off so it kept us awake right through to 4 30am They were completely aware that the air con was faulty but still made the room available What a disgusting rip off Avoid at all costs ,No Positive
364873,Lancaster London, Bathroom is quite old Cold hot water balance was not stable , Location was very good Near the paddington station and metro as well Room was enough big for 2 persons Breakfast was very nice

364879,Lancaster London, Your web site shows the location of the Hotel further along the main road and not directly behind Lancaster Tube Station We ended up walking from the bus stop opposite Lancaster Tube for a couple of miles before getting a taxi which was rather annoying , Great location for Hyde Park concert 
364880,Lancaster London, Room very small but it was London so to be expected Check in was horrendous we were kept waiting far too long and when we eventually got a room allocated it was a double not the twin we had booked They promised to come in later and unzip but they didn t , Very clean and public areas very nice Quality of furnishings etc excellent
364881,Lancaster London, Rang up for a early check in at 13 00 instead of 14 00 as was going to a concert was told yes that was fine when we arrived we could not go to our room so we had to leave our luggage and could not refresh ourselves after our journey When we arrived back there was police outside and also running down are corridor after a fight had broke out at a wedding Was looking forward to a sleep in after a late night at approx 08 00 the room felt like it was shaking and a loud drilling noise from above the room went on for 3 hours until we checked out The staff were friendly but would avoid hotel until after refurb,No Positive

364884,Lancaster London, We booked a park view room only to be told on arrival that it wasn t available We were then given a back room which smelled of cigarette smoke Unacceptable And then in the morning the toilet wouldn t flush because the water had been turned off Definitely won t be going back ,No Positive
364885,Lancaster London, For a so called superior double it wasn t good value for money The room looked tired furniture was scruffy only one out of threee lamps worked We ve paid less than half this cost stayed in better rooms with brands like Premier Inn I didnt expect to pay 161 for a view of the car park, Location was good booking in staff were friendly
364886,Lancaster London,No Negative, I have stayed here 3 times now for the Hyde park summertime festival It s a lovely hotel in an excellent location right on the edge of Hyde park itself I will be staying here every year hopefully
364887,Lancaster London, Drinks a bit expensive and bar area rather dark found it difficult to read the menu Maybe an age thing , Location just round the corner from the Tube and in walking distance to Oxford Street Also next to Hyde Park where we were going to a concert 
364888,Lancaster London, When we visited the bar in the evening the poor barman was rushed off his feet On concert nights it might be good to have extra staff later in the evening , I was celebrating my retirement after 35 years as a nurse in the NHS with tickets to a concert in Hyde Park with a good friend I was absolutely delighted when I checked in to be told by Elena at reception that I had been chosen to be Special Guest of the Day She handed me an envelope tied with a pink ribbon and inside a voucher for 3 courses and a bottle of wine in the Island Grill Restaurant for two people My friend and I really enjoyed our meal the food and wine were superb and the waiting staff were great treating us as though we were really special I even had a hand written card and fruit in my room when I returned Apparently the hotel picks someone at random every day What a brilliant idea they definitely made my day VERY SPECIAL Thank you 
364889,Lancaster London, There wasn t anything not to like , The room and dining room views over Hyde Park and access to the rest of London faultless Bed and Pillows excellent we had a superb nights sleep When I booked I emailed the hotel with some questions They answered the same day and true to their word they made our stay memorable by going the extra mile for us Breakfast was top notch fresh and flavoursome On arrival we were early and reception were unphased took our bags and ensured they were in our room when we got back very late 11pm Next day following check out they were very happy to look after our cases and coats for the day they were promptly returned when we collected them again much later in the day We feel it is walkable from Paddington 7 minutes tops We ll happily stay again when we go back to London 
364890,Lancaster London, Booked an executive room but size of room and bathroom were smaller than expected, Great Location with very friendly welcoming staff good selection of breakfast items
364891,Lancaster London, the room is very dated this includes the bathroom and lacks additional touches which you would expect The breakfast is very expensive and not original in the menu presented It also took a long time to come out We had to pay as soon as we arrived apparently a new system, The downstairs lounge and reception area was well presented the staff worked hard on the award The night service was very good 
364892,Lancaster London, no net curtains in our room the fire alarm came on 4 times in 10 minutes at 6am phone in the room did not work rooms are dated and need modernisation, good location we were there for a wedding the and the venue was great 
364893,Lancaster London, This time unfortunately we had a very old and small room with a shower that didn t drain properly Bumped into some people who loved their stay in the newly renovated area so it might just be kick of the draw But certainly not worth the price we paid , Love the location of the Lancaster and the last time I stayed I had an amazing room with brilliant views 
364894,Lancaster London, Too long checking in Waiting staff at breakfast too attentive it was a bit off putting our room 910 looked a bit tired decor wise wallpaper needed replacing , Nice smell in the lobby Breakfast was fresh and a good selection if little over priced 
364895,Lancaster London, Room only and would have preferred bed and breakfast but cost of breakfast very high 20 per head , Lovely room very clean Very very comfortable Very helpful staff A pleasure to return to after a busy day sightseeing or taking in a show Tube station 1 min away so a brilliant base for exploring London 
364896,Lancaster London, Rooms too small and very dated And these are superior deluxe double room blah blah Hair dryer from 1970s and bathtub wouldn t drain Price too high given the above , Good location Friendly reception 
364897,Lancaster London, very expensive upgrade for a park view room that you could definitely not see a park from maybe if you could see through the trees or swing a cat in tiny One bottle of complimentary water other small bottles for 2 50 each in mini bar not enough little milk cartons for more than one cuppa each hairdryer not working they did eventually bring a plug in one phone hanging by a thread off the wall in the bathroom Great location so guess thats what you pay for but not worth the upgrade ,No Positive
364898,Lancaster London, The shower needed to be changed as water was going everywhere The room had a lot of construction noise during the daytime I would not have known this unless I had some phone meetings in my room , Locations is great if you can utilize Hyde Park for walking or running There are many bars and nice restaurants less than 500m from the hotel Got an upgrade to a suite and it was the best room I ever had in London 
364899,Lancaster London, We had a disappointing experience with breakfast it seemed to take a number of tries to finally get it right with numerous staff members The hotel is very grand but could definitely do with some updating in places , The hotel was very grand but needs updating instead of patching up 
364900,Lancaster London, the room was very noisy because of the renovation drilling happening in the next room this meant that we had to stay out of the room until about 5pm, friendly greeting and attentive staff
364901,Lancaster London, We stayed in room scheduled for renovation later in year Sink tub drains very slow Other than that no problems , Staff was excellent friendly helpful courteous Nipa Thai Restaurant was a real treat They have 6 Thai female chefs so taste is pretty authentic 
364902,Lancaster London, I prefer more of a relaxed atmosphere but enjoyable all the same , Superb location overlooking Kensington Gardens friendly staff large comfortable room 
364903,Lancaster London, Doesn t support Union Pay card so it can be very inconvenient for Chinese travellers If you don t have Master Card or Visa you have to withdrawal cash from your Union Pay card first there is a cash machine at their lobby and then pay in cash , Staff
364904,Lancaster London, I can not compain about anything , The room was cosy and clean and the view is fantastic The bed was fantastic The staff was very friendly and ready to help on any matter The location is fantastic specially because we started every day with a run in the park We walked almoast all our ways to Notting Hill Primrose Covernt Carden South bank City The Nipa Restaurant is very good and the breakfast also 
364905,Lancaster London, There was no hot water one morning but it seemed to get rectified in a reasonable timeframe , Be easy to say what I didn t like Gorgeous hotel helpful staff brilliant location yummy food at Island Grill Restaurant Bed was soooo comfortable 
364906,Lancaster London, Confusion over whether breakfast included or not different staff said different things Slightly dated decor but think in process of being upgraded , View from dining room over Hyde Park at breakfast on beautiful sunny morning 5 min walk from Paddington Station Very comfy bed and good shower 
364907,Lancaster London, We are customers of this Hotel since a long time The Hotel is beeing rebuilted They should inform about this Very noisy by the morning Carpets in loby VERY DIRTY Rooms in poor state of maintenance damaged furniture broken toilet ripped Wall paper in the rooms etc They told us how everything will change not worth any improvement So they have two alternatives Close the Hotel during the works Request price compatible with the quality offered When we suggest to a high hotel responsible to close the Hotel during the works and make them quickly we were informed that it was impossible because the true business of the Hotel were the conferences meetings etc and not the rental room UNBELIEVABLE Is anacceptable that have increased the cost of breakfast and decreased quality 17 5 by such breakfast I consider it an assault WE NEVER BE BACK TO THIS HOTEL , Unicamente da simpatia do pessoal 
364908,Lancaster London, The constant hard slamming of doors at all hours was not appreciated Each door slams into a metal frame each time one opens it Has no one thought of felt buffers to dampen the impact On this basis alone I would not stay here again , The pillows were excellent as were the staff 
364909,Lancaster London, Electricity and water supply cut off from 10 am till 16 am including lifts to get on the 8th floor not advertised at the time of booking Dated rooms with old and dirty wallpaper old bathrooms all in need of an urgent renovation Not even close to a 4 stars accommodation , nothing
364910,Lancaster London, Indian party going on till 2am with no prior warning Being woken up at 3am by screaming people trying to find their rooms Then waking up to chips being outside are bedroom door with out it being cleaned up even after we told staff , That we got to check out at 12
364911,Lancaster London, The toilet in room 925 would not flush easily The wash basin drainage was very very slow Both reported on departure No toilets throughout the hotel appear to be ventilated Would be great if the doors could be made silent when closing A couple in a room opposite had a domestic and decided to shout and scream outside of our room and continuously opened and closed their door between 2 00am and 3 30am, Towels toiletries shower mattress hostess tray Very good
364912,Lancaster London, TV in room had only 4 channels working all sky channels only Bathroom had some mould up high over shower No rail or hangers to hang up clothes, Location was perfect for what we needed Beds very comfortable Nice sized room for two staying two nights Staff very helpful 
364913,Lancaster London,No Negative, Staff very accommodating and quick to fix a small booking error 4 min walk from Paddington station restaurants and the like Hotel was 30 seconds from a tube stop
364914,Lancaster London, I booked two room for checking 2 00 pm I travelled by car all the way from Manchester with my old parents Reception staff told me our rooms not ready We checking 4 30 pm Reception staff need more training, Good location
364915,Lancaster London, At 6 50 a bottle of Peroni which worked out at 13 a pint this has to be one of the most expensive hotels in London A small cup of coffee was 5 better to go to one of the cafe bars nearer Paddington , Location and price and our function was held downstairs
364916,Lancaster London, Only a short break but wish we we could have stayed longer , Superb attentiveness of all the staff from reception in the bar right down to chambermaids all most polite and friendly
364917,Lancaster London, Buffett breakfast selection was a bit on the light side for the price charged but it was Convenient , Reception concierge restaurant and the door men were all extremely helpful and friendly and went the extra mile to engage with the kids as well Most hotels treat kids as a necessary evil but this hotel welcomed the entire family and made us all feel welcome Great location next to the park 
364918,Lancaster London, What I didn t like was the extortionate valet parking , I loved the staff decor and ambiance of the place Great views But what I loved the most was my big firm comfortable bed 
364919,Lancaster London, The room size was just OK for 2 people Maybe a little bit bigger would be nicer The air conditioning was operating but the room was never warm Finally I consider the hotel a little bit pricey but for London s standards maybe is fair The breakfast for instance wouldn t harm to be cheaper I asked for a room with nice view but I consider that my request was not fulfilled side view 7th floor , The hotel is very quiet and located in a great position The location couldn t be better You exit the hotel and the metro is just around the corner You can walk to the center as well The personnel is very helpful and joyful all the time The room was always clean 
364920,Lancaster London, We wait in launch bar a little bit longer for order , Excelent rooms breakfast restaurants and beautifull view to hyde park Staff was kind and professional

364926,Lancaster London,No Negative, Everything was wonderful Rooms upgraded as it was my son s 30th birthday The lovely receptionist Hanika also sent our son a complimentary bottle of champagne with a card and balloons to his room making it all the more special over and above anything we expected thank you to everyone at the London Lancaster Hotel 
364927,Lancaster London, Would have been nice if there was a lounge to sit with bar somewhere on entrance Unfortunately the lounge bar upstairs was busy with a function , Friendly staff location fab
364928,Lancaster London, The public rooms were fine but the bedroom although well kept obviously without the brand new feel because of the age of the hotel , Excellent location next to Lancaster Gate tube station and bus stop outside This means that distance from West End not a problem To walk out directly into Hyde Park another bonus We had an excellent well served and reasonably priced evening meal in the Island Restaurant within the hotel 
364929,Lancaster London, We had a basin in our room we couldn t use It was obviously like it before we arrived as the taps had been turned off so hard it was almost impossible to turn them on When my husband eventually got them on we couldn t get them off so they were permanently running My husband had to shut them which was so difficult we never opened them again An absolute pain trying to wash our hands and brush our teeth using the bath didn t have time to complain but the room cleaner obviously was aware of it Apart from that everything else was fine, Easy to get to staff were very nice
364930,Lancaster London, Upstairs bar prices are ridiculous 6 19 for a 330ml bottle of beer which works out at 12 a pint and 5 for a small black coffee The downstairs bar was only 4 a pint , Location and price room cleanliness and maid service very friendly

364933,Lancaster London,No Negative, The rooms were very comfortable and clean and the staff extremely friendly and helpful I found the hotel to have a very calm feel about it away although it is in a very busy city The long was very comfortable and relaxing Very good location close to Paddington so able to get around easily 
364934,Lancaster London, Only two sachets of normal coffee May sound like a small point but as I forgot to buy a jar while sightseeing , Slept very well due to big comfy bed and quiet room Later found out the rooms above are closed for refurbishment so no noisy footsteps etc Excellent location next to tube and Hyde Park Staff all very helpful and friendly 
364935,Lancaster London, Television had only 3 channels Bathroom needs renovation, Continental breakfast was good with a possibility of adding extras from the menu Room was very clean and well maintained
364936,Lancaster London, Overall a tired room Old TV Difficult to connect to wifi boiling hot shower noisy air on in the night Just little irritants Expensive drinks in the bar bordering on extortionate, Good bed at a conference and that was well managed Very good dinner service
364937,Lancaster London, The internet useless and TV not working all instructions on TV were in Spanish , The staff very friendly and helpful They changed my room to get better TV but internet even worse As a gesture they gave me free breakfast location great
364938,Lancaster London, Feel they could have done with a bar coffee lounge on higher floor which would make the most of the views If they had one I doubt we would have left the hotel in the evening in search of a drink with a view , Amazing views of London skyline from room worth the relatively small extra cost city view room Helpful courteous and highly professional staff Complimentary extras as it was our anniversary which made our stay extra special 
364939,Lancaster London, Nothing , Beds comfortable Front of house staff extra friendly particularly the concierge Location overlooking Hyde Park relaxing Great for exercise incl Gym and walk in the park 
364940,Lancaster London, There could be a better selection of beers at the bar, The room was very comfortable and clean Very good location within easy walk of of Bayswater and the Edgware Road and opposite Hyde Park
364941,Lancaster London, For no apparent or explained reason it took forever to check in the receptionist seemed unable to locate the reservation for my colleague Mrs Ball The hotel was apparently undergoing renovation though there was no evidence of it and the TV in the room only had 3 channels strangely with german script The furniture in the room dresser and table were clearly old worn and of very poor quality I have stayed in this hotel many times over the years and this trip simply did not measure up to previous visits, Really comfortable night s sleep and fantastic views of the Park and central London 
364942,Lancaster London, The room was old furniture need renovation with my reservation either I get a room by the elevator very noisy or hv to upgrade for another room exactly the same but away from the elevator and when I complained about the room they returned the money paid fro the upgrade but did not offer to change the room This stay was very bad tv only 2 channels as they upgrade their system why they did not notify when doing the reservation my experience this time is bad ,No Positive
364943,Lancaster London, There was an issue with the TV in the room over which we did not complain but we were subsequently made aware this was a general temporary problem It certainly did not spoil our stay , The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff was exceptional from the time of our check in to departure nothing was too much trouble 
364944,Lancaster London, The internet connectivity was appalling often falling over and when connected was reasonably unresponsive, The concierge and hotel check in staff were excellent I felt I was the most important person there This made it a very enjoyable couple of days
364945,Lancaster London, Bathroom a little tired with some damp showing but not a problem , Friendly helpful staff Rooms comfortable and view across London especially good Enjoyed our stay here and would definitely use this hotel again very handy for underground 
364946,Lancaster London, Didn t find anything wrong with the hotel at all , Bed room bathroom and view was amazing Such great value for money and so happy with it Would definitely return
364947,Lancaster London, Could only get three TV channels Not what you d expect for the price you pay , Excellent location as its right around the corner from the subway Bedroom was lovely and big comfy bed 
364948,Lancaster London, I can t think of any actual cons but just an interesting side note we thought it d be easy to get a free upgrade since it was a Monday and low peak but we were told that it is the opposite in this hotel they upsell better rooms during low peak and only upgrade during higher peaks Thought this was a little strange as I ve always experienced the opposite but ah well , Staff was friendly Room and bathroom were comfortable and better than I expected Location was fabulous 
364949,Lancaster London, room did not smell too nice seemed like no one has used it for awhile requested for an adaptor but it didn t come, nice staff willing to go an extra mile
364950,Lancaster London, Rooms are quite basic a bit old and could use new rugs and furniture, Location is easy to get to from Paddington station Staff were very friendly and helpful
364951,Lancaster London, Very small room No room for a wardrobe hence no wardrobe I upgraded to a larger room But the room we stayed in was perhaps the smallest i have seen bar Tokyo The room was quite scruffy , Good location friendly staff
364952,Lancaster London, For us Nothing not to like , The whole experience from start to finish at the hotel was very good Great room Executive double Great views Super efficient staff Room service was very prompt Train line was 1min away So if you have lots of bags from shopping It makes life so much easier If you like exercise or just a pleasant walk Hyde park Kensington gardens are touching distance from the hotel We will be coming back For a stress free stay Thank you to everyone who we met at the hotel 
364953,Lancaster London, Prices in the bar a little expensive service wasnt great in the lounge bar Seemed more interested in keeping non residents out then serving guess We had to order our drinks at the bar ourselves and was still charged for service , Nice pillows Reception staff were great 
364954,Lancaster London, Furniture in room a little tired , Perfect location for sightseeing as the underground is just around the corner and walking distance from Paddington 
364955,Lancaster London, the signal for the television in our bedroom was poor and though we were not concerned it would have been useful to be able to tune in to more than two channels , the bedrooms were spacious and the bed was very comfortable the general areas and breakfast rooms were well appointed and decorated a very comfortable place to stay and in a good area near to the tube stations and Hyde Park My daughter and I were surprised to get a birthday treat most unexpected and very welcome 
364956,Lancaster London, I know the windows or opening of them has to comply with regs but they could have opened more I think For comfort The view of the carpark below was not attractive Some of the paint scrapes along the skirting boards from trolleys looked unsightly The lift doors on the inside look unsightly too , The staff were very attentive Very calm and friendly The foyer was impressive The view To the park was lovely All the meals I had in the hotel were delicious I loved my stay 
364957,Lancaster London, I wasn t told that 1 2 of my windows were blocked with film to hide construction cranes Also finishes were dated and tired drapes were torn couch upholstery was worn and faded and wood window sills need re finishing , The room layout design was great as is the view and hotel location 
364958,Lancaster London, Could have had a wider choice of TV channels and the service on Sunday lunch time in the bar could have been better But this did not detract from our stay, We were fortunate to be chosen as customer of the day so our stay exceeded our expectations and we were treated very well 
364959,Lancaster London, Valet parking is a bit on the expensive side 90 for 2 days , Very convenient spot for walk in Hyde Park or 10 minutes to Oxford St for more serious walking 
364960,Lancaster London, Nothing , Staff were really efficient and very polite and professional The concierge was so smiley and very welcoming I felt very special which was lovely Room was comfortable and clean and I thought it was very good value for money 
364961,Lancaster London, Cost of the breakfast , We only communicated with the receptionist on our arrival She was very helpful and friendly The good score is based on interaction with only one person hope the rest are as nice 
364962,Lancaster London, Very minor suggestion the safe instructions are difficult to read Too dark and too far down relocate , The outstanding helpful friendliness of the staff which creates a welcoming atmosphere that s unusual in a mid range London hotel 
364963,Lancaster London, The beds were very uncomfortable and it was quite noisy from the busy road below , The hotel was nice and the staff were friendly but it s a little tired and needed updating The bathroom was nice but there was a drainage problem

364966,Lancaster London, Breakfast was good but very noisy and busy Felt like a canteen No big deal Will be back again , Everything Staff room bar restaurant gym and location
364967,Lancaster London, English breakfast supplement was poor quality for the standard of the hotel Room had very limited mains power access only two UK power points and one of those was unusable Some power points behind the TV table were fully loaded with adapters for fixtures and inaccessible , Easy access and close to our destination Room was quiet and on 12th floor giving nice view of the city The Continental Breakfast buffet provision was very good 
364968,Lancaster London, Very small bathroom and not sure i would call the room superior as the hotel do Quite small in my opinion , Staff were very accommodating after moving rooms twice Eventually got moved to the 14th floor Fantastic views

364970,Lancaster London, Breakfast was poor considering the price please can we have a great British breakfast , Great welcome perfectly situated staff great food in the island restaurant was very good Great view from the room 
364971,Lancaster London, Nothing Whole stay was great , Excellent location close to tube Very good hotel with friendly staff Even gave my wife a bottle of wine for her birthday nice touches like that are what makes the difference 
364972,Lancaster London, The room had a smokey aroma as if someone previously had smoked a cigarette in the room It was subtle however The walls are also very thin you will definitely be able to hear the people in the corridor and rooms next door , Staff were very kind and helpful The view from the room was very impressive also 
364973,Lancaster London, Rooms are small dated and tatty I have my Christmas Party here every year the hotel looks lovely so thought the rooms would be too Therefore this year rather than struggle to get home i stayed here Next year i will go home , convenient for the function i was at the hotel itself hence booking here and huuuuge bed 
364974,Lancaster London,No Negative, Staffs responsiveness to a small issue I had with the internet they moved me to a fantastic room with good internet speed at the same cost with swiftness and efficiency 
364975,Lancaster London, The plumbing can be a little erratic but upgrading is in progress so perhaps this will improve A minor criticism which does not significantly detract from the quality of this establishment , Everything about this hotel is first rate It is exceptionally comfortable with excellent facilities and a very convenient location in a pleasant area The staff are wonderful and provide an unbelievably friendly and helpful service in all departments Buffet breakfast one of the best ever experienced

364977,Lancaster London, The rooms need to be improved The bathroom is old it need to be renewed, The Location is great and the staff are amazing especially the concierge The man who stand at the door and open the car is really friendly Rooms are good
364978,Lancaster London, Bad internet connection especially during break hours and bad tv signal lost every 10 minutes in the room, goodbye card cookies in the room polite staff
364979,Lancaster London, old furniture and old shower which water leaking from the top shower to the sides lobby area need to be cleaned much more , great staff very helpful and kind and mile all the time
364980,Lancaster London, Room was upgraded but looked very tired needs a refurb booked through a site got a deal but think they give the older rooms to this type of booking , Location
364981,Lancaster London, Wish the lobby could be re designed and made more welcoming The reception staff were fantastic though , Hotel is centrally located Fantastic transport links Overlooks Hyde Park The rates available just before Christmas were an absolute bargain 100 a night for a lovely room It s almost a 4 5 Star Hotel 
364982,Lancaster London,No Negative, We were very kindly upgraded to a suite for our one night stay As we were meeting friends from Hawaii this was wonderful The reception staff in particular deserve raise 
364983,Lancaster London,No Negative, This hotel over looks Hyde Park and is pristine inside With the windows closed you can not hear the road outside which is brilliant The rooms are spacious and the beds are comfy I have no fault for this hotel as the staff were all friendly and eager to help they all said hello if you were walking through the hotel I would most definitely stay in this hotel again may I visit London

365005,Lancaster London, No bad experience, Situation of hotel by Hyde Park and where I needed to be My son who lives in Australia was also staying at the hotel and this is what prompted my visit 
365006,Lancaster London, I booked 2 twin rooms and requested to be next to or close to each other i requested an early check in 12 1 and got neither I sent 3 emails about early check and got no reply turned up just after 12 to be told they had not received my e mails We had one room on floor 8 and one on floor 12 so nowhere near each other and our room was a double not a twin which was put right but along with the other two disappointments it was not a great start to our stay, the veiw was fantastic and location for our needs was within waliking distance which was great as not late night tubes staff were friendly and very helpful

365019,Lancaster London, The curtains were pulled off the runners There was no hot water when we came to get ready to go out on Saturday night and the shower was loose on the wall this was a superior room The grill room and the Park breakfast room were all very cold too much use of the air conditioning One lady sat having her meal with a coat round her shoulders that should have given the staff a clue I did ask for it to be turned off they said they would but it never happened We think it is on for the staff why when you are sat having a meal do management staff think you want to be freezing cold you wouldn t have it like that in your own dining rooms at home , Our room was quiet
365020,Lancaster London, None at all , Third stay at this fine hotel Very conveniently placed beside Hyde park and adjecent to the tube network Fine views over the park and the city Lovely staff fine restaurants 
365021,Lancaster London, Room size was vey small and barely any room to turn around Shower was too small and could not get two people in the bathroom , Location was very close to underground railway 
365022,Lancaster London, Wi fi was not working properly in our room The rooms were not ready when we arrived to the hotel at 15 00 pm We reserved 2 rooms at the same time and the rooms were at different floors and far from each other After we talk to the reception they arrange closer rooms , Location is perfect Just 100 mt to Lancaster Gate Underground Station 
365023,Lancaster London, Had booked with booking com for room for 2 adults and 1 child On check in was told that the room booked would not accommodate extra bed for child Staff very helpful and for a nominal charge we were upgraded to a proper triple room and problem solved Should not have had this problem in the first place however , Excellent location Very helpful staff on reception

365029,Lancaster London, Had to change rooms 3 times due to problems with the hot water toilets not working and no airconditioning Their maintenance in this hotel needs to step up , Lovely hotel in a great position close to transport and a great park Their ground floor staff are terrific and happy to help with everything 
365030,Lancaster London, breakfast was not included I think for the price it should have been, I was a guest at an awards show being held here so It was extremely convenient to stay in the hotel Lovely being opposite Hyde park to walk off our hangovers
365031,Lancaster London, It is just a small detail really but I would have liked the mini bar to be stocked in the room before arrival Also as there were dressing gowns provided slippers would have completed that little privilege , Location was excellent just round the corner from Lancaster Gate Underground The staff were very helpful and friendly Concierge were able to organise a bus tour for my daughter and I also room service was excellent delicious food and quick service Beds were clean and comfortable and we had a great two nights sleep Would definitely recommend this hotel and will use it again myself 
365032,Lancaster London, A lengthy check in However hotel apologized profusely and provided complimentary breakfast for the stay which was appreciated A used nappy under the bed from a previous guest , Buffet breakfast is very good All the staff in the hotel were very polite pleasant and helpful The lounge was wonderful to relax in and the Island Grill restaurant was excellent 
365033,Lancaster London, The price is over and i dont know why the room has different rate every night , The hotel is a 3 min walk from a metro and a bus station which made our live much easier The Portegase lady in the concierge was very helpful The room was equipped with every thing you would need small fridge iron and table air conditioning hair drier water boiler and a good wifi There was a small store just next to the hotel were you can get whatever you need 
365034,Lancaster London,No Negative, Central location with ease of access to travel infrastructure Views of the park and over London were magnificent Courteous staff made a real difference 
365035,Lancaster London, We found the internal noise levels too high after moving from our originally allocated room extremely noisy neighbours the replacement room was also noisy being adjacent to a service room with a lot of banging doors , Courteous helpful and friendly staff 
365036,Lancaster London, We thought we were getting a Suite but ended up with a large room with a sofa in it The bathroom was very small There wasn t a lot of pictures on their web site and it never even displayed the suite so this is why we thought we had one paying for the most expensive room It just wasn t set clear what you were getting I have tried to book the suite for next year but it is not displayed again on any date I tired so we will go somewhere else next year , The closeness to Hyde Park just a walk across the road The view wasn t to bad and the shower was good with shampoos and bath stuff 
365037,Lancaster London, Unable to get room specified to you park view on lower floor 6th the first possible You should know this Ended up with one overlooking a building site No refund possible but kind staff gave complimentary breakfast , Location close to Paddington and Hyde Park 
365038,Lancaster London, Asked if we would prefer double bed but still got singles too small Sink plug broken bath water took all night to drain TV not working Air con so loud you couldn t have fan on no opening windows Bar drinks extortionate even for London Lifts useless ended up using stairs , Location 
365039,Lancaster London, This hotel felt tired and needed a bit of tic had a smell like a Las Vegas hotel You also had to queue for breakfast so we didn t eat here, We stayed here for the location bbc festival in a day
365040,Lancaster London, The hotel is a very nice place but the windows of my suite were very dirty on the outside This is the only problem I had all weekend , The view was perfect the beds where so comfy and the staff where absolutely fantastic helping out where ever they could The Door Man was very nice and friendly in particular
365041,Lancaster London,No Negative, A great reception s stuff very helpful and disciplined Very good cleaning stuff as well Gym is convenient for central London A view from the room was fantastic 
365042,Lancaster London, Booked a superior double with park views but was upgraded but however the room had no view of the park and really needed to be updated Very run dow, Location is good
365043,Lancaster London, Considering the room price thought the extra 31 for 2 breakfasts excessive Ate good breakfast very locally for less than half of that , Immediate access to the Tube City centre Park Friendly staff
365044,Lancaster London, There were stains on the carpet an the arm chair Also the room had a strong undesirable smell I had to purchase a air freshener from Oxford St to get rid off the smell , The room had good veiw an the bed was comfy
365045,Lancaster London, The breakfast had to be changed 3 times as it was cold and some of the food was not cooked properly , The location was good and the room was very comfortable The room was on the 16th floor overlooking Hyde Park 
365046,Lancaster London, this hotel uses the term Deluxe Room Loosely and depending on availability They used standard room and tried to convince us this is deluxe Unfortunately we stayed earlier that week in the hotel and we stayed in Deluxe room so we knew how the room should look like , staff were ok
365047,Lancaster London, The water taps at the bath are old fashioned and have a difficult to use mechanism , Best location with fabulous view to the city and Hyde park The tube station is one minute walk We asked for a quiet room and received one at the 16th floor which was nice and quiet Room was clean and nicely maintained The staff at reception were kind and helpful We needed Concierge assistance few times and were very satisfied with their help 
365048,Lancaster London, We particularly booked this hotel as it had a car park onsite However on arrival we were told that the car park was closed for refurbishment There was a valet parking service instead in the interim at the same price so all OK ,No Positive
365049,Lancaster London, Room a little tired and could do with a little refreshing of Its decor The fire door was particularly irritating as it squeaked constantly , Location view
365050,Lancaster London, The rooms on that particular floor seemed to be a combination of options for non smokers and smokers Unfortunately it was unpleasant to smell cigarette smoke on few occasions and probably with booking I would like to make sure this could be excluded Placement of sockets to arrange ironing was more than tricky and it would be expected to have an easy access to a socket where the ironing desk is kept in the cupboard not on the other side of the room where you have to fight with space between a chair desk bed and personal belongings Little practical issues Also lack of bottled water per room as a part of catering we found to be under standard for this class of hotel luckily we had own arrangements to refresh ourselves after a long journey , The room we were allocated to was on 14th floor with a great view across the city landscape and popular features Although the booking included the Hyde Park view and city to get the gardens view it would have to be on the other side of the building Room was clean and well presented as travelled with my colleague room had two separate beds comfortably separated Clean and well accessible bathroom with no hygienic issues I would agree with other comment that although it is next to the tube station it limits only to the Central Line The hotel staff was very helpful and check in check out went relatively smoothly We also were able to recover left in the item via mail with no additional costs The breakfast offers a very nice selection of morning food to fuel your day until evening and for those liking more variety a separate section of Indian food is served as part of custom We cannot comment on dining and other meals All together I would book my stay again in Lancaster London Hotel 
365051,Lancaster London, we stayed in two different rooms on different floors Both rooms were due for remodeling updating , The location is excellent convenient to the underground the staff very friendly and professional 
365052,Lancaster London, The room which i booked is under my expectation it was very small space and very dirty furniture i tried to see more than 4 room and it was the same I ask dor bigger room and i look into 2 rooms I choose the best of them which I can stay in it This cost me 65 Pound day more Simply I will not book to this hotel again , Staff trying to satisfied me in anyway
365053,Lancaster London, We arrived on a Saturday The corridor outside our room was littered with small pieces of rubbish which were not cleaned up until Monday We paid extra for a park view room The view was diagonal not direct and only the boundary trees could be seen from the 8th floor Waste of money Hotel is in general need of renovation The room furniture was not in a great condition , Location
365054,Lancaster London, It s written on booking website that the superior twin room size is 20 m2 but in reality the rooms are much smaller and the bathroom is very tiny When I talked to the staff she told me the room size is 15 m, Location Allowed us to check in early
365055,Lancaster London, Very bad connection WiFi Very slow in check in and out Very small rooms and bathrooms They just started construction work and you can hear them every day, Location
365056,Lancaster London, No bad experiences only good , Chose the Lancaster for its location near Paddington Although there are other hotels that are closer we liked the fact that the hotel offered views over Hyde Park Short 5 min walk from Paddington which turned out to be an excellent decision as there was a tube strike on
