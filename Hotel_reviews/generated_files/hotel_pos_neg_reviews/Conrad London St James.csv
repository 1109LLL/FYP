107747,Conrad London St James, No parking facilities but could have opted for valet parking but only if you trust London valet parking , Quality room fittings added to the excellent room finish value for money with additional features such as an expresso maker 
107748,Conrad London St James, The smell of perfume in the lobby was too strong and the smell of cigarettes just outside the front door was also unpleasant , Excellent helpful staff members
107749,Conrad London St James,No Negative, The staff surprised us with their warmth and service It was on par We booked the largest room so it was just amazing Heated floors in the bathrooms Loved it here 
107750,Conrad London St James, needs a tv in bathroom loud screeching noise at 7am in morning water pipe issues in the hotel horrendous leak in bathroom shower design water pours all over the bathroom floor no pool or spa expensive food and drinks no discount offered for breakfast at check in hairdryer was faulty wet towels were taken an turndown time but not replaced, Modern decor comfy bed personal touches staff were very polite lovely to have turndown service
107751,Conrad London St James, There were no instructions whatsoever on how to use TV Phone etc I could not work out whether curtains were electric or manual When the people in the room next door used their shower an airlock created a horrible siren like noise that awoke myself and my wife at 1 am thinking it was a fire alarm , The room was fine Nothing jumps out as outstanding
107752,Conrad London St James, No tub in the bath room also morning sunlight came through the bathroom window and made us wake up too soon , breakfast was good tea coffee facilities and amenities were good crispy sheets and super down pillows on the bed no tub in the bathroom instead a wheelchair facility Sunlight was shining from the bath room which caused early wake up bell boy service was prompt and friendly St James tube station conveniently across the road storage of luggage was very well organised we had a short but wonderful stay at Conrad We enjoyed good value for money Will recommend Conrad Hotel to anybody 
107753,Conrad London St James, Housekeeping wasn t very consistent Although the bed was made we always came back feeling that the room wasn t tidied up maybe it s a directive from management not to put things away Although we aren t messy we did sometimes forget to put our shoes away etc as we d be in a rush to get to our destinations and it was a little disappointing to come back and everything was the way it was except for the bed and thankfully the bathroom We once forgot to turn off the Do Not Disturb sign and I called the hotel to explain I was assured housekeeping would be sent up We got back housekeeping must have left because no one explained to them to ignore the DND We called again turned off the DND light and asked for the room to be made Room was made but they d taken all the towels and had not replaced them , Doorman was extremely helpful and helped us get cheaper parking about 5min walk away from the property We received complimentary wine on arrival Our fav part was probably the lounge we gained access to because of our suite It allowed us to use the meeting room facilities when my partner and I had some business calls to attend to but it also served a fabulous afternoon tea that I thoroughly enjoyed Their scones were to die for Breakfast was fine not too many kosher options unfortunately but I m sure this wouldn t be a problem for most guests 
107754,Conrad London St James, No spa also I asked for a vase and they did not have one The staff did not smile and came across quite moody , This hotel has the most comfiest bed ever If you want comfort and a good nights sleep this is a great option Also loved that the tube station is just across the road and that there are lots of shops and cafes nearby 
107755,Conrad London St James, Two minor things our view was of the rooftop of an interior courtyard Basically just an inner light well for the hotel But I had asked specifically for a quiet room and that location certainly delivered Besides the room was so beautiful inside we just pulled the sheer curtains closed and then the blackout curtains at night Secondly the lobby is heavily fragranced which my husband with allergies did not appreciate I did not care for the smell myself but that may just be my preference Otherwise it was a wonderful stay , It was a jewel box of a room Not overly large but clean and luxurious and cozy with every amenity we could possibly need The bed and bedding were amazing and the decor was warm and modern I asked for a quiet room and we never heard any other sound while in our room We slept like babies Felt very pampered And the location cannot be bettered Just steps from the St James Park tube station After a long day touring and walking there was nothing better than knowing our hotel was right there beside the tube station And we loved being so close to Westminster and St James Park The neighborhood is close to everything yet without all the hoards of tourists and noise you can get in London We loved it and would definitely stay again 
107756,Conrad London St James,No Negative, The staff were excellent We stayed 2 days after arriving from the US before going off to Normandy and Paris It refreshed us to start our vacation at the Conrad St James
107757,Conrad London St James, Cleaners for the rooms were good but did not restock the tea and coffee at the same time so it meant that two or three people were knocking on the door at different times , Good sized room room service available all day and night 
107758,Conrad London St James, Absence of a health spa was very disappointing had to source outside for workout, Housekeeping was meticulous Concierge service was fantastic Hotel staff courteous at all times

107760,Conrad London St James, Due to business reasons I informed the hotel that I was about to check out around 2 or 3pm and they said only able to check out at 2pm However due to traffic in London I rushed to the hotel at 2 45pm to check out the staff at the reception and the cleaning staff gave me a very nasty look and implied I came too late to check out which was very unpleasant I understood the late June was a busy period for the hotel because I travelled a lot and stayed many times in the hotel and staff have always been very friendly and accommodating but the experience I had this time was not good , Food and hotel facilities were excellent
107761,Conrad London St James, We had a meal out and decided to have dessert back at the hotel I had a sticky toffee pudding and hubby had a bread and butter pudding Mine arrived and then we had to ask where my husbands was It eventually turned up Neither were particularly great The price of each was 8 and then they stuck nearly 3 on as a Service charge which wasn t optionally Felt ripped off , Bed and bedding lovely Best nights sleep in ages 
107762,Conrad London St James, Issues encountered with regards to do not disturb button inadvertently being pressed This was not explained on check in or when bags were brought to the room This resulted in a one and half hour wait to get into the room on the second day of our stay as the room was not serviced After servicing condiments had not been replenished and wet towel left in room Guest services did not tespond to three separate phone calls , Location
107763,Conrad London St James, Not being able to get your own ice The Restaurant was pricey was good but not excellent Had better in London for less , The location was excellent walk to Westminster Abbey The London eye bus tour The room was very comfortable the shower was excellent The only bad thing was if you want a small ice bucket or a beer you can t bring it up from the bar you need to call room service Thought that was a bit crazy The concierge service was great A bit posh but really nice The sheets towels pillows were great quality A lovely stay

107773,Conrad London St James, The turn down service is annoying I have to remake the bed to go to bed in it Cleaning of bedroom is good The bar most waiters and waitressses were excellent one her English was not good enough and she did not pay attention to our order like she should have Obligatory 12 5 tipping when we stayed for 13 days and ate there twice a day Spending approximately 100 per meal 2600 Total tip 325 a little high for soup and salad in a bar , Very helpful reception service and doormen Food in the bar

107776,Conrad London St James, The water from the shower didnt stay in the shower area It was a little annoying to have to put multiple towels down to catch the water, Room service was a delight Staff was friendly and attentive Overall my favorite hotel I ve ever stayed in 
107777,Conrad London St James, Although expected rooms very small Concierge very friendly but we got some misinformation couple times Hotel bar closes early believe the whole area does Just plan accordingly , Great location near st James park station Nice large hotel bar Lovely door staff always friendly and grab a taxi in minutes

107779,Conrad London St James,No Negative, if you can upgrade to a room with the executive lounge access I would highly recommend it as the facilities were excellent love this hotel cannot wait to stay here again
107780,Conrad London St James, Recipation staff was very unwelcoming We felt it was Prejudice and humiliating to my daughter Many things they say to justify their actions was not true and unexcpetable even management apologies but still racisam has no place in England They do some thing stupid and humiliating and maybe racist and justified it because of security check and their location and next day they violate their own excuses By making another mistake negate their policy if their justification was true The person caused all the problem didn t even oppolgies but management did after we requested a meeting Apology accepted but rating has to be fare and balanced ,No Positive

107783,Conrad London St James, I know it s difficult but we didn t have a very good view out of window we could see into other people s rooms and they could look into ours we just looked into windows , The rooms are spacious and clean tidy beds are very comfy There was a bath tub which was excellent for soaking feet after walking all day windows could be opened so we could have fresh air instead of the air con We ate at the hotel and the food was excellent staff are very friendly 
107784,Conrad London St James, Breakfast was overpriced they had only cooked Sausages Scrambled Egg and Mushrooms I had to ask for Bacon and B Beans to be cooked I would of thought they would of had this available from the start Bar has no popular lagers , Clean modern hotel with excellent rooms and very helpful and friendly staff 
107785,Conrad London St James, Breakfast was chaos I had to ask for tea and toast on several occasions It never came Tables weren t cleared It wasn t even that busy , They upgraded us to a suite for the price of breakfast

107788,Conrad London St James, Price for food and drinks were extortionate we ate elsewhere, good facility s and friendly staff we got there early and they held our luggage until our room was ready to save carrying them around
107789,Conrad London St James, For my stay from 23 27 December the breakfast was always the same and there was no change at all by 3rd day i started to feel very bad literally stopped having anything from there Food is bad blue boar breakfast incharge at the reception was having a bad attitude , bed was good staff was good Doorman Mr Dave is wonderful 
107790,Conrad London St James, Cooked breakfast was a bit disappointing but that was maybe our fault for not getting up earlier , The welcome and care of staff was outstanding the accommodation was great everything first class

107793,Conrad London St James, check out was difficult and took too long we got double billed for breakfast which was discovered and corrected by the hotel management in 2 days, small but comfortable rooms friendly and caring staff
107794,Conrad London St James, Absolutely nothing dining and accommodation , The staff could not have been more helpful the facilities were second to none and I have never been made to feel so welcome Try the cocktails in the Blue Boar Smokehouse brilliant 
107795,Conrad London St James, Gym was simply too small esp when you have a personal trainer that works out 2 clients, It worked very Well for us as a famile with adult kids Great lounge with relaxing staff that was extremely helpful Beds were wonderful
107796,Conrad London St James, We arrived at 15 00 but the room was not ready Although this was very quickly addressed by a friendly member of the check in team and we were given a free upgrade to a room that was ready I can t fault them , What s not to like The location was perfect Everything was spotlessly clean the room was fantastic with large TV large bathroom and great facilities Nothing was to much trouble for the incredibly friendly checking staff The breakfast had a good selection and the sausages were very tasty Would definitely stay in the Hotel again in the future 
107797,Conrad London St James, No direction given when checking in had to requestwhere the Lifts were to find room No mention of the fire test that took place around 9 30 10am Coffee stain on the desk around the drawer at the front right hand side Cobweb dangling from ceiling, Location was great and the hotel in general very nice The travel cot when set up came with a baby dressing gown and some lovely toiletries this was a great touch 
107798,Conrad London St James, Would have liked an information pack about the hotel facilities and amenities in the room , Comfy beds lovely bathroom and super in room refreshments Good room service 
107799,Conrad London St James, The nature of the shower meant it was impossible not to get the floor of the bathroom wet after use This seemed hazardous to me , The bed was very comfortable and the room clean and modern 
107800,Conrad London St James, Rude and unprofessional staff Hotel Gym no privacy at all Full of personal trainers in tiny gym room with they are clients It was really strange never had that experience before , Nothing to like in Conrad hotel They need to improve a lot They are even not on 3star hotel level

107802,Conrad London St James, Nothing i like everything just little far from Knightsbridge and Harrods and really i strongly recommend this hotel, Fantastic Conceirge thanks to Tom and Nice and Clean Hotel
107803,Conrad London St James, It is well located if you re interested in visiting the top London tourist spots which are all about 10 mins walk away Not ideal for my visit however there is an underground station right across the hotel which was very convenient and easy to use My stay was a bit pricey but that is what you d expect from hotels in London at this time of year with almost all rooms sold out , Everything For London standard hotels this had the best standard rooms I have ever stayed in Clean spacious comfortable high tech and the best customer service all around I will definitely be making this my hotel of choice for all future visits 
107804,Conrad London St James, Size of the room but understand we did not pay for it, Staff were extremely professional courteous and helpful Decor was very appealing Artwork lovely
107805,Conrad London St James, Room got warm very quickly The service in the lobby bar could be a little faster or better staffed , Fabulous place and helpful staff From the beautiful entrance elegant reception and gorgeous surroundings the Conrad strikes the perfect 5 Star balance Comfortable beds and well kitted out rooms made me sad to leave 
107806,Conrad London St James,No Negative, Great location for our purposes Friendly and helpful staff The room wasn t really large but very nice Big bright bathroom with excellent walk in shower plus tub 
107807,Conrad London St James, The bath plug was difficult to understand and kept sliding back to the middle and drained the bath a few times whilst leaning on it , The bed was extra comfy Facilities we modern and easy to navigate 
107808,Conrad London St James, Lobby and restaurants cold and without charme Almost no windows Staff at breakfast not experienced and not good organized Breakfast quite poor for the hotel standard Not a large selection omelettes and some egg dishes will be charged , Good Location Nice Rooms Comfortable Bed
107809,Conrad London St James, The security of the hotel suddenly walked into my room without even ringing the phone because of a noise complaint I had some bags in the room for gifts I have bought and these bags had receipts that I needed for claiming taxes the house keeping house keeping services end at 10 PM room price approximately 400 just took them and I had to open an investigation and at the end I didn t get them back I had to checkout on my fith day because of all the mess that happened This is my 3rd time at this hote but the last The hotel was much more efficient with it s previous intercontinental management ,No Positive
107810,Conrad London St James,No Negative, After touring amidst all the crowds and commotion of a large city it was great to be able to retreat to a super quiet hotel that was a stone s throw from some of the major attractions Service was great beds were incredibly comfortable with super plush bedding staff was really courteous even to children 
107811,Conrad London St James, Unfortunately room did not have toileteries ie toothbrush and paste Requested newspaper which was left outside the room instead of having it slipped inside the room So had no idea it was there Phoned to check if room was smoking room and felt staff was very offhand and rude Room was okay although one of the upholstered chair was considerably stained Did not want to sit on it , Location and helpfulnes of night staff 
107812,Conrad London St James, The size of the room that we paid for seemed very small for the money , The staff were very friendly and helpful The Hotel was very clean and comfortable The Hotel was well situated for sightseeing 
107813,Conrad London St James, We had forgotten our tooth brushes most hotels we have stayed in have them in the bathroom just in case But never mind we went to chemist and brought two more , The hotel and staff are excellent great location the room was great and the staff really were brilliant we will be back 
107814,Conrad London St James, Its very expensive for what it is but that is London air conditioning was hard to adjust and entire hotel was too cold perhaps the heat wave was too much , Friendly and very helpful staff nice rooms excellent restaurant great location 
107815,Conrad London St James, Beware standard room is facing the wall The room was not made up till 2 pm I was forced to ask for it two times , Hotel is modern and nice Personnel is helpful 
107816,Conrad London St James, Lack of the possibility of late check out even of a half an hour the breakfast restaurant is unfortunately without a natural light no windows full breakfast is too expensive The room in comparison to the bathroom was very small The obligatory daily changing of the sheets policy is a shame it should be on request as it is usually a waste of time money and energy , The location was perfect interiors room and its equipment bathroom shower and bath breakfast The rooms are very clean The concierge were very helpful and fast The quality of the fruits and vegetables for breakfast is superb 
107817,Conrad London St James, No information about what was offer at breakfast we finished our breakfast from buffet and realised later that we could have requested ordered other options from a menu porridge fruit variety of eggs toast etc there was no menu on the table no information was given to us by any of the staff A lot of money for one night not to have outstanding provision Left wishing we d stayed in a premier inn for a 1 4 of the price, rooms comfortable great shower hotel reception concierge
107818,Conrad London St James, Mature couple like us needed a double bed instead of twin bed although I wouldn t blame the hotel as it was absolutely my mistake at the time of booking, Excellent location
107819,Conrad London St James, Nothing Everyone was friendly and helpful and the decor was to our liking , The bathroom rainfall shower Also the mirror tv in the bedroom Very modern overall appearance Also enjoyed the scones and clotted cream 
107820,Conrad London St James, The breakfast was ok I have had better breakfast more extensive choice in other hotels The quality was fine I would have just liked to see more on the pastry bakery front and perhaps omelets The service was impeccable but the choice was a little like a Holiday Inn, The staff were very friendly and super accommodating Nothing too much trouble I also loved the layout and decor of the room The bathroom design is a stroke of genius I would love that bathroom at home Clever use of space Also loved the mouthwash 
107821,Conrad London St James, There wasn t anything that I could fault , Polite courteous staff especially Ivan in the restaurant I liked the attention to detail and the extra touches of the turn down service The bed was very comfy I didn t want to get up 
107822,Conrad London St James, Club room facilities rather restricted a glass of wine in the afternoon after shopping would make for a nice relaxation Perhaps could charge more and make food and beverages match availability in other hotel club lounges , Room clean and modern 
107823,Conrad London St James, The shower design is not good as the tray is very shallow therefore the water runs out under the door in to the bathroom I also think it would be nice to have a toilet brush so that the toilet can be cleaned if necessary rather than leave it for the staff which can be embarrassing , Everything
107824,Conrad London St James,No Negative, The hotel is in a fantastic location for walking London attractions The hotel is spotlessly clean and inviting the staff are friendly and ever so helpful we will definitely be back 
107825,Conrad London St James, The shower leaked under the door so we had to mop up each time which was a bit of a nuisance , The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were soft but very supportive I slept very well toiletries etc were plentiful and very good quality 
107826,Conrad London St James, Shower leaked and had to continually use extra towels to avoid a flood Was not addressed even after we reported the problem to staff , Bed was extremely comfortable and so enjoyed the many extra pillows 
107827,Conrad London St James, After check out the sum payed to the hotel via a card was taken again No reply got from the hotel and a long negotiation with my bank is now in process very unpleasant problems Please do not perform so with your guests , The stay was perfect perfect service perfect location perfect room everything needed is there peefect bed Thank you very much 
107828,Conrad London St James, Not really a dislike but our room was showing some wear For example caulking missing or coming out from the tile in the bathroom soiled spots on the carpet as well as unraveling of the carpet ends The shower floor was very slippery when wet Perhaps some deep grooves cut into the marble would help to prevent falling Also some assist bars would be helpful , The hotel staff is fantastic Would definitely consider this hotel in the future 
107829,Conrad London St James,No Negative, After proposing to my girlfriend she said yes I thought nothing could beat that but this hotel just enhanced our special day bedroom staff food location and many more were just unbelievable What happily stay at the Conrad St James again
107830,Conrad London St James, Shower drain should be looked at When you shower the water could fill up the space You need to be strategic when you shower , Location Location stuff were amazing managed to go to thiier extrem to make our stay pleasant 
107831,Conrad London St James, I was travelling with my sister and 80 Mother and yet they still took a 100 deposit per room against damage what did they think we were going to do this money was out of my account for 3 days after checking out , The beds and pillows were the best I have ever had so I had a brilliant nights sleep 
107832,Conrad London St James, Not being told that they would hold 100 that they will refund after 5 days , Fantastic location knowledgeable and polite staff wonderful waterfall walks in shower 
107833,Conrad London St James, There was nothing not to like the service was impeccable , The bed was amazingly comfortable I didn t want to leave The rainbow shower was awesome Breakfast was an adventure with many choices to chose from 
107834,Conrad London St James, Very minor Our waitress at breakfast didn t advise us that we could order food other than what was out at the buffet eg toast and eggs We only realised when we overheard another guest being told after we had finished , Great location friendly staff lovely facilities 
107835,Conrad London St James,No Negative, The room is clean nice and modern with more space comparing to the other hotels with the same price Friendly staffs Great Location Really appreciate the stay 
107836,Conrad London St James, Nothing A spa here would be ideal but it doesn t have one and still is an excellent central London hotel at ridiculously good value for money , Helpful polite staff Beautiful clean spacious rooms Very considered comprehensive amenities in the room Superb breakfast in room dining 
107837,Conrad London St James, Although the bathroom was stylish and well appointed the shower did leak through the door into bathroom which made the floor wet and dangerous This happened in both rooms that we booked so is probably a design fault with the marble shower floor That said this is only a minor observation and should be read in context , This is a five star hotel and is very well situated for visiting Central London The hotel is stylishly modern as are the rooms the amenities are good and all of the staff friendly and very helpful 
107838,Conrad London St James, Nothing , Outstanding service room serviced on demand numerous times a day Room highly luxurious both sophisticated but welcoming as was the rest of the hotel Food in the Blue Boar Restaurant was phenomenal maybe a bit pricey but it is central London Baggage storage on checkout very efficient Room service prompt and high quality Staff friendly and welcoming Had a brilliant stay 
107839,Conrad London St James,No Negative, Great Hotel with wonderful staff will definitely be going back The location was fantastic being close to Westminster a number of theatres and a brilliant tube station on the doorstep The executive lounge was well worth including as this provides breakfast up until 11am and a number of free drinks later in the day 
107840,Conrad London St James, I was really unhappy with quality of room service food I specifically didn t eat out to have some food back at the hotel and was really disappointed The burger cooked medium was charcoaled and rock solid over well done The spaghetti bolognese sauce was too dry The tomato sauce used on pizza base was more of a pasta sauce with chunks of onion and very tangy We re ordered the burger only for it to arrive in the same condition Breakfast was again another disappointment I love this hotel but shocked at quality food this time round , great location and lovely rooms Been here 3 times now 
107841,Conrad London St James, Nothing, Great location Excellent staff happy to help in every way It was my birthday so we got an upgrade and complimentary wine delivered to our door Lovely surprise Would definitely stay again 
107842,Conrad London St James,No Negative, Overall a fab stay Stayed her for NYE was an ideal location for the fireworks and the rest of London was an easy commute Hotel was lovely staff were friendly 
107843,Conrad London St James, bed too hard pillow too soft breakfast selection was limited unless you asked for things not in the buffet e g omelette soy milk porridge most of the staff spoke English as a second language so communication was a challenge at times standard room is small media hub is a nice feature but not that easy to connect to, Location room quality fixtures and fittings food quality service shower
107844,Conrad London St James, The option of dining services is not so much the flavor is average The most disappointed is that they held my money as extra charge but never notify me And the amount is incredibly much We stayed with this hotel for 5 nights but they did the pre authorisation more than 2000 even I have paid the everything They just explained there s systematic wrong , The bed is so soft and comfort and the clearness of room is great Some staffs are helpful 
107845,Conrad London St James, Very small room no view hard or old mattress and annoying loud sound from the mini fridge, Clean Room excellent furniture bedding and linens spacious and clean bathroom
107846,Conrad London St James, The only thing I didn t like was the lady behind reception didn t explain the room deposit properly to me She should have told me that if I paid with a debit card I would get my 100 deposit back within 3 5 working days I was explained this after I made the payment Beside this everything was 5 star from the moment we walked in the door What an amazing hotel all round , One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in Close to everything in London Amazing staff Amazing room I will definitely be back 100 
107847,Conrad London St James, The bar Big fail Amazing furniture and nice decor but VERY over lit so felt like being in some sort of fast food restaurant Sauces etc on the tables So incongruent with the rest of the hotel Truly bad Sort the lighting It could be great, Pretty much everything especially the staff Great room too Room service excellent Check in checkout terrific
107848,Conrad London St James,No Negative, Comfortable rooms great location but OMG the staff The level of service was just above and beyond my expectation and for this alone I would stay here again 
107849,Conrad London St James, There is nothing negative to say , We both felt at home here Staff very professional and polite The bed was soo comfy Food was lovely worth paying that extra for the service we received 
107850,Conrad London St James, The room was very light which I often struggle with Additionally the pillows were far too soft and I couldn t sleep on them , Cleanliness and very friendly staff
107851,Conrad London St James, We were put in a disabled room and also the shower flooded thought the room Wetting the bottom of are clothes We the had to change rooms, It was clean and staff were very helpful
107852,Conrad London St James, A half used toilet roll in the bathroom I think for 320 a night we could have one all to ourselves , Comfortable modern hotel Excellent staff Great evening meal in restaurant Very comfortable bed Central location
107853,Conrad London St James, check in out desks understaffed poor management did not respond to a complaint at all during our 3days much better service elsewhere in London, staff on breakfast very helpful attentive pleasant
107854,Conrad London St James, Slightly inconsistent service with regards to keeping our in room coffee water refilled daily Wasn t a big issue , Great location Just minutes to Westminster Abby Buckingham Palace Big Ben Parliment and the London Eye Book the Executive room if you can It included a wonderful hot breakfast afternoon snacks and evening cocktails and appetizers Very worth the extra money Friendly and helpful staff We really enjoyed our stay and would stay there again

107861,Conrad London St James, It s hard to get a cup of complimentary coffee in the morning or as an American to get ice in the evening The hotel should have coffee and tea readily available in the lobby Fortunately there is a Pret and an espresso bar next door I had to beg from the concierge room for ice and was gifted with about 6 little cubes each night The bathroom doors are heavy sliding things and the showers leak into the bathroom Minor annoyances it s still a very nice hotel , The Conrad is in a great location and is very clean and classy looking The rooms are quiet and well maintained It s fairly expensive but not obscenely so like the most famous London hotels generally are 
107862,Conrad London St James, The hotel over charged me for my room rate by 100 When I questioned the hotel they claimed it wasn t there fault dispite my bank statement showing the hotel name They offered no explanation as to why forcing me to go back and forward on the phone to booking com and the hotel The Hilton Conrad are a huge corporation and they could have refunded me my money but they were uninterested not what I would expect from this type of hotel Thankfully booking com were helpful and refunded me the difference ,No Positive
