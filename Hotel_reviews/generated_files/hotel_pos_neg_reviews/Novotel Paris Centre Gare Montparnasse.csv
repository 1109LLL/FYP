71288,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, It isn t cheap, We were given 2 single pull out beds which were ideal for our little ones On arrival they were given toys and there were toys on their beds when we got into the room too The bed was extremely comfortable We had room service 3 times due to one of us being unwell and the food was delicious and portions were very good 
71289,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Breakfast gets busy and sometimes not possible to get sitting space , This is a really good hotel close to Gare Montparnasse station Very easy to get to the location is excellent The staff are helpful and the breakfast is really good to get your started with your day 
71290,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, lack of highchairs in restaurant, Comfy beds activities for the kids little extras i e toblerones free from mini bar nice little touches excellent stay
71291,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Nothing, Great location bus direct from airport to nearby Gare Montparnasse Room was good size for 3 and clean with good facilities Breakfast buffet good and no issues finding enough to suit a dairy free diet and slightly fussy 11 year old We walked a lot and ate in nearby restaurants State was probably pick of these 
71292,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, They didn t replace the tea bags after you used a specific flavor , The sofa bed in the room really handy with kids And the location was really good Especially traveling from gare du Nord just one metro line to connect you from the hotel 
71293,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, The toilet is too small for comfort breakfast area is too small for the hotel crowd Suggest to ask guests to register their intended eating time to manage the crowd, Location is great room is clean and modern
71294,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, The place is good to stay located in the old neighbourhood of Montparnasse but I found the staff not so friendly I had arrived early morning and I had already requested for early check in but that did not happen and I can understand that there might be an unavailability of room but then I had requested to contact the property via booking com multiple times since I wanted to extend another night at the hotel and even then Novotel never got in touch with me It was a difficult experience managing this hotel , The rooms were spacious and clean The bed was comfortable Breakfast was like any other 3 4 star hotel buffet spread The staff was fine The location of the hotel is quite convenient 
71295,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse,No Negative, The property was recently updated We got an upgrade to a more comfortable room with balcony and view to Eiffel Tower with no extra cost so as to compensate the delay in letting us in 
71296,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, The Eiffel Tower looked closer than it was albeit walkable but at the end of a day of sightseeing it was too much to walk back so we had to take a short taxi ride , We enjoyed the buffet breakfast and the variety of items available There was something for everyone The self serve coffee station had a nice selection of coffees Our interaction with the front desk staff was always positive and pleasant from check in to check out This was our first trip to Europe and at the suggestion of family to consider the Novatel brand we were not disappointed The hotel smelled clean and was well taken care of The size of our room was ample for 3 guests 
71297,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, The breakfast was really bad Noisy crowdy messy and few seatings and too little time Only open to 9 30 on weekdays Had to que every morning to get a table The rooms are too small for a family , Good location and great parking in a garage Superior rooms are good but small for a family 
71298,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Little off the main road not many kid friendly restaurants close by a little distances away for child friendly, Near station but a little far from other attractions and not too close from other restaurants
71299,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, It s hard to find even if arriving from Gare Montparnase In fact thou are better off arriving via Line 6 Pasteur , The rooms are modern and clean The beds are very comfortable The breakfast is good 
71300,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Air conditioning was NOT Working breakfast was not having enough variety no pool no bath tub Not worth for money , Pretty much nothing My past experiences in Thailand with Novotel was fantastic but with this experience I don t think I would go for Novotel 
71301,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, The hotel is good but too overpriced For that price it could be closer to the subway it s about 10min walking to the nearest station not far but not so close for the price and could at least include breakfast I ve stayed in similar hotels for 1 3 of that price ,No Positive
71302,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Parking facilities very small Very complicated to park The money that you pay for the rooms and services is high, The location is close to the station and it is convenient 
71303,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, It was expensive but I knew it was going to be when I booked It is a great location and we only had one night in Paris so I wanted to make sure it was nice , What a beautiful room I think it was the nicest I ve ever stayed in We had a premium room so it even included snacks and drinks from the room fridge Nice surprise It was clean and my two teenagers were so happy to find that the pull out bed could split into two twins Close to the train station too We showed up very early and were pleasantly surprised they d watch our bags while we walked around We were so tired from traveling from London Then when we got there to check our bags they gave us the room It was so cool and quiet and clean It was perfect 
71304,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse,No Negative, Only compliant is Staff at Reception was very Rude during check out We really felt that staff was differentiating people by their skin color We were not staying there for free We had paid full amount of the hotel rent Thanks Hemal Shah
71305,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Provide the guest minimum one or two water bottles free a day as a courtesy , It is very well located and easy access to the main train station Also very clean rooms and friendly staff at your service 
71306,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Our room was hot and we could not get it to cool down, They were especially accommodating to the kids with a play area at the reception lobby and complimentary toys upon arrival 
71307,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, When ordering room service make sure they repeat to you your order You may not receive everything when it arrives to your room Downstairs bathroom by lobby was out of order our whole stay at the hotel , The free breakfast has a lot of options Comfortable rooms separate for the toilette not in the same bathroom as the shower 
71308,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Air con didn t work Asked for service to fix different issues nothing was done Done staff were rude No city view as per our booking House keeping was slack and not up to standard , Location
71309,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, It was a little further from the center of town than we had hoped but it was close to the Metro and an overall nice property , The hotel was nice and the breakfast was great 
71310,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, , Renovated room not big but big enough to accomodate 2 adults 2 small children Room was silent and the beds were very comfortable Very handy usb charging points directly from the wall Great breakfast Fairly priced rooms considering the overall price levels in Paris Walking distance from several iconic attractions 
71311,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, On May 11 8 30am I called to borrow a hairdryer since the one in the room was not working I also asked if I could borrow an iron The lady staff in the front desk told me that they were too busy to bring those items to our room so I must get them downstairs I did because as I said the hairdryer in the room was not working In the lobby beside the front desk the bespactled front desk lady staff gave me the huge ironing board the iron and the hair drier which I carried myself and brought to our room located at the end of the hallway How we treat our guests is a very important part of our overall experience Guests stay in a hotel with a mindset that their needs will be catered to and also expect that people tending to them will exude a certain level of joy in serving you We are paying for our stay and for their services and that was the first impression I got I have stayed in so many hotels around the world and it was my first time to be treated this way The sink in our bathroom was draining so slow almost clogged but I did not bother to raise my concern because of how cold the staff treated me on our first day of stay I will never recommend this hotel to anyone and I will never book with them ever It was the worst hotel experience I got , That we had a place to stay
71312,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Not good value for money The main hall area of the hotel seems to be used by external customers as well using the bar Seats of the sofa there are not clean stints everywhere Even though rooms are ok they are very small , Room service was great 
71313,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse,No Negative, The place is really nice and very clean Nice toiletries provided and the beds were actually not too bad Staff was very helpful especially with the kids Breakfast was superb We would stay again in a heartbeat 
71314,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse,No Negative, This was a very kid friendly hotel with a welcome gift for both kids on arrival as well as children s entertainment during breakfasts The room was fairly spacious and I really appreciated the shower and tub as well as separate toilet facilities I really felt we got value for money and the cherry on top was a late checkout at 5pm at no extra cost when our flight was departing at 10pm that night 
71315,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, I don t think its the hotel s responsibility but the overgrown tree beds outside the hotel entrance needed to be taken care of , Eggs were fluffy The breakfast buffet had an excellent range of choices We also had dinner in restaurant and were very pleased with our appetizers warm goat cheese and prosciutto and melon and our pork with mustard sauce main course 
71316,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, 1 We requested to have our two rooms on the same floor Since they were not we were reassigned only not giving us the same amenities 2 The room 312 was on the back side of the building and the sound from outdoors with windows closed was terrible We could hear a woman voice making announcements etc 3 We did not like that breakfasts were not included They did give us two breakfasts but we lost money on the reassignment , The room was clean except for the carpet under the bed We would have liked to have a few more TV channels in English 
71317,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, I did not like the location I booked it because it said it was really close to the Eiffel Tower like a 15 minute walk or something However it was not It was very far more like a 45min 1hr walk There wasn t that much around the hotel it was on a very quiet street just a few restaurants around the corner Everything else was really nice the hotel and the rooms were really modern looking and very clean very comfortable , I liked the breakfast it had a lot of variety Very plentiful with a lot of choices I also liked the hotel itself it was very modern and very clean 
71318,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, The room service guys some times skip to change the bed sheets of the sofa bed If you are travelling with family and plan to travel on metros then please consider the location is little far also there are less restaure ts nearby , I really enjoyed the buffet breakfast rich variety quality and quantity of food Further to it I liked the rooms the beds and the beverages in it which were complimentary Wifi was equally good with best speed 
71319,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Amenities like Tea Coffee were not provided in the room Everyday we have to ask the reception to arrange for it Rooms are small being considered family of four 2 Adults and 2 Kids Location is near to the train station Staff is good ,No Positive
71320,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, An itemised bill at time of checking out Told that this would be posted or emailed as yet not received , The wide choice at breakfast The comfortable rooms Separate toilet within the en suite rooms 
71321,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Plates and kitchenware were dirty for breakfast Room was too small for a family and a bit uncomfortable , Rich breakfast Great location Very responsive staff 
71322,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, My only complaint was that the bathtub wasn t totally clean had some stray hairs from a previous guest , We stayed with our four children in two adjoining rooms and it was very pleasant The rooms were just as pictured very neat and tidy They had the extra beds already made for us which was very nice They spoke English and had their own car garage just underneath the hotel Also we accidentally left our passports in our safe and the staff found them and took them to the front desk to hold for us so that was very appreciated 
71323,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Roms are a bit small for 4 good for 2 feasible for 3 really a bit small for 4 , Friendly staff Parking below the hotel for a decent rate Good breakfast 
71324,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, very expensive majority of staff didn t speak English which we suffered during our stay only one elevator was working so we took much time to go up down breakfast options is very limited and not suitable for Muslims restaurants is very small so sometimes we have to wait to get in room is very small and there is no wardrobe really was not convenient stay at all, location is good near from many historical places
71325,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, The staff at the reception specially this guy working there so rude and with bad manner never been treated so bad in hotel Like this hotel, Nice hotel the rooms clean and tidy
71326,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, We only recieve 1 small bottle of water per day for 4 person we have to request more bubblebath soap beacause we just recieve 1 stk per day and upon checked in we we have to deposit 200 euros but we checked out yesterday 10 01 2017 until now the 200 euros is still in my credit account hope i can have IT back have to pay city tax for 20 euros , The cleanliness and the bathtub location is little bit far but we manage to enjoy the view of Paris breakfast is great 
71327,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Restaurant and breakfast was a little pricey Location was relatively close to metro but not much in the area A little far from city attractions other than Eiffel Tower, Food at the restaurant was delicious fresh and high quality Bar was great for an evening night cap after the kids went to sleep Convenient to have a restaurant onsite The kids area will games kept our children occupied 
71328,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, dirty hallway on the room floors 6th floor light at the bed side did not work properly no english TV channel except CNN BBC coffee cup out of cartoon plastic pictures on the web gives you a wrong impression e g nespresso machine Said all this for EUR 190 i would expect better , The staff was very nice and helpful full stop 
71329,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse,No Negative, The hotel receptionist they are very bad even they are not ready to listen any complaints My room key is not working properly and I informed them to solve the problem but not on time I use to go my room to open 4 5 times from reception to my room trying to open the door and after long they Chang my room lately 
71330,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, No enough staff when I need a service they tell me to come by myself and collect whatever I oredered No staff to help you out with your luggage even , Location is great 
71331,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, The toilet overflowed which can happen to anyone but they did not deal with it in an effective manner I brought the problem to their attention at 11am as sewer was overflowing in the room and by 12midnight it was not addressed It was after midnight when we were given a new room The room was for three persons and the beds were only dressed for 2 They also provided no towels shocking experience When I spoke to the night manager he took no responsibility and blamed the day manager for not addressing the problem , Nothing this was a very poor experience
71332,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, On checkout we were charged an extra 83 Euro on top of the already paid contract price made through booking com having been told booking com didnt charge us correctly Very disappointing so not sure I will be using the website anymore to avoid nasty surprises like this , Comfortable hotel location fine
71333,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Further than we thought to walk anywhere need to get a metro to all places unless u want a long walk , Very clean and spacious rooms Metro station not too far and good local shop nearby 
71334,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, The room was too hot air con didn t seem to be working properly and with the city heat made it quite uncomfortable, The bed was really comfortable Location was fab for our requirements
71335,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Not much to complain about we shopped around to find a good deal this was a good price for central Paris so had low expectations The only thing which was a small negative was the cost of the car park was 22 per day but given location may be reasonable , Very child friendly balloon sculptor came round at breakfast and made an amazing flower by far the best balloon modeller I have seen Reception area is great nice area for kids and great champagne bar Car parking is hotel is great safe secure and decent size 
71336,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, If we had to give a minus point it would be for the prices of food and drink in the restaurant and bar When we arrived we just wanted a snack and was shocked when we looked at the prices We didn t want to look rude so we ordered 4x portions of fries at 20 This would have doubled if we would have ordered 4x cokes for drink I suppose they have to get their money back on the free room mini bars from somewhere To be fair this was the norm for all over Paris We thought prices were going to be on par with London and we were wrong It was very hot and we were shocked to have to pay 12 or more everytime we had a drink roughly every hour , After spending more than 1hr finding the hotel after leaving the Metro we was just happy to finally find it When we walked in the door first impressions were good We then went to reception to book our bags in and was told we could have our room more than 2 hrs early Reception staff spoke very good English and were very polite and could not do enough for us The rooms were very clean with free toiletries and a free mini bar re stocked every day The beds were very comfortable as was the whole room and hotel Breakfast was very nice and plentiful Both times we had breakfast there were free activities for the children Our two teenage children especially liked the body painting and didn t want to wash the artwork off their arms and legs This hotel made our stay in Paris and we would give it the best rating possible 
71337,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, I dont think anything could be better we where met by friendly staff check in was quick and efficent information pass on to us and questions answered , The room and staff excellent and very helpful This made our last day in France wonderfull we take home great memories no bad stories 
71338,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Pics had a nespresso machine none in room and the fridges in room were poor , Good location when you get used to metro Montparnasse is bustling and vibrant Plenty of caf s etc mcdonalds for young ones The hotel staff were great 
71339,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Staff is not very freindly Rooms are not cleaned well We have to ask for water everyday and sometimes they say it is finished Rooms are very small We booked 1 room connected and they said they don t have this type of rooms and this is booking com mistake and they can t resolve it It ended up family was separated and disappointed, Almost nothing
71340,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, There wasn t much around the hotel and the subway stations were all a good walk away , There wasn t much around the hotel and the subway stations were all a good walk away

71342,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, No latch on window so couldn t open it at night as we have small children, Beds were really comfortable bathroom was clean and modern Bar reasonable priced
71343,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, The hotel is old and room is too small and on top of this the AC is not working in all the hotel as when we ask for a fan they told no more as all the fans given to other rooms Brecfast is very poor and not enough for all guests The night duty manager is careless to all guests and keep on telling for any thing this is not my business you should see my colleague The refrigerator also in all rooms not working you have to go to the par to get cold drink even water In all on all very bad experience not advisable to any one , I did not like any thing
71344,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, There is only one thing that made us very upset Though we paid in cash the hotel kept 560 euros as a deposit from our prepaid card for 20 days The hotel should tell its customers that it will hold their money as a deposit not for 2 or 3 days as they said but for 20 to 25 days That is the truth , breakfast was very good also the bed was comfortable The personnel is very helpful 
71345,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse,No Negative, We had two rooms for our family The beds were comfortable and had plenty of pillows We have been traveling in a few different countries and this has been one of the best hotels thus far My kids enjoyed playing foosball babyfoot in the lobby to pass the time between activities They liked the breakfast offerings and I was happy they had a kettle on the room with tea and coffee 
71346,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, I wish I had not been robbed in the lobby by some unknown character All the euros I had wired from the US after the first robbery were stolen at the hotel lobby Western Union was closed during my stay due to the national holiday I filed a police report about the second robbery in Paris I had previously filed a report with the police in Aubagne France , The staff especially the manager Xavier the assistant manager Anais and Nicolas Dan took very good care of me in light of a very negative situation I was left with no money passport Global Entry Card or anything else of any value as a result of a robbery at the reception desk I had previously been robbed of my telephone credit cards bank card euros and dollars at the train station at Lyons France 
71347,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, 1 the 18 eur breakfast is not worthy 2 the thermostat in the shower is a stupid device even i am an engineer and familiar with these things i need time to find the suitable temperature for me compare to the waste of water when i adjust the so called energy saving with thermostat is nothing , 1 although i have problems for the payment online the hotel keep my reservation 2 staff are very friendly 3 facilities in the lobby are children s favorite 4 good location easy for transport 5 the sofa bed is really good for family

71349,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, A sink with the toilet , Rooms were very clean every day Location in city center facilitated getting around to major sites Nice to have a restaurant on site 
71350,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Only one bath wash tube was being provided every day while we were three of us The shower door would not close properly so after a shower the entire floor used to be wet and we had to mop the floor with the small towels , Breakfast was good Helpful staff Close to metro Clean hotel 
71351,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Confusion about my bookings Apparently one of my bookings was cancelled but reinstated at a higher rate Location is an awkward walk from the Montparnasse metro , Superb bed Sleeping arrangements for 2 2 very good 
71352,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, we would have prefered if the staff had directed us to the best train station Montparnasse was a very complicated underground for those who are new to Paris and especially with kids and luggage so the first day was very exsausting next day we found through othere guest who stayed there that Pasteur was the ideal station , The croissants were the best I ate in Paris
71353,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Small tasteless croissants Please bring back the larger ones , Friendly staff location great comfortable beds fridge great tv Plentiful breakfast

71355,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Arrived late and tired because of the train strike to find that our booking had been cancelled Staff did rally and reassured we could stay but the delay in the reassurance and the cold way we were treated was poor I was a bit tired and emotional but it was wrong to laugh at my reaction , Easy to book
71356,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, No complaints at all , This hotel is really well located for a tourist to view the sights of Paris The amazing eiffel tower view just metres from the hotel door is a bonus We found it much nicer and cheaper to eat in the nearby Montparnasse restaurants Definitely not the overpriced Paris that you are warned about Hotel was of usual Novotel excellent standard with the comfiest bed in the world Just what you want after a day trekking around the city with 2 small children 
71357,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Not even a small washbasin in toilet which is not too hygienic though the room had both shower and bath but with a separate entrance Almost nothing upset us , Good location especially for those traveling further by rail variety of tea coffee hot dishes fruits bakery pastry for breakfast and it is an early one which was another pro the staff was friendly and helpful

71360,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Nothing We loved it , So happy I picked this hotel Would have loved to stay longer but we were only in Paris for one night It was a short walk to Montparnasse so the kids got to see the fabulous night skyline with the Eiffel tower The beds were so comfortable we didn t want to get up the breakfast was 10 10 Great selection of tasty foods to choose from The staff were very helpful gave the kids a small gift on our arrival Will definitely choose this hotel again for our next trip to Paris Close to the Metro for visiting all the sites
71361,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, not quite as nice as some other Novotels Probably could do with a bit of refreshment, The options for breakfast buffet or at the bar Friendly staff useful to have a car park even if a little pricey
71362,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Parking is bad and to mutch money The children beds where not already instald The toilet was dirty in the room , The location is good in the middle of the center The breakfast as exellent bud 20 is a lot money 
71363,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, They didn t tell me about the shopping centre I knew it by chance The shuttle bus is not working with the same hours of Disney so if you wait until Disney closes you will have to go back by taxi The family room is basically a bed and a sofa bed Not a lot of food options in the evening, The breakfast was perfect but needed more cheese options since we are in France Located close to shopping area and Disney but half hour away by train from Paris
71364,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, The night front help desk was awful When I asked him to send somebody to pick up my luggage he told me to look for a cart and carry my bags on my own The guy was unpleasant unfriendly and disagreeable , Located just next to Gare Montparnasse train Station

71370,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, I paid more for a room with a Queen size bed and a panoramic view on the city However the room had a really twin bed even smaller than the regular size with a view on a secondary street facing a really ugly building Moreover the room was so small that the position of the bed prevented the door of the bathroom from being closed, Position easibly accessible by car and not distant from the metro station
71371,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Room too small for family of 3 One person needed to step aside to allow the other to pass by Self service cabinet needs more selection Arrived after midnight unable to get anything to eat or drink unless we wanted to pay nearly 5 for a can of cola ,No Positive

71376,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Some clerk knocked the door I asked who it is no one answered after two minutes he opened the door and as headed for the door he handed me an envelope from the reception, I felt home
71377,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Breakfast area is small comparing to the amount of people making the place very crouded The bed headboard in my room broke in the middle of the night creating relevant noise and waking me up Carpet smelled quite bad Mini bar fridge in the room turns off so it has NO use When mentioned all of the above to the receptionist she didnt care at all and she was quite rude and didn t try to assist except to repair the bed No apology was expressed at any time and checked out the next day Very disappointed , The location is good Staff in restaurant area is very nice

71380,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Nothing No value for money for tiny room with grumpy staff I should of rented Paris apartment for same as this hotel which I am doing now 2 bedroom 100sqm 2 bathrooms and toilet located in Ternes for same daily costs as Novetel Paris central Never again will I book Hotels on the basics of nice advertising photos and fictitious customer reviews if anyone says that the Novetel Paris is an excellent hotel then I know that that is pure fiction and possibly other hotels on your site are possibly just the same Get back to me if you need any further information Thanks Peter Woroniuk, What I did like was the morning breakfast Chef at the buffet at least he smiled and said Good Morning when he brought out the hot food even though he cooked the same every morning The buffet breakfast was like first in best served chaos at the best people scrambling pushing food exactly the same every morning pile of fatty bacon tasteless scrambled eggs and small sausages No change and if that is not enough at times the waitresses didn t even want to let you in only if you piled up what you wanted to eat at one time only and then sit down never ever again would I stay or even recommend this hotel I have had better at mining camps in the middle of the West Australian desert Thanks Peter Woroniuk
71381,Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse, Room service called up at late in the night and asked us to pay for the food room service even though it was agreed that it will be added to the final bill of hotel After some discussions they asked us to next day morning next day when I went to pay they told that it will be included in the final bill This is not a good experience from a leading start hotel,No Positive
