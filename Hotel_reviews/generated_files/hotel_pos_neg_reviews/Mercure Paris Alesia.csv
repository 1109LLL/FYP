78980,Mercure Paris Alesia, We had a problem with the hot water No hot water on our first day The problem was fixed and reoccured a second time on our third day Staff fixed the problem as soon as possible and offered free brakefast as compensation , Staff were friendly and helpful Everything was clean and nicely decorated Room size comfortable Easy access to metro 
78981,Mercure Paris Alesia, Room lighting was not adequate and the room looked a bit dark although it was on the eighth floor so there was plenty of light from the window , Very clean and spacious room minibar and coffee making facilities available Wifi connection was very good and there was a great variety of French and English speaking channels on TV Location was very good just 50m from Port d Orleans metro station line 4 which is about 15 minutes from Chatelet Les Halles and 25 minutes from Gare du Nord I stayed for 9 nights and the total cost was 795 euros including local taxes no breakfast prepayed no refund if cancelled which i consider an excellent value for money for staying at a 4 star hotel in central Paris during summer 
78982,Mercure Paris Alesia, Wi Fi connection was very bad I had a difficulty to receive an e mail The room was small but OK Break fast is very simple , It s very close to the metro and easy access to Paris center 
78983,Mercure Paris Alesia, Breakfast a bit overpriced hot items were cold , The location felt safe and close to Metro and restaurants The staff were friendly and helpful Very clean 
78984,Mercure Paris Alesia, The size of the room was not 18 m2 as stated For a couple the room size was not roomy enough and we found that it is not what we expected from a 4 star hotel in addition the bath soap etc were very basic , The location and personnel
78985,Mercure Paris Alesia,No Negative, The staff was wonderful They were so kind and helpful The room was comfortable The A C was great in the summer The location was convenient next to the metro however it is a 20 min ride to most of the common sightseeing places 
78986,Mercure Paris Alesia, Room was smaller than usual but still cozy When I arrived and checked in around 12 I didn t like how one of the staff barged in without knocking the door first to drop off the glasses n bottled water , Room was clean and modern Good lighting 
78987,Mercure Paris Alesia, Towels Just change them every day even if thay are not thown on the floor At least that was what I ve been accustomed to in Mercure Moscow , Location was very good 50 meters to closest metro station Nice breakfast sousages cheese and all that Just pick what you most like Very friendly staff that is always at your service Not my first time in Mercure network and I love that Familiar design of reception ans stairs and corridors and elevator makes a cozy feeling and almost home like experience 
78988,Mercure Paris Alesia, The room is small , Is located very close to the subway the neighborhood is very quit and safe The room was very clean and confy The staff very helpfull 
78989,Mercure Paris Alesia, Front desk person in late afternoon not friendly Put 2 charges on my card For same room Hopefully I will NOT BE DOUBLE BILLED , Room good Breakfast excellent 
78990,Mercure Paris Alesia, Weak Wifi Signal the bathroom floor easy to get wet after shower , good location next to Metro Bakery and supermarkets nearby Helpful staff Comfortable bed and pillows 
78991,Mercure Paris Alesia, Nothing really to dislike WiFi a bit slow but not a problem if you want to check your mail or to visit a site , Good location nice neighborhood with a lot of decent restaurants arround though far from the center I knew that before but metro at 30 sec walk Excellent breakfast Nice rooms a bit small but that is quite normal for Paris Bottom line excellent value for money 
78992,Mercure Paris Alesia, Nothing really I was happy about everything , The room was extremely good We were a couple together And we agreed that the room was big the bed lovely the bathroom large clean and tidy You get so much for the money here We were in room number 001 down the floor Of course the view was not that big But I did not care I asked for a room as close to the ground as possible And I got it Such a good service And the metro is almost next door Restaurants nearby and also if you want a drink in the evening I did not try the breakfast but it looked very good as far I could see 
78993,Mercure Paris Alesia, Bathroom was very small Although very clean, Really nice Hotel Room was a bit compact but very clean with nice and comfy bed Very close to Metro station Overall an excellent hotel to stay in 
78994,Mercure Paris Alesia, We followed the request in our bathroom to keep using towels for encouraging Mecure to grow trees However the cleaning staffs take away our towels everyday When we back to hotel to take our suitcases in the last day the staff in the reception desk can not speak English at all It s difficult to ask any questions to her We were surprised for that , The room is nice and comfortable Compare with eating outside the price and the quality of the breakfast is really good The staffs in breakfast speak English well and really friendly 
78995,Mercure Paris Alesia, Was missing some small stuff that I normally get in everywhere in Asia like tooth brush shower cap etc but it is probably just European standard nowadays , Nice new hotel friendly staff nice room 
78996,Mercure Paris Alesia, The room was of nightmarish smallness I have never seen a 4 hotel with a smaller room I guess it is the Parisian touch There was a chief receptionist a lady who treats the subordinates wearily in front of guests I found it a bit distasteful , It is a few steps away from Porte d Orleans station So the hotel is central but away from the commotion of the city crowd So the location is very good
78997,Mercure Paris Alesia, The night receptionist working on the 6th april was incredibly rude I booked the bedroom for my mother and that night after diner and dropping her off at the hotel i asked the receptionist to pay for the bedroom I asked him first to check whether the bedroom was payed or not He seemed genuinely bother as he was chatting with a friend of his He ignored a couple of other clients before me and when it was my turn he started to check on his computer for the information i have requested clearly angry I asked him for a note bill and he answered in a really unpolite and uneducated way He asked me if i wanted the note bill at my name or my mother s and when i answered he said too late already printing I can t believe this type of rudeness from a 4 stars hotel member staff , The hotel is placed within walking distance from different transports such as the metro the tramway the RER and many buses I liked the neighborhood as well as the view from the frontal window 
78998,Mercure Paris Alesia, The staff really let the place down I would say to the owners please train them The reception staff are aloof unfriendly and unwelcoming Terrible I never got a bonjour out of any of them The guy who met me was actually pretty rude Travelling alone I felt unsafe , Excellent functional very good value hotel Very clean 
78999,Mercure Paris Alesia, Not sure why it s 4 stars typical Parisian 3 star hotel small rooms etc , Convenient location if you have to stay in the South of Paris 14th very close to line 4 station Ok if priced at 100 euros per day not worth more than that 
79000,Mercure Paris Alesia, Poor sound proofing I could hear noise from the next floor up Staff were a bit slow at times but then again I would expect that in paris, the place was clean and well designed
79001,Mercure Paris Alesia,No Negative, The location of this hotel was amazing not even 2 minutes walk from the metro which was so easy too use The staff were lovely they were so welcoming throughout our entire stay nothing was too much effort for them The cleanliness of the hotel was lovely We were very pleased with our stay 10 10 
79002,Mercure Paris Alesia, staff especially the night receptionist did not speak English this is unacceptable for hotel staff in a 4 hotel in Paris, nice breakfast room size was ok for Paris 
79003,Mercure Paris Alesia, Breakfast was very disappointing especially compared to other Mercure hotels close to the exhibition center Eggs made of powder can fruits etc Reception staff could be a bit more helpful no hotel parking and the garage that hotel worked with was full and need to park expensive in public parking, Location was great with direct Trarm connection infront of the door to exhibition center comfortable bed and could even sleep with open window in Paris that was great 
79004,Mercure Paris Alesia, On the second day of our stay the power kept on going out and we were left in the dark on and off for a good few hours We contacted the reception and we were informed that the electrician was working on it but the fluctuating power supply was affecting our work and we feared for our laptops and phones which were being charged when the power failures happened Finally the power came on and we went into have a wash we had just come back from a very long day of sightseeing and badly needed a wash but couldn t because there was no power when we discovered that there was no hot water We were drenched in the rain and was chilled to the bone further delayed from a wash due to power failure so not being able to a nice long warm bath at the end of a tiring day pretty much ruined half of our trip there When the reception was contacted we were told that there was nothing they can do about it That is as helpful as they got Basic amenities violated is not very good in a hotel Small room Would have liked a more spacious one , Room was comfortable and clean but very small We had a tiny balcony from which the view was lovely Nice modern bathroom with bathtub
79005,Mercure Paris Alesia, There was nothing to complain about except I am used to very hot water and the water was a little too mild for my taste set to 38 degrees I m sure that would be fine for most people though I d still stay again as everything else was spectacular , The bed was very clean and comfortable and oh I needed that with my Australia to France jetlag The staff were so beautiful helpful and sweet Thankyou 
79006,Mercure Paris Alesia, Hot food not regularly replenished during breakfast therefore left with drying scrambled egg and no bacon Room next to lift and noisy Forgot to service room on final night though they did offer to move us Reception staff quite rude Business Centre was a large touchscreen computer in reception Bar area was essentially the hotel lobby ,No Positive
79007,Mercure Paris Alesia, I had no Wi Fi signal at my room I informed the problem at the reception desk and the person kindly proposed to me to change the room in the day next I did not change because it was a short stay , I have the impression that the rooms were recently renewed Comfortable bed Location Seconds away from metro and tram stations and hence very well connected to the airports 
79008,Mercure Paris Alesia, Shallow table in front of the TV little noisy room above the restaurant A C locked to central setup , The location close to our office and 50m from the metro is excellent Lot of restaurants easy to get to city center 
79009,Mercure Paris Alesia, Some of the individual staffs are not very friendly nor helpful even irritated when talking to us during check in But again at check out we had a very nice female staff who was very helpful and friendly , Newly renovated even though the room is a bit small but the overal design was very nice Room is very clean as well Good location close to the subway 
79010,Mercure Paris Alesia, The fire alarm going off at 00 15 hrs with an intended evacuation of the building which we believe was caused by a guest smoking and setting the alarm off , Rooms were compact but adequate and tastefully decorated as was the whole hotel 
79011,Mercure Paris Alesia, Just it took a little time to check in , One staff i forgot the name It starts with L tho His service is amazing and very accomodating Clean rooms and surroundings Nice location
79012,Mercure Paris Alesia, 1 The rooms were tiny It is almost impossible to live in it with an infant s crib installed the crib was not really a crib but a playpen Due to the crib being installed there was no room left to keep our suitcases the baby s push chair or even to walk around the room 2 The hot water kettle was filthy and looked like it had never been cleaned There was tea and coffee but no cups to drink them in 3 The bathroom was almost the same size as the bedroom which means a lot of space has been wasted Yet not a single shelf or storage space in the bathroom for any toiletries This is just a terribly designed property where the comfort of the guests have been totally ignored 4 The air conditioner was switched off daily by the reception and then only after a phone call did the front office staff switch it on This was a daily affair we never returned to have the ac working This is a terrible way to save energy wonder why they can t invest in a keycard system 5 The hotel lacks basic amenities like a dental kit laundry business center etc This should technically be a 2 3 star property 6 The check out took longer than usual and it was difficult for them to distinguish whether the credit card amount was blocked or charged so they did not know if it had to be reversed or just unblocked , 1 The staff was courteous and very helpful 2 The check in was smooth although they did not know that we had already requested for a crib to be installed a month ago 3 The property is very well connected to the public transit system 4 A lot of choices for dining around the hotel
79013,Mercure Paris Alesia, Air condition was not working properly needed to sleep with an open window the first night then to switch it off the other night as it worked too much without any control , A nice comfortable hotel newly and tastefully refurbished an interesting location Helpfull staff simple but good breakfast clean rooms
