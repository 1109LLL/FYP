43688,Mercure Paris Porte d Orleans, A bit on the expensive side not necessarily on the room prices per se but 19 euros for two 4cl gins and one 25cl Schweppes tonic in the hotel lobby bar is just a rip off , The hotel was clean and the check in and check out went smoothly without issues The staff spoke both French and English so language was no issue Breakfast was a mix of continental and English breakfast with a varying selection of cheese and fruits so everyone with a normal diet should find something for them Selection was also wide enough to cater the needs of a vegetarian The area was full of different style restaurants so one can easily go out for a different style for a week A large grocery shop was also located two blocks away 
43689,Mercure Paris Porte d Orleans, Check in and check out were very poor and took far too long We didn t have breakfast as it was so expensive but it was added to our bill anyway and we were told that the breakfast staff had ticked that we d had it which we hadn t Eventually they agreed to remove the charge Very poor system ,No Positive
