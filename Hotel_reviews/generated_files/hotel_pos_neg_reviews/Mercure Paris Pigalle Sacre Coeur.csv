103831,Mercure Paris Pigalle Sacre Coeur, The staff were unhelpful and when advice was received we were sent to a very dangerous area which made us felt endangered , The room and hotel was clean 
103832,Mercure Paris Pigalle Sacre Coeur, Never been in such a small room Unacceptable for a 4 hotel No more than 50cm around a queen size bed Felt completely cramed in the room it was difficult to even open our bags It was unbeliavebly small I regret not taking pictures to post here Breakfast was less than medium again unecceptable for a 4 Awful experience Avoid ,No Positive
103833,Mercure Paris Pigalle Sacre Coeur, Very rude receptionists Didnt honour our booking request Wierd awkward set up for breakfast not relaxing Rooms tiny , Location opposite Pigalle metro Rooms serviced every day Rain shower lovely 
103834,Mercure Paris Pigalle Sacre Coeur, Location of the property is very much in an area which may not be suitable with families Size of room is very small The room may not be even sufficient for 2 adults which is rare in Mercure range of hotels , The property is clean well maintained 
103835,Mercure Paris Pigalle Sacre Coeur, The staff was not very friendly on many instances 1 We asked over email if we could accommodate a 10 year old in a room total 3 people and they said no problem while we were checking in they said it will cost 40 euros extra per night After we argued this was not explained over email they waived the charge but it s not a good start They did put a hold on my credit card but hoping they won t actually charge it they promised not to charge it before my approval 2 The a c wasn t working and all of the details on the control were in french The guy who came to fix it didn t do it with a smile you have to fix it anyways pls do it with a smile 3 While checking out we wanted to store our luggage for 2 hours The guy did not help us with the luggage which is fine he made a grumpy face when I said I left something in the storage And when we wanted to collect our luggage they wouldn t let us collect it ourselves it took them way longer to find our luggage because we had to put it in the storage I think there are much better hotels in the neighborhood our friends stayed in hotels they cost 50 less and were decent Booking com gave us free and discounted tours in Paris which didn t make me feel bad for spending so much money on hotel rooms that were not worth it , The rooms were clean and tidy and was very close to the metro station pigalle 
103836,Mercure Paris Pigalle Sacre Coeur, No bar in the hotel or mini bar in the room Wasn t a big problem as the location is close to many pubs and restaurants , Great location quiet room Very close to the metro Area is geared towards adults but all in all it was a great location 
103837,Mercure Paris Pigalle Sacre Coeur, Location surroundings don t seem that safe after dark but it s easily accessible and close to the city centre coffee in the room was not very good although the tea was nice the room itself was quite small, Big comfy bed clean room bathroom cleaning services daily great shower optimal air conditioning easy to use safe in the room 20 min on foot from Gare du Nord
103838,Mercure Paris Pigalle Sacre Coeur, The location itself cannot be helped but having a smoking area would certainly make the stay more comfortable the only problem we had whilst being there was having to go out front in the morning for a cigerette to be harrassed by a still drunk stag nighter or homeless man It isn t much of a problem but is definately not pleasant when you havn t even put your lenses in yet Its location might disuade family holidayers but for young couples like us travelling friends business people or indeed people enjoyying Pigalle itself it is certainly worth it for the price we were given , It was very good Pigalle for those who do not know we didn t is a party area so it is a bit loud at night but the hotel rooms do a brilliant job of hiding this We had a minor problem on our first night with our original room but were quickly reaccomodated to another It is within walking distance of metro connections to get you around Paris it is also not far at all to walk down to the centre if you want to do a touristic route I would reccomend this walk it goes to the west side of Paris to Arc de Triomphe and then work East for everything else It was also just a couple metro jumps to get a train to Disney and the same for a train if you are travelling elsewhere in France aswell We did not try a breakfast at the hotel but it smelt loveley we personnaly got attached to a little bakery across the road Facilities were great shower was fantastic some rooms do have quite pokey bathrooms but it is not much of a problem The Aircon was a life saver in the summer and was easy to use They also have televisions no english but no problem Equally the staff were brilliant helpful and smiley and the hotel was spotless Would certainly reccommend this hotel for most staying in Paris 
103839,Mercure Paris Pigalle Sacre Coeur, Having to boil my eggs in the morning the machine was not at its highest tempreature which made the process a little longer I think it would be useful to have some instructions stuck on the wall on how to use coffee machine etc Also the liquid soap in the bathroom gave me an allergic reaction The bed sheets could do with some softner , location was excellent room was very clean Loved the decor of the whole hotel They have made the most of all the space and I absolutely loved my stay here Great hotel in a great place Breakfast was great too Staff were very helpful 
103840,Mercure Paris Pigalle Sacre Coeur, No good possibility to hang up towels so we needed to get new ones every day On the last day they were out of hand towels Check in is from 12 check out to 12 you do the math Had to wait for an hour to get our room , Friendly staff very good location Small room but that s quite usual in the area Excellent windows didn t hear a thing from the noisy street Good pillows duvet anti allergic 
103841,Mercure Paris Pigalle Sacre Coeur, The bed was very very hard The light in the bathroom was an odd color and made it difficult to put makeup on , The room was beautiful The windows were very sound proof It was so noisy with the windows open but once you shut it it was quiet Rooms are adequately spaced for a French hotel Two people could get around in it ok but sometimes it was cramped Very very short walk to moulin rouge Long walk to Eiffel Tower but doable Lots of great restaurants within walking distance Easily get taxis or metro 
103842,Mercure Paris Pigalle Sacre Coeur, After paying for the room in full in advance received email requesting credit card details after contacting to ask why was told it was because there were two rooms and one person paying had to scan credit card and passport and email images to hotel wasn t happy doing this for safety reasons was told had to or room could be cancelled don t understand why when it was paid in full already hotel nothing special very small room for myself and daughter No screen on shower so floor had puddles each time we used it had to mop up with towels Well decorated and comfortable Breakfast ok Wouldn t choose to stay again , Good location very helpful and informative reception staff 
103843,Mercure Paris Pigalle Sacre Coeur, very narrow corridors dwarf size rooms with dwarf size bathrooms no nice toiletries we had to wait one hour 13pm 14pm in the lobby until a room was ready Compared to the super Mercure Lyon Part Dieu this here was 2 3 star standard , very close to Metro station and Montmartre staff very friendly
103844,Mercure Paris Pigalle Sacre Coeur,No Negative, We booked a Privilege Room which was modern and of a good size for Paris Hotel is located in front of Pigalle Metro Station hence easy connection to Gare du Nord and other parts of Paris Sacre Coeur is only a 10 min walk away Plenty of nice restaurants and boulangeries also within a 10 min walk from the hotel Very friendly and helpful staff Free WiFi worked well Even though the hotel is located in the red light district of Paris we did not feel unsafe in any way whilst walking around the area at night 
103845,Mercure Paris Pigalle Sacre Coeur, Hotel surrounded by sex shops not recommended to families with young children , A large Privilege room in a brand new hotel Very quiet and well equipped Comfortable and large bed Nespresso machine in the bedroom 
103846,Mercure Paris Pigalle Sacre Coeur, After booking with booking com they sent an email with forms to fill for checking in the second room I booked 2 rooms I replied that the amount is paid and we will fill all required forms after we get there Especially the payment was done on my credit card and I was the first to arrive They still insisted on sending the form again and again that others will not be able to check in without this form I thought booking with booking com was easy and hassle free but the hotel doesn t make it easy While checking out half of us left early The other half were charged again for coffee which was already paid for When my friends tried to explain that we had paid for the coffee the staff s reply was You were not there so you don t know Very unfriendly and they should learn some basics of handling customers , The location and the rooms

103848,Mercure Paris Pigalle Sacre Coeur, Can t really fault this hotel at all however location would definitely not be suitable for a family as at the heart of the pigalle with very adult themed shops and saunas ideal Base for a couple or groups looking for a sightseeing few days, Staff were extremely friendly and helpful location was ideal for the metro and main attractions of Paris very comfy beds and fluffy towels daily

103851,Mercure Paris Pigalle Sacre Coeur,No Negative, The Mercure opened recently It actually coincided with the last terrorist attack in Paris so the receptionist was doubly glad to have American guests We chose the location due to its proximity to la Cigale theater and to the Metro station Pigalle which makes everything else easily accessible
