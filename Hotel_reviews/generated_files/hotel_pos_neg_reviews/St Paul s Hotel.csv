61075,St Paul s Hotel, Nothing, Wonderful hotel with some very nice touches I would definitely stay here again And only a short walking distance from Olympia and Hammersmith 
61076,St Paul s Hotel, Bathroom sink plug didn t close and wasn t repaired after reporting to the staff , Lovely building comfortable and modern room Easy access to transport from Hammersmith
61077,St Paul s Hotel, In the Masters House adjacent to the hotel the walls and ceiling are paper thin I could hear all conversations and other activities in 3 other rooms quite clearly I did not sleep well in this part of the hotel You need to do some work on sound proofing the rooms , I have always enjoyed staying here in the past in the main building Great location and really attentive staff 
61078,St Paul s Hotel, Very small rooms and absolutely no space to store your belongings So basically live out of your suitcase for a week , The building is beautiful and staff is friendly
61079,St Paul s Hotel, Breakfast started about a half hour late which was only an issue since I was trying to make a plane but it was otherwise delicious , The building was beautiful and historic Lovely rooms with great views out of the window We also enjoyed walking around the area and spent time over in Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park 
61080,St Paul s Hotel, Parking is an issue but we resolved it The Hotel offerred quite a few Options , A great little find as most Hotels in London are too big and mechanical This Hotel was comfortable had an intimate atmosphere and the staff couldn t have been more helpful Walking distance to Queens which is why I picked it 
61081,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, I requested a quiet room as I was exhausted from travel and it was truly a quiet room It was a loft room on the third floor which is only accessible via a flight of stairs from the second floor with no other rooms next to me and no traffic in the hallway in front of the room Restaurant was very nice as well and late night room service was available for light snacks and sandwiches perfect after my flight delays They also offer a nice high tea Staff was always helpful and courteous no matter the hour The hotel is about a 7 minute walk from the underground which took me to central London in about 20 minutes Neighborhood is quiet mostly residential with some shops nearby 
61082,St Paul s Hotel, Expensive breakfast turn right out of the hotel and 200 yards down the road you can get the works for five pounds , Everything was fresh and clean in the rooms and public areas Staff were very friendly 
61083,St Paul s Hotel, Our original room Room 10 right on the Hammersmith Road , The quirky building and the hotel s historical links Breakfast was varied and plentiful Staff were professional and pleasant Alternative room found for us when requested 
61084,St Paul s Hotel, Thought the garden park area could be tidied up , Decent sized bedroom with good facilities Must mention the most comfortable bed I ve ever slept in in a hotel Cleanliness tip top Small intimate hotel with the friendliest staff Much nicer than these characterless high rise hotels Would definitely book to stay there again 
61085,St Paul s Hotel, We got a little winded walking to and from the Tube station but it is a lovely residential area and we didn t feel unsafe at all The bus stop being so convenient was a plus we always rode it back at night , Perfect Stay I chose this hotel for its World War ll history and because it is so unusual and beautiful Our my adult daughter and I room was lovely a super comfortable bed free water in the mini fridge and delicious biscuits cookies in the room vintage fireplace beautiful garden view Breakfast was a ma zing It was delicious with wonderful selection As if the hotel were not perfect enough the staff is remarkable If we had a question about directions they would look them up and print them off If we got lost while out sightseeing we would just call and they would cheerfully get us back I had wanted to see the historical marker but could not find it The clerk not only located it for us while we out sightseeing but he emailed me to tell me exactly where it was and sent a photo Lastly despite there being a bit of a walk to the nearest Tube stations the city bus has a stop right in front of the hotel 
61086,St Paul s Hotel, The breakfast selection was very poor unfortunately There was no cooked breakfast at all just hard boiled eggs which were by the salad , The staff were wonderful and my room was extremely comfy and clean 
61087,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, A small room but beautifully done with everything I needed I couldn t possibly get any closer to Olympia unless I had camped on the pavement outside so from a location point of view it was absolutely perfect for me 
61088,St Paul s Hotel, It was a bonkers Holiday when I stayed and the partners were making noise in the park directly by my room , Pretty property many nice touches in the room bubbly H2O and biscuits Very nice sky lights 
61089,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Excellent hotel with a very interesting and famous history and a central London location within 10 mins walking distance to Victoria Station and Underground District Line etc making it a very good location Hotel facilities very impressive clean rooms well appointed facilities and staff are polite and responsive Continental Breakfast very good and wide choice of quality foods available Evening dinner in hotel s own Melody Restaurant was very good and reasonable Will definitely stay here again and no hesitation to recommend hotel for business holiday travellers 
61090,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, The room was amazing confortable beautiful fabrics and upholstery every thing in the room you could need The staff were so attentive I couldn t fault We had to wait 10 minutes longer for our lunch than they thought acceptable so they didn t charge us I really ca not find anything to complain about Just perfect 
61091,St Paul s Hotel, The ground floor rooms were a little more prone to noise , The beds are exceptionally comfy the rooms well equiped the bathrooms are beautiful and the showers are brilliant 
61092,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, If you work around Hammersmith the location is great The number 9 bus takes you through to a lot of London attractions and is only a short bus ride from the hotel It is one of the nicest places I have stayed in the city 
61093,St Paul s Hotel, Pretty much everything except the room This hotel has almost no public areas that are not demised as bar or restaurant so as a guest it is more like an AirBnb room than a four star hotel As previously noted the bar manager prides himself on getting the bar cleared early post 10pm to set up for breakfast and the non bar areas consisting of plastic covered chairs is more like an NHS waiting room than an hotel The manager reached out to us after my last review but we also saw some American clients informing him that they were canceling all their remaining nights so we are perhaps not alone in our frustration The hotel is next to a pretty public park yet late at night it is quite possible to walk into the hotel and to the rooms without any supervision or interest from the reception staff The lift is currently broken and the hotel s entrance is full of the required replacement machinery and vans In a taxi it is illegal to stop outside the hotel during the day The manager promised us he would turn things around though I am skeptical that this will be the case My advice avoid this place It s too far from any tube station and for this price there are much better hotel options in London , On the positive side in an earlier booking com review we were asked to pay to upgrade from a ground floor room overlooking a busy Hammersmith road to a room at the back of the hotel After posting the first review the manager kindly waived the upgrade fee The upgraded room 16 was very comfortable 
61094,St Paul s Hotel, Breakfast could have been better the website says good breakfast included but I didn t think it was anything special , The mint chocolate on the pillow when they clean your room 24hr reception 
61095,St Paul s Hotel, Breakfast started at 7am Not great for the business traveler if you have to be across town for 8am meetings I would suggest moving the start time to 6 30am , Great location easy walking distance to the train Rooms were nicely decorated and overlooked the park Very quiet 
61096,St Paul s Hotel, This is better described as a bunch of bedrooms with a reception than a real hotel The public areas consist of a corridor from the reception desk to the bedrooms There is a bar though the staff spend most evenings trying to turf the customers out so they can set it for breakfast complete with cornflake dispensers as early as 10pm When we visited it on our first night at 10 20PM we were advised to sit in the corridor as the bar would be closing soon this despite being full at the time The staff are consistently miserable and the reception staff pay little or no attention to guests You could walk in here from the street and get to the rooms pretty much without acknowledgement or challenge To hide the traffic noise the hotel blares out loud music in the entrance from the street which is very noisy and doesn t give a good impression , Beware Room 7 located at the front of the hotel next to a busy and noisy road When we asked to move we had to pay an upgrade fee to a room at the back of the hotel The upgraded room was comfortable and well appointed 
61097,St Paul s Hotel, Air con in the room was quite noisy, The room was lovely very nicely decorated great value for money great location friendly staff Will definitely try to stay here again 
61098,St Paul s Hotel, Felt a bit overpriced The lift was out of service at the time of my stay but they kindly helped me bring up my bags Admittedly this took a while though and I had to come back down to check that they were bringing them up , Overall a pleasant stay The exterior of the building and the ground are beautiful and the interior feels a bit historic but is well kempt I stayed in this area specifically because it would be easy get into central London and to get a train to Heathrow in the morning which it was but I would not pay so much next time to stay in Hammersmith 
61099,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, This was a birthday trip with show and overnight stay The staff kindly left a Birthday Card and chocolates in our room Very nice gesture along with the birthday wishes on our arrival at reception Wonderful room with a view over the park Small and friendly Hotel Staff were excellent Booked an evening meal and Breakfast and again superb Would highly recommend to anyone looking to visit London and just a short walk to Hammersmith Tube Station 
61100,St Paul s Hotel, Bathroom was a little small As a single traveler the room size was ok for me however 2 people in the standard double maybe tight especially with large luggage , Really impressed with my stay Interesting historic building Make sure to watch the short history on the in room TV system 
61101,St Paul s Hotel, No parking that s all, The bed was so comfy such a peaceful room loved the marble bathroom complimentary robes only a 5 minute walk from eventim Apollo so was perfect Would highly recommend
61102,St Paul s Hotel, The music which was intrusive in the public rooms and dining room Unpleasant and unnecessary , The bed was very comfortable and the shower was excellent in its detail 
61103,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Very convenient for local places Hammersmith Apollo walking distance Plenty of local restaurants Fantastic wet room that was fully disabled ready although we didn t actually need it Quality Hotel 
61104,St Paul s Hotel, The shower in the room was great but opening the door before the water in the shower drained would flood out into the bathroom even with having a towel down , The bed was comfortable the room size was perfect for 1 or 2 people I was shocked at how big the shower was which was a nice change to a lot of the smaller bathrooms I have dealt with in London hotels 
61105,St Paul s Hotel, Having to leave , The hotel was immaculate the staff very helpful and polite the room was amazing and the bed was very comfy the night porter was excellent too didn t get chance to use restaurant slept past breakfast but it looked very good and the menu had very fair prices all round fantastic hotel and would highly recommend and it s very close to the Piccadilly line about a 5 min walk Barons court so the London attractions are only a few stops away 
61106,St Paul s Hotel, I liked every aspect of my stay at this hotel, Excellent hotel environment comfortable and also very stylish High level of customer service Bianca at Reception was especially helpful she even rang me in my allocated room to check all was ok 
61107,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, great hotel top quality room under floor heating and air con hansgrohe rain shower and other fittings the same quality very friendly and helpful staff food was spot on with good wine choice nice chilled out smoking area with music and cover perfect location 5 min walk from olympia and kensington train station probably the best hotel in its price range i have stayed in in london thank you for a great nights stay 
61108,St Paul s Hotel, Very irritating 30 deposit required on credit card For what There is no minibar in the room so I don t quite see how even the criminal minded can rip the hotel off Hotel needs to rethink treating its guests like fraudsters , Great design and architecture 
61109,St Paul s Hotel, No parking or offset from the road so it s difficult to offload passengers especially with luggage , Very comfortable bed and good quality sheets and towels Nice combination of modern up to date room features in a historic building Very helpful staff Enjoyed an excellent dinner in the restaurant 
61110,St Paul s Hotel, Nil, Request for a quiet room was met staff were friendly and service was excellent Location very good with bus stop out the front and train stations a short walk Would definitely stay again 
61111,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, clean well furnished decorated and maintained hotel a little bit of affordable luxury while away from home food excellent and very well priced staff really friendly and helpful thank you 
61112,St Paul s Hotel, The lift did not work as they are changing it and we had asked for an upper floor so if you really need the lift ask if it has been fixed yet before booking Other than this we could not find fault , Superb stylish perfectly appointed boutique style hotel Nothing too much trouble Super clean room friendly staff that actually smile and seem to enjoy their job Lovely restaurant really tasty juicy fillet steak served in the evening Fantastic buffet continental breakfast included thank you Did not miss the full English option or variants of this Nice quiet room room 30 tucked away at the top of hotel Not huge but just right for the two of us and all amenities included Compact but perfectly appointed bathroom with shower toilet and wash hand basin with good sized soft towels and windows that actually open in addition to the air conditioning A novelty in this day and age and most welcome too The property is quite a way out of central London and we did rack up a few taxi fares to be fair but if you are not in a hurry then no worries We felt this was a small price for the peace and quiet of the hotel even considering it is on the main Hammersmith Road The road works around the junction of Brompton Road Harrods and Kensington high street were a pain so our hindsight advice would be get a taxi to this point then walk a bit and get in another taxi You will probably save quite a bit of money that way The road works had been there for some weeks and looked like a marathon job Certainly not the hotels fault just advice that s all Average Taxi to St Pancras from the property 25 00 30 00 through the road works and 30 40 mins in time This was in January 2017 We would stay there again 
61113,St Paul s Hotel, Music at breakfast too jazz blues for my taste something classical would have been more in keeping with the atmosphere, The staff were very attentive and friendly and the location on bus routes direct to central London was great bus 9 and bus 10 
61114,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, The building is gorgeous and the room is really nice exactly what I have been looking for a classy comfortable room The location is quite convenient as the buses and tubes are close The staff are also very friendly Highly recommended 
61115,St Paul s Hotel, Our room no 30 was below staff rooms so we heard heavy footsteps above late at night and early morning Would have liked Full English breakfast provided in price not as an expensive extra , Super clean white duvet and sheets Beautiful en suite bathroom room with great rain shower and low level lighting Sympathetically good conversion of an older property Extremely friendly and polite staff 
61116,St Paul s Hotel, Nothing, We had a comfortable stay Very comfortable beds clean rooms at a good price We did experience a dreadful main course in the restaurant on our first nights stay which we made them aware of They swiftly sorted it out 
61117,St Paul s Hotel, The bed was too soft for really relaxing The facilities for disabled people disturbed the atmosphere of the nice room and bath , We could get to our room well before the official time just when we arrived at noon The room was well aquipped with lots of pillows blankets chairs water kettle fridge and free mineral water The stuff was not only friendly but really tough and competent giving good advice in case of the tube strike and organising a taxi Even continental breakfast was very good The historic building was in good condition and well kept The bus station to get to the city was just in front of the hotel 
61118,St Paul s Hotel, room 6 noisy room from heating or air conditioning unit our side room all night and the cleaners chatting outside our door at 630am not much sleep, lovely building just had the wrong room
61119,St Paul s Hotel, Tut tut here we go again staff must b poorly treated cos most fed up especially in restruant no greeting no interest lamb chops raw no apology portion size miniscule Finally hotel too white bright and get real fireplaces working Ady on reception Marie in bar were lovely as we re cleaners Drink prices ridiculous ly high and no draft beer , Beautiful building can t believe in London as a hotel Room very top class 
61120,St Paul s Hotel, Wish we could have stayed longer , Everything One of the loveliest places I ve ever stayed Friendly helpful staff great food easy walk to Underground Beautiful architecture with interesting history 
61121,St Paul s Hotel, Unfortuanately we had some extraction directly outside our room which caried on all night We found it difficult to sleep with the constant hum Avoid room 5, Small and friendly 
61122,St Paul s Hotel, My room was number 23 the hotel was hosting Christmas party s on both Friday and Saturday night The rooms aren t properly insulted and we heard music all night long ,No Positive
61123,St Paul s Hotel, Nothing , Beautiful room perfect location Short walk from hammersmith underground and the eventim apollo Shower was amazing too Overall super happy 
61124,St Paul s Hotel, The lift was out of order on the night we stayed, We were going to Eventime Apollo and this was a great place to stay The hotel was delightful We had a lovely loft room which had character and which was spotlessly clean quiet and comfortable I would recommend this hotel 
61125,St Paul s Hotel, Very uncomfortable mattress I could feel each and every spring There was a stained towel in the stack of clean ones Breakfast starts too late and buffet is rather poor , Helpful staff Location
61126,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, We loved everything about this hotel When we arrived we were upgraded by a lovely lady that I had spoken to the night before We had a knock at the door just after arriving and was greeted by 2 members of staff with slippers and robes When night fell the Xmas lights came on right outside our bedroom window and made our stay feel magical The room was warm and cosy and everything about our stay was fantastic Great breakfast too When I got home the 1st thing I did was to look for booking next year at the same time Thank you St Paul s see you in 2017 x
61127,St Paul s Hotel, Overall very little Not sure that the thermostat was working properly in the room and it was tough to get the temperature right thermostat said the room was 15 degrees but it certainly wasn t that cold Air conditioning was a nice luxury but personally find these systems uncomfortable overnight Not sure if there was underfloor heating , Lovely historic hotel with plenty of character Well renovated and plenty of attention to detail overall a very lovely stay Loved the large TV in the room and the marble bathroom 
61128,St Paul s Hotel, Leaving , The hotel is situated in a little oasis of it s own surrounded on three sides by trees and parkland albeit not vast in size The fourth side is on a main route west but but does not impede the tranquility Gin menu extensive and dinner fabulous 
61129,St Paul s Hotel, I have food allergies so couldn t eat any of the fresh cakes pastries cereals or toast so asked for a bowl of porridge made with water On checking my bill when I got home I found I was charged 6 50 for it Not impressed , We stayed in a ground floor double which was quite spacious with the most amazing walk in rain shower A continental buffet was included in the room rate which was more than enough for my daughter 
61130,St Paul s Hotel, You would only stay here if you needed to be in this area Our stay was noisy due to maintenance work being carried out and resulted in a reduction in our bill , The hotel was very interesting and unique with a great history
61131,St Paul s Hotel, Lift was broken car park closed No discount offered Bar closed when i returned to hotel at 11 pm on monday evening I would have liked a night cap, Very friendly No problem when late check out requested
61132,St Paul s Hotel, I booked with breakfast but didn t realise that a full english cooked option would be extra It was fine but suggest that either the option to book without breakfast or full breakfast are the only options as it s always a negative feeling against when you feel slightly disappointed that it wasn t clear , Courteous service Restaurant and reception very positive You could feel they enjoyed working there Great rooms Lovely ambiance in restaurant
61133,St Paul s Hotel, I can t think of a thing , By far this was the best experience I have ever had with a hotel staff Thei care of me with just a one night stay was amazing from the lovely man at the door to the reception staff to the concierge to housekeeping everyone went out of their way to make our stay perfect I wish I could have stayed longer 
61134,St Paul s Hotel, Bed was too soft for me but my wife loved it , Everything couldn t fault it Staff friendly room clean and comfortable food in restaurant excellent great location for our business trip to Olympia 
61135,St Paul s Hotel, Our room was on the top floor but their lift wasn t working during our stay so we had to climb multiple stairs they did help us with our bags though , Great looking hotel Good location 
61136,St Paul s Hotel, I was in a ground floor room near the restaurant and opposite the stairs leading to the bar The smell of food and noise from these 2 locations affected my stay in addition the fan outside seemed to switch on every 30 minutes and was quite loud Finally there was excessive banging of doors from about 5am All of the above meant I had a less than restful night , The staff couldn t have been more helpful Very efficient when I asked for assistance Also the hotel is very clean and the food very good 
61137,St Paul s Hotel, The room was a little on the small size as there was not much room to walk around the bed as there was a table but liked the idea of a table as my husband sat around the table Wardrobe a little small and clothes were in the way when leaving the room Would recommend leaving more milk for residents , Good location very close to Kensington Olympia Room service was excellent and the food was very good We ate in the restaurant too and the food and service was excellent we loved it we would recommend it The bed was very comfortable Fixture and fittings were of a high standard 
61138,St Paul s Hotel, Squeaking and screeching floors as can be expected in a historical building when people walk fast in the corridor or above your room you hear an unpleasant noise , Excellent 4 star hotel all stars are fully deserved Close to Hammersmith and to most London attractions via tube or bus Impeccably clean very nice looking comfortable and large room with all the facilities of a very good 4 star hotel Very well organized bathroom with an excellent choice of toiletries Relaxed ambience in the common areas on ground floor Very courteous staff at the concierge 
61139,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, I made a last minute booking and found this hotel excellent value for money The room was quite small but very quiet and clean The bathroom also very clean and functional The hotel is not central but 6 7 mins walking from Hammersmith station 
61140,St Paul s Hotel, Room decor safe and bland for a boutique hotel Room on small side Staff were fine but could have been more engaging, Historical building of character Presentation of cooked english breakfast excellent Clean bedroom Nice clean bathroom
61141,St Paul s Hotel, Food was lovely but the bar menu was limited to sandwiches and burgers Would like to have seen a pasta or chicken dish other than the burger In saying that the 2 burgers I had were delicious There was a separate dinner menu which offered more choice but I did not try as it was slightly more expensive , This is a wonderful hotel Friendly staff throughout who are willing to help in every way possible The beds were super comfy with a change of linen every day 2 chocolates left on pillows music softly playing every day on return Room had aircon as well as windows which opened a reasonable distance 
61142,St Paul s Hotel, The breakfast choices can be improved , The hotel is a historical budiling with good surroundings The facilities are nice and the staff are helpful It is about 10 mins walk from Hammersmith station which is directly accessible to Heathrow airport 
61143,St Paul s Hotel, My room did not have a bathtub , My room had a beautiful view of the garden the food was excellent the staff helpful and the bed comfy It is walking distance to my office in Hammersmith and I would definitely stay here again 
61144,St Paul s Hotel, Pricey Not really sure as London Hotels are all pricey anyway, Location for Olympia is great and so much better than the big chain hotels by Olympia Enjoyed the lovely setting and unique building with its nice little park 
61145,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, We just loved it friendly staff and the perfect location for us Brilliant restaurant and fantastic food beautiful interior I cannot find anything to moan about we will be back 
61146,St Paul s Hotel, My room was very small It was a double room and had I not been traveling solo it would been cramped From this standpoint I did not think it was good value for money Just setting expectations for future guests but otherwise the hotel is nice , The hotel had great ambiance and the location was ideal for my visit
61147,St Paul s Hotel, we were on a ground floor overlooking a small courtyard parking spot with a direct view of delivery vans staff etc dodgy hot water taps in sink and shower difficult to get cold water sudden scalding jets impossible to switch off underfloor heating in bathroom as moniter was broken notified twice to reception , Beautiful building Very pleasant and helpful staff Comfy bed Good restaurant bar
61148,St Paul s Hotel, The staff was nice but it didn t feel like a personable experience They would at times talk to each other in their own language making us feel left out , The beauty of the exterior and interior of the hotel Fantastic WiFi Big rooms and bathrooms Very clean and modern 
61149,St Paul s Hotel, There is absolutely nothing to dislike , The Executive Double Room spacious extremely comfortable bed slept really well The Bathroom very spacious And I love the Buffet Breakfast The staff were as welcoming always smiling just like my 1st stay And having the small beautiful Park at the back of the Hotel is such a treat when in busy London Really wouldn t stay anywhere else 
61150,St Paul s Hotel, Walls a little thin so you hear everything in next room and in the corridor but it is a small hotel so not much traffic Wish it had a frequent visitor program , The rooms are well appointed not especially large but very comfortable The bathrooms are good sized with both shower and tub Rooms at the back of the hotel overlook the garden so are very quiet Very good continental breakfast Staff was pleasant Hammersmith is not too near tourist areas but bus and tube lines are very close For convenience to my office it is great 
61151,St Paul s Hotel, Nothing, Exceptionally clean extremely helpful cheerful staff fantastic for stays at exhibitions at Olympia quite a quiet place at night Not one complaint
61152,St Paul s Hotel, Your opinion of the location will depend on whether quiet and out of the way is what you re looking for Having stayed in Kensington we found the location a bit dull Area restaurants and pubs were largely uninteresting and the walk from Hammersmith station goes mostly by corporate offices , Charming immaculate property that fulfills every expectation of what a European boutique hotel should be Spacious and well appointed room with beautiful touches like underfloor heating in the bathroom and a bow window overlooking a quiet park Very comfortable beds with crisp sheets big windows and good climate control made for an excellent night s sleep 
61153,St Paul s Hotel, The lift is veru slow use the stairs , I thought the architecure was stunning and the setting was handy for the tube and shops The room was on the top floor and very comfortable 
61154,St Paul s Hotel, Nothing really would have preferred a more varied selection of music piped to the outside areas and like all hotels more hangers in wardrobe I m sure if I had asked they would have been provided , Impeccably clean beautiful building and surrounding grounds breakfast fresh and plentiful underfloor heating in bathroom a lovely comfort free wi fi worked well in room and rest of hotel Perfect location for London Olympia within walking distance
61155,St Paul s Hotel, One small criticism of what was provided in terms of accommodation and facilities was that the individual portions of milk in the fridge had gone off This seemed a little sloppy for this level of accommodation The mail criticism we had would be over value we got a good deal on the room rate online and because of the night of the week we were staying although breakfast wasn t included and it was also an extra 20pp a day to use the facilities at a nearby gym We would have been mortified to have paid what is the apparent full price of the room Having said that we live not far from London so don t typically stay overnight in hotels here so we have little to compare it with other than accommodation in other European capital cities We ate in the restaurant too and though the food was lovely again it was expensive and our meal was accompanied by the worst music playlist we ve had the misfortune of listening to over dinner for some time think low rent Alexander O Neill and lift music versions of Mrs Robinson , The room was pleasant if small Good quality of d cor and a lovely bathroom The bed including pillows was very comfortable and the blackout curtains were very efficient I d recommend taking the staff up on their offer of a wake up call if you need to be somewhere by a certain time We went on a short break leaving our son with his Nana to celebrate our anniversary and requested a room with a view of the park to make our special couple time even more special if possible In addition to making that happen the staff had left an anniversary card and some strawberries and chocolates in the room We were very touched it was a lovely gesture 
61156,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Room 27 was lovely with a huge bath and fab shower A lovely comfortable bed and lovely dormer window views of the park I forgot to pack toothpaste so it was great to find that there was a complimentary set in the bathroom 
61157,St Paul s Hotel, the staff service could have been better some struggled to understand us maybe their English could have been better In one instance we ordered a bottle of wine then changed our minds to something else the waiter went off without saying anything and came back with both bottles and that took 10 minutes and there was only 2 other people in the bar and this wasn t the only time our service was slow not understood Also you shouldn t state breakfast included when that s only cereal cold meats and yoghurts anything that needed to be cooked even toast is a charge to me this is bad as it is not clearly advertised, The rooms were lovely and very clean 
61158,St Paul s Hotel, The park close to the hotel is a bit neglected it doesn t do the hotel itself justice All staff are not professional I felt though nice on the whole , Nice historical building comfortable beds A good choice of food for the continental breakfast 
61159,St Paul s Hotel, nothing, Our room was upgraded to a loft suite which was amazing as I requested a room on higher floors The room was incredible so impressed Will definitely be back 
61160,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, A beautiful hotel nestled in busy London Loved the historic context of this hotel and the quality of the rooms and facilities were lovely Excellent news staff and quality can be seen throughout 
61161,St Paul s Hotel, My only complaint was my room was quite noisy from either close by boiler or air conditioning unit , The location was perfect for the Olympia exhibition hall and good local access to tube and local shops 
61162,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Reception staff gave me a free upgrade on arrival to a room with a bath which I was keen on I was delighted lovely quiet attic room and staff so helpful 
61163,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Free upgraded room on arrival lovely touch Welcoming and friendly Location was superb 4 mins from Hammersmith tube station and 5 mins from the Olympia Drinks reasonably priced Room was stunning spotless Couldn t have asked for more Thank you 
61164,St Paul s Hotel, The location was difficult for us with limited amount of time there only one night and traffic was intense so we really had only a few hours in the evening , Most of the staff were helpful Historical building The hotel is clean and a really neat place if only more of the staff would speak English more fluently We had a full breakfast with our stay but because there was nothing really prepared except for the continental breakfast we were unable to have a full breakfast 
61165,St Paul s Hotel, Could hear banging doors a little too much , The building looks ever so nice and carries on when you go inside It s a nice place to stay and has a bit of history to it The same architect designed the natural history museum The room was really nice and was well worth what we paid We will be staying again when we have the opportunity 
61166,St Paul s Hotel, Nothing really ticks all the boxes, Excellent hotel only open a couple of years Modern with very helpful staff Would definitely recommend and would stay again Very good continental breakfast Generally good value for money except charging 12 50 extra for a full English is a bit overpriced and needs reviewing 
61167,St Paul s Hotel, The breakfast was horrible to much oil in everything they keep lock my card for the first nignt and I still haven t get back my money Don t normal when I have already pay with another card this is 3 days ago , Nice Hotel lots of history nice staff 
61168,St Paul s Hotel, That I didn t have chance to enjoy the breakfast as it looked and smelt good as I rushed through reception each morning , I loved the squishy pillows the heated tiled floor in the en suite the way the dim lights came on as you entered the bathroom at night the crunchy biscuits the little tray of tea coffee the walk in shower wet room with a GINORMOUS shower head like a sunflower I was very unwell whilst exhibiting at The London Bridal Show in Olympia and the hotel was my comfort when I got back each night I TRULY MADLY DEEPLY WANTED TO LIVE IN MY ROOM FOR EVER
61169,St Paul s Hotel, Wi fi connection inside the room worked partially, The continental breakfast and the facilities were great The rooms are modern with all what needed and even more 
61170,St Paul s Hotel, Breakfast charge was 17 for continental breakfast but they add a further 10 to have full English 27 for a breakfast is a rip off I had the executive suit which was nice but nothing amazing to be honest , Lovely building good location for the london olympia rooms nice and comfy 
61171,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, It was a beautiful building and well designed and furnished It was very clean and the location was ideal for us The staff were helpful and friendly I would definitely recommend this hotel I will be booking for next year 
61172,St Paul s Hotel, We were given room number 10 which was extremely small and dark and should not be considered a double room in our opinion Unfortunately it s also right next to the busy main road so even with secondary glazing the traffic noise is always a problem as it seems to come through the walls It was also right next to the goods entrance which was audible when deliveries arrived Two chairs and a table were crammed into the space between the bed and the wall making it difficult to access the bed There were also issues with the bathroom It smelled really badly of damp which permeated the whole room and the bathroom floor flooded when we used the shower After we informed reception of these problems it was repaired which is when we noticed the smell of sewage The bathroom was also constantly freezing as the under floor heating didn t seem to work The hot and cold were the wrong way round on the bathroom tap surprising when forgotten in the middle of the night After two nights we couldn t bear the smell anymore and asked to move room We got room 4 which was much bigger lighter and really quite lovely Unfortunately as soon as we returned from town for a nap at around 4pm the maintenance crew started drilling right beside our room After 15 minutes we called reception to ask how long it would take were told 5 minutes and after a further 30 minutes of drilling we called again to complain The drilling stopped only to be replaced by hammering We understand that maintenance work needs done but in our opinion loud work should come with a warning to the guests or done in the middle of the day when most people have checked out or are out in town As a pregnant woman and someone who is paying to stay there if I need a nap then I need a nap and I should be able to take one This should not be a problem Unfortunately this was not possible so I was exhausted that night and couldn t enjoy the show at the Apollo as much as I had hoped , The location for the Hammersmith Apollo is great and with both Hammersmith and Baron s Court tube stations are within walking distance so it s easy to get into more central areas like Soho The building itself is very nice with a park to the back which some of the rooms and the restaurant where breakfast is served look onto Continental breakfast included with room is fine anything hot must be paid for 
61173,St Paul s Hotel, Room was not particularly warm and I could not see easily how to turn up the heating, The building and learning about it s history from the video recording 
61174,St Paul s Hotel, Nothing, I loved that there is a bus stop right infront of the hotel The ambiance of St Paul s is one of a kind Every evening it was such a pleasure to come home I arrived from the airport at 08 00 in the morning and they booked me in straight away I realize that this is not always possible but it was a wonderful surprise 
61175,St Paul s Hotel, Breakfast was OK rather than great Bathroom was a little scruffy in places bare plaster repairs cracked grout No milk for tea in rooms only coffee creamer 228 for a double room was really a top end price, Nice building and rooms Staff were efficient and friendly Coffee tea making facilities Beds bedding and towels all good quality
61176,St Paul s Hotel, That breakfast was so expensive to include we went out in the end , Bed was very comfy room was quiet and modern Good view Good air conditioning Lovely bathroom 
61177,St Paul s Hotel, I visited for a special occasion with my elderly mum it was her 75th birthday so picked this hotel specifically for the high standard and facilities Unfortunately when we went to have tea on arrival we were told that the lounge and dining room were closed for a private function I was gutted as we had wanted to spend a leisurely afternoon and have early dinner before heading out to theatre I was shown into a basement conference room which was being used for dining but it looked like being at work so didn t stay We had a quick bite in the room lovely and then went to hunt for an alternative to eat Not ideal as her mobility is a bit limited and we had thought we were sorted Might have opted for a less expensive place with facilities if I had known prior to arrival , Bedrooms bathrooms and staff were great Decor and comfort were superb and felt very comfortable Good choice if you are after a bit of history and luxury 
61178,St Paul s Hotel, Evening staff a bit preoccupied Lift frighteningly slow with the door not quite fitting Refused to use it again despite having to lug heavy luggage from 2nd floor , The location is great The actual building was a school for 153 boys hence the number 153 Hammersmith Rd Now it s like a film set In fact it was a film set It has masses of character and the staff are proud to let you know it The architecture and art is fun and the atmosphere is Victorian boarding school Given the right clientele could be quite hip Room nice if a bit tight for two 
61179,St Paul s Hotel, Pillows were too hard , Staff were excellent very attentive without being intrusive The building and the fittings were fabulous and make it a real experience to stay there 
61180,St Paul s Hotel, Breakfast wasn t included and there was no parking available, Lovely room comfy bed and amazing bathroom with under floor heating and a shower I never wanted to get out of 
61181,St Paul s Hotel, The trolley supplies cupboard was next to our rooms and staff going in and out of it early in the morning woke us up , Great staff great location very pretty hotel 
61182,St Paul s Hotel, The service in the breakfast area needs to improve We were told that breakfast was at 7 am Saturday morning init was actually 8 am We were not told where the breakfast was service was slow We were given a disabled room with no bath , Bed rooms clean and comfortable
61183,St Paul s Hotel, Breakfast wasn t included in the room rate , Excellent very comfortable room in an historic building helpful and friendly staff Very convenient for the Eventim Apollo 
61184,St Paul s Hotel, Breakfast service was a bit slow We did get there at the start of Service on a Sunday No excuses as would have expected more, Nice comfortable surroundings and good base for the Apollo
61185,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Warm welcome Tastefully decorated throughout Friendly professional and helpful staff Very comfortable room Good wine reasonably priced for a hotel 5 minute walk from Hammersmith Broadway Classic room very compact but perfect for an overnight stay 
61186,St Paul s Hotel, Only very slight niggle got Back very late early hours one night starving hungry to be told no 24hr room service available, Superb weekend Great hotel Great staff Great location
61187,St Paul s Hotel, Daughter got bitten by bed bugs Concierge didn t help with luggage , Food in restaurant was good Atmosphere was good Our wait staff were very friendly and nice 
61188,St Paul s Hotel, Bed was only a double and a little uncomfortable Due to location you also heard a lot of traffic noise from main road , The location and facilities were excellent friendly and helpful staff 
61189,St Paul s Hotel, Air Conditioning was proberbly OK but more details would have been usefull True Reception were capable of remote adjustment but any result can take time , Most things 
61190,St Paul s Hotel, From our room the traffic noise was quite bad I know its London but that did disrupt my night Not sure it was worth the cost nothing to complain about but I have stayed in equivalent places for less , Fabulous old building great location for Olympia Beautifully decorated friendly staff Breakfast nice 
61191,St Paul s Hotel, 1 Small point our room was overlooked by an office block , 1 Staff friendliness 2 Relaxed atmosphere 3 Excellent cuisine 4 Ambience and standard of decor 
61192,St Paul s Hotel, Low background noise in the room throughout the night Didn t stop us sleeping but could be irritating for some Milk in the room was off , Location and comfort Complimentary waters in the fridge Elegant room 
61193,St Paul s Hotel, I have nothing for this section everything was fantastic , Beautiful building Beautiful room and amazing bed Staff were great and breakfast was delicious Highly recommend 
61194,St Paul s Hotel, The staff were not overly attentive especially when we wanted a snack late evening Some staff were also socialising at the end of their shift in the bar as we were trying to get some service ,No Positive
61195,St Paul s Hotel, While there is an advisory on slow lifts they should do something drastically about it as it might be of great inconvenience to senior citizen travellers You keep pressing the lift button and at times you keep waiting but the lift door doesnt open at all, Everything about this place is convenient ideal location great comfort and good ambience has a nice heritage feel in a castle like set up so feels grand staff was warm and cordial and rooms were clean and comfortable
61196,St Paul s Hotel, All was good, A very beautiful hotel that s run like clockwork Incredibly clean and comfortable Food for lunch was Superb So central to our needs Would love to stay again Thank you to all the wonderful staff 
61197,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Lovely hotel traditional Very nice location in the small park Special thanks to Antonio at the reception His attitude to the hotel guest is one of thw best we ever met Every hotel management must be proud of such receptionist 
61198,St Paul s Hotel, Room had too many chairs so felt a bit crowded , Comfy bed great welcome early check in peaceful room but near River and shops and good access to centre Great shower too 
61199,St Paul s Hotel, I felt I had to score it a little lower in value for the money because let s face it hotels in Great Britain are more expensive typically Breakfast is not included If breakfast was included even a simple breakfast not just the extravagant options offered this hotel would be ranked even higher I realize most hotels in Great Britain do not offer this as an option , This hotel is a luxury boutique hotel It has unique historical character and is full of English charm St Paul s is beautifully decorated I obsessed over the chandeliers Other important amenities great adjustable thermometer in the room lots of hot water and a great restaurant downstairs for English breakfast or Afternoon Tea The staff was so helpful and sweet Close to two metro stops and a bus stop restaurants shopping nearby It is in zone 2 which makes the hotel tax and the cost of transportation a bit lower perhaps 
61200,St Paul s Hotel, There was a trouble about Wi Fi We sometimes couldn t it during we stayed there , Everything was wonderful Staffs were always friendly Hotels location is good Room was very clean and its size was enough not little The hotel is my favorite hotel after this 
61201,St Paul s Hotel, Our first room was too dark and had a small window without much natural light but the staff changed us to a really lovely room with lots more light , Hotel was really lovely and extremely clean Bus stop was right outside and the train station was about a 5 minute walk There was secure wi fi available 
61202,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, everything was outstanding service facilities room and general atmosphere close to tube and hamersmith high street with plenty of pubs and restaurants central london within half an hour away either by bus stop right outside hotel or even quicker on tube no complaints whatsoever
61203,St Paul s Hotel, bar prices a little high but was London That I couldn t stay longer Rates are very variable usually above my budget , loved the whole experience clean tidy spacious beautifully appointed room Friendly helpful staff
61204,St Paul s Hotel, We didn t like having to leave this lovely hotel and return home , We absolutely loved this hotel From the outside the building is beautiful and on the inside it doesn t disappoint The decor is classy elegant and understated The atmosphere is warm and the staff were all outstanding The rooms are exquisite with really comfy beds and all mod cons integrated into the tasteful furnishings The restaurant served great food and the breakfast menu was extensive and original Can t wait to return 
61205,St Paul s Hotel, Some of the rooms at the front of the hotel get traffic noise so request a room at the back of the hotel if you are a light sleeper , Very helpful and pleasant staff The breakfast was tasty nice quality food and good coffee Location is great too easy to get to Knightsbridge Kensington Oxford Street and also a short tube ride from Heathrow 
61206,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, This is a lovely hotel with very comfortable rooms with very high quality finish and amazing attention to detail Breakfast in the pretty restaurant is good the staff could not be more helpful and friendly and the building is beautiful Transport links are fantastic and central London can be reached in minutes There can not be a better value hotel in London and I cannot recommend it highly enough 
61207,St Paul s Hotel, Ordered taxi from reception firm used by hotel Overpriced even after reducing the extortionate fair trip not metered and two rear seat belts inoperable Not hotels fault but taxi firm didn t do hotel justice , friendly relaxing atmosphere
61208,St Paul s Hotel, Large housekeeping trolleys and bags of linen left in corridors when checking in at 3pm No flannel left in bathroom , Beautiful building very carefully decorated with taste and sensitivity 
61209,St Paul s Hotel, Noisy bathroom when another client was showering I could hear the sewage pipes making noise I believe they were blocked and this must be why As I have stayed twice in the hotel before I can tell this was only in this room and not the other ones although this past summer the A C in my room was broken during the heat wave , Cosy Style Friendly Staff
61210,St Paul s Hotel, Price for the breakfast is a bit high considering there are very good alternatives not too far , Location and atmosphere of the hotel are perfect You do not believe you are in the middle of London when you go through the door Service is very good and they are always willing to help you 
61211,St Paul s Hotel, Quite expensive for the size of room , Nice size not big but enough of a buzz Very friendly attentive staff Bathroom was spotless and so was the rest of the room 
61212,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Superb room and the hotel has character which is beautifully presented Friendly staff who always greet you with a smile and nothing is too much trouble 
61213,St Paul s Hotel, Shame the English Breakfast did not include cereal , Location was ideal with Hammersmith Olympia and Baron s Court stations within a few minutes walk The building and interior were very impressive and to a high quality Room was surprisingly well lit with a beautiful fully tiled bathroom with underfloor heating Staff couldn t be more helpful and the overall quality was close to that of a 5 hotel This is the best hotel I have stayed in for under 300 a night anywhere in the UK 
61214,St Paul s Hotel, On arrival it took a while in reception to check in after asking twice the room wasn t ready they wanted to upgrade us and give us a special room but I had to ask twice if we could just check in as we had appointments scheduled bit of a hassle The receptionist thought we had all the time in the world but unfortunately we didnt Within the room there were too many gadgets the phone had a constant glow on it which flashed all night the fan in the bathroom was humming all night so you could hear it whilst you were trying to sleep Not so relaxing Apart from this our stay was good , Staff were friendly bar nice setting breakfast good value and plenty of choice room was tidy and had a parking space Surroundings were pretty 
61215,St Paul s Hotel, The room was overloaded with furniture which left too little space for luggage Elevator very ancient and slow , Staff especially receptionist were very kind and helpful We liked very much the decorations and the atmosphere in general Breakfast was delicious Very close to public transportation Many restaurants and coffee shops in the neighbourhood 
61216,St Paul s Hotel, Coffee making facilities in the room were very basic Instant coffee is so last century Just invest in some nespresso machines please, The boutique charm of the hotel and history of the place Montgomery went to school here and D day was planned here friendliness of the staff size and stylish decoration of the room the park view from the massive windows
61217,St Paul s Hotel, The building being so old means the stairs and corridors are wooden and in morning when staff come on shift they squeak badly but then it s a good alarm call , The building was amazing and such a joy to see a old building in such good condition Great restaurant and food amazing Very good location for trains and bus routes Very helpful very polite staff 
61218,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is outstanding in every way From the staff to the outstanding cleanliness of the hotel and the guest rooms The management has thought of every little detail thats makes your stay perfect in every way 
61219,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Characterful hotel Lovely quiet room overlooking gardens hard to believe you are in London D cor tasteful everything worked and the Continental breakfast was excellent served in dining room with pleasant garden outlook Choice of 3 different tube lines only 10 mins walk away 
61220,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, A wonderful boutique hotel in a conserved historical building The staff were gracious polite and very helpful The room was large and beautifully appointed and there was a very large bathtub in addition to a walkin shower A mini fridge was always supplied with free water and the coffee corner always had cookies as well The hotel is outside of central London but extremely well connected by tube and bus services It s only 30 minutes by tube to Heathrow airport The breakfast was a very adequate continenntal one A bit pricey but well worth it if you don t absolutely have to be in central London 
61221,St Paul s Hotel, Can t say we didn t like anything really , Great property with great staff and atmosphere On the bus line for easy access to the heart of London Very cool history The place is even better than the pictures 
61222,St Paul s Hotel, Breakfast in the gorgeous sun filled garden room involved a very long wait was luke warm when it arrived and the staff miraculously disappeared so there was no one to complain to Coffee not good either Also disappointed to find the bar closed when we got in around 11 30pm on the Saturday evening , Reception staff in particular were very professional welcoming and knowledgeable Hotel has been newly refurbished around a year ago to a high design standard with quality fittings the most comfortable bed and best shower we ve experienced anywhere 
61223,St Paul s Hotel, Hotel was not as quiet as I expected I had one completely sleepless night because of kids running for most of the night in the room above mine Was moved to another less noisy room next day still lots of trafic and other noise Rooms and beds are extremely small Dirty worn carpets Hotel is supposed to be brand new but feels like it already needs renovations The London Novotel West which is closeby offers better value for money , Staff is trying to help and meet your requests but they are young and unexperienced 
61224,St Paul s Hotel, Slightly disappointed there was no lift , We liked the location and the general style and appearance of St Paul s The historical aspect was extremely interesting 
61225,St Paul s Hotel, This is a small complaint but I so look forward to a good cup of tea when I travel in the UK and the tea at breakfast was a weak and lukewarm disappointment , I spent one night here on a long layover between Turkey and my home in the States This was the perfect place as I could take the tube followed by a short cab ride It is walking distance from the Underground but with luggage its a hassle The room was cozy and well appointed the bathroom sumptuous WiFi free I had a good Scotch whiskey in the bar what else and dinner in the dining room The food was fine although I don t think I would eat here if I wasn t staying here In the morning I had the generous Continental breakfast Staff was friendly and helpful They extended my stay by a bit until I needed to leave for the airport I would have cheerfully stayed longer As for value its not cheap but what habitable hotel in London is Since the Basil Street closed some years ago I haven t found a reasonably priced hotel in London to which I would return Until now 
61226,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Great atmosphere converted school to a boutique hotel Room was great not too small at all Mini fridge stocked with water daily Cozy bathrobes wonderful shower 5 minute walk to the tube 
61227,St Paul s Hotel, I asked the front desk to arrange for a cab to the airport They did not arrange a cab but booked a luxury car whose driver charged more than three times the cost of a cab and then demanded a tip on top of it Front desk should have informed me that they were not arranging a cab and that the cost would be absurd I was charged 60 pounds for the short ride to the airport Secondly I was unable to use the tv with my hearing assistance device because it has no connection for headphones Almost every tv has this connection When the hotel replaces its tvs you should make sure that there is a headphone jack for hearing impaired guests , Beautiful facility 
61228,St Paul s Hotel, Good room service menu unfortunately limited availability from the after hours menu when we stayed , Beautiful hotel a short walk from Hammersmith tube rail and bus station Situated within small park like grounds Friendly staff and thrilled to be given a complimentary upgrade Able to leave our bags both before and after check in which was extremely useful Highly rated restaurant on site prosecco on the patio looked very appealing 
61229,St Paul s Hotel, Only gripe would be minimal parking but I was lucky to park in the hotel parking area big enough for 2 cars or 3 small ones and not in the street Had to pay 25 for the parking , A beautiful building I had a standard double room for one night which wasn t large but had plenty of amenities and furniture I pretty much was straight into bed anyway lovely room overlooking the park Would not have known the hotel is on a busy main road it was so quiet Very comfortable room bed and pillows Nice linen too which was soft and pleasant Good modern bathroom which was spacious with walk in shower Very helpful and polite staff Didn t use the restaurant so unable to comment on dinner breakfast Would not hesitate to recommend the hotel 
61230,St Paul s Hotel, Not a bad experience was just surprised there were no tissues , Facilities and price towels were fabulous cleanliness and room I stay most weeks at least one night in London this was one of the best Dining was good too 
61231,St Paul s Hotel, The bed even if very comfortable might be not big enough for taller people But still ok , Very sweet hotel Location is ok About 5 min to the Underground station with Piccadilly and District lines Breakfast even is not too big still enough Lovely selection of small jams 
61232,St Paul s Hotel, The only minor issue was with the blinds that were not that efficient at keeping the room in the dark , Spacious room quiet I was on the park side comfortable and well equipped The spacious bathroom is really enjoyable as well The staff was really nice and serviceable 
61233,St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Our room was very comfortable and clean It had everything that we needed for an overnight stay Despite our room being close to the road the noise was not intrusive we live in the country
