409395,Hotel Michelangelo, Beds were a little hard Air conditioning was ineffective and intermittent especially considering record heatwave temperatures , closeness to central railway and good restaurants
409396,Hotel Michelangelo, The furniture is a bit old and could use some refurbishment Having said that we stayed for two separate nights the first room was newer and nicer than the second room , The location is absolutely perfect super easy to get to and from as it is a very short walking distance from the Milano Centrale train station The breakfast is very good The bed was sooooo comfortable I must say 
409397,Hotel Michelangelo,No Negative, The room as gorgeous it was spacious and the bed was big and comfortable The bathroom was great and the jacuzzi bath was amazing We thoroughly enjoyed our stay 
409398,Hotel Michelangelo, The rooms are outdated It was well kept and in great working condition but reminded me a lot of the hotel in Crocodile Dundee just a little darker I would stay here again even though it was a bit outdated , The location was perfect It s less than five minutes from Milan Central Station Everything we wanted to do was a quick Metro stop away The staff were very friendly and helpful They were able to give recommendations for eating and attractions to see based on your likes The room was spacious and we were not cramped with our many bags 
409399,Hotel Michelangelo, The internet was problematic when we were there They were attentively trying to fix it but we didn t have wifi overnight for about 12 hours on our first night , Vintage hotel amazing hard bed with perfect pillows turquoise tiled bathroom with spa like tub 
409400,Hotel Michelangelo,No Negative, we ve stayed only one night in this hotel the other day we had a flight its right across to central station so very easy to reach airport shuttles stuff was kind and helpful awesome location
409401,Hotel Michelangelo,No Negative, Excellent location for trains and metro Clean and comfortable and very helpful front desk staff and porters It s our second visit there and will be returning too 
409402,Hotel Michelangelo, Whilst the breakfast menu was plentiful and extensive we were not overly excited about the menu in the restaurant and the fact that a hotel of this calibre has hardly anything to offer from the menu after 9 30 pm , We chose this hotel because of its closeness to the Central Railway Station to make it easier for us with view to our travels It proved to be the right choice Our room offered us a view over a large part of the city which was an extra bonus 
409403,Hotel Michelangelo, The mirrored walls caused a bit of confusion especially late at night , I asked for a bottle of Prosecco in our room which was provided with 3 bowls of snacks which we weren t expecting and was very welcome especially by my friends who had flown in from England The staff on reception were very helpful The room was very spacious and the view from our room was fabulous 15th floor 
409404,Hotel Michelangelo, Reception staff a bit clinical but efficient , Only had one night Asked for recommended places to eat but took a look and didn t fancy them needed an easy cafe style with a bit of atmosphere Found it wandering out on own down the road nearby Mogomo or similar Fantastic benunning so close to the station as we were in and out Lots of buzz going on in the stations piazza at night Very comfortable beds 
409405,Hotel Michelangelo,No Negative, Location is great Convenient to visit the city as well as the nearby lake area by subway or train I booked a room with twin beds and one sofa 1 adult plus two kids of 9 and 10 years old Additional 30 Euro is charged per night This may be normal in Europe but in China no extra charge The room is clean and comfortable Big enough The breakfast is good with different choices at Euro 15 per person 
409406,Hotel Michelangelo, Not much really we really liked it , Great location just by Milano Centrale train station close to good restaurants The hotel has a classic vibe and the rooms are 60s 70s inspired affairs with above standard bordering on a luxurious feel if you go back to those decades Jacuzzi bath and nice little touches such as stationery a mini bar as well as numerous multilingual TV channels We were also able to leave bags at the concierge with no trouble whilst we wondered around the city the following morning Close to metro links would definitely stay here again if we re ever back in Milan 
409407,Hotel Michelangelo, Nothing It s all good value for money and above average , Extremely well managed hotel foot walking from the main train station and yet very quiet Only the bar is a bit dated Got help from the staff at 6 30 am to free a swallow caught between two window glasses 
409408,Hotel Michelangelo, Bed is smaller than a king size bed and there was no electric kettle in the room , Good location accessible public transport short walk from Milano Centrale Una delle migliori colazioni One of the best breakfast we ever had fresh fruits feta cheese fresh bread espresso etc Best of all the courteous and attentive staff at the restaurant makes you start your day right 
409409,Hotel Michelangelo, we have booked triple room and actually get double with sofabed Room needs some renovation although was clean and well maintained , Good location for public transport and airport shuttle buses only few stops from main attractions of Milan Very good breakfast big room with wifi and great view 
409410,Hotel Michelangelo, The bed was smaller than the typical king size bed and there was no coffee maker in the room , Excellent location Just a few steps to Milano Centrale station and other public transportation We were accommodated in the 16th floor with a great view on the city and Milano Centrale area The staff were very helpful and friendly 
409411,Hotel Michelangelo,No Negative, Great location a short walk 100 meters from the train station Room was nice clean staff was very helpful and friendly Loved the jets in the bathtub and the bath salts and bubbles the hotel provided 
409412,Hotel Michelangelo, Nothing, Everything is beautiful the location of the hotel the view from the window of the room spacious comfortable and clean room bath with Jacuzzi nice staff and great breakfast My stay at the hotel Michelangelo was unforgettable 
409413,Hotel Michelangelo, Very minor things Not many outlets in the room for recharging devices and we couldn t find one in the bathroom for the curling iron The Wi Fi connects when your TV is on so you have the TV screen lit up even if you are not watching it Nothing else I can think of , The Hotel Michelangelo is right next to the main train terminal in Milano It was very easy to find when we left the station and an easy walk The bus shuttle service and taxi services are right across the street for getting to the airports and around the city Shuttle service to Linate airport was five euro each A great bargain The neighborhood was clean and not crowded The hotel rooms were excellent equipped with everything you could need including a wall mounted iron for pressing clothes The tub was huge with two shower heads and whirlpool jets Large storage closet We were on floor 13 and the large window could be fully opened to let in the night breeze Excellent view of the city as well We had a morning thunderstorm that was very relaxing Finally the breakfast was exceptional squisito Full buffets of hot and cold items Fresh orange juice you make yourself by rolling whole oranges into the juicer The staff were ever present and very attentive in the restaurant A great start to the day 
409414,Hotel Michelangelo, fixed carpet in our room was threadbare and should be replaced Too many tourists from South Easst Asia with young children almost occupying the lobby area The sofas are too low and make getting up difficult , Breakfast was worth the extra cost Nearby transport facilities excellent
409415,Hotel Michelangelo, Well I have no particulate complains It was clean close to the train station It was convenient because I traveled though Italy mostly by train Hotel staff made everything right It just old unpleasant room with those wooden panels from 60s Unless one got really great deal on price or one got everything paid by employer I would not stay there No charm more like corporate environment , Location Good for business trips I guess 
409416,Hotel Michelangelo, Somewhat worn out rooms Bit depressing small breakfast room in the basement Distant walk to centre , Well run hotel traditional rooms sufficient facilities for business trips
409417,Hotel Michelangelo, One of the waiters trying to hook up with me it was a bit unpleasant , My room was great I only had a single but it was roomy clean and comfortable The closeness to the station for my onwards journey was perfect 
409418,Hotel Michelangelo, Trip too short , Great location right across from the Milan central train station Staff was very nice and helpful Room was comfortable and breakfast was good 
409419,Hotel Michelangelo, Area was ok Close to train station and sketchy characters, Close to subway train and hop on hop off Far from good restaurants but metro makes it easy
409420,Hotel Michelangelo, We were only there for 1 night and wanted to be close to the station so was good for us But it was quite a long walk to the main part of town , Breakfast was amazing everything you could ever want and more Close to train station Beds comfortable and good bathroom 
409421,Hotel Michelangelo, The floor we were on was designated as a non smoking floor but the room smelt of smoke , Very comfy bed Breakfast was excellent and very close to a variety of bars aand cafes 
409422,Hotel Michelangelo, Room service Besides charging 8 euros extra to deliver to your room price of dishes higher than from directly at restaurant Ok if you wanna charge to deliver to your room but having a different menu price is double rip off You really feel robbed , Location lovely breakfast and good value for money
409423,Hotel Michelangelo, I guess it s because it s mainly used for business but the decor in public spaces and rooms was rather drab mainly brown and beige and the the bar and restaurant were priced for those with expense accounts However the food we did have in the hotel was very good and the city is full of excellent bars and restaurants within a few minutes walk from the hotel if you want a bit more atmosphere and less cost The large sofas near the reception area looked really stylish but were quite uncomfortable and difficult to get out of if you re not fully mobile , The hotel is a large business hotel and its location is very convenient for transport 10 minutes walk at most from Milano Centrale railway station with access to the city s metro network which is really efficient and the nearby shuttle buses for transfers to the airports Rooms are quite large clean and well equipped with good air conditioning Bed was big and comfortable Wi fi superb and free and soft drinks from the minibar were also free Staff were also very helpful and friendly 
409424,Hotel Michelangelo, I booked my room with a bath spa but it was a normal bathtub without any spa It was room 1504, Clean and comfort The location is very near to the central station but it was very expensive 
409425,Hotel Michelangelo, Normally I like to do breakfast in the bars of Milano but this time I wanted to try breakfast in hotel and it was poor There was not even olives and this hotel in Italy Coffee was not good as you can find best coffee in Italy , Location is great smiling and helpful staff 
409426,Hotel Michelangelo,No Negative, Huge relief to find a blanket on the bed as opposed to the ubiquitous ridiculous duvets in 29oC heat Great hotel a flat 100m walk across from the station found online same day when an overnight stay became unexpectedly necessary Booking process and product came up trumps at a very stressful time 
409427,Hotel Michelangelo, An impersonal tower block we were on the 11th floor Room was dingy and smelled musty though this solved by opening window OK on our return 4 hours later Bed not especially comfortable and too hot at night , Main saving grace is its location very close to Central Station we used it for a stopover Staff were friendly and helpful 
409428,Hotel Michelangelo, Nothing, Good breakfast pleasant staff that spoke good English and a nice Resturant called Davids great location at the railway station and easy to find
409429,Hotel Michelangelo, Since I had to leave for the airport at 5 30 am before breakfast started I asked the day before if the kitchen could put a roll in a bag for me the night before and the answer was no Since breakfast was included in my room rate I thought this was a bit unaccommodating , If you have reason to be very near the train station like an early morning flight or train Michaelangelo is a perfect choice After a problem with the a c in my first room the front desk assigned me a new upgraded room without my even asking The wifi is a bit strange being through Direct TV you have to keep the TV on but worked fine I had to get up too early for breakfast so can t comment The hotel offered very good value and I would return there again 
409430,Hotel Michelangelo,No Negative, The room bathroom and view was perfect The bed was a king size and very comfortable The windows opened for fresh air and the drapes automatically opened closed Free snacks were available The tub was a relaxing jet tub Very comfortable hotel Great breakfast 
409431,Hotel Michelangelo, Breakfast seemed very expensive The lack of tea coffee facilities in the room , Very central for train bus and Metro The area seemed safe to walk around after dark
409432,Hotel Michelangelo, Air conditioning wasn t working and to have the window open was very noisy, Very convenient to use underground which was cheap and easy to use Spa bath was nice and view of station building from room 1106 was impressive 
409433,Hotel Michelangelo, The shower is in the bathtub which made it extreemly difficult to use for us senior people when climbing into the tub to take a shower , The hotel was near Central Station Milan which suited us from an arrival standpoint 
409434,Hotel Michelangelo,No Negative, I would highly recommend this hotel for a business person nut NOT a family Hated the location Difficult to get anywhere Just a big yucky city Hotel itself was great Facilities room breakfast but parking was remote Railway station was about a block away and was inhabited with what appeared to be with homeless folks and immigrants Very uncomfortable 
409435,Hotel Michelangelo,No Negative, It s just 5 mins walking distance from Milano Centrale Classic 4 star hotel in Europe Comfortable bed pillow free mini bar and excellent breakfast I could recommend friends to stay here Airport buses are just outside of the hotel along the side of Milano Centrale 
409436,Hotel Michelangelo, Parking was difficult if your not use to it , Excellent experience while staying here Very central to everything either by short Uber ride or 15 20 minute walk Only a short drive to Lake Como which I would highly recommend driving to f you have a chance Views are absolutely amazing 
409437,Hotel Michelangelo, Staff didn t speak good english, Breakfast was good with lot of options with a perfect combination of hot and cold food Room was spacious and comfortable Very clean hotel 
409438,Hotel Michelangelo, Room a little noisy from water system in the air ducts and bed a bit too hard for my liking Neither were major issues though A kettle in the room would also be a good addition , Very extensive choice for breakfast fantastic Wifi very good
409439,Hotel Michelangelo, the parking and breakfasts are very expensive The rooms look old fashioned and require renovation , the room was quite big the parking is available on the 1 floor with the lift very nice view to the city from the upper floors 
409440,Hotel Michelangelo, No facilities for making tea or coffee in the room Breakfast was not included in the price , Location and comfortable room with very large bed Room on 16th Floor so great views over the city Very close to Milan Central railway station and subway system 
409441,Hotel Michelangelo, For us the weather was really bad So we were unable to see Milan properly When it rains it pours However head for the Cathedral which is lovely, Good location for travelling around city But not so good for staying local and eating
409442,Hotel Michelangelo,No Negative, Location is great especially if you are travelling by train or car Out of traffic jam good parking facility and just near the train station Staff is helpfull and lovely They have found my laptop and kept it for me until my next trip 
409443,Hotel Michelangelo, The hotel is close to the central railway station not a particularly good area with many African asylumseekers hanging around but one doesn t feel threatened It is just the litter which is a bit offputting , Excellent location for all lines of the Metro network Very comfortable room Friendly and efficient staff Very good breakfast buffet perhaps not cheap at 15 but worth it Also very close to the buses between Bergamo airport and Milan Central 
409444,Hotel Michelangelo, Everything was good , At a transport hub Opposite the central station access to trains metro buses trams The hotel allowed us to store our luggage while we took an overnight trip Gave us slightly early access to our room when we returned Free wifi 
409445,Hotel Michelangelo, Very small bar of soap and no shower gel provided , Good modern hotel very close to central station Easy to reach by bus from airporthe Comfortable bed and spacious room Excellent breakfasts
409446,Hotel Michelangelo, No tea coffee in the room but the water and soft drinks were a bonus, Hotel was fantastic breakfast was great and the staff couldn t be more helpful 
409447,Hotel Michelangelo, Smokers ALWAYS blocking the entrance staff at breakfast take no care in the amount of noise they make when clearing tables and stacking them on trolleys it was over bearing also we came down to BF with 3 4 hr left to closure but the food selection was diminished and not refilled for 15 euro each not worth it , was chosen for proximity to main train station Staff courteous and efficient at front desk Rooms good size very comfy really appreciated the complementary water and soda 
409448,Hotel Michelangelo, When I booked for 7 days I was told that I would have free breakfast When I got there they said that I only had 3 free days They picked the days Well for 2 of the days they picked I had extremely early trips planned I would leave before breakfast even started They would not switch my breakfast days Considering the money I spent I was very disappointed and felt robbed It seemed very cheap and Penny pinching on the hotels part , It was a 2 minute walk to Milan Centrale 
409449,Hotel Michelangelo, Hair dryer in bathroom Very little flexibility when styling hair A hand dryer in the bedroom would have been better , Very clean and fresh bed linen Hand shower in the bathroom as well as shower Good for hair washing 
409450,Hotel Michelangelo, The rooms are a bit dated You also need to have the TV on to have access to the wifi which is a bit bizarre The hotel is almost half an hour walk from Duomo but super close to the central station and metro , Super close to the Stazione Milano Centrale which means you can get a bus from Linate or a train for Malpensa The area around the train station has definitely improved since the last time I was there so it s pleasant to walk around The hotel rooms are spacious and I enjoyed the slippers bathrobes and cosmetics provided They also helped partially reimbursed me for a wrong reservation I made which I appreciate 
409451,Hotel Michelangelo, the mattresses weren t comfortable at all very old and used The electricity wasn t compatible with our mobiles we couldn t charge neither them or the PCs the bath bagno was blocked and the water remained until the 2nd day , the location is near to the central station 
409452,Hotel Michelangelo, One of the staff for breakfast was rude and hurried guests for breakfast but all others were excellent, The location was perfect for us to explore Milan and for us to do our day trips Like the small touch of amenities in room and free items in mini bar You can leave luggage after you check out if you need yo depart for train or airport later Breakfast selection is decent too 
409453,Hotel Michelangelo, It was quite warm in the room the windows can be opened only partially there is air co in the room so it should be fine in the summer The price of the breakfast is too high 15 euros I didn t take it there s plenty of small caf s nearby, The hotel is super convenient opposite Milan s central station The room was very spacious I was travelling with my 7 year old daughter The staff was very helpful Very nice jacuzzi in the bathroom I really enjoyed my stay 
409454,Hotel Michelangelo, Even I have paid for the breakfast and in the room there was message that in case of early check out it is possible to provide in packet the reception asked me 8 EUR person for packing Another aspect is that the hotel looks a little bit old planning and condition now , The breakfast was rich a lot of choices Excellent 
409455,Hotel Michelangelo, it is no doubt a super hotel before but the room need renovation, good location super breakfast you can enjoy the fresh juice free minibar and nice pillow spa bathbub
409456,Hotel Michelangelo,No Negative, Excellent service quality Breakfast area was very clean and comfortable Wide selection of available products fresh oranje juice and all kibd of coffee a great plus The staff in breakfast area was extremely helpful and kind always taking care of the guests Room was clean bed was confortable and wi fi signal excellent 
409457,Hotel Michelangelo, Same as above, It was theorist experience Made two bookings under one name by mistake and both were refused to cancel Asked them to at least extend so stay can be prolonged Hate Booking com and the hotel Was the last time to do business with both I will tell another 20 friends of mine to stop using booking com as sometimes they cheat on purpose 
409458,Hotel Michelangelo, the wifi only works as long as the room tv is on and it doesn t work in the breakfast area some of the bell staff can try to put up a smile and be more responsive , location is awesome
409459,Hotel Michelangelo, Discount for loyal customers like me fourth time there, Staff is nice not bothering you with all unnecessary inquiries room is excellent location very convenient
409460,Hotel Michelangelo, all is very good, everything is nice in this Hotel its My usual choice in Milano Breakfast is amazing location is the best you can get the stufff is stunning always available very friendly special thanks to Paola 
409461,Hotel Michelangelo, The bed was very very hard I asked for a soft mattress overlay but was told no such thing was available The pillows were a bit firm too , Proximity to Milano Cenrale was very convenient which is important when you re dragging a heavy bag Metro station and bus stops for Hop On Hop Off and airport buses all close by 
409462,Hotel Michelangelo, Usually this hotel is all good but this time the jet bath doesn t work in my room I was booking double room with Spa Bath I stay several times every year but sometimes I had trouble like this ,No Positive
409463,Hotel Michelangelo, Nothing , Great location and really good hotel Had some quirky design features in the room glass bench tops on drawers Excellent WiFi and free mini bar soft drink and water only No hesitation in staying there again 
409464,Hotel Michelangelo, Staff attitude to customers awful rip off prices in bar for food and drink no one interested enough at check out to even ask how it was Rude concierges only spoke when you had euros in your hand No way 4star needs renovating and new staff with the right attitude , Central location clean 
409465,Hotel Michelangelo, The bed was a little hard but we still slept ok The wifi worked well but you had to have the tv on to use it which is a little odd Not a big deal just a minor inconvenience The rooms felt a bit dated in a bad way and ours had a bit of a mustiness to it Again small details but depending on your level of pickiness they may bother you , This hotel biggest selling point for us was the location It is right next to Milano Centrale and therefore made our trip in and out of the city easily accessible by train with all of our luggage and it made it easy to get to other areas because there is a metro stop inside the train station as well The hotel itself was fine The bathrooms were nice We didn t try the breakfast
409466,Hotel Michelangelo,No Negative, Jacuzzi Bathtub and free Minibar Soundproof rooms with views Comfortable beds Nice American breakfast Nice Restaurant Many lifts to rooms 2 minutes from Milan s buzzing central station
409467,Hotel Michelangelo, Stayed at other hotels while traveling through Europe for about same price but had at least breakfast included and also at the reception they didn t give us maps or told us how to get around , Location was excellent and staff was helpful 
409468,Hotel Michelangelo, Staff generally polite but not particularly friendly or helpful No tea and coffee making facilities in room, Nice view Comfortable room Next to main station metro convenient for easy early morning departure
409469,Hotel Michelangelo, We are tea lovers but the room does not have kettle or coffee maker We asked for the hot water but they only can do room service with 8 euro service charge , Great location 2mins walk from the central station The breakfast is great plenty of choices and tasty 
409470,Hotel Michelangelo, The bed was a little firm for our taste but that is likely just a matter of opinion It wasn t uncomfortable by any means and I slept fine both nights The room wouldn t stay as cool as we liked either though I could have been using the thermostat incorrectly ha We like it quite cool when we sleep and I couldn t get it to stay below 70 degrees There was a mild smell of cleaner powder when we entered the room that wasn t all that appetizing but I suppose that is better than it smelling bad dirty or smokey unless you are a smoker of course All these are minor issues at an otherwise nice hotel , This hotel was in a great location next to Milano Centrale Easy access to from there if you are traveling by train The room was nice not particularly spacious but not too small either The bathroom was really nice It had a spa option for the bath but we didn t use that Standard toilet and bidet All in all worth the price and in a great spot with quick access to metro and trains The staff was helpful and spoke english The room was clean 
409471,Hotel Michelangelo, The room decoration is not super modern though everything is still functional , Excellent location just across from the train station nice view spacious room with nice facilities such as jacuzzi bath Very decent breakfast 
409472,Hotel Michelangelo, Issues with wi fi the smell of chlorine after cleaning very old fashioned decor of hotel and room lack of a kettle to prepare tea coffee in room The most strange and unpleasant situation with packed breakfast I have ever seen we got room with included breakfast so due to early flight we wanted to pack our meal but the staff told us to pay for this additional 8E per person This is inexplicable and unprofessional to want from guest additional money for what they already have paid in 4 stars hotel , Localization near train station 10 min to old town by metro room with nice view 5th floor good quality breakfast warm dishes friuts fresh juice 
409473,Hotel Michelangelo, old fashion internet connected to TV and if you want to use even when your friend slept you need to keep it on Iron machine doesnt work in room decoration need really to be changed after these years even partially year by year can guarantee their future, very good breakfast very helpful staff good price and clean room good prestige Super good location good hotel just with old fashion decor a bit
409474,Hotel Michelangelo,No Negative, Staff were friendly and responded kindly to every request Hotel is comfortable and in a great position Good value for money Breakfast offered excellent choice
409475,Hotel Michelangelo, No conference room to work Staff were a little stand offish, The rooms were really beautiful and the bath was amazing Teh toiletires were really nice The location was excellent We had a problem with our room and the staff were very helpful and immediately moved us to a new room The wifi was excellent 
409476,Hotel Michelangelo, bellman not friendly at all was charged 5 euro when checking out why not add that to the bill when i check in and save the hotel and me an extra step , loved location near train station
409477,Hotel Michelangelo,No Negative, Ideal location in front of CENTRALE Railway Staion Helpful staff Rich and delicious breakfast Spacious Room Excelent choice for stay in Milano in general 
409478,Hotel Michelangelo, The room we stayed this time had really old and damaged carpet Our room was next to the cleaning lady locker She constantly dragged noisy things in there and slammed the door after We had to go tell her to stop after 11PM We needed tea for my mom who was sick at 7PM I went to the lobby bar to order and to take it in the room and they said it is no possible and just ask for room service The service charge for room service after 6 30 PM is 8 EUR The same woman who refused me brought the tea good business , Location breakfast 
409479,Hotel Michelangelo,No Negative, The staff at the restaurant were just fantastic They were nice helpful and very enthusiastic We must praise Alessandra and the rest of the crew sorry I didn t retain their names for making us feel at home As per the hotel facilities they were as usual comfortable and clean It is a bit odd to rely on the TV set for connecting to the internet but that is not a big problem Thank you Guys very much 
409480,Hotel Michelangelo, A bit far off from central Milan required a good walk to get to the museums and the Duomo etc but that was our choice , Excellent location for us close to the central station which allowed for further exploration of the region Excellent breakfast many food choices Very clean and tranquil Very good and polite service 
409481,Hotel Michelangelo, can t think of anything, Good clean hotel good location to the underground train station considerate staff and very helpful The room was very nice and a comfortable bed 
409482,Hotel Michelangelo, Dirty room with hair underneath the sheets that were visible I moved it and realized it was full of them and dirty furniture with hair from other guests as a result for this night we had to sleep with our clothes I booked the rooms as it looked nice as a 4 hotel and my friends as well as me were totally dissatisfied , Nothing 
409483,Hotel Michelangelo, Don t bother eating at their restaurant The food was below average and the service terrible , The location was good Close to the central train station and walking distance to good shopping
409484,Hotel Michelangelo, Thought breakfast was a bit expensive 30 euros a day a couple to bad there wasn t a deal going, We loved the location just across the road from the Milan Train Station and the Metro was so easy to use
409485,Hotel Michelangelo, looks a bit old fashioned, location close to stazione centrale so easy to acces trains and subway wifi was excellent fast and no bugs bathroom bath tub good 
409486,Hotel Michelangelo, For room service they charge an extra 8 euros for the service which is really very high We ordered a coffee for 3 euro and got a bill for 11 euro Why have room service at all if it s going be charged so high because of this we chose not to eat or drink anything at the hotel at all even in the restaurant didn t want anymore surprises , The best part is the windows open even on the 16th floor The view is great and the location being exactly opposite the Centrale Station you can go anywhere in Milan or out with in a 3 minute walk 
409487,Hotel Michelangelo, Could do with more sockets in the room, Location near transport routes Walking distance to shops historic sites Nearby restaurants Big room fabulous ensuite Free fast wifi Free minibar Classic tasteful decor Amazingly quiet Restful comfort
409488,Hotel Michelangelo, They should provide tea and coffee making facilities in the room We had a tour that starts at 6 45am and the breakfast starts only at 6 30am When we requested for a takeaway breakfast they say that we have to pay 8 each which is too ridiculous In all our travels whenever we have to leave early the hotel always provide takeaway breakfast free of charge In one hotel that we stayed they even set a table with a few breakfast item for us to eat before their opening time If they have tea and coffe making facilities in the room then we could just have some biscuits and coffe in our room , The location was excellent Breakfast was ok 
409489,Hotel Michelangelo, Honestly I could blame this place much as it is acutally good , The location is awesome very close to the train station especially there was a Chinese buffet place three doors down the street Also it is close to a metro station where you could easily access the Duomo and the two main shopping streets for luxuries Also the room is spacious compared to other places I ve stayed during my trip in Europe 
409490,Hotel Michelangelo,No Negative, Perfect location if travelling by train is only 3 minute walk Hotel really clean and helpful staff They give free public transport vouchers with tram stop directly outside hotel is so easy Would definitely recommend 
409491,Hotel Michelangelo, Hairdryer was not usable room a little small and only English tv channel was news Expected to be more central , Friendly staff very clean and comfortable Very close to central train station and easy transport access to center and airport s 
409492,Hotel Michelangelo,No Negative, The Hotel Michelangelo in Milan is a high rise across the street from the train station and very convenient from that viewpoint which is why I stayed there based on a local recommendation I quite enjoyed my stay from a cultural viewpoint The hotel is modern in an Italian modern from forty or fifty years ago sense Everything in the room is a gadget to figure out including a pants press The wi fi only works when the TV is turned on the instructions were good The curtains open and shut with electronic button controls Sort of a James Bond hotel in a word Try it you might like it or at least the challenge of some the puzzles as to how to work things like the shower 
409493,Hotel Michelangelo, Not much negative to say price on the high side and tight reception area , High speed wifi was a positive surprise after a couple of slow wifi hotels Fast check out and a good location near the Central station helped for catching the train and flight 
409494,Hotel Michelangelo, Cleanliness I booked the room because hotel advertised jacusi in the bathroom There was a jacusi but also dark hairs on the bath walls Impossible to use , Location in front of railway station Milano Centrale
409495,Hotel Michelangelo,No Negative, Great location for us just across the street from train station Lovely large well appointed room very clean property The breakfast offered many choices and the coffee was quite good We only had a one night stay but would choose this hotel again if ever in Milan 
409496,Hotel Michelangelo, The bin in my bathroom wasnt emptied when I checked in , Very convenient location right across the road from the railway station Free drinks in the fridge 
409497,Hotel Michelangelo, Nothing not to like , Very convenient close to the station perfect for a last night and early start for the airport Receptionist recommended an excellent nearby hotel for dinner
409498,Hotel Michelangelo,No Negative, The location is really good very near the Central terminal The amenities and room are very comfortable The staff are friendly Goo internet connection 
409499,Hotel Michelangelo,No Negative, Good location very near Centrale Station but is far away enough from the crowd Breakfast is the basic one Staff is efficient and professional Tidy and clean 
409500,Hotel Michelangelo,No Negative, You get the best of Italian hospitality at a rate considered very economic compared with other 4 and 5 star hotel rates in Milano with no sacrifice in luxury 
409501,Hotel Michelangelo, The price of the was over inflated specially when you know that your neighbour paid almost 60 of what you have paid , All the staff are friendly from the manager to the housekeeping staff 
409502,Hotel Michelangelo, The behavior of staff is very very bad specially the fron desk can you believe we are in 2016 and the people they do not give iron bored to the guest or the can do any pressing the cloth after 7pm, Location near train station

409563,Hotel Michelangelo, The breakfast is less than stellar and the breakfast staff is rude and not helpful but then you will find it very difficult to find ANY helpful Italian And whatever you do DO NOT ask an Italian for directions They will lead you astray intentionally or simply pretend as though they do not know where obvious landmarks are located although you will discover it s obvious to local people Italy in general depends on tourist sales but they also appear to hate the invasion of tourists so there is a sort of a love and hate relationship with tourists So just keep in mind that they want your money but they don t particularly want you there tourists are tolerated for the sake of their money This is not my first trip to Italy so it took me a few trips to discover this perspective Still there are a few exceptions to this Italian rule some of the Italians are wonderful people but they are definitely the exception not the rule In a sense it is like Disneyland you go to see what it s all about and then you get over it really quickly You can lay claim to having done Italy but then you visit someplace like Prague and quickly wish everyone was as nice as the people in the Czech Republic I m a born and raised Californian and have no relationship to Prague Hope this review helps happy and safe travels , The location is super convenient to the main train station Milano Centrale Taking the convenient metro at the train station to the Duomo and main square is super convenient

409575,Hotel Michelangelo, The hotel reception area is dated and not very welcoming , The Hotel is a short walk from the train station which privides fast links to rest of Italy and Switzerland Staff are professional and efficient We would especially want to mention Carmen and the housekeeper my wife left her phone in the room and only realised when we had checked out and travelled away from Milan We called and Carmen was able to check and called us back within a few minites that the phone had been found
