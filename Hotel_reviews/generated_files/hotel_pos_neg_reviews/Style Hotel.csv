473472,Style Hotel, Rooms are quite small no bath in a standard room just a shower Poor or no window view again from the standard room , Amazing rather small boutique hotel Really unusual stylish interior Good location around 10 15 mins walking to Duomo Very kind and helpful stuff helped me to receive my package in advance dryclean my things and gave many advices on how to make my journey the most comfortable while in Milano Good shower and bathroom
473473,Style Hotel, I asked for a an ice bucket and two glasses for a bottle of wine I had purchased at the airport I was told it would be 12 really I choose this hotel because of location and spa albeit a very small spa on arrival was told spa charge was 200 per hour and 150 an hour after that , Location good front desk very helpful 
473474,Style Hotel, 1 Unfortunately I booked Junior suite but it seem as a normal room too expensive 2 At 12 00 pm you must leave the room if ot become 1 00 you will pay 30 of room charge for one extra hour haha Even of you booked Suite no exception in this hotel , Just the location of the hotel
473475,Style Hotel, Fairly priced Breakfast cheaper so we could have used restaurant facility Gym cheaper 100 Euros for an hour So we could have used facilities, Expensive for what we got in return Tea and coffee was payable in the room
473476,Style Hotel, This is not a 5 hotel by any stretch It feels like it s run by amateurs and is basically a glorified guest house Following many requests to fix the air con and a plethora of excuses ranging from it s broken I can t adjust the program etc to Italian law states that we can t allow you to use the air con I had to demand that the staff turn on the air con Only when I threatened not to pay did the air con suddenly turn itself on Everything is an extra from the 2 tea bags to the 100 jacuzzi Breakfast is 25 the bar restaurant is in the basement and is tiny Don t stay here take your business elsewhere , Rooms were clean and the location is great 
473477,Style Hotel, The price is not matching to services and and this hotel is not 5 stars maximum 3 5 The internet cost 10euro and its not working every 5 minutes dissconetcting we got free wifi because we booked at booking com but i working in internet so it was impossible to work We ordered from booking com their regular room 580 EUR for 3 nights on the photo its was amazing but when we came there the room was so small i asked for another room more luxury and bigger so i paid 270 EUR more they gave me better room with very nice bath But to take shower was impossible we almost fall in the bath it was so slippery all the water was outside on the floor when we took shower i never seen shower and bath worth than this Its only looks pretty but not usefull at all The toilet was very bad uncomfortable if you pee everything going outside when you flush the water the water going out side The Smart TV not worked not connecting to internet Their Media server also not worked They leave 2 pairs of slippers and one of them was used already by someone This is not 5 start hotel please do not stop at this hotel until they will write the real 3 5 stars , Location is nice the shampoo body lotion also was nice Nice smart lights control system 
473478,Style Hotel,No Negative, High quality hotel Fantastic location Well managed super clean and with a spectacular Private SPA All services breakfast room service SPA I used have been delivered spotlessly with superb quality I will definitely be back 
473479,Style Hotel, the hotel if compared to hotels we stayed in bellagio levanto florence and venice is not up to 4star standards and overpriced because of the 5star rating s fourie, the hotel is a boutique type of hotel and in no way 5 star nothing more than 3star expensive for its facilities and easily 3km from the centre and 1500m from nearest metro i will not stay there again final remark s fourie
473480,Style Hotel, Worse bathtubs ever There is no way to take a normal shower and stand on your own feets Almost lost my life , Excellent position very close to the center Nice rooms and very clean

473482,Style Hotel, I had issues with the Internet Even though the reciption gave me a credentials I didn t use them I was able to just connect easily the first day However for two other days the Internet didn t work and the reciption didn t know how to fix it Soo I won t stay again in this hotel just because of the bad internet How could some one live without net wile traveling , Nice little hotel Great service room location The bed is confortable 
473483,Style Hotel, The Internet had an issue The saff gave me a password and user name but I actually didn t need them I was connected without authentication and it worked perfectly However the Internet stoped worked some days all night the first day I arrived and all morning some other day for really long time the saff couldn t figure the issue I would say Internet access is really importent the hotel have to check the issue , Clean big room Helpful friendly staff Overall a really nice hotel with a central location 
473484,Style Hotel, Extremely overpriced breakfast and spa and gym are extremely limited and overpriced too Spa tub in room did no work and answer I got from reception after informing about it was I m very sorry but I can t do anything about it , Food quality good staff very helpful and offer guidance good location nice and comfortable rooms Location of hotel very good too
