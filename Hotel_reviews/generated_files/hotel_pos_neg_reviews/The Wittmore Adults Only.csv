430390,The Wittmore Adults Only,No Negative, This hotel is perfect the location is central to the gothic centre with bars and restaurants walking distance away The roof top sun deck is where we spent most of our days Comfy all day loungers with a plunge pool Staff were fantastic and couldn t have been any friendlier I would recommend this hotel with full confidence 
430391,The Wittmore Adults Only, The shower head had too much pressure , I loved the design and the bedroom features Marshall speakers and beds where you can sleep like a god The roof terrace is perfect for lounging in the sun and the location is fantastic 
430392,The Wittmore Adults Only,No Negative, My wife and I were able to get all the correct recommendations from the wonderful staff about tours bars local cuisine and Catalunyen culture without feeling like they were just brushing us off to someone they know We had the pleasure of meeting the owner who s vision was easily visible by the way his staff were able to help and how beautiful comfortable safe and stylish the hotel was Highly recommended if you are looking to enjoy what Barca really has to offer 
430393,The Wittmore Adults Only, We had a room on the first floor and could hear sounds from downstairs at times But this really is the only negative thing we can think of , We had a great stay Staff is very professional and friendly Very clean hotel and very well designed Great kitchen You can make the room completely dark which helps a lot for sleeping We slept very well in good beds and quiet airconditioning The rooftop is an absolute bonus We often go to Barcelona because of friends we know there and will definitely go back to this hotel 
430394,The Wittmore Adults Only, A little difficult to locate , Sheets pillows amazing all the little extras in the room were well thought out Amazing views from the roof top terrace with a romantic ambience 
430395,The Wittmore Adults Only, The car can t reach the hotel you need to carry your luggage for few meters to the main road , The Hotel it self is very nice Boutique hotel The Staff the service the rooms were all fabulous 
430396,The Wittmore Adults Only, Lighting could have been better in the room at times it was just not enough They have dimmers however the max setting it still very very low A floor to ceiling mirror in the room would have been a nice touch as well Other than that everything was great your eyes eventually adjust so it wasn t a big deal , Everything was great the food was excellent service was amazing The concierge was absolutely amazing and helped provide recommendations and booked reservations at some of the top restaurants 
430397,The Wittmore Adults Only, Rooms were fabulous however would suggest a little extra lighting in the wardrobe dressing area so dark I had to use my light on my phone to see the contents of my bag , Roof top bar cafe and pool were super awesome Exclusive yet felt a little like a rock star Staff super friendly Highly recommended 
430398,The Wittmore Adults Only,No Negative, Staff were really fantastic very welcoming professional and friendly This applied to reception the bar restaurant roof terrace and housekeeping We loved our stay and will definitely be back Could do with a mirror in the bedroom and a little more light by the door as you enter the lobby so you can see to put your key in the lock 
430399,The Wittmore Adults Only, A little hard to find but if you call the hotel they will help you and even come and find escort you back if you are stuck go to the nearby post office if you are stuck , The rooftop bar the overall design and feel of the hotel the location the service everything really 
430400,The Wittmore Adults Only, The hotel is very dark especially the corridors and the bedroom We couldn t see the keyhole to get the room key in and even with all the lights on the bedroom still felt like a cave albeit a very comfortable cave The speaker in the corridor ceiling right outside the bedroom door played music too loudly but a quick call to reception soon fixed things , Amazing location tucked away down a quiet street arranged around a stunning green courtyard with a beautiful roof terrace Room well furnished and bathroom was fabulous The staff were without exception friendly and welcoming 
430401,The Wittmore Adults Only, Hotel location is not easy to find by the transport company We were dropped off at the other side of the street so we have to walked and brought our luggages to the hotel by ourselves Lighting inside the room is too dark for us, The bed and its pillows are very good and comfortable also the room is quiet and clean 
430402,The Wittmore Adults Only, Should have tea coffee making facilities in room To order a hot drink with euro 5 room service surcharge is not good , Quality fit out attentive staff good vibe 
430403,The Wittmore Adults Only, Rooms are small In the evenings with the window open you can hear the noise from the patio Both are rather little inconveniences than defects windows are soundproofed and the rooms are beautiful and well equipped , The place fulfilled all my requirements Excellent service very rare today The design of the facility is thoughtful no detail has been overlooked Excellent quality materials and equipment in rooms and common areas I sleep about 100 nights each year in hotels and I first time rate hotel on 10 10 
430404,The Wittmore Adults Only, Rooms were small for a deluxe king double We paid 390 night and breakfast was not included Hotel was very dark and a bit claustrophobic The interiors were absolutely beautiful but the dimmers neede to be turned up especially on the stairs No full length mirror in the bedrooms for a five star and the pool was just a paddle pool just for your feet So the pool description on your website was misleading Staff were excellent and the service was impeccable We wouldn t book with booking com again as it was misleading The three nights cost 1230 and we only had drinks in the hotel I think breakfast should definitely have been included , Location and style of hotel
430405,The Wittmore Adults Only, Hotel is absurdly dark in all common areas and in room Staff needed torch to find key hole in bedroom door Reception so dark that staff could not show directions on map without moving ot a small lamp at end of desk Common stair lighting levels dangerously low No full length mirror in room No tea coffee facility in room , Location roof top bar and lounge area 
430406,The Wittmore Adults Only, It s difficult to criticise this hotel and the only aspect which might be improved upon is the dinner whilst the menu is well designed I think more traditionally Spanish dishes should be on offer and more seasoning is needed for the dishes we enjoyed , Quiet elegant charming and cleverly designed Breakfast was adequate Staff were happy to help and were responsive to any request It was quite quirky in places lovely little dog condiments with magnetic noses 
430407,The Wittmore Adults Only,No Negative, To reach hotel as five star is not possible 20 min to walk to find hotel no any sign they do not have any food at 9 o clock at breakfast unprofessional behaviors at general it is not five star hotel better to move from your list because I trust on booking not for unknown hotel
430408,The Wittmore Adults Only, A little bit dark in some corridors and in the room but just a minor complaint , Wow what a great boutique hotel One of the best we ever stayed in Staff is super friendly and the hotel is a lovely hidden gem midst a great location Beds are so comfortable we could have slept all day long Service we received via email before we arrived and even during our side it most be the best ever by any hotel 
430409,The Wittmore Adults Only, My room was a little noisy It is a small room for the price but well appointed The cappuccino is disappointing but the rest of the food is wonderful , The property is beautiful and the staff is very attentive 
430410,The Wittmore Adults Only, The hotel is located in not secure area where it is easy to be stolen once get outside the hotel A question how to be ranked hotels as a five stars where nothing is fitted with that criteria To reach hotel should continue walking which is not comfortable for business people and even if carry stuff for long holiday , Nothing to remember about what to like 
430411,The Wittmore Adults Only, Very little to fault No full length mirror in the bedroom , Luxurious hotel in the heat of Barcelona Really friendly and helpful staff with a tasty restaurant The roof terrace has some fantastic views and is great for relaxing 
430412,The Wittmore Adults Only,No Negative, One of the nicest hotels we ve ever stayed in Beautiful brand new building with the best of everything from windows to amenities and everything in between The staff went above and beyond In fact we liked it so much we re going back again Can t imagine staying anywhere else in Barcelona The owner was very accessible and takes great pride in his hotel It s obvious he took every opportunity to put the best of the best into this property 
430413,The Wittmore Adults Only, nothing except maybe not enough light in the room but minor detail , Staff are extremely nice and professional Ask them recommendation for restaurant they have a very good list Charming Hotel and decoration very good food in the restaurant
430414,The Wittmore Adults Only, Nothing not to love , We stayed at the lovely cozy sexy wittmore for 4 nights one New Years We had a wonderful time From our first amazing small batch Italian Gin Tonic to Our final breakfast we enjoyed ourselves The place is small but somehow feels like an old grand hotel The service is wonderful and we loved having a sophisticated oasis tucked away in a mysterious and fun part of Town Will be back 
430415,The Wittmore Adults Only,No Negative, Amazing boutique hotel we stumbled upon it when in need of last minute accommodation for one night after a very stressful day and it absolutely couldn t work out better The place is beautiful staff extremely attentive without being pushy and every detail is well though out From beautiful toiletries to food to the outside patio and music It was a flying visit for us but will definitely be back highly recommended gem right in the middle of the gothic quarter 
430416,The Wittmore Adults Only, The rooms could use a little more lighting they are a little on the dim and romantic side I was traveling with my mother , Upon arrival staff saw it was my birthday and so after being upgraded to a larger room we were upgraded to a suite Which was spacious and beautifully decorated lush and warm The service was professional and the staff very friendly and helpful Dinner at the restaurant was AMAZING And the location was right in the old city 10 minute walk from everywhere and in the center of great restaurants bars and shopping 
430417,The Wittmore Adults Only, You have to walk a few steps off the main road as it is in a pedestrian area which I like but would be tough if you had tons of bags , Extremely hip hotel in terms of decor and lively bar restaurant in the lobby with reasonably priced food and drink Beautiful but accessible without being intimidating or snobby very different than anything I ve seen in Barcelona Great location in the old city one of my favourite parts nice chill out area on roof staff was great could not be better 
430418,The Wittmore Adults Only, Room is little small as it was renovate from old house Little dark inside room , most friendly staff david who help me book ticket and call the shopper for the item I want ship back to home Do a lot extra work Very good hotel
430419,The Wittmore Adults Only, A full length mirror somewhere in the room would have been wonderful , Simply stunning and our hero was David He greeted us checked us in and then ensured for our whole visit we were looked after and happy David even organised a wonderful place for us to go to on the Saturday although we rushed back to our perfect hideaway Maria was delightful she served us everyday always charming and always smiling Had the BEST time ever thank you DAVID 
430420,The Wittmore Adults Only, Nothing , Everything Their attention to details raised the bar for the rest of our trip Loved it Even my husband started comparing the next hotel we stayed in with The Wittmore A true example of a soundproofed room on our last night there they had a guest singer with audience at the restaurant bar We slept through it not a single complain and i m a light sleeper 
430421,The Wittmore Adults Only, Nothing really Seemed pretty great overall Next time I would book a bigger room but we only booked it the night before so it wasn t possible on such short notice , Great hotel Helpful staff who went the extra distance Cool design Excellent location

430424,The Wittmore Adults Only, Dark alleys and rooms with little lights You can t even see your clothes to get dressed Too expensive for services and size of room provided, Excellent location in gothic quarter Comfortable beds and nice patio on the roof Friendly staff
430425,The Wittmore Adults Only, Everything was perfect No complaints , I absolutely loved this place Location was perfect and the place is so beautiful and boutique I ve stayed at the Arts Hotel in Barcelona which is very nice as well but something about the Wittmore felt more personal And at a fraction of the cost of the Arts 
430426,The Wittmore Adults Only, I think the lighting can be improved Although I understand it is part of the overall design of the Hotel the guests should be able to use a dimmer in case they would like to see what is in their suitcase for example , Best location and best comfort assured The pool is absolutely stunning Rooms are cozy and the beds are very very comfortable 
430427,The Wittmore Adults Only, good design only the shower for this you need a manuel instruction smile, The Hotel ist fantastic the service excellent the kitchen is wonderfu the best tapas in town around all very good
430428,The Wittmore Adults Only, Location is a bit difficult to find and go for one of the bigger rooms as they are quite small , The hotel has a great vibe to it very chic and cool The staff are very attentive and go the extra mile to help I also liked the details in the room e g amenities The Hotel also has a great restaurant pool terrace and courtyard Really enjoyed my stay Shout out to Giorgio who provided some excellent restaurant recommendations
