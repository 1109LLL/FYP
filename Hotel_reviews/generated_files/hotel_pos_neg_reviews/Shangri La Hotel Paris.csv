17806,Shangri La Hotel Paris,No Negative, Very nice restaurant All rooms are different even in the same category I did not like the room that was offered and staff proposed me to change for another one free of charge 
17807,Shangri La Hotel Paris,No Negative, This was a truly spectacular trip to remember The decor and the rooms scream opulence the staff were incredibly accommodating and helpful The view was absolutely breath taking The facilities were magnificent In short absolutely amazing stay 
17808,Shangri La Hotel Paris, Arrived at 9 00am hotel knows my arrival time as they have been informed earlier but room not provided until 3 00 pm, Clean excellent concierge service
17809,Shangri La Hotel Paris,No Negative, We live in Japan where service quality is always very high so honestly we were a bit nervous of possibly feeling disappointed by an hotel in Paris regardless of its 5 stars Turns out we weren t at all and the staff couldn t have been nicer and more helpful Location is great and needless to say the room are impeccable and look gorgeous 
17810,Shangri La Hotel Paris,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and professional Although they have a lot of customers and residents they give you the feeling and the attention as if you are the only one staying in the hotel They are never late Your requests are immediately taken care of and if what you need is not available they exert all efforts to give you alternatives that suit your taste and demands The room had a very nice view on Eiffel Tower and the temperature was set to what really I wanted inside the room 
17811,Shangri La Hotel Paris, The view from the room was giving on the metallic structure of the restaurant roof bringing very little of natural light One night there was a wedding in the ball room and it was pretty noisy during the night but yh it is Paris so it can happen We found 60 euro for breakfast really over exaggerated even for palace , The Palace is absolutely astonishing architecture and history makes this place very special Service of Palace speaks for itself you have the best for you nothing to add Our room was comfortable and cosy very spacious bathroom and great bed of course Very good swimming pool and SPA area but the most I appreciated the quality of the massages 
17812,Shangri La Hotel Paris, The price was very high Fitness could have been a little better but decent for Paris There are better locations in Paris to be based I believe But a nice hotel , Grand hotel near arc and trocadero Rooms were reasonable size and nicely decorated usual high Shangri la standard and style Bed was amazing 
17813,Shangri La Hotel Paris, Nothing, Everything about this hotel is perfect From the Enormous bed with feather pillows to the stunning Eiffel Tower view from the bathtub It is just a perfect Parisian stay
17814,Shangri La Hotel Paris, Have some misunderstanding about dry cleaning express , The room is fantastic for eiffel view The food are excellent The stuff are great I love breakfast there The bed is very comfortable and large space I love Shangri la Paris 
17815,Shangri La Hotel Paris, This is the first time that I write a review They charged me twice The first time they charge me 2062 54 the second time they charge me 1972 41 on 8th August which is the date I already left Paris for 3days I didn t understand how this happened I write email to the staff they said that they did a investigation it was pre authorization the bank will release the money I waited for few day I write another email to them with my bank statement they admitted that it was a mistake I mean you did a investigation before how come you didn t find out it was a mistake Why can you still charge me on the day that I already left I need a explanation for this ,No Positive
17816,Shangri La Hotel Paris, My room wasn t ready on time and I had to go out around town before getting settled in when I returned my room was still not ready Also the price is super expensive , The view from my terrace was like something out of a fairytale

17818,Shangri La Hotel Paris,No Negative, We stayed there to celebrate my eldest daughter s 18th Birthday When we got in the room a bottle of champagne a cake and a handwritten note from the manager greeted my daughter We got the room with a balcony and a good the view of the Eiffel and the garden below us We had food delivered to the room and everything was just perfect The tower s sparkle the delicious food good music in the wonderful company of my family made our stay there magical 
17819,Shangri La Hotel Paris, The only drawback would be the price point If you stay more than a couple I imagine the bill might come as a bit of a shock but as they say you get what you pay for , The staff went above and beyond to accommodate our every wish The cocktails were unique and DELICIOUS

17824,Shangri La Hotel Paris, Didn t have a bad experience at all but just to note that the main image on the website left me thinking there was a beautiful rooftop bar terrace for guests but in fact is the penthouse suite so if you want a view like that you have to book a room with a view of the eiffel tower and you will not be disappointed , One of my most enjoyable holiday experiences staying in this hotel The staff couldn t be more helpful I had a fabulous room with the most gorgeous view and I couldn t have asked for more
