196840,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, We booked two rooms at the same time but forgot to ask specifically that they be close if not next door In the event one was on 3rd floor the other on the 2nd ,No Positive
196841,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, The area seemed a little rough but it was an excellent location for the Olympic Park , The staff were really friendly We were there for the Ride London and they were very helpful The room was a good size and clean We left too early for breakfast but the restaurant looked nice 
196842,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, There was a slight odor in the room we were only spending an evening at the hotel so there was no need to change it The service at breakfast was not great The server was friendly but only offered us coffee and milk after my husband flagged her down to ask where we could get coffee after waiting for 10 minutes , We stayed at the Holiday Inn during a weekend trip to London to attend Afropunk Music Festival It was conveniently located for an easy trip to the venue It was also an easy walk to Brick Lane for a lively community feel It was also incredibly reasonably priced for a London hotel 
196843,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Overall this is a good hotel but food in the restaurant is limited and the check in process was slow especially after a long days work still wouldn t put me off staying here again though , Nice room
196844,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, The area around the hotel is a bit shady , The staff were very friendly the hotel and room was lovely and modern and there were more facilities than I expected 
196845,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, A bit far away from the city center Shoreditch within walking distance 15 mns , Normal Holiday Inn standard good staff Ideal if leaving from London City Airport take the DLR from Shadwell a 10 minutes walk 
196846,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, couldn t get a twin room and the double bed was not really good for me and my mom it was the smallest double bed I ve slept in As a couple I guess if you cuddle it s fine , The hotel is new modern and with large rooms It also looked very clean good bathroom and shower quiet great value for London Location might seem bad cause it s not a rich area but Shadwell station is actually 5 minutes away and gets you to central London very easily Personally I had no trouble walking even alone at night and one time I walked from Whitechapel station which is a bit further away 
196847,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, The location is a bit far from central London which is where most of the tourist attractions are We used Uber and it was very easy but we did waste a bit of time because of the location , Staff was very friendly and helpful I give them top marks for sure There were a couple of minor issues with the room which were attended to very quickly The breakfast buffet was excellent with a lot of variety I would stay here again absolutely 
196848,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Staff were helpful in booking us a taxi with the company they use to get to the station at a fixed price of 8 Although the meter showed 8 the driver insisted the cost was 10 Not a big deal but was disappointing for a partner company to let the Holiday inn down I paid the 10 but no tips Will definitely stay there next time but will get a black cab which cost us 5 on the way in , Staff friendly and extremely helpful Went out of their way to assist us in every way Great asset to the company
196849,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel,No Negative, The room was light comfortable with air conditioning making the temperature more than comfortable The room was immaculately clean The staff were polite and friendly and very accommodating a very nice stay
196850,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel,No Negative, We arrived just after the restaurant closed but the chef went back to the kitchen and made us up some food The reception and bar staff were so friendly and helpful 
196851,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, I thought the price of 204 for a twin room rather steep but I guess that s what you expect in London , Certain tubes were not running near the hotel so getting there was confusing The hotel is modern friendly clean and the food is good The surrounding area is unsuitable for exploring by foot not because of the safety issue but lack of shops and eateries and places of interest 
196852,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Being too close to the noise of the lift, Bed was really comfy tea and coffee was really welcoming if there was one negative it was being too close to the lift as we could hear it going up and down and doors opening and shutting but would stay here again
196853,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Location wasn t the best the photo of westminster bridge was more than a little mis leading suggest people use street view first before choosing this hotel,No Positive
196854,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, I am an IHG Platinum Elite level member so usually get upgraded although I hasten to add I don t expect it it s a nice touch for my loyalty On this occasion I was told they were fully booked and that they couldn t do that however they would send a bottle of wine to the room No big deal and I proceeded to my room which was okay At dinner which is next to reception I overheard several guests being told that as Platinum members they were being upgraded Did I not get the upgrade as I d booked through Booking com Dinner Menu is not exhaustive so I ordered chicken and chips 13 95 I think When this arrived it was chicken thighs and a bowl of fries No mention of this on the menu and certainly not good VFM IMHO Still feeling hungry I ordered a dessert and was told my first choice was not available I was slight annoyed as it was only 7 30 in the evening and there were only THREE people in the restaurant I jokingly asked if I d missed the coach party which I think my attempt at british humour went over the waiter s head somewhat When my second choice dessert arrived creme brulee the brulee was just runny sugar syrup so I questioned this and was told that the chef did not have a blow torch Really 133 room hotel in a Central London hotel At this point I left Unfortunately this is not the first time I have experienced this at this particular hotel restaurant having previously being told they did not have any steak Again dining in the restaurant early 7pm with only a handful of diners present On that occasion I had to settle for a burger On leaving the restaurant I went to the bar and ordered a drink As I was paying the waiter from the restaurant kindly gave me this on the house again a good gesture However I could not believe that the half bottle of wine that I had not drank at the table was then placed behind the bar , Great Location for an event I was attending at Tobacco Dock 
196855,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Staff swiped my card for payment without my consent prior to my checkout dates Hotel is far from city and staff misguided on the location and proximity to city to travel with luggage Unsafe area post sunset , Rooms were clean
196856,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Meals in house are awful and terribly over priced 2x curry out of a packet 45 Restaurant was always empty Toilet did not flush properly Shower was of primitive construction for this level of accommodation Slow wi fi Noisy and disturbed night rest because of close proximity of other rooms Airco clicked loudly when thermostat adjusted room temperature Nearest tube train is a good distance and the taxi service provided by the hotel is twice as expensive as the local service , Very friendly and helpful staff Hotel is very clean and welcoming Breakfast was really delicious Free newspapers etc Starbucks coffee in house Interesting part of London 
196857,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, I stayed with my partner for 1 night and it wasnt great when house keeping knocked at half 8 and woke us up by opening the door when we didnt check out untill 12 , Staff were very friendly rooms were very clean and tidy and spacious 
196858,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, When we were checking in it was obvious that the person on the desk was not familiar with the check in process We had been delayed for over an hour on our journey and the last thing we needed was to spend half an hour checking in The room we were allocated room 211 was very noisy My wife and I were woken on three occasions during the night by noise from the hotel plumbing We had very little sleep all night , We had an issue with the room we were allocated We raised this issue with the staff and we were moved to a different room The attitude of the staff who dealt with our complaint was very good 
196859,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Location is the only drawback of this Hotel It is a bit out of Center and takes some 5 10 min to get to the Metrostation Whitchapel There is not much to do right outside the Hotel But in 10 15 min walk towards London Bridge one might already find some nice pubs In the night we prefered to get back to the Hotel on Uber , Wonderfull hotel clean and new Rooms spacious and comfirtable 
196860,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, No pancake to breakfast while the restaurant put up this menu on table My son s morning wasn t good , Personal is perfect everyone have really servicemind 
196861,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, More TV channels would have been nice and a better range of toiletries too I d have like to have able to open the window for some natural air , Lovely staff especially Lola who works in the restaurant she has good banter 
196862,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, There is one point the hotel obviously has no influence on right now I was misled by the name and thought the hotel is close to the Whitechapel tube station it isn t and the walk took me around 15 minutes and I didn t feel very safe due to lots of the minorities living in this part of the city However it is still quite close to Aldgate and the whole business area , very friendly stuff big and clean rooms and bathrooms well equipped even with the iron wonderful breakfasts including milk shakes and pancakes
196863,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel,No Negative, Clean comfortable spacious room very friendly hotel staff very nice breakfast buffet with good choice for everyone s taste I especially liked the pancakes The hotel is also a good base for exploring London with the Shadwell station nearby Trams to Banks or Tower Gateway every couple of minutes from where you have multiple connections with the London Underground 
196864,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Hotel is located in an area that is somewhat run down and not necessarily breathes the atmosphere of a friendly environment , Good modern hotel with a high standard and high comfort level Pleasant helpfull staff Excellent breakfast 
196865,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, The area wasn t good We went to a show one of the evenings It was a very dark walk back to the hotel from the train station didn t feel safe If staying here I d recommend you get a taxi, It was very comfortable and staff were very friendly
196866,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, The area is a little bit dirty difficult operation of air conditioner lack of organized storage to put the clothes out from the suitcase lack of place for suitcases or bag lotion was missing from the bathroom daily , The location close to public transport and walking distance from Tower of London 24 hour working grocery stores in the area 
196867,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Trying to find parking nearby was horrendous , Staff were very pleasant and would always go out of there way to ensure I was happy The room was lovely clean and spacious Bed was SUPER comfy too Breakfast was superb they even had a machine that made pancakes for you 
196868,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Breakfast was alright but the sausages were of poor quality , Decent location about 1 km walking distance from Whitechapel station Facilities were good but air circulation in the room had to be manually relegated everytime we reentered the room Friendly accommodating staff Overall well worth the price during our Easter stay 
196869,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Nothing Perfect stay , Really lovely breakfast with unusual choice of fresh juices Cater really well for vegetarians just asked for veggie sausages and they were particular great not quorn Worth the money lovely friendly staff Upgraded to an executive room that was simply stunning both in decor and size 
196870,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Wasn t asked if I wanted house cleaning and had to leave the do not disturb door hanger on so they wouldn t , Staff were awesome namely Dennis our bar tender He took extra time during and after his shift to make sure we were happy Perri was super friendly and a joy to be around 
196871,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, breakfast could be better eg better coffee, rooms are very tidy and spacious this hotel is really good price quality It s a 5 min walk to the DLR and there are some good restaurants in walking distance you just need to find them 
196872,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Nothing , The location is very good You can get to underground stations by ten minutes walking You can reach city centre in 20 minutes at all Bus stop in front of the hotel 
196873,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel,No Negative, The staff are very friendly efficient and kind The breakfast is good The sweet potato fries in the bar were excellent We have no criticisms to make everything works its clean and comfortable the staff are well trained and it runs like clockwork 
196874,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, All good, Really immaculate comfortable hotel in the middle of quite a run down area but it didn t feel threatening to walk back to the hotel late at night the area this hotel is in shows you a different side to London which we really embraced 
196875,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, The Wifi was rather poor and would not connect properly didn t bother the staff about it as was only staying two nights , Overall the hotel was great would stay again for sure
196876,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, The shower head was hard to position where we wanted it so it remained high or it would flop over This could be easily fixed by the maintenance people though , The swipe access card to access the room worked instantaneously every time The lock system was more responsive than most places we stay so we were very impressed to not have to stuff around with the swipe access The breakfast had a good variety The room was nice and quiet The heating system worked super quietly and very efficiently There were many transport options and we even used the bike hire that was directly across the road It was within walking distance of many restaurants and pubs We had a great stay 
196877,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Location is middle of no where Booking com said it was 0 5mi from the shard which is why I booked Turned out to be an hour and half walk or an hour car journey due to traffic The local tube was enough to make anyone not want to travel by tube again Hotel prices are ridiculously expensive for the facilities and location If this was more centre London then fair enough but it isn t and made the whole weekend trip more expensive than it needed to be I can t see why there would be any other reason to stay at this hotel , Clean hotel nothing else 
196878,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, The bagel could have been better and the black pudding was dried out, Comfortable bed pillows and hot shower with good pressure also the complimentary upgrade All the staff were friendly helpful and professional 
196879,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Pillows were too firm and high Asked for a softer pillow but they were exactly the same Still slept fine, Great shower and quiet room on 1st floor Nice ambiance in the lobby with comfortable seating and newspapers magazines and internet access Staff were lovely Bus stop right at hotel and Shadwell DLR 3 min walk 
196880,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Evening Meal Menu has a small selection which can be tedious if on a long stay , The standardisation of Holiday Inn means you get exactly what you expect regardless of where you may be This standard is high and doesn t disappoint The staff are friendly and always willing to help 
196881,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Breakfast may be a bit heavy but that s British cuisine , Staff was extra helpful Rooms very quiet Lots of good cafes and restaurants nearby DLR is few minutes away and bus station is right across the street ExCeL 20 minutes Trafalgar 30 35 minutes on bus 
196882,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, The kettle was to high made it very dangerous for making a hot drink from my wheelchair The tv stand was in front of the curtains meaning I couldn t close them properly, Very comfortable bed and attentive staff
196883,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel,No Negative, Exceeded all expectations quite the pleasant surprise The room was much larger than we thought it would be with an equally good sized bathroom Service at reception and in the restaurant the following morning was excellent We contacted reception shortly after arrival to request a taxi to be arranged for the evening we were booked with their linked taxi company who were excellent 
196884,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Located in not a very nice area of London and the tube station is a fair walk You have to use taxis really , Had a good stay a quiet nights sleep the Staff were helpful ordered me a taxi and were informative
196885,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, a man who checked us in talked diffinitely too much too quick i coudnt understand what he is saying not english accent we were tired it was quite late we just wanted to get the card keys and go to room but he kept talking for ages but i must say i had totally perfect stay , clean cozy good sized room with comfy bed we enjoyed our stay a lot
196886,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, The location could have been a little better however the breakfast places nearby were amazing, The professionalism of the room and the amazing view that we had really met the expectation 
196887,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Cleaning of rooms the following morning the bedsheets still had marks on them from the night before and were not changed Didn t make an issue of the situation because we were tired and didn t have the energy to do so They should ve done a better job , The hotel it s self was good the staff were friendly and helpful Room service was good and quick 
196888,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel,No Negative, We were there just for a night Because i mentioned while booking that it was our anniversary night they upgraded my room and also did some minor arrangements to make our day special Really appreciate that 
196889,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Could have included herbal teas in the room Other than that couldn t fault it , Bed was comfy Room clean Quiet at night Room service was good as was the food and service in the restaurant Staff more than happy to help you 
196890,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Not a complaint because they could not have know but the kettle was faulty it was turned off but was turned on all night could have been nasty if it had caught fire , Very clean room well presented beds were very comfy excellent experience
196891,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, The different pillows were a great idea but all of them were still much too firm Fire alarm went off in the morning which wasn t ideal, The actual bed was really comfy and the room Was spacious and clean
196892,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, There was a very loud noise coming from the vent every night it was hard to sleep would be perfect if that was sorted Also fire alarm kept going off which was annoying ,No Positive
196893,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, The air con air vent above the hallway of the room 301 was rattling as if there was a screw loose all night and because very vigorous waking us up multiple times , Bed was extremely comfy 
196894,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Location especially if you re walking from the Shadwick DLR in the dark seems a bit dodgy Hotel itself is great and I m guessing that things are safe but the streets were quite dirty , Great room good size Very nice bathroom quite clean There s a great Turkish restaurant Efe s just up the block 
196895,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Cannot think of anything, In 40 years of staying in London mainly for business reason the is the BEST London hotel I have ever stayed in Especially liked the touch of complementary toiletries if one had forgot them i e tooth brush 
196896,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, parking is an issue it was a concern when we left the car in a side street which l moved later that night , a very large bed and very good service breakfast was very good l would recommend 
196897,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, We couldn t check in till after 2 which is understandable but was frustrating , Great location best hotel stay ever room was beautiful and comfortable breakfast was brilliant so much choice available we didn t want to leave
196898,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, They had overbooked for our first night of two and thus sent us to a Holiday Inn Express down the road which was in stark contrast to what I paid for and then brought us back the next day I am still trying to get a partial refund for this lack of service I paid for and will update this if they do convene , All the staff were very friendly and the hotel has any nice amenities 
196899,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Receptionist had to sort out a double room although already booked previously Then had two single beds pushed together air con wasn t working correctly wouldn t warm the room up No instructions on how to use electrical products within room Only one lift working Signal reception for television was very poor , Shower was nice
196900,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, For the price and location it was relatively good but the breakfast was a major disappointment I usually prioritise that over any other facility I wish Booking com would include a breakfast rating by which to filter hotels too The breakfast was quite basic Two juice options and neither was fresh One type of eggs fried along with the other standard breakfast options tea coffee baked beans hash brown sausages and a poor selection of processed cheese , The staff at the hotel were very friendly and accommodating I arrived very early for check in and was in a hurry to drop off my luggage to join a workshop The staff at the reception made it a quick 3 minute process 
196901,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Room service was poor The food took over an hour to arrive and the order was wrong with some items requested as per the menu were not provided and it was cold when eventually arrived and dried out I complained immediately and the food and the rest of the order glass of wine and dessert were not charged But that didn t help with not having a main meal, the service in the restaurant at breakfast was excellent 
196902,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Everything good for us , We enjoyed the pleasant staff and convenience of the hotel for our needs It was very clean and up to date We didn t eat at the hotel this time but maybe next time we visit 
196903,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Cleaning staff knocked on our door numerous times early in the morning Very frustrating as checkout wasn t until 12 Complained at checkout and staff were very apologetic about this At check in you have to pay a 20 fee in case you want to order anything or use the minibar which we were not planning on doing , Room was nice with a comfy bed and very quiet so was able to get a good night sleep Complimentary toiletries and bath robes were a nice touch 
196904,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, I hate hotel pillows lol never like your own but no complaints really, Lovely breakfast we paid for Came for a gig at the troxy location was perfect and hotel immaculate
196905,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, If I was to try and find an issue it would be there was not a closer tube station although Whitechapel is only a 5 minute walk , Everything about the property was spot on couldn t fault it 
196906,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Air con was a little noisy but one call to reception next morning fixed it , The staff were attentive and friendly The room was comfortable The breakfast had a wide range to suit all and the cooked brekkie was amazing The decor throughout looked new and the place was spotlessly clean With the bus stop across the road and the underground a 5 min walk away was ideal to go places as a tourist 
196907,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, The room was a disabled toilet needed a bath after driving over 8 hours on the road Had to upgrade to get a room with bath which was 15 In end the room was terrible and bed uncomfortable for me plus shower was not working properly Did not get a good night sleep But last time stayed the other room I had was much h better I think 303 fantastic, Woman on that night shift was great tryied to help as much as she could Indian guy helpful Gut with glasses not very helpful
196908,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, The area the hotel is in is absolutely horrendous Stay away if you travel alone and plan to be out after dark , The hotel is clean great staff Had a really nice stay food in the restaurant is really good
196909,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Expensive breakfast not so great neighborhood especial when it s dark 10 15 min walk from the tube , Tasty breakfast spacious quiet luminous room comfy bed and pillows coffee machine in the room helpful personnel and 5 walk from DLR train
196910,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, I like to be provided with bath robes and slippers when I travel Was told when I asked via email that these were only provided in the executive rooms and would I like to upgrade for an extra 42 per night for an executive room I was expecting a slightly different answer It didn t matter as I packed accordingly but in other hotels these would be provided on request , Breakfast was good Everything was freshly made 
196911,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Not an ideal area of London , Staff were absolutely brilliant Room was exceptionally clean and comfortable and food was superb Lovely hotel and well worth the price 
196912,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel,No Negative, The bed was enormous shower was lovely the room was unbelievably quiet considering the hotel is on a busy London road Food was tasty and staff were helpful Can t fault it 
196913,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel,No Negative, I was amazed firstly at the decor and size of the room I got for a what is seemed to be a budget hotel The standard double was amazing The staff were all friendly and very helpful I will definitely be booking this hotel again 
196914,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Wireless never connected on my mobile but ok on laptop Geographical position is not best close to a big hospital on a high traffic road The closest tube is 10 minutes walk it takes about 30 minutes walk to go to the City There is not much to do around in the evening , The room was nice the personnel was friendly and the room noise isolation is quite good luckily due to negative aspects of geographical position Breakfast has good different choices to satisfy everyone 
196915,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, I booked well in advance paid in full However I was quite annoyed when I tried to cancel my booking which was still several weeks away due to unforeseen circumstances I was advised that I would still be charged the full fee and would not be able to get any refund at all They need to review their cancellation policy, Did not use their restaurant facilities as they did not cater for Halaal Muslim meals 
196916,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, No complaints , The hotel as a whole is a pleasant surprise for us The rooms and building is clean and bright 5 star hotel level or even more The staff are always ready to help with patience in a sincere way super We booked the hotel before reviewing the comments Was a bit worried after reading some comments on the location and safety concerns We did not do public transportation came back late in the evening sometimes We feel secured and comfortable with the area where the hotel locates 
196917,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, The AC in our room wasn t very cooperative also it was absolutely freezing in the breakfast area Just something to look into in the future , The staff was very polite and helpful the hotel was clean the room was beautiful and comfy The location is not excellent however the tower is within walking distance and the bus tube stations are near Also the breakfast was quite amazing 
196918,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Hopeless bar and restaurant service Must be losing a fortune on drinks sales, Spacious lobby and restaurant area Helpful competent reception staff Nice room good self service breakfast
196919,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, My only criticism was we had 4 little pots of milk and used them on arrival meaning not enough for morning tea I know its personal taste but we both like to add 2 small pots of milk to a coffee which left none for the morning, We loved the big comfy bed
196920,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, The bed was a little bit too hard as a twin room we could have done with an extra hand towel and plug sockets next to each bed but otherwise the hotel itself was fab The location was a bit dirty and grubby and whilst fine to walk through during the day we didn t feel it would be safe in the evening to walk to the tube so got a taxi back, The hotel was lovely and clean The staff friendly and helpful the breakfast was plentiful and tasty and the room was very comfortable
196921,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, This is no reflection on the hotel and only matters if you use a pram beware that there is no onsite parking and no lift on the overground station , Comfy beds Clean hotel Great transport links if you don t use a pram DLR and overground all within a 5 10 minute walk Breakfast was great I would definitely stay there again 
196922,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel,No Negative, the stuff are very helpful which is impressive for example I would like to go somewhere she search how to get there and print it out which is very helpful when I asked someone for direction
196923,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, The only negative comment I would make is that the bar service in the evening could have been better only one person doing all , The locality was excellent for us as we were attending a family funeral Did not spend much time in the hotel but when we did everything was grand 
196924,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel,No Negative, We had a brilliant stay The staff in particular reception where fantastic the hotel is lovely very clean very relaxing would definately go back and recommend to friends Rooms great and breakfast excellent I had a small issue with my dinner it wasn t what I had expected and the issue was resolved immediately with no trouble at all 
196925,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, The location of the hotel is in a REALLY not safe area though it is 5 minutes walk to a metro station but STRONGLY recommend people not to take the hotel since you can get a way better location and way better hotel with the same price I was staying in park plaza riverbank with EXACTLY same price in the first two nights but way nicer area and location also way better rooms and services Unfortunately they didn t have the other nights available since i booked too late The receptionist who checked us in had the worst attitude ever They locked our luggage and suitcases in the room the second night since our credit card didn t work out and they refused to take our dollars as deposit when we went back to hotel at 11pm No upfront notice via phone number or email we left at the check in form They insisted that we shall either go to the ATM at 11pm at the not safe area or we shall try to make the credit card work An upfront mail about this during the day would be nice VERY UNPLEASANT STAY AND NOT GONNA STAY THERE ANY MORE NOT RECOMMENDING OTHERS EITHER Actually this worst stay ever even got us really bad impression on Holiday Inn brand it was the first time in Holiday Inn and the last time will NOT stay in Holiday Inn brand hotels any more , The receptionists except one particular bad attitude girl are pretty nice 
196926,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel,No Negative, Great location for central London no picturesque view but that wasn t on our list of requirements For service comfort cleanliness fresh food at breakfast it s perfect and despite the central location peaceful too The air conditioning in the room was also a welcome bonus 
196927,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Last year the hotel allowed us to keep bikes in our rooms and laid on an early breakfast as we were participating in the Ride London 100 I assumed wrongly that their polcy remained the same However despite Holiday Inns allowing bikes in rooms in other locations this one forbade it Their offer to make up for the lack of early breakfast was quite frankly disappointing They could have laid out cereal and fruit Instead they provided a ham and cheese sandwich on plastic white bread and an apple I will not be going back ,No Positive
196928,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Website said parking there wasn t only on street on yellow lines I was with disabled mother disabled rooms only have double beds we wanted twin so then had shower with step to get in, Clean staff friendly rooms comfortable
196929,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Just the area but I was going to the o2 so what choice did I have, The staff were so good and helpful friendly I know it was east end of London not the most pictures but when you were in the hotel you could have been anywere the staff were great
196930,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, The taxi we ordered from the hotel was late try a more reliable service provider Not the hotels fault but an alternative taxi company would have been better , Checked out on hottest day of the year the hotel stored our bags until late afternoon and when we returned after a very hot and sticky day they gave us the use of a room for free to have a shower and change wonderful Staff were so eager to go the extra mile
196931,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel,No Negative, Very impressed I have stayed in a variety of high class hotels all over the world I booked this hotel on convenience of location not buy name or reputation and can only highly recommend excellent hotel and staff
196932,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel,No Negative, The staff were very helpful and really friendly I loved my room It was really spacious and all the amenities were really good I will definitely stay here again It was great value for money 
196933,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel,No Negative, Bed was huge Ordered from the bar menu it was tasty and arrived quickly Room was excellent Check in was smooth with the staff being very helpful 
196934,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel,No Negative, Friendly staff and good value for an east end location close to the DLR and within easy reach of central London Great range of restaurants on Brick Lane also within easy walking distance 
196935,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, The selling point for breakfast was the make your own pancakes all over the literature yet the pancake machine was not working , room was bigger than expected cost of breakfast was refunded see dislike
196936,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, We ordered seafood paella in the restaurant when it came it had other unidentified meat in it as my sister and I only eat seafood I enquired what it was and why it wasn t stated on the menu I was given no apology just asked to pick something else It should have been stated on the menu but even then mistakes happen but an apology would have been nice , The room was clean reception staff friendly 
196937,Holiday Inn London Whitechapel, Whereas the time for breakfast ends at 9 30 am on the dot employees should not take the food without telling people who are already in the restaurant Alternatively we suggest you do not accept anyone else after 9 00 am so that they can have at least 30 minutes to eat , The lady at the reception was very friendly and professional
