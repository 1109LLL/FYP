327680,City Hotel Deutschmeister, Stuff was not pleasant and we felt uncomfortable due to this For example I asked to buy beer in a bar on a first floor and the guy said Do not you have a bar inside your room or ordered parking place that was not confirmed And the guy said that it is not confirmed next time I would have to get it confirmed but ok I m lucky and there is a free space As a result we were alone in a parking but felt that we were not so good for it after that And they do not know what is electric kettle , Chose only because of parking place 
327681,City Hotel Deutschmeister, The weather was in the 30s and the room was stiflingly hot especially at night and there was no air conditioning , We had a very large studio room which had a queen sized bed dining table chairs a sofa armchair coffee table There was a small well equipped kitchen and a huge bathroom The hotel was in a very convenient location only minutes from the underground transport and a great selection of bars and restaurants 
327682,City Hotel Deutschmeister,No Negative, The breakfast buffet is great The hotel is minutes from a subway station and a major tram line it s also an easy walking distance from the Ringstrasse and tourist attractions in the center of Vienna 
327683,City Hotel Deutschmeister, A ventilation fan kept pumping cigarette smoke into my room from somewhere else in the hotel I hope that this is a rare problem , Nice breakfast good location just a couple minutes from U4 Ro auer L nde and Donaukanal comfortable room 
327684,City Hotel Deutschmeister, Cleaning in the mornings were too noisy and it interrupted my sleep very nasty , Extremely friendly and helpful staff Great location but a bit more expensive than what it should be For the same price you can stay in Sofia in Hilton or in Radisson in the very center 
327685,City Hotel Deutschmeister, The lifts are very small 3 people max and it s sometimes quicker to use the stairs Air conditioning unit in the room had no controller so had to be operated manually which is ok if you are familiar with it , Good location and close to restaurants and bars Short walk to the centre and all the sights Hotel was on a quiet street and a two minute walk to a U4 underground station 
327686,City Hotel Deutschmeister, I really enjoyed the hotel but if you are needing to do laundry be advised they do have a service but the charge will be by piece instead of a load , The location of the hotel so close to the U4 Rossauer Lande stop and all the cafes there along the canal made this a wonderful stay It is a perfect point for using a 72 hour public transportation ticket and exploring Vienna I had an 8th floor room that had a slant opening window that was great to cool the room instead of using the AC The bed is very soft and comfortable and the room itself has enough space The shower has great water pressure and plenty of hot water However the shower is a space saving square meter type like a glass round cylinder when cured doors are closed and it does take a moment to get used to The hotel staff was very friendly and very helpful and made my stay a great one The free breakfast was a very good spread of food and its not often that you get such in Vienna these days Should you miss it there is a Backeri a block down the street towards the church 
327687,City Hotel Deutschmeister,No Negative, The hotel is 3 minutes walk to the underground from where you can easily go all over Vienna The hotel was very comfortable and we had a 1 bedroom apartment The staff were helpful and friendly 
327688,City Hotel Deutschmeister, Wi fi is bad Towels could have been changed in every two days Extra blanket is needed , So close to u bahn Heating is great Hospitality is great they were very helpful Large room Kitchen is great 
327689,City Hotel Deutschmeister, cuscini pillows non buoni not good at all serve una macchinetta per espresso o capuccino per la prima collazione need to have a good Italian coffee in a good hotel , hotel tranquillo
327690,City Hotel Deutschmeister, Not stable internet connection, We stayed in one of the hotel s apartments Very good kitchen facilities 2 Minutes walk from underground station U4 line Ro auer L nde station great and quiet neighborhood but still close to center Coffee shops and large supermarket just 2 blocks away 
327691,City Hotel Deutschmeister, Dead slow WiFi unusable Unfriendly waiters at breakfast buffet, Comfortable single mattress double bed Spacious room Really nice reception staff Awesome location in Vienna s 9th district
327692,City Hotel Deutschmeister, Breakfast selection could have been better for British guests geared for European tastes After 5 days a bit repetitive A toaster would have been good , Rooms facilities excellent and staff very friendly and helpful Although hotel 15min walk to Hop on Hop off buses it was only 200m from underground 
327693,City Hotel Deutschmeister,No Negative, Our accommodation was very spacious warm and beautifully furnished We would love to return to Vienna and would definitely revisit the City Hotel Deutchmeister 
327694,City Hotel Deutschmeister, No option for food or snacks after breakfast Breakfast doesn t change even after 4 days , Free breakfast with decent selection Quiet room Quiet neighbourhood One block away from an U bahn station 
327695,City Hotel Deutschmeister, THe internet is very slow the beds in the studio were not one big bed but two separate and thus uncofortable for a couple, The location is superb U bahn station at 50m walking distance to the ring Votive kirche Rathaus 
327696,City Hotel Deutschmeister, Overpriced staff weren t very friendly or helpful, 24 hr check in for late arrivals Close to the metro beds were very clean and comfortable A tasty breakfast was served daily The rooms had a nice modern look
327697,City Hotel Deutschmeister, Free Wi Fi was bad also the morning breakfast could be better The construction works were starting at 07 00 AM that was bad , The room was very good clean comfort and it also had a stereo for good music
327698,City Hotel Deutschmeister, Staff was not always very friendly I was expecting a better breakfast Forget to skype with this wifi , Good location very close to subway Staff was helpful 
327699,City Hotel Deutschmeister, Breakfast was nothing special and they served some low quality packed food Pillows and matrasses not confortable , The area is calm and close to metro station Rooms are clean despite some old material 
327700,City Hotel Deutschmeister, I ordered a taxi through the hotel to the airport At 7 am it took 20 minutes and I was charged 44 Euro which is an exorbitant price by any standard and the hotel management should stop engaging this company ,No Positive
327701,City Hotel Deutschmeister, i took my own iron with me on trip and the cleaning lady took it leaving a message on the bed that it is hotel policy I understand that it is hotel policy not to allow such devices in the room but still it felt unappropriate for someone to take something from the room, location breakfast staff room
327702,City Hotel Deutschmeister, wifi but i think it was a problem exactly at the day of our stay Breakfast was slightly lower than a 4star hotel s level, Clean and tidy Good staff
327703,City Hotel Deutschmeister,No Negative, Good location close to the fantastic underground train system The staff at the Reception desk were very helpful and recommended the value for money 3 day travel pass Use the hotel parking much cheaper than the ticket you ll definitely get if you park on the street 
327704,City Hotel Deutschmeister, Australian Star rating on hotel must be different from the one in France Below the expectation No air con in 4 star hotel, Good location for money Close to the subway
327705,City Hotel Deutschmeister, As I am on a gluten free and vegan diet I didn t have many options I also prefer to have dinner at a hotel, As I am vegan and on a gluten free diet I didn t have many options For those not following any rest
327706,City Hotel Deutschmeister, There was some building work going on which meant the stairwell was a bit dusty and there was some scaffolding around the windows The hot water in the bathroom took some time to come through , I had a lovely roomy apartment that was very comfortable The local area was delightful it felt like a proper neighbourhood but not far from the city centre The desk staff were lovely 
327707,City Hotel Deutschmeister, I stayed on the top floor straight under the roof Using airconditioning which was really poor and at times noisy due to fan hitting the body required renting a remote from the reception and was additionally charged I had to use it because the room got hot in the day through the roof probably not an issue on lower floors Bed was just fine mattress too soft and pillow stuffing clumped up , Reception staff very nice and breakfast excellent Room of good size Very close to city centre and to metro station Internet worked ok slower in evenings but definitely manageable 
327708,City Hotel Deutschmeister, You pay extra for air conditioning How does that make sense for a 4 star hotel Definitely not worth the money The location is good but you can find cheaper better deals Nothing else was particularly impressive small garden plain breakfast small rooms etc , Close to U bahn nothing else 
327709,City Hotel Deutschmeister, Unfortunatelly our room was very noisy making it difficult to sleep in the morning Also we had great weather but that lead to a really high temperature in the room since there was no air conditioning Not such a great problem for us but it might be unconfortable for others , The hotel is centraly located it only takes 15 20 minutes to reach the city center by foot The subway station is also conveniently located near the property The room was big enough clean and the breakfast offer good enough You can enjoy your coffee and meal in the inner courtyard a great start for the day The staff was friendly and helpfull 
327710,City Hotel Deutschmeister, The hotel charged 0 70 euros for each pod of coffee A couple of complimentary ones each day would have been nice You have to read the two sheets of apartment information to find this out Please note that there is some construction near the hotel It did not interfere with our stay but if you want to sleep during the day you should find out if the construction has been completed , The apartment was HUGE and we were able to use the kitchen when we did not want to eat out The subway was two blocks away at the most If you like to walk you could easily find yourself walking to the Old Town and main sites 
327711,City Hotel Deutschmeister, I booked a double room but the bed was two singles pushed together which moved independently and were therefore uncomfortable Also no additional pillows The room has an air conditioner but there are no controls so it doesn t work The lifts are tiny and can only take 3 people with no luggage The reception staff were not particularly friendly The exterior photos on the website are misleading The hotel is behind the building shown in the photo and when we were there this building was covered in scaffolding and we were disturbed by building noise , The furnishings and facilities in the room were very good and the shower room excellent Breakfast was also excellent with a wide choice of food and plenty of it The hotel is a very short walk from Rossauer Lande Metro station and a 10 minute walk from the trams at Schottenring 
327712,City Hotel Deutschmeister, The parking place s to small 5cars they have also a Bigger parking garage but there you supose to have an S U V or a car with with high clearance Other way you reman stock Break Fast s Very Poor Only eggs and some prosciuto and yellow cheese every day They have also vegetables and sweets , The location of the hotel s perfect FOR visiting the city YOU have near the metro station But also you can walk to the actractions Around 20 min to walk

327717,City Hotel Deutschmeister, I asked for late check out and it was confirmed there is no charge for it On the day of departure staff said that I have to pay for a late check out Had to insist and after 30 minutes they found that they agreed for free of charge late check out , Great location very nice hotel 
327718,City Hotel Deutschmeister, There was an espresso machine in the room and we used it At the end of our stay we were asked how often and we had to pay 70cents per cup It had not mentioned prices and we took it to be part of price for the room The breakfast remained the same for the whole week No variation , Spacious room and good location 
327719,City Hotel Deutschmeister, Rooms are old and not really done up Room service was not good Beds were too soft and creaky Room heater was not working properly specially in the bedroom , Location was excellent Very near to city center Value for money in terms of location

327721,City Hotel Deutschmeister,No Negative, The staff was lovely The apartment suite was well equipped clean but a little on the dowdy side everything worked though And the espresso machine was awesome made perfect lattes The location though was what would convince me to return We could walk to the center which we did although it was a hike take a tram or subway all convenient and the we found the local pubs restaurants and shops were great

327723,City Hotel Deutschmeister,No Negative, We arrived at the hotel at 9 00 in the morning We got the room immediately despite the entry should be at 13 00 pm The room we got was at street level We asked if they could give us an alternative room on a higher floor We received an upgraded large room on the third floor The hotel is really close to the train station U4 line There is also a supermarket nearby and a nice cafe The place is quiet and pleasant The people at reception were nice and courteous 
327724,City Hotel Deutschmeister, Car cost per night expensive considering it s a garage some 600m away, Very large apartment Great breakfast Car is locked away in a secure garage 600m away

327726,City Hotel Deutschmeister, Unfriendly and unprofessional staff Sloe internet connection Smelly room No value for the money paid , The location is ok if you want to be close to the messe center and not too far away from the inner city The tube is just around the corner Breakfast quite good

327729,City Hotel Deutschmeister, There is no air conditioning or opening windows for ventilation we stayed during heat wave and had to cut short the trip as to the hotel not being suitable to actually stay in under those circumstances Guess what they just want to take you re money then do nothing the manager says he has no power to do anything as the hotel owner is currently watching his bad performance, This is not a 4 star hotel it s more like 2 star
