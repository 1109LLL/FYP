449454,Derag Livinghotel Kaiser Franz Joseph Vienna, I had to complain 3 times I did not have any kitchen equipment in the kitchen The fourth time I was told it was in an upper cupboard which was very difficult to reach and I am of average height The promised to send someone up but during the seven night I was there he never came Also when I came back at 14 30 for a rest the room was not yet made up so every day I had to ask to do it befoe 13 00 If I forgot to ask it was bot done , Nice bathroomand balcony
449455,Derag Livinghotel Kaiser Franz Joseph Vienna, The room and especially the bathroom is very small it s ok for a night only The windows open in neighbors balconies so you are seen from several floors and also hear people coughing sneezing talking because their balconies are a max of two meters away from you Lacks style There are better and more central places for this price ,No Positive
449456,Derag Livinghotel Kaiser Franz Joseph Vienna, The beds were a little too much on the hard side but very good covers and pillows , Excellent place to work from while at meetings in Vienna Large fridge and possibilities to simple cooking Great work space in the room Well placed options to recharge your devices etc Quiet super market close by tram close by made it easy to get around 
449457,Derag Livinghotel Kaiser Franz Joseph Vienna, Too hot and a few ants in the kitchen just one night , 2 supermarkets just beside the hotel bus and train stations just beside hotel good breakfast nice staff large rooms and small kitchen I most probably return

449459,Derag Livinghotel Kaiser Franz Joseph Vienna, Far from city but nice for people who enjoy a quiet area you can take the cable car if you would like to leave your car at the Hotel Charged extra for my dog Sauna opened after 5pm 10pm , Breakfast was great Room was an okay size but unfortunately a little outdated in design I have not gotten the nice modern room 
449460,Derag Livinghotel Kaiser Franz Joseph Vienna, I thought for no breakfast the price charged was too much THe garage is quite difficult to get in and out of the lay out is very cold and Eastern European with long corridors to drag one s luggage to, The bed was comfy
449461,Derag Livinghotel Kaiser Franz Joseph Vienna, Internet connection could be faster , The hotel is situated in the beautiful district D bling which is close to the vinyards and the famous Austrian wine bars The prices are very reasonable for Vienna and the luxury of the hotel The rooms are nice and clean and the beds are very comfortable The staff was very friendly and helpful It only takes 15 min by tram to the city centre We ll definitly come again 
449462,Derag Livinghotel Kaiser Franz Joseph Vienna, It is unter construction and very lout in the room during the day time It charges phone calls which did not get through Only because I TRIED to call , It offers a free mini bar including mineral water and beer It has a supermarket Spar Gourmet next to it It is next to the tram line 38 
449463,Derag Livinghotel Kaiser Franz Joseph Vienna, The noise made by our neighbours the room next to us was a little annoying The 2 rooms were connected by a locked door so you could hear pretty well different stuff , Comfortable bed Very kind and friendly staff they spoke several languages not just english The room was just perfect for resting after a full day of sightseeing visiting museums and christmas markets 
449464,Derag Livinghotel Kaiser Franz Joseph Vienna, A bit last century but they have starting renovation this year Looking forward to seeing the results, Great location very close to our points of interest Also the city center is easily accesible and the heurigers in Grinzing are just a few tram stops away The amenities are exactly as needed everything is neat clean functional well organized Always coming back with great pleasure to this hotel 
449465,Derag Livinghotel Kaiser Franz Joseph Vienna, Build above a supermarket Billa and a drugstore DM And at 7 AM they start to unload stuff and make an awful lot of noise So don t choose this hotel if you are looking for a lei in if the racket downstairs doesn t wake you the cleaners who turn up at 8 AM will ,No Positive
449466,Derag Livinghotel Kaiser Franz Joseph Vienna, The only complaint I have was the smoky bar but I didn t complain about it because I understand that smoking is still allowed in Austria in public places , Our daughter lives around the corner So the hotel was in a very convenient location Excellent for transport links Thoroughly enjoyed our stay 
449467,Derag Livinghotel Kaiser Franz Joseph Vienna, Some things went missing from my room after cleaning I complained to the front desk and they talked to the cleaners but didn t really resolve anything I ve stayed at 50 hotels and this is the first time someone steals from the room Ironic that it s at a 4 star hotel Not recommended , The room was ok overall but the hotel is far from the center
449468,Derag Livinghotel Kaiser Franz Joseph Vienna,No Negative, I loved the striking contrast between the old fashioned look of hotel s interiors and the modern design of the room Even though the hotel is not in the city center it was very easy to reach and at less than one minute walk from the bus station I will definitely come back for a next time 
449469,Derag Livinghotel Kaiser Franz Joseph Vienna, On the hotel site we have seen that exists parking places surprise no they aren t When we ask to reception were to park the car the response was everywhere in the district We find a place at 2 streets distance was not good for us after 9 hours of driving to look after a parking place in an unknown area We choose the hotel for the parking place that they said it s have it Outside were 2 celsius degrees and no heater in the room We tryed to call to reception about 11 30 in the evening and keep trying untill 1 a m nobody answer so I had to go to reception finally we received another room with heater The feeling was that the employe doesn t care about our problem , 
449470,Derag Livinghotel Kaiser Franz Joseph Vienna, There is no easy control of the room temperature You have to use the knob on a traditional heater Plus the hotel didn t make sure the heating was on in the room before we arrived , The room is very smart and super clean The neighbourhood is beautiful safe and quiet Even though the hotel is not in the city centre connectivity with the Vienna rail network is excellent The breakfast was superb 
449471,Derag Livinghotel Kaiser Franz Joseph Vienna, I think there should be more in the break fast more means some things can be added to the guests like us , it was my second visit I like the location the confort n more thing its very near to the city plus staff is coperative and one more thing you can change the currency as well 
449472,Derag Livinghotel Kaiser Franz Joseph Vienna, The bed mattrass was very soft and quite uncomfortable Pillow was also too soft Underground parking was good but door opening was not well coordinated , Very good breakfast Underground parking Good size room with cooking facility Quiet 
449473,Derag Livinghotel Kaiser Franz Joseph Vienna, for some reason the wi fi on the upper floor was quite weak while it was fine 2m downstairs the parking lot was also full so we had to look for place in the street but it was fine , Comfy 2 storey room with a kitchen and 2 bathrooms inside Hotel is close to tram stop and just next to two grocery shops We definitely enjoyed our 3 night stay Very good price for Wien 
449474,Derag Livinghotel Kaiser Franz Joseph Vienna, Hotel says no need to reserve parking at arrival a reception lady told us you can park in front of the Hotel Morning car was kept by police We waste lots of time and money 300 to take it back It ruined our travel When we asked for help reception boy answered I have lots of stuff to do After complaining and asking to see the manager finally we were lucky that reception lady said I give your money back by my own pocket No appology No compensation No reliefe And the money was not all the things we waisted in the 2 days staying in a hotel What about enjoing of the travel Time Stress and And this is a Hotel and Hotel apartment at the same place Double rooms are same as single rooms in size but with a double bed which made the room smaller Very tiny bathroom toilet and sink No mirror outside the toilet and no dressing no shaving nor makeup mirror Double rooms are renewed but you can see color droplets on the floor Very bad pillows no slippers and breakfast is not even close to 4stars hotels We will never stay back there Honestly there are lots of the better hotels with the same price or even cheaper in Vienna Do not waste your travel with it , Nothing to like

449483,Derag Livinghotel Kaiser Franz Joseph Vienna, One lift was out of action for the duration of our visit to Vienna 31 Aug to 11 September with no attempt to repair it This has caused much inconvenience and psychological downgrade I stayed here in 1997 when it was very impressive Now everything looks old and in need of renovation , Location near tram stop and not far from Grinzing Free wi fi is a great bonus as is air conditioning but the latter stopped in the middle of the night and I had to wake up every night at 2 am to switch it back on

449488,Derag Livinghotel Kaiser Franz Joseph Vienna,No Negative, Excellent quality for the money Nice people Because the hotel was not available for the requested early check in they upgraded us to an apartment at same cost It is beautiful to walk in the Grinzing area or to take the tram 38 for just 20 minutes trip to the city center I recommend the location for everybody wanting to have busy days in the city center and relaxed evenings uphill to the traditional restaurants and wineries 
449489,Derag Livinghotel Kaiser Franz Joseph Vienna, I am not an early breakfast person However the website advertised free coffee and croissant which I thought would be just great When I enquired at reception about this offer it was denied The room had kettle and cups but no coffee milk or sugar Will definitely never stay here again , The bed was comfortable and the room very clean
