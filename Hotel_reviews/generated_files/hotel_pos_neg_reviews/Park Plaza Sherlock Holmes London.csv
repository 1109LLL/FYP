29766,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Would have preferred bath over shower , Bacon was really tasty and the Grilled tomatoes excellent 
29767,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Didn t like the glass door to the bathroom not good for privacy as I travelled with my teenage daughter Especially with a mirror on the wall opposite , The pillows were superb We arrived at noon asked if they could store our luggage until later but the room was ready so they let us have it early 
29768,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, We had to change room because our so called superior double had a window looking out onto a very noisy heating pump chimney , The breakfast was good 
29769,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, the door to the toilet is opaque that is ludicrous as you can see the silhouette of the person using the toilet old awful hotel from the reception area to the rooms will never stay or recommend this place again, I found this hotel awful I have already complained to the hotel It is old fashioned dated and tired Very disappointing and very unhappy to have paid what I did for it My guest said it was nothing more than Premier Inn standard 
29770,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The room wasn t ready at check in time and the children s bed wasn t set up as requested This was quickly sorted out after it was brought to their attention , Acknowledging that it was a birthday celebration and providing a birthday cheesecake this was a nice thoughtful touch Thank you
29771,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Air conditioning control which has only cold air in the summer and hot air in the winter It would be good to be able to select which one was required on the day , Good location lift d cor good 
29772,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Size of the room was small even for London we were possibly given a single room as there was only one bedside table The bathroom door is glass and the toilet was only 2 5ft from the bed so no privacy The bar closed just after 11 and the cost for a glass of wine and a bottle of cider was 16 , Cleanliness and reception staff
29773,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London,No Negative, The hotel is very central yet inside was quiet and a good place to relax Breakfast was also good and all the staff we encountered were helpful and friendly
29774,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, We booked a deluxe double but I think we had the smallest room on the mezanine floor It was OK with a comfortable bed but disappointing in terms if expectation , The staff are lovely The whole place is very clean and the facilities are better than you might think Location wise it was fine for what we needed Good tube access and a relatively short walk to Oxford street
29775,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, I never saw any British employees which would really have completed the Sherlock Holmes theme at the hotel Depending on which room you are in they can be puzzling to find I suppose that goes with the Sherlock Holmes theme but can be frustrating after a couple cocktails or if you are in a hurry We ended up being moved to another room since ours had some issues which I will explain There seems to be some major differences in rooms that are in the same class We paid for an executive double but the first room we were in was much smaller than the next executive double we were changed to The first room had no room service menu pen paper American plug as advertised and the minibar fridge was frozen shut The room was ice cold and even turning off the thermostat for 5 hours did not change that problem I would have had no idea there was room service available had I not been changed to a different room and seen a menu as it s not advertised on the tv information or anywhere else They may be missing out there , The location is perfect in central London near many sites and shopping galore The property is well situated and presents nicely upon check in with very polite and accommodating staff The bed was comfortable and the rooms are clean The Sherlock Holmes theme was very cool The bar was very nice with very polite staff Drinks were generous and delicious The hotel held our bags after check out so we could get some shopping in before heading back to the country I would definitely stay there again 
29776,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The room was hot Air conditioning was advertised Apparently the hotel controls when and if the a c functions Our room had a thermostat that was decoration only because it did not make the room cooler Requesting the hotel to investigate why the a c was not working in our room elicited a promise to look into it but they never did And they had a comforter as the only cover on the bed Who needs a comforter when the room is hot , Location
29777,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Breakfast for a vegetarian was not value for the money charged, The hotel is in a very good location for the area were we wanted good choice of pubs and restaurants nearby
29778,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Hotel is tired and needs an update desperately also the staff were slow and not very attentive and the bar area stank on Saturday evening and they were obviously cleaning up something, location is excellent and we attended last year and all was fine
29779,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, House keeping were not very reliable at restocking tea coffee milk in the room but that is my only niggle , Great location Baker St and Marylebone High St is a beautiful side of London 2 minutes to Baker St tube stop which is really well connected to the test of London The hotel staff were very friendly Rooms are a great size and include tea coffee nice bathrooms hairdryer and iron ironing board board Everything you could need The bar restaurant is relaxed and well priced All in all a London hotel I will definitely use again 
29780,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Pictures on web must have taken 20 years ago Room I reserved Deluxe double room was size of closet so had to upgrade with 20 for each night Furniture wooden floor was all scratched and worn out Glass door to bathroom does not fully close and see through No privacy at all Housekeeper left coffee mug and wine glass not cleaned Regret that I trust booking com reviews Never again And couple of steps in the middle of hallway If you can t lift your luggage every ten step to get to your room from elevator don t stay here They make you work out by lifting own luggage , Convenient store coffee shop and subway stop is close by Good location 
29781,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The breakfast was serviceable but not great Too many packaged rather than fresh items but there was plenty to choose from and serving staff was extremely nice , Found this nice property for a list minute business trip in one of my favorite neighborhoods Very walkable and easy transportation nearby Tube stations and Paddington station Room was bigger than expected and received free water and fruit upon arrival Staff very helpful with directions and other routine questions 
29782,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Old fashioned hotel out of date Over expensive room considering size A global refurbishment is needed urgently I do not recommand this hotel for the price , Location
29783,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London,No Negative, All the staff were very friendly and efficient they set up the baby cot bedding for us immediately upon arrival A very good well priced breakfast 
29784,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Price is high although understandable given the location The floor of the room was making a lot of noise The shower system was complicated , Location helpful and pleasant staff
29785,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The steak was a bit dry and overdone the night we had steak but everything else from the restaurantand bar was great , The staff were lovely the location was very convenient to everything we vented to do the beds were very comfortable and the breakfast was really good 
29786,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The room was very hot during the night despite having the window and the fan system on it just wouldn t cool down , The bed was comfy and the room was laid out well Fantastic location very close to Baker Street Tub Station but did not here any traffic noise from the room 
29787,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Generally furnishings in rooms and access corridors etc run down Grossly overpriced Staff helpful when necessary but not knowledgeable about their hotel Man on reception surly and unwelcoming, Location
29788,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London,No Negative, It was a real delight from the moment we walked in to the moment we left The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly The whole experience whilst being there was very pleasureable In a perfect location to get around london aswell Loved every moment can t wait to go back 
29789,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Check in took a long time Bathroom in the hotel room flooded when taking a shower We had to request reception to ask the room next door to quieten down at 3am in the morning There were not enough breakfast tables in the morning for breakfast so we ended up eating in the bar And in addition there was not enough food and we had to wait over 20 mins before anything in the buffet was replenished ,No Positive
29790,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Nothing from the hotel point of view but there is external noise but this is to be expected on busy road like Baker Street with trains nearby , Location is amazing for Sherlock Homes museum Madame Tussaud s and tube station at end of the street lots of places to eat and shops within a minutes of hotel Hotel is beautiful and staff friendly and helpful We went for my daughter 18th and hotel staff had left a beautiful birthday card and cake on arrival in our room Would recommend this hotel 
29791,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, We were very disappointed by a policy that was not evident to us upon booking the room SIX MONTHS AHEAD OF TIME The rate on an individual night varies by as much as 20 to 50 pounds per night dependent solely on the discretion of the hotel itself It was explained to me by reception that it varies solely on how busy they are NOT on the rate that I thought was locked in upon reserving a room I would not book here again simply because of a lack of transparency , The bar on the ground floor the location to shopping and the tube stop at Baker Street 
29792,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Lack of equipment in the room like a place to put the suitcase an armchair Old furniture scratched with dusty moldings fridge not clean moldy and sticky Glas door of the bathroom with finger marks paint No temperature regulation for the heating system Small plastic shower tub with deficient shower head Too expensive for that level of service , The location The welcoming receptionists The wooden floor in the room 
29793,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The hotel itself is quite small inside there is an intricate system of narrow corridors Be ready to encounter steps on your way to the room Executive suits are far better than Superior ones My last Superior suit had a weird smell in it something like antiseptics which was surprising but not critical The furniture was also older and a more worn out though the bed was as good as in the Executive one Besides it has a shower cabin while Executive suits have bath tubes , Excellent location less than 5 min to Baker Street Station 20 min to main tourist attractions friendly staff good and quality bed clothes and towels Very comfortable bed and good Wi Fi 
29794,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Could have made much more of the Sherlock theme I brought my son to stay as he s a massive fan of the BBC Sherlock programs Photo s from on set cryptic messages otherwise it s was a decent hotel in central London btw Breakfast is way too expensive , Great location nice hotel 
29795,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Hard to find any downsides ok maybe some of the corridors could do with some re decoration and the varnish on the outside of our bedroom door needed a re coat but hey I m clutching at straws now Also the rooms have wooden floors so I was awakened by I think housekeeping in an adjacent room cleaning the room and moving furniture around at 6am Management need to note this , We found this to be a great hotel Great location 10 min walk from Marylebone Station 3 min walk from Baker St Underground loads of bars cafes restaurants locally if you don t want to go far Exceptionally friendly and helpful staff from the Concierges to Reception Housekeeping Staff at Breakfast Mihara I think and the manager very accommodating Nice clean room comfortable bed good sized bathroom Good bar cafe area at front of house Had a quiet room to the back of the hotel which was good Overall I would overlook the minor quibbles and still give an Excellent Recommended we will definitely return 
29796,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The duvet on the bed could have been a little thicker and cosier It was a bit thin compared to what we are used to at home but a small issue to moan about when everything else was so good , I would highly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to go back there lovely clean and comfortable rooms apart from the duvet and super bathroom with a decent sized bath and a great breakfast too The Manager Fatmir was excellent All the staff were friendly but he really took the time to ensure our stay was perfect 
29797,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London,No Negative, This hotel was not like any other London hotels I ve stayed at it is has a personality the staff were really friendly and helpful Would definitely stay here again
29798,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Room a little warm unable to open window due to noisy vents outside not a pleasant outlook from the room , Super location walked to Oxford street and Covent Gatrden from the hotel Great bars restaurants and independent shops on Marylebone high street just around the corner Luxury toiletries very comfy mattress Speedy check in and out 
29799,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London,No Negative, We have stayed here twice before but a few years ago we like the polite but non pretentious feel of the Hotel also staff are very pleasant Its location is ideal for our needs so we will be back 
29800,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, When I arrived at the hotel they gave my room to some one else and it was already paid by me they gave me a smaller room for a night then moved me to my room but they took the charge for the big room for all the nights As well i kept my card holder in my bag at the room in the hotel when i came back i didnt find it when i told the hotel they did nothing even the managers who works there aneta they tell as that we will do our best for the first mistake and the second one and they did nothing and this is the worst hotel in london ,No Positive
29801,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The staff could not suggest a good indian restaurant nearby The photos were nothing like the room we actually stayed inn , The staff was nice but needed better training in what is nearby the room was clean but small and has not been refurbished for a long time 
29802,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London,No Negative, Absolutely amazing hotel Staff were so friendly Stayed here for my boyfriends birthday they decorated our room with happy birthday banners and a card signed by all of the staff This made us feel so welcome and happy Would definitely recommend and would love to return 
29803,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, there was nothing that we didn t like about the hotel or the service provided but can I suggest that a provision for connecting rooms be made available for family convenience The price of the room was a bit higher compared to the other hotels , The room service was very good as well as the quality of the food They were very efficient in attending to our requirement same goes for the house keeping dept also 
29804,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Bedroom was stiflingly hot only temp control option was heating on or heating off no aircon and couldn t open window because of noisy heating unit outside We didn t sleep at all because of heat Shower was very difficult to control without scalding oneself or flooding bathroom, Great location
29805,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, When walking in no service Impossible to have the room at a good temperature no AC in winter The establishment needs refreshing The cleaning service was not to standard missing floor mat in the bathroom on the second day and first day towel was still there along side the new ones , You have everything under one roof bar restaurant
29806,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Breakfast seemed like an after thought squeezed in Not the best , Receptionist arranged for a couple of small cakes and birthday card for my sons 9th birthday It was a lovely suprise and made him feel special 
29807,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Room rates can go above my reasonable expense rates policy for certain dates, I was able to secure a very good room rate through Booking com Bedroom was attractively furnished clean and tidy Unfortunately checking out at 04 45 for business meant I wasn t able to use the restaurant bar or gym facilities but pleased they were on offer 
29808,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Didn t like the lack of privacy in the bathrooms with the windows and no lock , Bed was so comfortable slept better than I did at home Staff were very friendly 
29809,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Room too hot unable to control properly fan noise impossible to sleep with and only issues hot air in winter and cold in the summer unable to open window as secondary double glazing did not open so stuffy and overheated night, Location small friendly comfortable hotel room and bathroom well fitted and smart
29810,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Heating on room either on or off we called staff at 12 30 am as so hot nearly cooked overnight very uncomfortable Thermostat did nothing, Convenient excellent breakfast Bed comfortable
29811,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The room was extremely over heated 80 degrees We had to leave the window open in January to maintain a comfortable temperature Also the cleaning staff was poor there were huge dust bunnies left in the bathroom towels missing and we were charged for the same missing item from the mini fridge which we had not taken on 3 separate days , The staff was very helpful and friendly and the location was perfect The room was particularly large especially for the price and the beds were pretty comfortable Even the strange sliding glass door for the bathroom was OK the frost treatment was enough for our privacy and we figured out a way to use a towel to keep it from sliding open accidentally 
29812,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Breakfast not good Only one cup of coffee Food cold Buffet sparse No crossiants , No restaurant facilities the evening we booked in Nice to have been advised at the time of booking 
29813,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, On our day of check out the only elevator for our section was out of service We called the switch board for help nobody came after 10 minutes we had to grab room attendants who happened to passby However they were helpful in bringing our baggages downstairs which was nice , Room is clean 
29814,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Nothing, The understanding and assistance of the reservations team when I had to at very short notice make changes to my arrangements It was an anxious time for me and they couldn t have been more helpful 
29815,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Old ac system that hasn t been maintained properly Was first put in a room with radiators only and got refunded for that However radiators produced much cleaner air than the ac, Wonderful location excellent customer relations problem solving care
29816,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Didn t have slippers Also had to pay for late check out, Room was comfortable Staff wAs very helpful Location was convenient Would recommend it and stay again
29817,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Often unable to use the lounge as it was sometimes very crowded I am a wheelchair user and the lift was very small and rather awkward to get in and out of , Room very spacious excellent facilities and attention to detail breakfast fantastic staff very helpful and friendly Excellent location 
29818,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The heating said We operate a two pipe system cold in Summer hot in Winter When I arrived my bedroom was 25C In order to make it sleepable I needed to turn off the hot pipe heating and leave the window wide open , Staff were brilliant really helpful and friendly but not pushy 
29819,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Room is not same as foto at all Very tiny room with low celling and with bed under the window now at winter you always feel wind over yor head Door to bath doesn t close ,No Positive
29820,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Mini bar would not open and no hairdryer to be fair I did not complain about it as this did not spoil our visit, Excellent location close to Madame Tussauds and London Zoo clean comfy hotel excellent breakfast Would definitely return
29821,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London,No Negative, Courtesy of all staff They are not in any way pushy but are attentive to needs at all times Plus the location which allows movement across all of London by bus or tube to be made so easily 
29822,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London,No Negative, Very attentive staff cozy feeling spacious sleeping room beautifully decorated public rooms lots of choices for meeting spots fantastic breakfast will definitely rebook 
29823,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, We were in a superior double room and it was not up to scratch or value for money There was no bath either , The location was fab Very close to the train station so could get around London easily
29824,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, There is significant staff turnover which is not a good sign Some of the staff seem indifferent Most don t smile or fob you off The hotel needs investment in 1 staff training motivation incentives 2 facilities new furniture etc The gym is tiny cluttered and basically an afterthought a token , Location central with well designed lobby bar and breakfast room The breakfast is good with some pleasant staff Rooms are fine and clean but furniture looks somewhat dated 
29825,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The room was noisy water from other rooms seemed to flush past two corners of our room The childrens sofa bed was very squeaky they do fidget No water came out of the bath tap so had to fill up using the shower head but still enjoyed the big bath after a long day walking the streets of London Breakfast my omelette was cooked to perfection but far too much salt couldn t eat it , We had a 3 night stay over New Year Aneta on Reception was so lovely and helpful Our room was BIG Perfect shower lots of hot water Location could not have been better Enjoyed the settee area out the back on a rainy NYD Would recommend and would come again 
29826,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Rooms way to hot no way to cool down TV channels limited no reading or small lights in room Even after paying for room in full before arrival a charge of 25 a day held BEWARE if staying 5 nights as 125 will be held until end of stay or in my case after being home one day, Location is great
29827,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, ROOM WAS RATHER DATED SUPERIOR DOUBLE NOT SURE ABOUT IT BREAKFAST WAS LUKE WARM TOOK AGES FOR EGGS TO BE BROUGHT TO TABLE , LOCATION WAS VERY GOOD 
29828,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The downstairs main part of the hotel was far far too hot which made the idea of drinking at the bar or eating at the restaurant an impossibility so we ate out The mattress was so soft leaving us both with painful backs despite being young and back problem free normally The cleaning service for the room literally only did half a job with half the room still messy when we returned and the flannels not been replaced , The location is fab surrounded by all the bars and restaurants you could want and easily accessible distance from lots of attractions The hotel itself is nicely presented and people are nice 
29829,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The hotel itself unfortunately a little too expensive for offered standard Certainly does not deserve the highest rating The rooms are clean but not new The view from the window in the room that I got is poor Prices far too high However as I mentioned the location is great , Superb location very nice service Everything clean 
29830,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Room wasn t ready until after 3 Staff unapologetic Hotel lobby was uncomfortably warm to the point where we had to wait outside, Room was very comfortable great location 
29831,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Room was so hot even with the window open The shower didn t work Only one teabag in the room so had to ask for more which the start were quick to resolve ,No Positive
29832,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The bar was expensive , the staff were so friendly and helpful Delicious choice of breakfast We had our evening meal there too and it was lovely and very reasonable They accommodated my dissecting of a dish and adding other bits to it with a great attitude 
29833,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The rooms were very small and we were not informed of construction works happening directly outside our room window For a superior room the standard was poor,No Positive
29834,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, A better view room the room provided to us was blocked by wall Don t know if this was done because we booked through Booking com or just unfortunate coincidence , The Housekeeping was very good prompt 
29835,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, room service menu very disappointing i hear that s common but the pizza was absolutely gross The film choice on the tv was ridiculous there were about 4 choices in each category and very expensive If i d thought about it i d have brought my laptop and got a film online but it wasn t really a problem because there was the tv anyway the sauna and steam room were nice and clean a hot tub would be a nice addition all in all i loved it and would stay again i think it was a little expensive but probably no more so than other london hotels so i have no comparison in terms of value for money, the staff were lovely personable the hotel was very clean lovely Elemis products in bathroom room was warm you could open the window which was a bonus lovely location
29836,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Bedroom was cold until warmed up No dressing gowns or slippers supplied Central heating noisy during night time , Staff were obliging and helpful Bar was spacious and comfortable 
29837,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, For an executive room it shouldn t be showing as many signs of wear, In room breakfast order card didn t explain what come with the traditional English breakfast It just said 15 50 For this reason we give it a miss when the restaurant manager couldn t seem to explain either Our room had a dust sheet at the window and scaffold outside which they didn t advise of before we found it ourselves In general it was ok 
29838,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Room was too hot for us but on the second day we finally figured out how to open the window The old wooden floors gave the hotel a lot of warmth but were also a bit creaky which meant we could sometimes hear people walking around above us The view from our window was of a wall and the air handling system but that didn t really detract from our stay , We booked the executive twin which was quite roomy for London The hotel is charming and in an excellent location near the Tube and loads of restaurants The bathroom was spacious and modern I wouldn t hesitate to recommend this hotel 
29839,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Nothing i thoroughly enjoyed my stay , The breakfast options were fantastic the bed was incredibly comfortable The staff every single one that i encountered seemed genuinely keen to be helpful and not just because its their job Best hotel i have stayed at for service comfort and atmosphere 
29840,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The house keeper forgot to renew the toilet paper and some of the shower products one of the days , The staff was very nice and we had a very warm welcome and with lots of professionality 
29841,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Room was very disappointing have booked studio rooms at other Park Plaza hotels for family trips and been really impressed Not at all sure what qualifies this room as a studio it was smaller than a family room in a more budget hotel and the only divided area was in essence a vestibule with a desk in it The bathroom was very shabby the door wouldn t close , Location Breakfast 
29842,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Expensive for what you got for your money Ask if we cud up grade but got told had a good rm already Which was only ok stayed in better standard rm Had plastic film around windows due wk being done outside and floor was spongey probably due water getting under neath it Was not happy considering how much we paid for a studio rm big let down , Bath room was nice Especially shower 
29843,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, We upgraded our room to one of the new bedrooms great bathroom and decor but very little direct light to put makeup on at night Also the walls are very thin we could hear next doors guests very clearly, The highlight of our stay was the excellent staff They were friendly helpful and professional
29844,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Party next door until 3 00am so loud Staff were unable to relocate us Not overly clean Squeaky floors and we could hear people walking around in room next door Also glass door on toilet directly opposite room door weird , Comfortable bed and hotel location
29845,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Breakfast area is a bit too crowded Food was average , Great value for a 4 stars hotel in central location The reception guy who check us in and check us out was very friendly to us Thank you for the upgrade the cake and card We had a great night at this hotel The bar area and lounge area are both really nice 
29846,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Very poor sound isolation you hear the steps of the neigbour above perfectly Wooden floor makes a lot of noise , Very cozy hotel with perfect location I liked the breakfast Room is nice and clean but quite tiny very good bathroom
29847,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Very bad organisation i arrived at 10 o clock at night very tired they had no room for me they send me to an other hotel and I had to pay cash I was very upset Next night they said they got the room ready they have waisted 3 days of my 6 day short brake,No Positive
29848,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, I m very picky about cleanliness and I was a little upset to find a few hairs in the sheet which I hope either came from the floor when the bed was being made or the machine hadn t done it s job properly A few unloved wall cracks and flaking paint but nothing major or that would make me rethink staying there , All members of staff from reception to the wait staff were very polite extremely courteous and so helpful The room was lovely and room service arrived extremely quickly Breakfast was well cooked and there was plenty to chose from making it well worth the extra fee I managed to get an excellent deal so it far outshone the other hotels available The Sherlock Holmes books in the bedside table was a cute touch 
29849,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, the room was at the front of the hotel and it was very noisy also it was extremely warm and we had to ask for a fan but still needed to leave the window open to get some air not an enjoyable night , staff
29850,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Our room s ambient temperature at night was a tad too hot Hotel personnel were proactive to provide a cooler fan air ioniser unit throughout our stay , Couple bed was promptly converted to twin beds per our request Thanks for the good service 
29851,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, very small shower , Good hotel in a perfect area in Central London with many supermarkets restaurants cafes pubs etc a few steps way with Baker Str Tube station 100 meters away as well as Regent s Park Madame Tousods less than two minutes walk Clean hotel with excellent service serving very good food confortable beds and pillows 
29852,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, It was a bit pricey , The room was very clean and bed was really comfy The staff were really pleasant My only complaint was we got a drink at the bar to take to the room and there was a sevice charge put on of 1 90is optional bit your not actually informed about it in the 1st place In fairness the manager did phone us within a few minutes of the complaint Other than that the breakfast was lovely and location fantastic 
29853,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Didn t sleep for 3 days as rooms were stifling Tried to lower heat but didn t go lower than 15degrees Asked for a fan but it didn t do anything Front receptionist was extremely rude and he turned out to be supervisor Made me feel very uncomfortable Breakfast buffet was cold Wouldn t stay here again or recommend it to anyone , Hotel was very clean and bright 
29854,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Breakfast offers very little variety The buffet has English breakfast and a bit of patisserie The a la carte option is good just for a day or two as it s egg based only The cold tap had a leakage and the bathroom door all made of glass was very hard to close open and did not offer much intimacy for the person using it , The location is perfect a 2 min walk from the tube station on the main road Lively atmosphere at the hotel s bar Rooms are large and tall Reception staff very kind and helpful 
29855,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, GLASS bathroom door If you get up during the night the whole room is flooded with light My beauty sleep was disturbed Greatly reduced privacy as the door is not completely frosted over Curtains too high Not easy to draw them together Staff were good except for one member who struggled with the concept that speed doesn t equal efficiency Poor lighting for reading in bed Sorry hotel but on balance we probably will not be staying again , The staff were pleasant and helpful though somewhat over stretched in reception 
29856,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, my room was tatty the hotel reception smelt like urine was very run down We stay at the Plaza westminster bridge and thought if it was same company it would be similar but complete opposite , staff were friendly and accomodating
29857,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The room was absolutely terrible noisy not very clean It was lower level and the constant banging from water pipes was just too much to bear Hardly any sleep so very disappointed Shower facilities very old , The staff were friendly breakfast was good 
29858,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Room on 1st floor overlooking Baker St Very noisy through the night as the delivery lorries come to the multitude of shops around the hotel Make sure of a room at the back of the hotel or high up , Comfortable room if a little tired Not really what one expects from Park Plaza brand But great staff and first class food 
29859,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Sofabed not very comfortable, Loved the bar and grill great service great food amazing buffet breakfast The Hotel is in a perfect location concierge always available to help get transportation Loved It there
29860,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, rooms differs between each other you may end up in the shady loud room with old equipment next to noisy street or get a modern room next to quiet street no influence just luck, location
29861,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Seems housekeeping just fold back the used towels that we put on floor as all the bath towels are wet when we returned to room on the 2nd day, Good location friendly staff good breakfast
29862,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The door to the bathroom could only open half way which made it un comfortable The in room tea cups and tea bags where not replaced consistently room 419 , Great location comfortable with good atmosphere very clean Friendly service team responding to any issue 
29863,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Breakfast area seating was a bit limited so waiting was needed but service was efficient and well managed, Breakfast was a lovely buffet lots of choice and everything very fresh and tasty Room was comfortable and great for our needs
29864,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, check in to have room ready room items in place like rubber mat in bath no safety bars in bath had to ask repeatedly for bathrobes, Location is really the only good thing about this place Have been staying here for years and may not in the future

29867,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London,No Negative, Great location breakfast wonderful Little pricey but worth it Close to metro neighborhood lively but room super quiet Filled with charm and lovely staff 
29868,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Food very average Had room that looked over main street Baker Street but so noisy all night long and through the night with bins being emptied bottles crashing when emptied into rubbish bins and did not sleep at all Ask for room at the back if you wishto sleep , Casualness of the place and so close to shops tube etc
29869,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, We really liked the Sherlock Holmes and we think it would be unfair to mark it down in any way but would advise to keep an eye on some areas that could do with the odd lick of paint here and there , Staff were first class and nothing was too much trouble The ground floor public areas are spacious and pleasant to be in We only had one meal in the hotel restaurant and that was a dinner of excellent quality with great service Really good location a stones throw from Regents Park and with lots of options to dine out close by Liked that we were able to leave our luggage for a few hours prior to later departure from London Would definitely stay again

29873,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The room was quite cold I didn t think the breakfast was worth the price I am a veggie and you have to upgrade your breakfast to get anything other than the scrambled eggs available and I think they were made from powdered egg or something as they didn t seem to be real , Great location Room was fine bed was very comfy We ate in restaurant the first night and really enjoyed the food Staff were all lovely Lots of places to eat nearby and also Tesco Express next door and a small Sainsburys too Very close to Baker Street Tube few mins walk Close to Regent Park gorgeous place to go for a walk Easy to walk to Oxford Street as well

29876,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Sauna and steam room were not on at 8am on Saturday morning and I tried to press the button but nothing happened No one around to ask, Bar area and breakfast
29877,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London,No Negative, The staff were so welcoming helpful and friendly This is an older historic building so it has some quirks The subtle Sherlock Holmes touches were nice Loved that the rooms have electrical outlets for US European and British appliances Our room had lots of space more than I expected and was located at the back of the building so no street nose The breakfast buffet was very English and plentiful The location was perfect a short walk or bus ride to Oxford Street shopping 2 blocks from Baker St Tube for quick access to the rest of London and Wembley Stadium Lots of fast food eateries and convenience stores close by We will definitely stay here again when visiting London

29880,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Our room was very uncomfortable and stuffy We were right next to the air conditioning units so had no air whatsoever coming into the room Me and my husband have both come home with blocked up noses , Nice shower 
29881,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The room it s self was a massive dissapointment I was expecting something so lovely for the amount of money we paid but was hugely dissapointed It was tiny all round and quite old , loved the location and stuff were very friendly
29882,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, i m really disappointed it was really bad stay and i had to change my hotel last night the bathroom was so small i can t even take a shower the hotel entrance has a bar and restaurant which it so bad smelly and crowded bad ground so old only one left and so slow no isolation on the wall so noice and the neighbor voice is so hearable, just the room was clean and the bed was comfortable

29885,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, We upgraded our room to executive and it ended up being a converted broom cupboard with no carpet just laminate floor in very poor condition , Convenient location
29886,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, room picture is misleading i resereved a studio which doesn t look like the picture at all in both size wise and furniture wise the room was too small with very old furniture the veiw of the room was horrible room 211 , location and bed comfort only 
29887,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Only criticism was bedroom decor Outdated cabinets Cracks on bathroom tiles and bath a bit tired looking Mention this in terms of expectations and cost as well as added value , Staff friendly and helpful Breakfast menu good and varied Gluten free food available
29888,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Floors need a good polish They were scuffed up in my room and in lounge areas Otherwise great Sherlockian decor , Staff was wonderful helpful Breakfast had the best eggs I have ever tasted Location was very convenient for my purposes 
29889,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The Air conditioning in the entire hotel apparently cannot cool any room below 23 5 no matter what the thermostat is set at I complained so they changed the room and also gave me a fan to use That helped but not too much , Loved the location 
29890,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Bed was a little too soft for my liking , Friendly staff general cleanliness of the place use of gym facilities nice bar food area Excellent location 
29891,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Only gripe was that the Toilet wasn t separate and was in the bathroom , Location was great short walk to the underground and bus station Staff were great always happy to help with directions etc The gym is good for a hotel gym Room was surprisingly big for London Breakfast was ok 
29892,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The food was overpriced for what it was I am not saying it was bad but we have eaten better at more realistic prices , Our room was very comfortable and would definitely visit there again 
29893,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Glass doors to bathroom though it wouldn t put me off re booking The breakfast was standard nothing special , Very nice cozy decor comfy bed excellent location pleasant pavement cafe Would not hesitate to stay here again

29895,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The only downside was the lack of privacy with a glass door to the bathroom , Fantastic location good size room with kingsize bed Very friendly staff we got free drinks vouchers when our room wasn t ready and a change of room so we didn t even have to wait I d definately recommend this hotel 
29896,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, There s nothing I can think of that didn t meet my expectations, Very comfortable and lovely relaxed atmosphere about the hotel It s the first time I ve ever sat in a bar and had a drink alone before going up to me room So that says a lot Breakfast was good too
29897,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The only thing that would have made it better for me was if there had been fruit tea available at breakfast , Everything was great We stayed for the weekend for our wedding anniversary The 1st time in 10 years we were away from the children Although we missed them It was pretty perfect 
29898,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Nothing , Great location friendly staff larger room than expected fabulous bathroom very comfortable bed All in all perfect would most def book again I didn t have breakfast at the hotel so can t comment on that 
29899,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The drinks in the hotel bar are quite expensive but a good choice and probably what you would expect in London , The staff were really friendly and helpful beds were comfy and the location excellent 
29900,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Our room was on the mezzanine so other rooms might be different but the walls were very thin if a neighbouring room had their television on or indulged in nocturnal activity it sounds like they are in your room it s so loud I felt as a new couple the glass door with gap where the glass panels meet on the ensuite bathroom was a little embarrassing you could see and hear everything from the bathroom, The staff were extremely helpful and friendly the hotel had a very luxury feel to it
29901,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Being kept awake at night by next door rooms tv the tv is on the wall and the speakers sound through the wall, Good cooked breakfast and my wife loved the toiletries

29904,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London,No Negative, The hotel was extremely child friendly and the receptionist even let my daughter go behind the desk and check us in She loved it It was a lovely welcome for the whole family to the hotel All staff were very friendly and helpful 
29905,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Rooms very small a bit cramped glass bathroom door not private at all as doesn t close completely , Very friendly staff great location Good food breakfast buffet lovely 
29906,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Hotel seemed very dark some of the furniture in bedroom was in poor state of repair Got stuck in lift rang alarm 1 couldn t understand instructions given 2 alarm couldn t be heard at reception desk someone had to go get help, Convenience of location
29907,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Nothing Great hotel, Great Location and Value for Central London I just like the feel of this hotel Several restaurants outside in walking distance and great service Ask for a room with a shower room only I had a room with a desk so i could work as well Food was good in general and there is an amazing coffee shop next door that sells healthy food A really good old school pub is around the corner as well Easy to get a taxi and 3 min walk to tube Great value 
29908,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Not all Executive rooms are the same We stayed here for 3 nights at an Executive Room via Booking com It was in the new wing the room was large quiet street behind and well appointed But the shower cubicle leaked and even after informing reception they were unable to fix it We checked out travelled and booked an Executive room again on Booking com for another four nights This time we were in the old wing and the room was half the size of the Executive Suite in the new wing It was also noisy and we could hear the footsteps of the guest in the adjoining room We asked for a room change for new wing but they said they were full Considering we had just given then 7 room nights the effort could have been a bit keener to put us in the new wing So we didn t feel we got our moneys worth the 2nd time around For guests staying in the new wing and who are carrying large suitcases staff should inform guests that its best to get help with luggage as the corridors to the new wing goes up and down steps and levels and can be arduous especially after a long flight , Location is amazing Close to some great restaurants and cafes bus routes and the tube Can walk to Oxford Street Hotel is clean and staff are pleasant The bar is open throughout the day for hotel guests which was a great plus Would recommend a stay if you can secure an executive suite in the New Wing We snacked a couple of times at the bar and the food was good the receptionists were helpful with hailing cabs and helping with luggage The rooms were cleaned well every day TV had a good range of channels Bathrooms were spacious and clean and good water pressure in the showers New Wing executive suites had a cool remote control to manage lights and blinds 
29909,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Nothing at all Don t change anything great the way it is , Simply a very nice hotel Everything was perfect made for a very relaxing unobtrusive stay So much better than a faceless chain slightly quirky but charming with it 
29910,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Nothing could of been better, They asked was it a special occasion and when we got to the room we had balloons a birthday card bottle of wine a message on the mirror it s really made my husbands birthday so much more special
29911,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, There s not much to say Everything was perfect apart from maybe more channels on the tv and maybe dressing gowns included too , The bath in the room was amazing The bed was very comfortable and there was a lift so after a long day of walking we were able to relax in our room 
29912,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Creaking noises from head board I think that was attached to the wall when neighbours moved , Spaciousness of the room interior no road noise even though our room was on the road side 
29913,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Apart from the room being a good design I m afraid to say too small The shower entrance was vary tight to get in to and we thought a few updates are needed for the room as we stayed in a very similar room for half the price sorry , We really liked the design of the room and how it is set out 
29914,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Twin bed not made up as arranged as a double This was changed but I had specifically requested separate beds , Large bedroom and bathroom Very clean Walkable to Paddington 
29915,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Mum s 80th Pointed this out and nothing special happened Oxo Restaurant Ritz and Savoy Grill all did something to mark this special birthday but The hotel did not despite being made aware , Very comfortable beds and very clean
29916,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, There is only one lift which can mean delays in getting from the ground floor to your room especially as it is used by the cleaning staff as well The common areas corridors etc might benefit from a deep clean , I love the location of this hotel only a few minutes walk from Marylebone High Street and right next to Baker St station The room was a good size and comfortable 
29917,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The price needs to be cheaper, It was close to subway and atraction madam tussu and sherlock homes there is a super market next to the hotel and restorants and easy acsses to buses the hotel room was clean and neat Managment very helpfull and the gaurd at the entrance was very helfull with givving directions to what ever we wanted to see Me and my wife totally enjoyed our expiriance at the hotel and we whould recomend to other The price i think needs to be cheaper s
29918,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The room could do with a little up dating Pillows too soft for my taste, Good location 2 mins from Baker St Tube Nice area away from Baker Street with good cafe s and restaurants Checkin and out was quick and easy Good Bathroom
29919,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Would have liked a larger room with more space room too small for superior double room classification , General cleanliness friendliness of staff location Excellent breakfasts particularly good value if ordered the day before 
29920,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The walls are very thin so you can hear every little things what is around you and what is going on the street It is very hard to sleep The breakfast is very poor especially for this price , The staff is kind 
29921,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, From the pictures on booking com expected a bigger room We stipulated a room with a bath but didn t have one so had to ask to be moved , Room was noisy as there were large extractor fans near it on most of the night 
29922,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London,No Negative, We only stayed for the night with the little ones while but we were very impressed by the room We booked a suite for 4 and it was large and spacious enough to spread out in with the kids beds in another area of the room Breakfast was great as was the evening meal Breakfast was actually much cheaper to purchase while we were at the hotel so thats worth considering before booking ahead 
29923,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Nothing really It was great for a few night stay , The location was optimal for sightseeing There were lots of food options in walking distance to the hotel 
29924,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Nothing, The studio room was large and lovely We were on the main road and i thought the noise would wake me up but it didn t Great breakfast lovely bar will go again 
29925,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The hotel restaurant was a little bit of a let down very expensive for the rather poor quality food and service It was a shame as the remainder of the stay was incredible , Amazing room with good facilities great for a family trip to London A special hotel that pays homage to the famous detective 
29926,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The prices of food in the fridge in the room 3 50 for a two finger kit kat Furniture in the rooms could be updated and wet room did become wet all over floor didn t appear to drain quickly , When struggling with access to bath in our original room reception staff Joanna immediately provided a room with accessible wet room Also we were upgraded and had basket of fruit and two boxes of chocolates Breakfast was until 1030
29927,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, We had been travelling through Europe and had heavy suitcases had to navigate sets of stairs to get cases to and from rooms Very minor issue no where to hang towels in bathroom , The staff were professional and pro active The location of the hotel is 10 minutes walking distance to Oxford Street and close to tube station My family booked two studio rooms which were spacious and certainly met our needs We were able to keep a room and have late checkout on an hourly rate Cannot comment on food at the hotel our family enjoyed many of the restaurants in close proximity to the hotel 
29928,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Where was the Sherlock Holmes theme It was non existent Our room had the noise of an industrial hotel fan all night from outside Did not appreciate the lack of privacy of sliding glass door on the bathroom , Room was very comfortable and so was the bed The hotel felt very relaxed Staff polite 
29929,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The rooms are not as it seem on booking com They are a bit old and the bad is not so comfortable executive room , The staff is very nice and helpfull Location is great a minute walk from baker street station A lot of information giving by the hotel regarding traveling in London 
29930,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Size of the room was tiny bearing in mind we had paid extra for an Executive Double it was really very small so we were pretty disappointed The bar downstairs had quite a pub feel to it rather than being an upmarket hotel bar , Bed was really comfortable and bathroom was lovely if tiny 
29931,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The bathroom door couldn t be shut all the way It is one of those doors you needed to slide shut however one of the bolts holding it in place was preventing it from shutting , We didn t really use the facilities as such went out and about in central London But the room was big and add a comfortable bed and relaxing ambiance to it And the bonus for myself was it was quite 
29932,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The room we stayed in 325 which was a studio room was tired and rather bare The bed was not comfortable and even the pillows left something to be desired , The bar and reception staff were very friendly Location is excellent for shopping sightseeing and dining 
29933,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Room service breakfasts where vile and vastly over priced considering Shower was outdated frankly and lacked any decent temperature control Could use an update honestly considering alternative options available with some of the larger chains Wi Fi although free was very slow , Location Beds 
29934,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, There only appeared to be one lift but It may be that I just didn t see another one There were of course stairs to the rooms , The staff were exceedingly helpful and friendly The restaurant offered good food and value for money The hotel was clean and light 
29935,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London,No Negative, There was a dark hair girl on the reception on Friday night when we arrived at midnight with an accent She greeted us with a big SMILE She is truly amazing 
29936,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, N A, The staff were friendly happy and helpful we didn t have any problems booking we had a query that was answered efficiently Breakfast was lovely Thank you 
29937,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, There was a large row in room next to us that spilled into corridor in early hours lasted for over an hour no security or response from hotel staff,No Positive
29938,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The entrance of the hotel is directly to the bar its better to seperate them , The location was very good at baker street and every thing like shops and restaurants near the hotel also the staff helpful 
29939,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, wasn t aware at the time of booking it would be rather busy with travelling Sheffield fans , The room was lovely we stayed in the Loft Suite which really gave the occasion a special edge 
29940,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Nothing negative to report, Can only comment on the room as this was the only part of the hotel we used The rooms were clean and tidy and as we were at the back of the hotel and on the top floor 4th the room was quiet on a night which was great 
29941,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, We were billed twice When you use your card to check in you will be charged automatically even though we were told this would not happen I paid with another bank card and was also charged on my the bank card I used to check in with Plus there was no British staff all everyone seemed to be from other countries As a British citizen I would expect some British sounding person at front of house This was central London and it should be standard Sherlock Holmes at least had a very British accent and a stiff upper lip Although the front of house people were nice enough it just did not feel authentic enough No sign of Britishness what so ever Sorry but that s how it was , No reply to our complaint
29942,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Small rooms but comfortable beds We had an issue with checkout exchange rate that we questioned and received a prompt response and were taken care of quickly upon our return home , Great location close to tube station and bus stops Excellent neighborhood restaurants Restaurant was okay and the bar was always busy and good service The staff was very friendly 
29943,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Our room was at the front of the hotel and even with the secondary glazing had some street noise in the early morning , Good to have a lovely generous bath as well as two shower heads The bed was roomy and very comfortable The tasty buffet breakfast was kept topped up frequently by the pleasant and efficient staff
29944,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Having to leave we should of booked another night , Friendly staff great breakfast very comfy bed the choice of mini bar safe Very peaceful even in the heart of London 
29945,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London,No Negative, The staff could not have done more to make our trip perfect It was my husbands birthday and he received a card from all the staff just brilliant Would definately return thank you
29946,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, We did not take the option of breakfast as we felt it was too much money so maybe that could be less for people staying at the hotel, The hotel is in an excellent area with easy access from Euston station The staff were polite and pleasant and the hotel was clean and well equipped We will definitely stay with you again 
29947,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, At arrival I left my wallet in the car and wanted to leave my bags in the room and get back for my wallet but that was not possible I had to give my credit card first This gave a somewhat untrustfull unwelcome feeling Parking is not in the hotel but in a paid nearby parking garage , Location was good Next to the tourist bus through London On Walking distance from Regent Street Oxford Street 
29948,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Room was a little small and one of those frosted glass sliding doors to close off the shower room WC but style over substance as door doesn t shut exactly so nothing left to the imagination View over an arrangement of air con units to retar if building, Location string with lots of neighbouring bars and eateries
29949,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The semi transparent toilet door in the bathroom without a door is just weird The scrambled eggs at breakfast were thinned out with quite a lot of milk giving them a very strange texture and taste Also the grapefruit juice was sweetened which was not to my taste, Lovely modern room very clean everything worked Good location pleasant efficient staff Nice toiletries in the bathroom Really good hotel would recommend 
29950,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The room had no remote to work the TV and took an hour and a second call to reception to resolve , Room could have been a bit cleaner and there was no fan to supliment the AC it s was an uncomfortably hot day 
29951,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Some of the lights didn t work in the room Room felt cramped Bit expensive , Very well situated for Marylebone High Street Very helpful bar staff 
29952,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, We went there 3 times in less then 2 months we definitely love the hotel location and room but the staff last time we checked in 8 pm was unfriendly The other times we checked in around midnight and staff was super friendly Unfortunately the negative staff does affect your idea luckily was 1 out of the 3 times , Amazing location I love Elemis product in the bathroom Prima Cotton bedsheets 
29953,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Its not a safe hotel to stay in Because i was robbed and there were no cameras to investigate about to i checked out earlier than what i have planned , Location was good All the cafe and restaurants are close Oxford street about 15 to 20 mins walking and marlynone likewise 
29954,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, We had to move rooms because despite having the air con on full for the night the inside room temperature was 26 degrees Celsius Unbearable so moved rooms at 7am The kettle in the room didn t work Room service breakfast was cold and inedible and was removed from the bill after we complained Two glasses of orange juice cost us 7 80 All the problems were dealt with by the helpful staff but meant that during a one night stay we were constantly on the move going to or calling reception Not the romantic night away we had been looking forward to for our anniversary , The bed was extremely comfortable The staff helped with the problems but it would have been better not to have had the issues in the first place 
29955,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The room was very hot and there seemed to be no way to control the temp in the room The next morning there was a lot of noise sounded like DIY or repairs , Breakfast was varied and very good
29956,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London,No Negative, The studi room was a great find for a family of 4 Really spacious and quiet for central London We were only there for one night so didnt really use the facilities or eat in the restaurant The staff were really helpful and friendly Nice touches such as complimentary bottles of water on our way out apples at reception Great job guys we ll be back 
29957,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Room was cleaned with no problem but clothes which had been on bed were left on floor , Great location easy access into Central London Well equipped room Friendly and helpful staff

29964,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Loved it all apart from the fact that food wise I felt they should have had a bit more of an option for halal food which was just a slight issue but still not too bad x, I loved the room and loved the fact we had a nice bath in there rather then just a shower staff were all lovely too very helpful indeed all nice and clean overall a bad boy experience with a Fantastic time on the end of the night to end the night with xx
29965,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Our room was very small and pokey The interior was worn and tired looking The room was uncomfortably warm and the air conditioning was useless We both kept waking during the night because of the heat and it s only April yet , The staff were exceptional Not only were they professional welcoming and friendly but also incredibly obliging 
29966,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The food was great but the steak was thin it tasted really good just a little thin Americans have steak like that for breakfast and I m not kidding lol, The service was excellent lovely staff Everything was good including the food bar and live entertainment The choices at breakfast were incredible first class
29967,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London,No Negative, I stayed here on my birthday and I don t normally review hotels I stay in that often cause there normally pretty average but this was a quality stay The gentleman at the reception gave us one of the new rooms they have built I would defiantly recommend to stay here 
29968,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The room was so hot we couldn t sleep both nights despite window being wide open and having to get a fan from reception which was noisy There was an air con unit in the room but switched off during this month The room was so hot it was unpleasant When we complained the dug manager called Laura kept saying the heating is switched off and I was getting the impression she wasn t understanding what we were saying We know the heating was off and the air con but the room was so hot it was unpleasant sleeping there and even after opening the window and getting a temporary fan for the room it failed to help and we had the same problem two nights in a row so het answer was here is my business card next time you come please tell me your preferences and I will accommodate you Why would I pay to stay again when you couldn t accommodate me after night 1 ,No Positive
29969,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The were signs in the bathroom saying hang your towels if you wanted to reuse them which I did but they staff replaced it anyway In a way it was good but in another way they contradicted themselves No big complaint though , the room was neat and clean The bed was so comfy Staff especially the concierges were very helpful Breakfasts were great and good variety 
29970,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Rooms on mezzanine floor are bit colder in the winter time than rooms on the other floors There is bit of draft coming from the windows and corridor, Very friendly and helpful staff Central location Nice food
29971,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, A little impersonal and a small bar would have been good Breakfast was not wonderful quite basic and not good quality , The location is excellent Suited our needs well It was clean and security good 
29972,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, We booked through booking com When we checked into the hotel at 8pm we established there was no family room booking just a booking for two adults I had the confirmation of a booking for four people The hotel managed to squeeze us in a small not very pleasant room we had a room for the night but we wouldn t have bothered booking for a room of that standard It was my daughters 11th birthday the next morning so the whole experience wasn t great The hotel said they did their best in the circumstances , We enjoyed the breakfast 
29973,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, They rooms were small There wasn t any plug sockets near any mirrors so was difficult to see when doing hair using straightens and hair dryer , Very good location hotel was clean and staff were always happy to help Will definitely be using this hotel again 
29974,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London,No Negative, I thought the hotel was perfect Beautiful decor extremely helpful staff and the food was lovely We wouldn t hesitate to stay here again It was my partner s birthday and the added touches provided made it extra special
29975,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The fact that we could not stay longer , Staff made our stay special as it was a special occasion that we were there Beds were extremely comfortable rooms were spotless with lovely touches throughout 
29976,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Only one elevator Stairs zig zagged all over the place and hard to find your way down if the elevator was slow Not sure if its safe in a fire , I liked the large room with plenty of space for a week s stay Overall the hotel is a bit past its best but maybe that s the Victorian ambience after all it does commemorate the Victorian detective Breakfast exorbitant but dinner in dining room was good and service excellent West End and Tube stations in easy walking distance 
29977,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, At first I thought I was walking into a bar not a welcoming layout however the concierge was very pleasant Booked Executive twin room Told room ready at check in however set up as double had to go to reception twice Offered another room which I had to view with a member of staff didn t like this room The first room was changed by a maintenance man while we were unpacking Bathroom had glass fronted sliding door with no ventilation which rattled when opening very curious given the decor of the room and which must have been designed by a contortionist The room was not what I would call Executive Very disappointed , Good location for Madame Tussaud s and tube 
29978,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Selection of beers on tap could have been better on the upside great selection of wines , Great evening meal in the restaurant delicious and the waiter was very friendly and quick Really helpful staff Comfy beds and shower was brilliant 
29979,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Some construction noise outside and there was a strange incident in the lobby with one of the cooks yelling at all the staff , Great location Good value Friendly service Nicely appointed hotel Pleasant lobbies and common spaces with a lively bar The breakfast was quite good and well worth it We stayed here as a family and would return 
29980,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Nothing best hotel I ve stayed in London and there have been many , The size of the room facilities quality of breakfast and the friendliness and professionalism of the the staff
29981,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, In my view glass doors and screens to bathrooms are not good would request conventional door in future , Excellent location with very friendly helpful staff Breakfast good value if pre booked

29983,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The room telephone wouldn t connect well as there was a dodgy telephone cable However this was quickly rectified once I reported it , I thought the facilities were excellent and the breakfast was yummy Bedroom and bathroom clean and great powerful shower 
29984,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, noisy air conditioning vent outside our room I am a light sleeper so kept me awake unfortunately Room was on the third floor facing the middle , Very comfy bed and good clean condition of room Staff super friendly and attentive 
29985,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The girl at the reception wasn t very welcoming Had to ask for a change of the room due to the fact that it was very small and much smaller than the other rooms in the same category plus it looked very old The main heater wasn t working and kept a msg for them to check and fix while I went out for 5 hours and came back to find the room freezing and heater is not working Asked for 2 portable heaters as the room was freezing , Liked the location which is amazing and in the middle of the city with walking distance to many shopping areas in central London One of the concierge staff was very nice and helpful
29986,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Bathrooms need an upgrade Room temperature hard to control In general everything was fine but nothing special , Great location for getting around central London quickly 
29987,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, In this day and age to have to pay for wifi isn t normal and the free option only being 512kb s wasn t great Again having to pay for Internet access through the TV wasn t ok it should be free in the age of on demand TV It was annoying that the lights in the bathroom kept turning off while you are in there Breakfast was very expensive considering the cafe next door was half the price , The room was great and the bed was really comfy The wet room was great The lighting heating and curtain controls were great 
29988,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, We were upgraded God only knows what our room would have been like The rooms are tired and furniture tatty very little comfort given today s hotel standards Ridiculously expensive we may as well have booked a Premier Inn For the amount we paid 180 for one night I d have expected breakfast There are way better and more reasonable hotels in London , I can t think of anything I liked The location is ok The doorman was friendly 
29989,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The glass door to the bathroom did not compliment the d cor of the room Was an issue in the middle of the night with light from the bathroom spilling into the room , The size of the room exceeded our expectations for a London Hotel room The staff were friendly and helpful The location of the Hotel met exactly our needs 
29990,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, We had an executive room which was too hot We were unable to use air con in winter and had to prop the window open with the free magazine The tv don t work on arrival but was quickly fixed The overall decor was tired and poorly finished The desk socket gave me an electric shock , Breakfast was tasty Good quality toiletries Friendly staff
29991,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Bathroom opens into bedroom not saying this is the same for all rooms , Location location location Walk to every major tourist spot Staff A room with a view of Baker Street and windows that open I love fresh air modern renovations do not detract from the quaintness of London living Nice bar and lounge area in which to take a break Live jazzy music on a Thursday and outside seating if you want a cigarette I am from London and have to say this hotel was a treat

29994,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, I had read on the reviews that there were glass bathroom doors I didn t think it would be an issue but for me it was There is absolutely no privacy and the door is a sliding one which didn t help If you are travelling alone this would not be a problem Our room was noisy with the fan but this was only in one area of the hotel , Great location near Baker Street tube and Oxford Street not far I was amazed at the friendliness of all staff They couldn t help enough Customer service was of a very high level I was given a choice of rooms on my arrival There are some facing Baker Street and as a listed building still have old windows that don t closes tightly This is resolved with secondary glazing Rooms are quirky and are all different Some have steps down into them and double glazing others have wooden or carpet flooring Rooms at the back are quiet but make sure you are not near the kitchen as there was noise from an extractor and air conditioning all night The room was very warm and we couldn t open the window because of outside noise The bed was really comfortable and there were tea making facilities and television etc You can choose pillows and whether you want down or synthetic Air conditioning has heat only in winter and cold in winter We didn t book the buffet breakfast but you will be offered it on checking in for 10 each per day We took it and it was lovely the chef will cook eggs to order The only caviat is that I love porridge and it was only on the a la carte menu for 3 50 Would return with a big bath towel to hang over the bathroom door 
29995,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Paper thin walls and awful bathroom glass slide doors that are see through The door kept sliding open also Really odd design doesn t give you any privacy what so ever , The bed was very comfy

29999,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, the building is very old for that amount of money is not worth it they should change the furniture it is very old not enough space to put stuff around the picture that show on the web is totally different the wooden floor is making so much noise when walking because they are old and loose overall the staff is nice but the place is old, close to station
30000,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Not a great choice of food menu same thing day in day out lunch and dinner more choice needed Eating out advised , Comfortable clean great for a weekend away 
30001,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Some of bathroom fittings were a bit loose but nothing that caused a problem, The location was very convenient Baker St Station is a few minutes away and is a good place to start from There are plenty of restaurants close by 
30002,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The hotel was very tired dated It was meant to have a Sherlock Holmes theme but this did not disguise the general shabbiness of the rooms and hallways Desk staff were harried failed to book our airport transport which added much stress to our departure Breakfast was crazy expensive and pretty poor by general hotel standards , The staff on the door were fabulous helping us with taxis and generally very friendly and welcoming The location was good for our requirements 
30003,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The ceiling of the room was leaking I suppose the room above had a water leak The TV is running some custom software that allows you to watch their entertainment package but because of this they have blocked the HDMI ports so you cant connect your own laptop to watch a movie on it , Good location close to Baker street underground Friendly staff Comfortable bed Water stream in the shower is really nice
30004,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, We upgraded our room through the Booking com email but the room we got was not as large or luxurious as hoped also there was a tear in the box sheet which made the room feel a little shabby and we looked out onto the back of the building Breakfast choice was also a little limited , The Sherlock Holmes Hotel is in an excellent location not far to walk to the Tube and also well placed for where we were spending our evening at La Cucina Caldesi The hotel has a lovely foyer bar area Our room was quiet which was lovely and the bed was extremely comfortable The Elemis toiletries smelt super

30008,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Paying for parking 22 50 for 24 hours with the hotel discount card not bad for London but should have been free considering the room rate , Amazing breakfast with a gorgeous ambience the bed was heaven and it was nice to have a sauna steam room Also Dawn in the spa does an amazing aromatherapy massage

30014,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The clothes wardrobe to hang clothes is constrained nuisanced by the small floor standing cupboard kept inside really cannot hang any jackets shirts or slacks no forethought , The availability of shower facility after check out
30015,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, Bathroom a bit small room decoration too old and the worst was the inability to open a window for fresh air , The hotel has a very welcoming atmosphere the room was spacious and nice and the location of Marylebone area is great 
30016,Park Plaza Sherlock Holmes London, The room was stifling hot and there seemed to be no way of adjusting the temperature The instructions for the air conditioning said that only hot air was pumped into the room in the Winter This seems rather antiquated for the price of the rooms , Great location pleasant staff and good breakfast
