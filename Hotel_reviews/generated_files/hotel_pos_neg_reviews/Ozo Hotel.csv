354883,Ozo Hotel, Beds were not comfortable and even though it was a double bed they used two single bed sheets not fitted which moved around and didn t fit properly The cleaner broke a glass in my room on the Sunday and just left it like that I had to call someone to come get the broken pieces as I had no broom in my room By the Friday I was still stepping in shards of glass as the cleaner failed to clean properly EVERY day since the incident and despite me asking several times to vacuum the entire room My supply of coffee and sugar sachets were never replenished some days I didn t even have any neither did I have any coffee cups The breakfast options were very limited And the same every day The coffee was good though The gym consisted of one small room with a treadmill and some weights , Good coffee Some friendly staff but not all of them 
354884,Ozo Hotel, A little far off and in a too quiet area but a walking distance to the metro Staff in the day was helping but staff at night sounded annoyed when I asked help to turn on the AC He asked to come in an hour later but it was 12am and I needed to sleep so he came disgruntledly, Clean comfortable rooms AC works ok after I called for help 
354885,Ozo Hotel, The staff wasn t nice at all The hotel is noisy you can hear your neighbours The confort is basic and the room wasn t clean It doesn t worth 4 stars The price is very high when there is a show at the ArenA ,No Positive
354886,Ozo Hotel, The price was very high because there was a concert in the Arena and a event in the city Breakfast was good but not excellent , A nice hotel close to the Arena and public transport to the city 
354887,Ozo Hotel, The staff were not very friendly or helpful The location is in a commercial area which would be difficult for guests without transport, The layout of the room was great
354888,Ozo Hotel, There are so many issues with this property it is difficult to know where to begin 1 When arriving the first thing that struck us was the state of the landscaping Weeds were growing everywhere around the perimeter of the property Not a good first impression 2 Reception staff were very unhappy there was no enthusiasm for their jobs no smiles It became apparent over the length of our stay that the reason for this is due to the hotel Manager He seemed very abrupt and controlling with his team and also over friendly at times so it is no wonder the staff are unhappy 3 There are no complimentary toiletries in the bathroom This is unacceptable for an establishment that states it is 4 star 4 Breakfast was the same every day it would have been good to see some variety 5 Common areas did not appear to be vacuumed at all 6 Our dirty dishes stayed on the restaurant table for 30 minutes with no one coming to clear them , The location is close to metro station which was useful The housekeeping staff were prompt and helpful when we asked for a fitted sheet 
354889,Ozo Hotel, Toilet seat broken in room writing on the wall or the room literally marks on the floor and carpets not going to guess what they were not good overall impression was shabby Redeeming feature was the staff who were very good ,No Positive
354890,Ozo Hotel, restaurant closed early and in business area so difficult evening meal Bathroom lighting for shaving , A little way out of Amsterdam but only a few hundred meters from tram station in to Amsterdam Great breakfast friendly helpful staff Free onsite parking 
354891,Ozo Hotel, Some of the staff was little rude when I ask questions The internet went out for couple minutes but came back But a fast internet , I did like the location take the subway to Amsterdam and the modern looking hotel room The breakfast was excellent They served cold cuts too bacon and beans Coffee juices and more They had vending machine on the first floor Some of the staff was very friendly and some were rude But over roll good I ask for a beer and wine when I arrived and one staff gave us that She was super friendly and helpful One staff came to assist us on the air conditioning situation He came quickly to help with air conditioning Awesome The lowest temp that you can set is 19 C In the day time you can t control the temp It does get warm in the summer and the room gets little uncomfortable The parking is tight and no parking spaces in the front when we arrived But more spaces in the back I was annoyed that they tour buses park on the side of the hotel Really hard to drive and park in the back of the hotel 
354892,Ozo Hotel,No Negative, Location was so easy 15 min from Centraal and 10 min walk from the Metro I was shocked at seeing some of the negative comments about Ozo and can t honestly believe they must be genuine Absolutely loved the place and thanks so much for having me even though such a short space of time 
354893,Ozo Hotel, Room facilities should have been checked before guest checks in e g soap dispenser in shower full of soap but did not work safe was locked open so unable to use Both could be resolved by contacting reception but not when already in the shower or want to use the safe as about to go out Not many places outside of hotel serve food after 6pm due to being in the business area but a place called Proef Zaak was a great find to eat with superb beer brewed on the premises , Easy to get to by car and not too far to walk to Metro into Amsterdam Comfortable bed Easy parking 
354894,Ozo Hotel, The walls were thin the shower drips loudly all night and sounds like water is flushing around you you can hear the neighbors very loudly I woke up with bites from bed bugs and it is almost impossible to organize pre payment for this hotel when I arrived they made it very difficult and stressful to sort out, There were tea and coffee amenities
354895,Ozo Hotel, There is a global lack of maintenance in this hotel 1 The entrance door is badly adjusted so it is not possible to enter if you have a trolley 2 The faucet in my room was not tightened to the lavabo and was going from right to left and left to right every time you opened it 3 The three first senders on television where not working And so on Why are the people at the reception so unfriendly Same at breakfast In normal situation an hotel employee would greet the guests here they do not You get the minimal service Fruit at the breakfast is limited to apples and oranges scrambled eggs are tasting like plastic limited choice of cereals Are you sure it is a 4 hotel , The price 
354896,Ozo Hotel, Doing Laundry was quite expensive On one occasion had Not so good experience with a staff member but he must have been having a bad night which is understandable sometimes Gym was small, Room was quite good and clean staff generally was nice and helpful Spoke English quite well would stay here again
354897,Ozo Hotel, Nothing wrong with the hotel but we had a problem purchasing metro tickets at the unmanned station the ticket machine did not take cash or international credit cards a very kind gentleman bought our tickets We had a similar problem paying for parking in Rotterdam we didn t ask at the hotel they may have been able to advise us I would recommend travellers check this out before heading to the metro , Very comfortable hotel Just a short walk to the metro station easy access to Amsterdam central 
354898,Ozo Hotel,No Negative, The black lady at reception was very indifferent and unprofessional She looked like we owe her money and so unhappy This has affected our feelings as well Very bad experience and poor service As a motel manager in NZ I can not stand this Not to mention its cleaning standard I guess it s cheap for a reason But it s not cheap 
354899,Ozo Hotel, I sent a mail to them and got a response after 24hrs and a second reminder Was expecting a quicker response time , Enjoyed the breakfast Location is near a Metro station so the hotel is easily accessible 
354900,Ozo Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was lovely was very clean The staff were very friendly The bathroom was very modern not a fan of the glass for privacy lol Great location for train services Transport was second to none would definitely go back again and stay in same hotel Weather was fab Heineken experience is a much with the canal cruise 
354901,Ozo Hotel, The rooms were too warm and the air con didn t work in my room or my friends rooms The staff weren t very helpful or friendly , The property was clean and modern The beds were very comfortable The shower had really good water pressure 
354902,Ozo Hotel, Cleaning, Beds are comfortable and location quite The bathroom is poorly designed so the water is everywhere after shower There are lipsticks marks on the pillow 
354903,Ozo Hotel, this hotel is not 4 stars hotel it is maximum 2 stars the rooms are not nice no soaps old towels very bed breakfast , this hotel is not 4 stars hotel it is maximum 2 stars the rooms are not nice no soaps old towels very bed breakfast 
354904,Ozo Hotel, The breakfast was not very fresh No water in the rooms , The bed was very comfortable The staff were lovely and we was across the road from the metro station and only 15 20 mins away from central station 
354905,Ozo Hotel, Location is difficult to navigate when traveling late night as the metros shut down and you have limited time in the Centre of the city, Comfortable bed fast wifi friendly staff
354906,Ozo Hotel, Reception staff generally not very helpful or friendly apart from the lady we met on arrival Room not very clean dirty coffee cups leaking kettle etc Had to ask for towels on 2nd day since all were removed which resulted in the aircon technician showing up in stead of the towels Room very hot so had to keep window open Lifts unreliable and slow Breakfast not great maybe suply more fruit etc It s a decent enough hotel for a one night stop to see a gig but not recommended for a longer stay and sightseeing , The room was a reasonable size and fairly modern Very close to Arena for music concerts the reason for our visit Staff at restaurant were friendly and helpful Free Wifi 
354907,Ozo Hotel, Staff on reception were miserable Not the greatest first impression on arrival Our room was not cleaned even though we put the to be cleaned sign on the door and they were in the room next door when we left for the morning so not like we missed the chance to have it done Breakfast was vile Raw potatoes undercooked bacon no coffee or hot chocolate left in the machine beans had gone brown they had been there for so long Aircon didn t work Pretty dissapointed considering the amount paid to stay , The hotel was clean and looked lovely inside and out There was a place to keep our suitcase until we checked in so we could have a look around Amsterdam before check in time without having to take the suitcase and the same when we had to check out 
354908,Ozo Hotel, Nothing around in case of want to walk to at night , Very clean room bathroom and well equipped with all high tech facilities Plenty space around room and drawers Coffee tee machine available

354910,Ozo Hotel, Unhappy staff Chasing for a working kettle Chasing for a remote control on both evenings unsure why they take them away Asking for an iron and ironing board and being thrown it when my hands were already full No water dispenser in the gym A room that wasn t very clean,No Positive
354911,Ozo Hotel, A very nice hotel but the whole experience was somewhat ruined by the glacial attitude of the woman at reception when we checked in No eye contact she seemed bored and annoyed by our mere presence there not at all helpful when we asked about the best way to get to the city centre We saw her at reception a few times during the stay and her attitude was the same most unpleasant to interact with her The rest of the staff especially the stagiares at reception were normal and nice , Comfortable room very comfortable beds nice bathroom
354912,Ozo Hotel, Staff behaviour when we didnt have the exact change Even when we asked them to pay us back the difference balance during check out instead they said that we were being difficult The hotel is far away from any grocery store or change machine and its a pity a 3 4 star hotel didnt have 270 euros in their till to pay us back even when we checked in at 10 30 at night Rest the stay at the hotel was good The lady in the staff room did not show any interest in helping either and just rudely shrugged the whole deal off ,No Positive
354913,Ozo Hotel, Both the magnetic keys of our room couldn t open our door at the evening even if we made great attention not to keep them near the mobile phones This occured 3 times and we found it quite annoying The cleaning service forgot to put the towels in our room and we had to ask for them at the reception Unfortunately the door of our shower couldn t be closed well and each time we took a shower we ended up half flooding our bathroom I found this hotel quite expansive for the general service we received , Breakfast was good The hotel position is good outside the city center but near the metro station The WIFI was good 
354914,Ozo Hotel, The lack of intimacy in the bathroom No more soap in the dispenser located in the shower, Close to the metro which takes you to the city center in 15 minutes Staff is very efficient Cosy rooms Safe deposit box and fridge in the room
354915,Ozo Hotel, Staff should be more welcoming Cleaning staff should give more privacy , Location fairly close to the Arena metro and bus station Overall nice hotel 
354916,Ozo Hotel, We booked a room with don t pay until 23 59 condition but the money was taken from the bank account exactly one day before that including the city tax which should not apply if you don t stay The room seemed to be clean at the first glance but there were black hair all over the floor and on the beds I had to ask to clean the room The staff is extremely unfriendly and slow , There is parking in the hotel 
354917,Ozo Hotel, Nothing too dislike, The staff were so friendly We got there early as our flight was early and they booked us in as soon as the room was ready which was nice of them
354918,Ozo Hotel, Location was awful Staff not very helpful girls at the reception were getting annoyed if I asked them to help me with anything Their faces were almost telling me to f off all the time I walked towards the reception I arrived to the hotel a bit earlier and had to way in the lobby for ages for my room to be ready no one notified me when it was ok to check in I had to go and ask Management should seriously do something about their staff , Honestly I wasn t happy with the hotel at all
354919,Ozo Hotel, Lacked cleanliness in the room Amenities not refilled When we arrived their was no soap in the dispensers but we brought our own thankfully The bed overlay pad was full of material knobs that could be felt through the flat sheet and the flat sheet pulled off during the night The pillows are lumpy and uncomfortable , The staff were friendly at the front desk 
354920,Ozo Hotel, For a 4 star rating I expected more than just a few green tea teabags 2 coffee sachets and 2 sugar sachet s and powdered milk The hotel is set on a commercial estate which is easy to get to from central station but felt very out the way we expected so much more With a charge of 15euros for breakfast on top of the room price We were glad we went out for breakfast Certainly puts the minimal in minimalistic The staff however were really helpful and the beds comfy but I would recommend to anyone visiting Amsterdam to try and get a room in Amsterdam central there s so much to see and do that travelling 20 odd mins from the hotel became quite a faff If we ever get another chance to see this beautiful city we will be booking into one of the cheaper hotels in the central , The hotel was clean Very minimalistic 
354921,Ozo Hotel, The receptionist wake me up 2 times after 23 00 because he had an issue with the reservation after tell him that I was sleeping and he wake me up he did it again he was really rude Poor bath complements only shampoo and gel if you need something extra you have to pay Breakfast poor orange juice diluted with water dishes dirty in the breakfast Air conditioner sometimes didn t work too cold I ask to talk with manager and he wasn t there during my stay there they gave me a fake Manager s name they don t have book for complaints AVOID THIS HOTEL , Bed confortable 
354922,Ozo Hotel, It could be even better if hotel provides use and throw basic things like toothpaste comb etc for international travelers Would be great if hotel staff can smile bit more and make you feel more welcome , Hotel was good neat and clean and looks to be newly build rooms were decent size very comfortable
354923,Ozo Hotel, The distance from town can t blame hotel because metro was being improved also ticket machine doesn t accept cash couldn t read a card chip no assistance to help you good we had our car to continue to explore city Probably that is worth knowing while booking hotel far from town without own transport , Hotel had the facilities we were looking for parking restaurant Included breakfast
354924,Ozo Hotel, Very limited menu , Triple room was a good size Easy to get in and out of the centre of Amsterdam by car or Metro It s right by the Ajax stadium so gets busy on the match day 
354925,Ozo Hotel, The walls were not sound proof and you could hear any small noise from the other rooms like when they used the bath room This was a bit inconvenient at night ,No Positive
354926,Ozo Hotel, Bit of a distance to the city centre no facilities in the area at all Staff could have been friendlier, The bed was really comfortable and the room was very big Shower was so nice too Lots of channels on the tv also 
354927,Ozo Hotel, The coffee didn t get refilled when the room was made up and the wall of the bathroom toilet is easy to see through which is weird, The bed was very comfy
354928,Ozo Hotel, I really don t have anything negative to say , The hotel itself was very nice appearance and cleanliness wise it had a luxurious vibe to it The room was great so was the bathrom The design was modern and chic the view from the room was amazing The staff was very friendly and helpful breakfast was also very good Private parking was awesome with a lot of space and the metro station was only 5 minutes walk M54 takes you straight to downtown Amsterdam 
354929,Ozo Hotel, Almost every service and facilities there is a mess they are running it like a lodge or guest house i hardly can give them 2 star ratings seriously bed was full of dust and some insects and i couldn t sleep because of allergy in my body And location is too isolated nothing nearby , only bathtub in my room rest is a mess 
354930,Ozo Hotel, Unfortunately the staff was not really friendly as I arrived the check in was a bit unpleasant which shouldn t be at all I have not been informed that there was a fitness center in the hotel and the wifi didn t work In general unfortunately I wouldn t stay at this hotel again as the value for money was in the end negative , The room was quite big and the bed was comfortable
354931,Ozo Hotel, Hotel is dark and lacks any kind of atmosphere Bar area and evening food offer is very poor and unwelcoming Staff were unfriendly and unhelpful as well as quite aggressive when you requested some service , The room though a bit bare was ok 
354932,Ozo Hotel, Never seen a hotel without a bell boy i had to carry my own bags with the help of the receptionist The breakfast is very limited and the hostesses are with attitude I also never seen a hotel that don t offer water bottles they just have a strange looking kettle which is dirty, The location was very close to where my business is taking place Receptionists are very helpfull 
354933,Ozo Hotel, The bed was lovely the first night when we arrived but then had the room freshened up and bed remade by the staff and they put a flat sheet on with out tucking it under the mattress so kept coming off ,No Positive
354934,Ozo Hotel, Staff unfriendly and unhelpful day and night No sense of customer service Aggressive if you challenged them or complain about something Bar dining room very dated and in need of upgrade The place feels old and unloved Food offer poor , The rooms were reasonably good 
354935,Ozo Hotel, There was barely any soap shower gel left in the bathroom and the matrass smelled like sweat The worst thing however was the downstairs restaurant with low quality food and appalling service , When the rooms are on offer for 65 80 euros you should probably get one all things considered In my opinion it s an okay hotel to have a brief overnight stay It s not a hotel where you go to relax or enjoy the atmosphere Has a lovely terrace outside even though it s facing the road 
354936,Ozo Hotel, The lobby carpets upstairs are dirty like they weren t vacuumed since last summer Bathrooms got a weird style glass made almost transparent you can be seen when sitting on the toilet lol They say it has air conditioning or heating system which doesnt work its preset by them at around 19 celsius degrees very cold Yellow floating mattress burnt chairs when you take a shower your bathroom is full of water no soap inside soap recipient no slippers dirty latch and they take your money when you arrive without giving invoice not even at check out if don t ask for it More like a 2 to 3 star hotel Bad management , 5min walking to the Metro station and the free parking are the only good things worth mentioning here 
354937,Ozo Hotel, When we arrived the staff we met were not very helpful or friendly The person who dealt with us at reception was adequate at best We were early for check in so we went into the eating area bar No one approached us in the 10 minutes we sat in the near empty area We eventually asked the only member of staff at the bar what the arrangements were for getting something to eat and he just handed us a menu each with not even a smile From this point on we knew we would only be using the hotel for sleeping To be fair the final night as we checked out there was a really friendly and helpful girl on reception I just wished we had the same girl to greet us when we arrived The hotel is located in the middle of a business park so do not stay here for the views It is however close to the local metro so traveling around Amsterdam is only 5 minutes walk away from the hotel when using the metro , Rooms were very clean comfortable peaceful and quiet 
354938,Ozo Hotel, The hotel charged is more than what I had originally booked the hotel for claiming for city tax however was not informed about this at the time of booking , The bed was soooo comfy 
354939,Ozo Hotel, The Hotel is convenient for the business area surrounding but not for Amsterdam Centre I am no a fan of wet rooms as a bathroom layout , Nice quiet and comfortable room good size bathroom 
354940,Ozo Hotel, Room very cold 18 deg C at arrival and slow heating to 21 deg C during the night Very slow restaurant bar and poor selection for dinner , Nice clean rooms 
354941,Ozo Hotel, NO HEATING FAULTY BLOCKED NEWS CHANNEL ON TV POOR UNTRAINED WEEKEND STAFF BROKEN SOAP DISPENSER BROKEN PHONE BROKEN KETTLE NO INFO PACK, AFTER MANY YEARS TRAVELLING WOULD RATE AS AVERAGE FOR A 2 STAR IN MY EXPERIENCE 42 YEARS OF TRAVEL IT IS NOT A 4 STAR SHAME AS IT COULD EASILY BE 
354942,Ozo Hotel, The bar was closed early on Sunday evening I wanted to relax downstairs and have some tea but it wasn t possible , Rooms very nice and clean very good for the money liked the shower 
354943,Ozo Hotel, Too far from city center It takes around one hour just to get to the place where you can have reasonable lunch dinner, Excellent room good breakfast hi speed Wi fi
354944,Ozo Hotel, 1 It was awful from housekeeping and cleaning points Everything they did is just making up a bed A floor was dusty and they even didn t remove used tea packets near a teapot I m not telling about refilling our tea selection package What s so difficult about cleaning up the room if we left on 10 AM and were back by 10 PM Not even clean up the floor I was frustrated this time and will test other options nearby next time in Amsterdam Shame on you OZO That s not even close to 4 stars were those Egyptian ones 2 The hotel is in a business park Now views at all All rooms are decent service is not 3 The double room has twin beds two matrasses That was not good at all , 1 The hotel is convenient for car travelers The parking was for FREE in AMSTERDAM 
354945,Ozo Hotel, Very cold at night because of bad A C a little bit far away from Centraal And the price is for such a hotel expinsive In my opinion it deserve max 3 Star and there are better options in Amsterdam than it Anyway best Regards to the Staff ,No Positive
354946,Ozo Hotel, We requested a late checkout by 2 hours and were granted However staff opened our hotel door twice during this time Very rude , Good location free parking was really nice 
354947,Ozo Hotel, Beds so unconfortable its a joke miles away from city center beter bookin a 3 star hotel in city center as this hotel is nothing special at all, Staff friendly thats all
354948,Ozo Hotel, The room is very small for 2 persons it must be a single room The bathroom is almost inside the bedroom there is a gap between the door and the ceiling The bathroom transparency from the outside The cupboard is very small Cleaning service badly organized Poor communication from the reception staff, The Parking The breakfast the staff in the restaurant bar The Bed LCD Screen room decoration
354949,Ozo Hotel,No Negative, The bed was very comfortable and a lovely large size Great choice of food for breakfast The hotel was in an ideal location and the staff were helpful and welcoming 
354950,Ozo Hotel, Not much to complain about Typically at hotels of this kind the lobby area is more interesting and alive It s grey brownish The restaurant food at the hotel is so so not bad but not what it could have been , I you have work to do nearby then this is for you It s a solid basic quality work hotel Clean and simple I d stay here again 
354951,Ozo Hotel, The breakfast was freezing cold The tea and coffee in the room should have also had small pots of milk and not powdered I booked this on 9th June 16 and the price was 133 but on arrival i was charged 166 dont think this is fair or appropriate if you book that far in advance the price should be as it was on booking , The hotel was nice but i asked for a twin room I also thought that the window walls for the bathroom were inappropriate for my teenage daughter and myself 
354952,Ozo Hotel, The pillows were hard to get accustomed to and the beds slid quiet easily a thin mattress on top of the bed base Kettle was broken on arrival and quiet small for three had to be boiled several times , The staff were very helpful with any requests Very clean and modern hotel closely located to the metro Very quiet so sleep was not an issue Bathroom was BEAUTIFUL and housekeeping were meticulous 
354953,Ozo Hotel, We were a group of friends sharing a family room and felt the bathroom glass wall design provided little privacy , The staff was very friendly and the room was bright and spacious Despite being located outside the city center it was easy and fast to access everything with the metro and train stations nearby Really enjoyed our stay would definitely stay there again 
354954,Ozo Hotel, Noone welcomes you at the gate You have to carry your luggages till your room The bathroom is in the room surrounded with an opal glass so no privacy Small room Empty fridge even no water No slippers for the bathroom No toothpaste ear stick or cotton in the bathroom The location is an empty silent business area , Close to metro clean rooms very comfortable beds good working heating system smiling personnel
354955,Ozo Hotel, Do NOT get the taxis They are so expensive A 10minute trip from the airport to the hotel cost us 70 , The hotel is quite a distance from the centre of Amsterdam However everyone speaks very good English and the trains are really easy and go straight to the centre of Amsterdam It cost us 17 for a three day ticket and we could use that anywhere in Amsterdam It also included the trams so we felt it was really good value The hotel is clean and well equipped It is very modern
354956,Ozo Hotel, Poor service at the bar restaurant Floor in the room is sticky Towels not replaced and missing Mattress not comfy Error with check out pricing , Hotel situation since it is next to my office
354957,Ozo Hotel,No Negative, Very sterile sort of hotel would be good if you were staying only for business The rooms are clean however the double bed was two beds pushed together Which I don t think is acceptable when you are paying 150 for a night Location is in the middle of nowhere however is only a 5 minute walk to a metro getting into central Amsterdam will take around 40 minutes Half an hour in a taxi from the airport 
354958,Ozo Hotel, I did not like the bed the pillow were very small and our light kept going on and off whilst we were trying to get ready when we arrived at the hotel we wanted to pay in pounds and they refused this Our hotel had no local shops it was only a McDonald s which was 10 min walk next time I visit Amsterdam I would stay local by the city,No Positive
354959,Ozo Hotel, very expensive considering it was 9 stops on metro to city centre and could do with shower facilities for guests that have checked out in morning but not going till evening, very nice room didn t have breakfast to expensive
354960,Ozo Hotel, I really don t think that you can class this hotel 4 when I arrived there were not towels so I had to ask at the desk for some I came back to the hotel from the city around 23 15 and there was no room service available nor were any of their cafes restaurants open for me to get food On the website it says that both the Savoy Cafe and Bar are open until 24 00 Mon Sunday but neither were open at 23 15 The only way I could get food or drinks was from a vending machine with limited choices There s no way of turning off the lights which are within the bathroom mirror which meant I had a poor night sleep I feel like I am being harsh as the staff were friendly but there is no way this is a 4 hotel and given I paid 150 EUR for 1 night I found it a little disappointing , The location of the hotel is great for business trips because you are close to the business parks and also to the metro station that takes you straight into the heart of Amsterdam takes about 15 minutes Staff were also friendly 
354961,Ozo Hotel, Room was not ready after we checked in an 1 1 2 after normal time and the family and I had to move to another room on a different floor , 5 minute walk to tram train station gas station close by breakast was good and free parking a huge plus 
354962,Ozo Hotel, staff were quite rude We were informed by email we could check in earlier because our flight was in before 2 but the staff were not v accommodating at all and quite rude Won t be coming back , Beds comfortable and place was safe
354963,Ozo Hotel, Location was in an out of town industrial area which was quite disconcerting for 2 women walking alone at night , Comfortable beds and big shower space
354964,Ozo Hotel, Bathroom daily cleanliness, Wonderful friendly staff I highly recommend Ozo hotel to my friends I go to Amsterdam every year I will chose Ozo again
354965,Ozo Hotel, I would improve slippery floor in the shower that s my only concern , Safe in the room free of charge as well as fridge and refreshments Just 2 minutes walk to the metro station which reach the town centre and other directions Nice staff We like it all cannot complain 
354966,Ozo Hotel, I only wish they had paper towels or hand wipes in the rooms , Staying at OZO was good and we almost didn t find any faults The hotel interior is modern and clean and our stay generally was spot on service checked breakfast checked staffs were hospitable helpful and serviceable and above all smiling It was a pleasurable stay that we wouldn t imagine staying at any other hotel in Amsterdam than hotel OZO 
354967,Ozo Hotel, Housekeeping personnel were a little aggressive about getting into the room to clean We felt rushed to get out of the room and it was only 1000 and we were staying another night , Room was very comfortable and clean The metro was a 2 minute walk from the hotel very convenient 
354968,Ozo Hotel, Check in time was a little late at 2pm but luckily when I arrived at 6am the hotel was able to look after my suitcase until check in time Also check out time was very early at 11am especially when packing a suitcase back up , Beautiful room lovely hotel very clean 3 minute walk from a metro station and only 10 minute train journey to dam square so great location Staff were extremely helpful and most spoke English 
354969,Ozo Hotel, 1 Staff when a wake up time is requested the staff should act on it and then follow up to ensure the resident is notified 2 Non privacy of bathroom 3 Maintenance didn t make repairs in ample time ,No Positive
354970,Ozo Hotel,No Negative, The quiteness and cleanliness after a stressful and scary incident happened during our trip i feel so relaxed and safe staying in this hotel Staff are so friendly and beautiful 
354971,Ozo Hotel, Unfortunately hotel rooms wasn t very clean there was hair everywhere and finger prints even after I addressed this to reception staff I still came back to same fingerprints and hair And another very confusing disappointment was that they took money from my card couple of days in advance and also made me pay at the reception desk And I only received money back to my card 2 weeks later As hotel is not really a value for money it was big hit on holiday budget , We loved that hotel had free parking and metro was 2 min walk We saved so much on parking costs Metro to town centre was 10mins Design of hotel was very nice Beds in hotel are very comfortable Reception staff is very polite and helpful 
354972,Ozo Hotel, not so many varieties for breakfast bed was not very comfortable especially the pillows , clean easy to reach the centre with the metro 5 mins walk from the hotel
354973,Ozo Hotel, Nothing, Free parking very clean and very good buffet breakfast Within walking distance from the arena and 5 min walks to the metro which will take you to the centre of Amsterdam in 20 min Will defenitly return if back to Amsterdam 
354974,Ozo Hotel, I would have liked to have a snack or bar menu available rather than a restaurant menu I wanted a light bite before going out and this was not possible it was all large courses A toastie or a salad but this was absent on their menu , It was within walking distance to the Heineken Music Hall which is why I was there Modern clean very good breakfast Well fed with public transport easy to get to from Schipol
354975,Ozo Hotel, Food in restaurant probably the worst 22 Rib Eye steak I have eaten chewy stringy and potatoes re heated Suggest they change the menu or improve quality of the meat and serve French fries they are twice cooked but taste good Had to move rooms because the TV would not switch off remote worked but TV couldn t even be switched off manually The faulty TV was apparently fixed the next morning , Decor in the rooms is really nice and the rooms are spacious Location very easy to find right off highway No noise from outside rooms well sound proofed Free Parking and Wifi worked well Would stay here again 
354976,Ozo Hotel, Not specific unfavorable points Parking was OK still had some available place , I arrived late I had informed and the counter person was kind enough I just slept and left in the morning and I could use the vending machine of water snacks and fitness booth Simple and quite OK 
354977,Ozo Hotel, Toilet with glass walls is unusual and quiet strange May lead to unpleasant situation if traveling with people you are not totally familiar with, Breakfast was very good Room was quiet and comfortable
354978,Ozo Hotel, Tried to get me to pay by card when I took the Euros specifically to pay cash Said it was for my and their safety nonsense Extra charges for me to pay by card abroad , Very handy for music hall trains bed and shower were extra good Night security sent the pizza delivery driver up to our room too at 01 30am so this was a bonus 
354979,Ozo Hotel, The staff at reception waited to be directly addressed rather than taking the initiative to ask if they could help I couldn t tell if the were busy or just ignoring me when i arrived they were very polite and helpful once i got their attention , It s very close to the metro station so it has good access to the airport It s within walking distance of the music venue i was going to the heineken music hall 
354980,Ozo Hotel, There are plenty stuff we didn t like about and here it follows 1 The staff has no clue about the services on how to respond to customer questions 2 For everything they contact the manager to get clarified 3 They speak terrible English 4 When asked about city tours and any other information regarding the city they simply ask you to contact the tourist info Yes Thank you I know that but you are locals or at least working in Amsterdam so get to know about your city and help your clients in providing basic info 5 Hired bunch of immature staff 6 Room was decent asked for queen size bed before hand while booking but they have joined two beds and made it look like one 7 Didnt even clean the trash it was left there when we entered I have traveled to so many countries and lived at places ranging from 3 star to 5 star The staff have always been the best and the rooms were very well kept worth the price untill i bumped in to this hotel Not worth your money total ripper I would never recommend to any of my friends and family to this hotel I would rather pay the same amount and try to live in the center Tip to management 1 Respect your customers 2 Provide proper training to your staff 3 Encourage to give away complimentary stuffs products for your customers for the high prices you charge for , Private parking is for free That s the only good grace Room was decent 
354981,Ozo Hotel, hotel is not as one expect a 4 to be at all no consumables small room poor shower cleanliness could be improved worst part was they blocked me 100E on credit card as warranty 7 days before arrival then they wanted me to pay everything on arrival as i had no cash they made me make the payment at 01 00am when i come back the same evening as they didn t trust me enough to wait the morning after with money already blocked on my account no good, location is great big free car park very nice bar
354982,Ozo Hotel, When we arrived we got a room which had no proper keys working and the staff was so uninterested in helping after some tough talks the staff unwillingly gave a different room with two beds where i had requested for a king size bed Later the staff came to room with a complimentary wine but for me was too late as the damage was done its annoying when you arrive late in the night driving for almost 8 hours and you get such reception, Connectivity to the city center is easy but 15 20 min travel
354983,Ozo Hotel, First of all we ve received a room with a dirty floor and after we ve got another room The hotel is not really what we were expecting for that money The colors into the rooms are really sad not too many amenities and I didn t liked also the bathroom with a glass wall The room was quite cold also , fast wifi connexion loction was also quite ok
354984,Ozo Hotel, Sheets weren t changed for 5 days I had to ask at reception When eating dinner in the restaurant the OWNER walked around lighting a candle on every table even the ones with a man sitting alone yet she walked past me and my boyfriend eating a meal together You get what you pay for in terms of the room but the extra facilities and some staff are definitely not 4 , The rooms are lovely and clean Few members of staff very helpful 30 minute underground ride into centraal station 
354985,Ozo Hotel, A bit remote on a business park with little in the way of shops or restaurants close by Hotel hard to find first time as no signs on building as you approach from the Metro station it has it s back to the path road Pillows very from and uncomfortable , Clean modern hotel only a 15 minute ride to central Amsterdam by Metro Good value base if you want nothing more than a room for the night 
354986,Ozo Hotel, The staff does not seem to care and the management isn t interested in making certain they are following up Nice top floor corner room with windows on two sides except the blinds on the window on one side were broken The manager on duty assured me the blinds would be fixed the next day Wrong not fixed at all Missed some nice sunny weather in my room with 2 windows Asked for a wake up call Didn t happen When I asked about it the desk person claimed loudly she called me Next day at check out I asked again the desk manager said the person called the wrong room Come on Can t you train people to perform the basics Surprised their phone system doesn t allow the customer to set up his own alarm No care employees and managers not watching what happens , I stay often here A modern hotel away from the city and near the Metro 
354987,Ozo Hotel, The staff was unfriendly bored and not interested in the customer Too busy talking with each other The rooms lack personality and reminded me of the movie Lost in translation , Clean simple close to the metro station 
354988,Ozo Hotel, They should clean bathroom better found a little bit hair in sink and shower not so dangerous , Gooe location friendly stuff good interne very beautiful hotel amazing bed and room 
354989,Ozo Hotel, Overpriced for the location Poor and overpriced breakfast Small room Bathroom separated from the bedroom by a single dull glas Toilet in the bathroom no intimacy, Comfortable bed
354990,Ozo Hotel, The lifts are filthy they need to learn how to clean inox the breakfast wasn t great and the sheets on the beds too small so didn t stay tucked in ,No Positive
354991,Ozo Hotel, The quality of the bed mattress the wi fi was always cracking the shower flood the entire bathroom the awful surroundings mainly enterprises offices the parking place despite free was not ease to find and the staff was not that professional Conclusion concerning the price that i pay for a 4 hotel i was very disappointed , Well the only positive point is maybe the subway location 5min walking from the hotel 
354992,Ozo Hotel, The hotel is in a typical business area with blocks of offices around Ikea quite close too No cafes near no places to eat and nothing to see really You need to take a tube 10 minute walk to go to the city At night one of the guests drunk was banning at our door making a lot of noise so couldn t have a peaceful night Considering location far from city attractions terribly expensive not reflected in any luxury , Quiet area 
354993,Ozo Hotel, I missed a little bit storage space in the bathroom and there could 2 or 3 more clothes hanger in the wardrobe It s a 20min travel Metro Walk away from the City Center in favour Arena with some Shops Cinema and Restaurants is nearby , Quite new facilty and furniture Everything seems modern and clean Bed is big and comfortable Flat TV and fast wifi available too 
354994,Ozo Hotel, The pillows were awful could only get ice from the bar no buckets had to use a glass to get it for your room no fitted sheets on bed so the mattress was easily uncovered with any movement and made the room feel cheap and uncomfortable , The location was great Minutes to metro and trains 
354995,Ozo Hotel, The hotel is not within walking distance from the city centre Nevertheless it is very close to the metro station Bijlmer station Once you get there city centre is less than 10 15 min ride In addition connection is very frequent Also some people might find the toilet a little uncomfortable since it is separated from the rest of the room not with a wall but with a somewhat transparent glass It was a little awkward but it definitely allows for more room space , The hotel is very close to the metro station Moreover it is within walking distance from Amsterdam Arena area where you can find a lot of restaurants mini markets and coffee shops the usual ones such as Starbucks for example The room was modern and clean 
354996,Ozo Hotel, We came at around 4 30PM for check in and our room still wasn t ready we had to wait for a cleaner to come back On the pillow and in the bathroom there were long hairs from past customers none of us has long hair The room for 3 persons was too small and it was obviously designed for 2 just two places to hang coats Definitely not worth the money 220 eur night as it was also far away from city center in some new business district where the only shop in vicinity was Ikea , Hotel was modern newly built 
354997,Ozo Hotel, No bathroom wall It s a cloudy shaded glass wall which doesn t give enough privacy Pillows were too big and uncomfortable , Free parking but limited spaces Close to metro station Good breakfast Room looks nice but smaller than expected 
354998,Ozo Hotel, The staff were a bit out of line and refused to give us our room as we had arrived at 5am and I asked if he could check us in earlier and I will pay for the 8hours But he refused and left us to wonder what to do For 8hours he asked me to pay twice what I had payed for the 2 rooms, The rooms were nice and clean
354999,Ozo Hotel, Not too fond of just a sheet of smoked glass separating the bathroom from the living area Being able to see a silhouette of someone sitting on the toilet including sound effects is not very appealing , Its a very short walk to the metro 
355000,Ozo Hotel, Not really got a bad word to say One tiny thing would have been nice to have a guide folder in the rooms with the hotel info facilities meal times menus etc As mentioned this is the only negative I can think of it and certainly didn t wreck our stay not having one Can t really fault the hotel itself , Awesome receptionist we arrived a couple hours earlier than our supposed check in time thinking we would have to hang around the bar for a while however as our rooms were ready she gave us the keys which was a massive help Rooms were really nice and also spotless Free easy wifi I d stay here again At first I thought the location was an absolute mission from the centre but it s just a short walk to the metro or you can walk down a bit further 5 mins and go to the next station Bijlmer ArenA It s 11 minutes to from airport from here 
355001,Ozo Hotel, Unfortunately for our first night we were give room 003 ground floor I have never slept so poorly in a hotel before You can hear the intermittent sound of running water through the vents like sleeping next to a waterfall In the morning when we complained the staff said they knew it was a problem and they try to avoid putting people there We were given no compensation not even free breakfast and had to pretty much beg for a room change Completely unacceptable that if this is a known problem that people are still being allocated these rooms Some of the staff were friendly here but a couple of the reception staff really could do with smiling once in a while , Breakfast was good beds were comfy and the room was spotlessly clean 
355002,Ozo Hotel, Breakfastroom opened at 8 o clock only So I had to get a breakfast takeaway which was not really tasty I missed breakfast the second day though having paid for it It was not offered , very quiet rooms friendly peaple at the front desk 
355003,Ozo Hotel, Superficially a nice hotel but the rooms were cold no carpets I really hated having to pay upfront on checking in Room was not very well cleaned and nothing used was replaced eg plastic beakers All in all a hotel that seemed like verything is done to cut costs I won t be staying there again , not much
355004,Ozo Hotel, It was very dirty we had ti change our room because sheets were full of hairs not vlean at all Road to metro station at night is quiet scary because it is businesses area and no people around in the night,No Positive
355005,Ozo Hotel, I can t think of anything that I feel strongly enough about to list here , I travel a lot for work and the 4 main items I look for in a hotel are location to the office cleanliness a comfortable bed and a nice shower This hotel aced all of these aspects And to crown everything else there had a UK plug in the room I would reccomend this hotel to all my fellow travellers 
355006,Ozo Hotel, Pillows are too thick The walk from the metro station to the hotel in the dark is not very pleasent for a woman on her own , Comfortable modern room Nice shower Very friendly staff 
355007,Ozo Hotel, The heater did not work So it was cool in the room , The bed was very comfortable Breakfast very tasty Price of breakfast 15 it is moderate and acceptable for Amsterdam
355008,Ozo Hotel, The location was a bit off but the station was only a few minutes away , We loved the service the fast Wi Fi the disabled facilities friendly staff and a well maintained hotel 
355009,Ozo Hotel, There doesn t seem to be a huge amount to do in the immediate vicinity but it s so easy to hop on the metro toward the city centre that it doesn t really matter , Great value Easy metro journey to Amsterdam Centraal Really helpful staff and the best night sleep I have had in a very long time 
355010,Ozo Hotel, Parking was not very good we got blocked in and had to wait an hour so that we could leave very little parking place for such a large hotel and no other parking in the immediate area very disapointing , The breakfast was good and the location is excellent for a vist to the ziggo dome or arena but I think a bit overprized 
355011,Ozo Hotel, The only thing was that you could hear everything that goes on in the bathroom and no call to say when check out time is as we got charged extra , The hotel room was big and decorated nicely with tea and coffe facilities Was within walking distance to the station and not a long train journey into the city As it was our first time in Amsterdam the staff when we checked in we re very helpful and told us the best places to go in the centre 
355012,Ozo Hotel, Quite expensive for an average hotel room and service I didn t like that only an opaque glass door wall separated it from the bedroom I wouldn t say the service was particularly friendly , It was clean and was close to the metro 10 minute walk 
355013,Ozo Hotel, Bathroom with look through wall Complicated airco system Rather far from the city center located between offices , quality of the bed Cleaness of the room Close to metro stop 
355014,Ozo Hotel, breakfast was not very good and they didn t gave much choice especially for cheese and ham The staff was not nice at all except maybe one young guy who was smiling to us , The bed was good
355015,Ozo Hotel, When you make a booking on booking com and they will increase it will increase it with large amount at reception I made a booking on booking with amount of 59Euros and they charged my card of 67 plus euros while I show them the amount on booking com They use to this all the time at reception , Nothing 
355016,Ozo Hotel, Although I booked a room with a double bed I got a room with twin bed I should have requested a change upon arrival but failed to do so , Nice room clean and everything you need Close to highway public transportation and IKEA Quite cheap rooms for a 4 star hotel 
355017,Ozo Hotel, Fridge empty in the room and is very bad charge 7euro for bottle of water breakfast not look very fresh, Free parking near the underground good for money
355018,Ozo Hotel, The door of the shower was not properly sealed the water came under the door and this area was totally wet The breakfast was not a four star standard e g the scrambled eggs and bacon were cold and there was only one person available in this area on our table empty plates and cups and and glasses were not collected as they should have been , good location free parking Metro 500 metre from Hotel very good Metro service 
355019,Ozo Hotel, The complicated room phone with no instructions the restaurant as is today should be avoided I was served items I did not order with the explanation that s what you ordered When shown the menu the waitress response was that s the same thing as what you ordered when it clearly was not And the pillows on the beds a common complaint on this site Why can this hotel not use normal pillows Go to any other hotel to see what a normal pillow is if you need a detailed explanation The breakfast is uninspiring even for Amsterdam standards which are relatively low Includes the cheap bagged tea in the breakfast bar , If you can live with the downsides it isn t a bad for an Amsterdam hotel It is in a quiet location without the noise and distractions of city center yet is close to public transportation The rooms are of a good size 
355020,Ozo Hotel, Between the bedroom and the toilet glass wall for some people this is might be uncomfortable Out the shower a lot of water flows to the floor Bad clearing of the room Hotel HOLD money for the rooms we book two rooms but can t accept my card on reception we should pay by cache and now money still in HOLD 30 days gone , Free parking Convenient location 5 minute walk to metro station Good WiFi Comfortable big bed 
355021,Ozo Hotel, No washcloths no kleenex a mattress lacked a mattress cover and when corrected they did not put a sheet over the msttress cover, Very friendly pleasant staff
355022,Ozo Hotel, The pillows were a but uncomfortable but that s a small detail that the hotel can easily fix , Hotel is modern and very clean Staff are very helpful The location is perfect for going to the Amsterdam arena or Heineken music hall 
355023,Ozo Hotel,No Negative, Exellent location outside the city center but very easy to get there in 20 min with a direct metro line from Central Station Very clean high confort nicest staff 
355024,Ozo Hotel, the bathroom was quite visible from the bed everything happened in the bathroom you could see and hear from the bedroom so not that pleasent also do not leave plastic bags with stuff on the table cause the cleaning ladys will throw it away they threw away my biscuits , The hotel was really nice the metro station very close the restaurant also good the wifi works very well 
355025,Ozo Hotel, It is located near a commercial area so not much to see around I was staying overnight for an early flight the next morning so it was fine to me , Clean and tidy Thank you for arranging the room at the corner so I can see the very nice sunrise 
355026,Ozo Hotel, I have to agree with some comments about the air con It can t be turned off so did come home with a sore throat If you use the 54 metro on leaving the station turn right for the hotel or hop off the metro station before and get a cab to the hotel door for 10 Great for weary feet and heavy cases , Ok first of alll this hotel is not city centre but a good 15 min metro ride will get you to and from the city This was expected and totally fine as a veteran of Amsterdam it is nice to get out of the city On checking in the receptionist was prompt and efficient getting us settled into our room The room itself was very nice with a good view of the office block opposite it s a business district folks but the stadium is a 10 min walk The bed was a great size for the 2 of us as were the pillows And comfy the room was quiet apart from some overexcited residents in the wee small hours enjoying themselves but it is the Dam Tea and coffee in the room and an awesome shower with hilarious frosted glass made for interesting fun Also had a good size telly for the rainy afternoon and you ll pick up Comedy Central and Bbc1 2 The dinner and breakfast although slightly overpriced breakfast more than dinner was lovely with plenty to go round All in all brilliant Would def stay again Thanks to the staff at the hotel 
355027,Ozo Hotel, We staid 2 nights First night we asked for extra towels as the entire bathroom was flooded after a shower The next day we told reception about that and there was a note made Still our room was not clean when we came back at 4 pm We wanted to relax shower etc before the concert but was not possible We complained at reception but staff did not handle it very well We had to tell them how to react we both work in tourism hospitality and how they could compensate it The only thing they wanted to offer was another room but we did not want that as we did not have much time and we did not want to pack and unpack again Reception manager even laughed while we were explaining the matter Got an email that evening from the reception manager that we get a 30 discount and we can get that back at check out the next morning Receptionist at check out did not know about the refund and supervisor was called Very rude person same one who took complaint the morning before he did not want to give us the money in cash although we paid in cash and he did not admit he didn t pass our message on the morning before All together a very unpleasant experience Very bad that the bar was closed after we came back from the concert approx 23h , Good location as we were going to a concert in the Ziggo Dome Also good train connection to city center Nice rooms and good breakfast 
355028,Ozo Hotel, The hotel is in an area with few amenities Proximity to the metro negates this to an extent but of you want something other than hotel breakfast coffee it requires a bit of a trek , Close to metro stop once you realised to get off the metro from centraal and use the exit towards the direction the train is going then turn right out of the station Only a 3 minute walk from there About 10 minute walk to the arena if getting the train to the airport 
355029,Ozo Hotel, Everything was great apart from the location Even though it is very well connected and only a short walk to the metro station we felt that it was not so nice to walk late at night from the metro station to the hotel It didn t seem unsafe but it is a very very dead area at night as it is all offices there Minor nuisance The shower was leaking into the main area of the bathroom Overall still a very good hotel , Great room comfy bed clean and functional bathroom excellent wife good service from the staff All in all very good hotel 
355030,Ozo Hotel, Staff wants to clean up so bad that they sometimes ignore Do not disturb request which obviously is not set for no reason , Really enjoyed it Location is ok if you don t mind spending 10 15 minutes in a comfortable metro train There s literally a 5 minute walk to the metro station and 15 minute walk to the train bus hub Coffie tea in the room is right for people who like lazy mornings with cup of hot drink 
355031,Ozo Hotel, A C without operating manual Very difficult to understand the system Was very cold at first, Nice and friendly hotel near Amsterdam Zuid Oost business centre Fair prices for room
355032,Ozo Hotel, The hotel very dirty there is a hair on the floor very cold and no heating very bad staff they make fun and laughf on the gustes the girls there bring there boy friend and drunk very bad hotel to go , Nothing to say very bad 
355033,Ozo Hotel, Slippers were missing and this is something I was not expecting from a 4 star hotel , Clean good location close to the metro station and 20 minutes away from Amsterdam Centraal by metro possibility to adjust temperature as needed TV good internet quality 
355034,Ozo Hotel, Location wasnt too far from city centre but taxis cost a fortune to get there around 30 single journey The beds wete very uncomfortable pillows were terrible the double bed was just 2 singles put together and the mattesses wete sliding off all the time Very hard to sleep on , Beautiful clean hotel very modern 
355035,Ozo Hotel, Location is fine but takes a metro train to get to almost anything interesting in Amsterdam aside from the complex that includes the Heineken Music Hall which is very nearby , New hotel new fixtures everything works 
355036,Ozo Hotel, Confusion at check in the young woman with long straight blond hair tried to charge me for 2 nites although I d successfully changed my booking on Booking to only 1 She searched and said they had not received the Booking email change The pillows are either far too big or these cylinders neither very good , I had a large room with a big empty area in the middle The room s small narrow desk was not good for working I asked for a table to partly fill the space so I could work instead Marco at the reception let me use an empty conference room for the evening Great 
355037,Ozo Hotel, The bathroom isn t very intimate The walls are made of glass and you can see the shadows inside , Very cosy hotel Very efficient staff Rooms are well furnished and very clean Quiet location and excellent soundproofing A bit far from downtown Amsterdam but it s only a five minutes walk and a 15 minutes metro ride from central station 
355038,Ozo Hotel, Breakfast menu was standard and unchanged for all the 5 days that I spent at the hotel Some variety is desirable, Was close to my office and also reachable from the metro 
355039,Ozo Hotel, Room had temperature setup for 18 degrees of Celsius which is a bit cold when you enter Some pre warming would be nice , Location very nice room good breakfast
355040,Ozo Hotel, Some staff were very good other cared not about service pot luck which ones you found Bar often closed 45 minutes earlier than advertised by disinterested staff When a fellow guest wanted to complain about an unrelated small matter the owner of the hotel denied who he was , Compared with other hotels in the area if you book early rates are pretty good if not it s expensive Rooms are nice clean and modern but a little small and sparse 
355041,Ozo Hotel, Didn t like the toilet glass walls even if they are faded still you can see someone sitting on the toilet , Clean nice room very friendly and helpful staff
355042,Ozo Hotel, Location is more of a business office district with few nearby amenities Still a bit of a walk to the Metro station but not unbearable For 15e per person the breakfast buffet was a bit overpriced for what is offered , Nice European hotel with very nice staff and clean rooms Suited us well for 3 persons senior parents with an adult son 
355043,Ozo Hotel, very far from city center and isolated Very good for business trips but not suitable for vacation, Room is spacious comfortable well equipped generally very nice
355044,Ozo Hotel, We were attending a music festival in the Amsterdam arena which finished very late each night as a result we stayed in bed late each day and missed the room cleaning each day , The rooms were very nice we loved the glass bathrooms
355045,Ozo Hotel, It is not in the city centre Anyway you can easily solve this problem with the metro which is just 5 10 minutes walking distance from the hotel, New hotel very clean with good quality of furnitures staff very helpful and gentle perfect if you need to attend an event at Amsterdam Arena
355046,Ozo Hotel,No Negative, Clean No Nonsense hotel with friendly staff Not my first choice for a romantic stay in Amsterdam but conveniently close to the subway Bullewijk and railway station Amsterdam Bijlmer Arena for easy and quick access to Amsterdam city Schiphol airport and other places of interest 
355047,Ozo Hotel, Although the distance from the town centre enabled us to experience the fantastic travel in Amsterdam it is a bit of a journey from the city centre meaning we couldn t nip back to the hotel if needed to , The hotel is lovely and modern with friendly staff We had our flights cancelled on the way home and the Ozo team were very happy to help us even offering us free breakfast on the further two days we had to stay for 
355048,Ozo Hotel, No shops around the hotel breakfast expensive, Excellent staff The apprentice receptionist helped me through data transfer from my handycam with patience although it took an hour at the reception desk And I got a four bed room for a single bed booking Couldn t stretch my legs more Thank you
355049,Ozo Hotel, I found the checking in process very time consuming It took 2 members of staff quite a while to assist a group of 4 people who were before me I would have called someone else to check me in but this didn t happen I wasn t apologised to either For some reason the hotel had me down for 1 night less than I paid for and had to re activate my door key This caused problems on the real check out day as I was told I had a balance to pay which wasn t true I would rather stay somewhere else when I next visit Amsterdam The hotel staff were not very polite and their lack of customer service skills was rather disappointing The buffet breakfast was extremely over priced I went into town each day and had breakfast in one of the many restaurants at a fraction of the price For what the hotel charge whether you book directly with them or via a web site I think breakfast should be included or reduced significantly , The hotel is close to the train station It s about 5 min walk There s also a Mc Donald s nearby and Costa There are bus stops within walking distance but I found it easier to walk to the train station The hotel was quiet I stayed there during term time so not many kids The rooms are of a decent size and they have enough lights plug sockets etc I love the bathroom It s very luxurious 
355050,Ozo Hotel, The bed wasn t comfortable at all The room is not clean The floor and room get Soo cold in unbelievable way And heater it takes time to warm up No privacy for bathroom The breakfast very poor choice Its far away from center city, 10 minutes walking to metro station
355051,Ozo Hotel, Not well thought through setup bathroom floor totally wet after showering glass bathroom walls a bit strange a bit noisy , Best deal close to ziggo dome
355052,Ozo Hotel, Check out was very early on the Sunday Also I arrived in Amsterdam at 8 30 Friday morning so I was carrying bag around the city until 2 00 pm to check in, It was very close to the venue which was brilliant Very close to a train station Staff were very helpful 
355053,Ozo Hotel, I think we could have had dressing gown s and slippers in the room I aslo didn t like the glass around the bathroom you could see people on the toilet , The bed was comfy the room was clean and it was excellent just for me and my friend 
355054,Ozo Hotel, Had to phone home I had no mobile Could not do this from anywhere in the hotel or email The staff did not seem too bothered Shower dripped frequently all night Pillow rock hard with no softer alternative No remote for the tv No info about the city or hotel facilities in the room, Clean and tidy
355055,Ozo Hotel, I did not like that the name of the individual staying in the 2nd room that I booked was not listed it was listed under my name even though I gave his name , the staff are very efficient and friendly 
355056,Ozo Hotel, The managers policy of pumping cold A C air into the rooms that you THE OCCUPANT can t switch off IT S THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER This hotel was FREEZING COLD Night front desk staff was totally unhelpful The black dude should get a job in madam tussauds cos he s brilliant at standing on the spot and doing nothing If you are the kind of person that breaks into a sweat just getting out of a chair or bed yes you know who you are then this freezing cold hotel is just the place for you For normal folks give the place a miss unless you want to freeze , Pleasant decor
355057,Ozo Hotel, See through light box as a toilet which is not private or comfortable cold vinyl floors no bathrobes or slippers to compensate No nice views and staff not very helpful at all everything seemed like a bother to any one of them,No Positive
355058,Ozo Hotel, Very poor breakfast selection and tinned fruit not acceptable Not enough choice or flexibility of menu for breakfast either Room only cleaned every day after 4pm not acceptable especially when I stayed there for 5 days, most of the staff very pleasant room very clean and location good
355059,Ozo Hotel, Location in general if not related to conf or gameday is not perfect , On a conf close to Amsterdam arena so in that case it was a good location Nice bed and good breakfast 
355060,Ozo Hotel, It was the first time in my life when I have been charged twice for the rooms I have paid cash during check in After talking to their manager they said they will contact me later to deal with this I have not heard anything for a few days so I contacted them they said it was their mistake and they will send me the money back one week after still no refund and no answer from their side Something it s suspicious about this hotel and their way of doing business and I will suggest no other travelers to use it Also the staff from the restaurant was very untrained not courteous and a bit arrogant you cannot come directly to the table and ask what do you want to have without even showing the menu ,No Positive

355062,Ozo Hotel, take very long to answer email and simply do not answer email enquiry until i call them when checking out i was told the hotel would send receipt by email but 3 days passed i got nothing i sent email to remind them no answer , nice and clean
355063,Ozo Hotel, I would suggest there should be covers for the food in the warm buffet , The hotel is brand new and is in perfect condition The showers towels bed everything suggests luxury Close to public transport it is a great choice to visit Amsterdam The breakfast buffet offers a very nice selection of food for 14 euros 
355064,Ozo Hotel, Sheets were DIRTY So i had to change room The taxi service is not reliable and concierge desk is not lifting a finger to help Worst experience ever, Nothing
355065,Ozo Hotel, Location was poor There is very little nearby Taxi cost to areas of interest or airport are very high Front desk staff on arrival were not very friendly Had no permission to use room phone other than in house calls , Modern and clean 
355066,Ozo Hotel, The most dirty hotel we have ever seen The first night that we went to sleep the sheets had hairs on it We informed the reception directly They bring another sheet which was again with hairs They have changed 3 times the sheets and all they were dirty The staff wasn t friendly at all When we made the reservation we ask for 2 single beds and they didn t even inform us that they don t have available 2 single beds so I was forced to sleep with my daughter in the same bed I surely wont reccomend your this hotel ,No Positive
355067,Ozo Hotel, no vanity sets that are common for 4 star hotels only soap dispensers in the shower no information brochures about hotel breakfast check in time etc in the room no minibar no room service staff could be more welcoming bulky pillows, spacious room with descent furniture modern quite hotel in office area 5 min walk from metro 
355068,Ozo Hotel, I found loads of men hair on the bed when I checked in and I had to complain so they came and changed every thing I found men hair in toilet and other disgusting things so so so dirty They claimed it is the laundry but not true I found dirtiness everywhere yukh, Nothing 
355069,Ozo Hotel, bad street name and indication leaving from the metro station, Nice room localization is ok but very bad signalization for who is coming from the metro 
355070,Ozo Hotel, Location is in Industrial area No shops around Staff over charged and refused to refund under their no refund policy Bookings com tried to talk to them Bottom line the owner who was present at the reception but rudely walked away is very greedy Any other hotel would of refunded the over payment The staff at reception lied lied lied in my face as if I was a school child Do yourself a favor avoid this hotel Staff more interested in their free cooked lunch then helping , Modern Room
355071,Ozo Hotel, The reception staff are rood and are not polite in addition they discriminate up on your look they hate ARABEs , The hotel furniture condition is great 
355072,Ozo Hotel, We had terrible experience with the staff They were inexperienced and gave every guest a hard time with the reservations and the payment Very unfortunate stay this time , Location and comfort were spot on 
355073,Ozo Hotel, The shower is horrible and leaking this minimalist open air design clearly doesn t work in this form The bathroom lacks enough hangers and towels are just not enough because of the shower leaking you end up using them to mop bathroom , It is quite clean easy to find and has free car park The train is really close you are in central in 15 minutes Breakfast is nice It is not in central so cabs costs 30 after hours to the hotel Nice receptionists very helpful All of them 
355074,Ozo Hotel, The staff at the reception were not welcoming at all except one lady who was very helpful and nice For a four star hotel it lacks many facilities Including toiletries and slippers And its too far from the city center , The rooms were modern and clean 
355075,Ozo Hotel, The bedding was lacking The pillows were some of the worst I ve slept on and the duvet was seemed to made of the same plastic spongy material Also the breakfast for its price was lackluster They ticked all the boxes but it s presentation freshness and panache was missing We should have walked the five minutes to ikea or McDonalds and just eaten there for less , The location and price were our deciding factors and that stayed true 
355076,Ozo Hotel, A bit remote hotels own resturant only option nearby other than fast food , Room tripple was spacious and comfortable with great fitments Good proximity to the metro to get into the city
355077,Ozo Hotel, nothing to criticise, The builidng is modern and quiet in a pleasant neighborhood near the underground Extremely easy to come from the airport A great advantage is that windows can be opened One feels like a guest 
355078,Ozo Hotel, The only thing I didn t like so much is that the room we received only had a shower If that not a problem to u then it s an amazing hotel, I really enjoyed my stay here The hotel was beautiful and only a 5 min walk to that metro station The bed was comfy and the room was modern 
355079,Ozo Hotel, As a Genius Traveler I was supposed to have a Late Checkout at the Reception it was mentioned that this was possible but only with extra costs 20 2Hrs 40 4 Std , With the Tram reaching the Centraal Amsterdam Train Station in ca 20 Tram at about 7 8 min sloooowly walking Pretty good internet speed but we stayed at the 1st floor Room was already ready Checked in one hour earlyer free 
355080,Ozo Hotel, Nothing nearby to go 4 shopping , Quite hotel Beautiful clean and cozy room Metro station is 5 about mins by foot and a good connection with the airport 30 40 mins and with the city center in less than 30 mins you are in the town If you are planning to go out till late a taxi from the city center at night is around 35 40 eur
