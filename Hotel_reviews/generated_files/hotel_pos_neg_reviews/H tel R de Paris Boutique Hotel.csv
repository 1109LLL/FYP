186442,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, Nothing , This hotel fitted very well with our needs It is well positioned close to Montparnasse it is modern and clean hotel very good wifi beds are big and comfortable the room was very quiet staff very friendly and helpful The street in front is relatively quiet and so not much traffic or pedestrian noise The whole hotel is non smoking which suited us perfectly Breakfast was perfect for our needs we included breakfast in our room rate so I can t advise value for money on breakfast The underground station of Liege is only about 400 metres walk away and is only stops from the Champs Elysees Two tips a you can leave your luggage at reception on your last day and they allowed us to use the shower in the gym in the afternoon when we came back to get our suitcases which was great because there was a heatwave on our last day b The hotel can arrange a shuttle to take you to the airport this is reasonably priced and much easier than using underground trains This is not a hotel which has a lot of facilities like a restaurant or outside patio but that is not what we wanted anyway its ideal for a Paris traveller who needs a very good place to stay as a base They serve snacks in the afternoon until evening

186444,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, More staff on reception sometimes , Nice snacks in the entrance area lovely staff a nice free bottle of champagne for my partner s birthday comfortable and pretty room
186445,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, The location is not as close to Opera as I thought Need to walk almost 10 minutes , The guy at reception was very nice explained us a lot of interesting things close to hotel very nice and gave us a room upgrade The room is nice new well decorated Really nice But not a huge space as you are in Paris and space here is very expensive
186446,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, Bathroom could ve been bigger , Nice boutique hotel staff is very friendly location is great bed is comfy and lighting in the room was great with natural light 
186447,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, If I were to complain on a very high level the terrace outside of the room was missing lounge chairs, The hotel is in a superb condition very good design of the rooms and very clean Staff very helpful I rarely leave reviews but this was an exlcellent boutique hotel 
186448,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, Tiny bathroom and didn t like the pillows on the bed they were so tall for our taste We asked to change them but they had only one thinner pillow in the whole hotel , Very well located hotel in the theatres area many restaurants bakeries and shops around walking distance to G Laffayette and Montmartre The staff is very friendly and speak english correctly Everyday they serve tea and pastries at the ground floor for free We stayed at the Deluxe room on the 3rd floor the room size is ok but the bathroom is very tiny Design in the room is modern and very clean also is the bathroom They change toiletries towels everyday Liege metro station is one block away Special thanks to the staff for the warm farewell with a bottle of champagne in our room 
186449,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel,No Negative, I stay in this area for work quite frequently and have been trying several different hotels This is the one I will go back to regularly from now on It is so luxurious I was very impressed Did not try the breakfast but everything else was excellent 
186450,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, The toilet in the bathroom was a little cramped the bathroom itself was great with plenty of space but the positioning of the toilet was a bit tight it wasn t possible to sit down without knocking the loo roll off , The welcome at check was extra ordinary and throughout our visit we made to feel very welcome and very well looked after the room was very comfortable with everything we needed the room temperature was easy to control and unusually adaptable and quick to respond Breakfast was good with lots of variety and room service was quick and tasty 
186451,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, Most of rooms are facing a narrow street which can be still noisy and interruptive for a light sleeper However this is still much better than majority of hotels in Paris , Free afternoon refreshments Hermes products on the bathroom welcoming staff at the reception
186452,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, Breakfast was expensive , Arrived late and the reception staff was very friendly and accommodating It was very clean and comfortable Lots of restaurants nearby Really like it 
186453,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, the prices for the rooms are a little expensive for basic room 16m square and i had to upgrade to get a little big bigger room , great location near major paris train stations very clean place with supported staff members
186454,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel,No Negative, The bed was really quite comfortable and the rain shower added a touch more luxury we loved the faux fireplace and the TV in the mirror which is a fairly small typically capital City sized room is a great use of space We had a courtyard room with big opening windows which was nice The biggest thing for us was how quiet everything was which allowed for a good night s sleep Easy access to several Metro lines within a 5 10 minutes walk which made adventuring around the City very easy 
186455,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, The only thing I could criticize is that the staff couldn t advice any restaurant lunch brunch and I would have waited from the hotel to guide me more, Location is perfect Really clean and comfy hotel 
186456,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, The basic room is small unless you pay to get a little bigger of rooms I understand that most of Paris hotels are similar but it would have been better to have a lower price for the rooms , Very good location and near to major Paris train and metero stations Also it was very clean place with great supported hotel staff 
186457,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, washroom too small no enough space to put our staff, The staff very helpful Peaceful and very quiet The 24h free light buffet very useful when we arrive late at the hotel The modern style of the room with light colors
186458,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, we didn t bother with breakfast as it was out of our budget and also there is a beautiful little patisserie just opposite and up the road a little we ate fresh croissants etc there every morning the hotel should use these guys, great hotel lovely receptionist made us feel really welcome and also gave us a free upgrade on arrival which was really kind The location is amazing you re just a lovely little walk to galleries and there is the most amazing bakery just opposite there is also an amazing parisian restaurant just down the road a little on the opposite side and it was just a lovely spot slightly away from tourist blur and a little taste of parisian life xx
186459,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, for the high quality of this hotel what s missing is USB charging plugs an iron board in the room available at reception and really nothing that comes to mind , Great rooms overall ultra quiet very comfortable bed contemporary and spacey shower go for the Deluxe rooms with their large mirror tv 
186460,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, It would have been nice to be provided with a few more sachets of instant coffee and a few more mini pots of milk And instant hot chocolate sachets would be a great addition , The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were very soft
186461,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Wonderful hotel the room is tiny but cosy the bed is amazing huge and comfortable The toiletry is Herm s Orange Vert one of my best favorite Perfume 
186462,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Second time visiting this beautiful place and fell in love with it all over again The cleanliness the location the cozy atmosphere top notch customer service make this hotel a perfect place to stay in Paris weather for a romantic get away or a family holiday A special huge thank you to an amazing Melanie at the reception not only she has upgraded us with a gorgeous room she has also been lovely the whole stay and gave us a lot of care attention and guidance during our stay Made it into truly great holiday experience Thank you again and see you soon dear Hotel R 
186463,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Everyone at the hotel made us feel welcome were helpful in every way We all fully intend to come back in the future Great location massive choice of restaurants within a couple of minutes walk 
186464,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, Breakfast is a bit expensive , The hotel is clean light and well maintained Close to the metro line and location is good Staff is friendly and helpful
186465,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Most comfortable bed and best night s rest I ever found had in a hotel proper sound proofing in a bustling area friendly helpful staff and great location with 9th and 18th within walking distance as well as several metro lines Even though the rooms are not large they are excellently outfitted and the design is comfortable and contemporary Hotel services such as breakfast room service and the fitness sauna hamam areas are great amenities 
186466,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, The location is great in terms of being very central but not the best part of Paris if you want nice bars and restaurants on your doorstep , The design of the hotel is great rooms lovely and the fake fireplace a real treat 
186467,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, Room was quite small however did not spend much time there other than taking a shower and sleeping, Very good location with easy access to all major Paris attractions 
186468,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, The one thing that could be improved was probably the cleaning of the showers and I m guessing other surfaces too as there was a bit of mildew growing in the corners , Everything about the hotel was pretty much perfect Hip sort of out of the way location between Opera and Montmartre Superb service with a smile Nicely designed and well appointed featuring Hermes soaps shampoos I didn t visit the on site Hammam but I m guessing its not too shabby either Breakfast looked great though I didn t have a chance to partake 
186469,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel,No Negative, The service was excellent We received advice from the reception in regards to the room and other hotel amenities In the room we had 2 free bottles of water along with tea and coffee The presentation booklet was tailored for our stay with recommendations for restaurants and places to visit The room was very clean and also the cleaning service was doing a good job We didn t try the room service but they seem to have various options The breakfast was very good with plenty of option to choose from We left very early in the morning and the staff was so nice they arranged for a taxi to come pick us up fixed price not matter of the traffic way he was going and served us with coffee water and some pastry for which he didn t want to charge us Very good experience would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Paris 
186470,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, While the room size deluxe room was quite large by Paris standards with a large bed and some other luxury inclusions hanging and moving around space was still limited , A stylish hotel with well equipped rooms including a large and very comfortable bed Lovely and very helpful staff A couple of good bus options nearby and also reasonably close to two metro stations A great patisserie across the road for those seeking a less calorific and cheaper alternative to the hotel s buffet breakfast 
186471,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, The only disadvantage of the property is the lack of space in the bathroom Although the shower cabin is very comfortable the space in the bathroom is almost zero not even somewhere to hang on the towel , The young lady in the reception is very kind and speaks perfect english The hotel is very clean and the beds are extremely comfortable The tv mirror is excellent 
186472,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, Breakfast only until 10 o clock on a Sunday Hmm Maybe they could extend it to 10 30 or 11 at weekends , It was incredibly quiet really good sound proofing in the rooms 
186473,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel,No Negative, We were upgraded for free on arrival a special touch for our first visit to Paris We stayed in room 610 very quiet and massive bed Would highly recommend 
186474,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, It s quite hot in the gym Could do with a fan , Great location Friendly staff Comfortable room Managed to check in early Made good use of the gym Faultless stay 
186475,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, Liked it all, Amazing staff quiet brand new simple but great breakfast cleaningness big enough room really big in Paris terms location never been satisfied with hotels in Paris till now
186476,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, Only modest facilities beyond the room itself i e plan to eat out but that was in the nature of the type of boutique hotel we knew this in advance and it worked very well for us, Very comfortable bed clean friendly good shower aircon well decorated convenient good price highly recommended Breakfast available 
186477,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel,No Negative, This has become one of my two favourite hotels of all times The staff are extremely friendly and helpful through email and in person The hotel is sooooooo cute and so Parisian located in a very Parisian area Really close to Moulin Rouge by walking and tons of lovely food around The Attic Room was immaculate just like the hotel in whole Loved every bit of it I d stay at this hotel every time if it s available in the future 
186478,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, Whilst the bathroom was very nice the shower leaked all over the floor which with two people in and out to get ready wasn t great The wifi didn t have the greatest connection strength , The hotel in general was very welcoming and aesthetically pleasing The room was modern and decorated tastefully it was a decent size for Paris 
186479,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, Room was absolutely freezing when I arrived My laptop wasn t able to connect to the hotel internet though my mobile was fine , Fantastic bed bedding Quiet and clean Perfect for a business trip with a great location Free upgrade was a lovely touch The attention to detail is definitely noticed luxury toiletries soft bedding extra friendly staff

186481,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel,No Negative, Extra comfy bed and pillows Lovely bedding and extra fluffy towels The hotel and room were very clean and comfortable The hotel staff were helpful and pleasant Altogether a very enjoyable stay 
186482,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, If I had to pick anything that was not best in class can only pick the fact that the bathroom in my room was quite small however it did not cause me any problems Great shower by the way better water pressure than you normally get , Staff are fantastic Hotel is quiet but very well located 
186483,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, I liked everything a lot My only suggestion would be to have some free weights in the gym , A beautiful little boutique hotel well located near the metro with stylish design excellent room and superb beds Everything is extremely new clean and well appointed Quadruple glazing windows even to ensure a quiet night s sleep and efficient and clean air conditioning to keep you cool and fresh in summer The staff are also amazing so very friendly and welcoming Really felt welcome there The free afternoon refreshments are a wonderful touch too Have been twice now and looking forward to going back again 
186484,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, A coffee machine and more english tv channels would make it a long stay option, Great breakfast and well appointed rooms Nice touch with the fire place
186485,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, There is nothing negative i could say about this lovely place apart from an expensive breakfast which works out much cheaper if you get it yourself from the bakery across the road the same bakery hotel gets it from and ofcause if you are driving parking is expensive but thats just Paris , An absolutely gorgeous small hotel with very friendly and helpful staff beautiful clean fresh and stylish rooms convinient location This hotel has pretty much everything you d need for a pleasant stay and has a very romantic feel to it which makes your stay in Paris even more special Will definately choose to stay there again 
186486,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, bathroom small and shower will everyday give you flood in bathroom , room clean and nice design may be small for 2 guess with luggages staff very kind very quite if u choose courtyard not use breakfast 
186487,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, Breakfast not included, Absolutely loved this boutique hotel Staff were friendly good location close to metro lovely decor We were upgraded on arrival Loved the Hermes bath products iPod docking station mirror television was fantastic Highly recommend 
186488,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, Nothing, The front desk is super friendly and can speak English fluently I once broke a glass in my room and they didn t ask me to pay anything only concerned that is anyone got hurt The location is convenient you can basically walk to the Opera the shopping centre nearby takes around 15 mins There is also a metro station takes only 3 mins walk to get there Everything as perfect as you want Won t regret to choose here to stay 
186489,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, Nothing they were great and the rooms were good but of Parisian size , The staff were amazingly helpful Always on hand to offer advice and point people in the right direction They spoke very good English too

186491,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, Rooms are a bit small , Very clean room was very nicely decorated with a classy touch Value for money considering the prices of hotels in Paris Fantastic Asian eatery Choy just further up the road 
186492,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel,No Negative, It is a very nice hotel located close to place PIgalle Montemarte and not far from other interesting places The room was small but clean comfortable and quiet

186496,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, Pillows are way too high so an option to choose more flat one would be much appreciated I was sleeping without the pillow but the bed was so comfy that it was fine Other than this there is nothing negative to say the hotel is really perfect , Very good location with three different metro stations just few steps away and a bus that will take you from the Louvre up to the Hotel has its stop right in front of the hotel door The staff on reception was extremely friendly and helpful always smiling and very polite The room is small but cosy and clean with a nice design Bed is really comfortable and thanks to the perfect soundproof it offers also complete calm without any noises from the outside we wanted to have a room facing the courtyard Bathroom was perfectly clean and the Hermes bath amenities were a really nice touch All in all it seems that after years of wandering around many Parisian hotels we have found our base 
186497,H tel R de Paris Boutique Hotel, I was very sick and could not leave the room Ordered room service but it did not state a minimum order Ordered an appetiser and reception said there is a minimum order I could only have liquid and was forced to order and pay for more food that I was not allowed to eat The wasted time back and forth with reception caused a late order of an extra charge that I was forced to pay Reception had the cheek to say next time there are lots of other restaurants around and you do not need to order room service This whole ordeal was very unpleasant with a lack of good customer service especially for a medical emergency such as this , Modern and clean rooms
