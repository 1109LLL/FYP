53756,Charlotte Street Hotel, Everything was great , The first hotel with true modern convenience I have visited Quality bose bluetooth speakers 20 device limit on wifi functional room space as well as being really stylish Staff were prompt and polite with actual personalities All the usual annoying little things that are not quite right at a hotel were not here and so it felt ver homely 
53757,Charlotte Street Hotel, I loved everything about this hotel The walk to the subway was very dirty which is not the hotels fault , I love the design of the hotel I loved our room and bathroom All the staff was very pleasant Everyone was very accommodating and patient with our 3 yr old 
53758,Charlotte Street Hotel,No Negative, We were celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary with our two toddlers We stayed in the first floor facing the street The room was just perfect good size for the girls to run around and the decoration was lovely The sofa bed was very comfortable and the children loved it The staff were superb friendly warming and always smiling 
53759,Charlotte Street Hotel,No Negative, The bed was wonderful especially the pillows Very generous personnel who placed some really nice chocolate in the room Thanks for a good visit Will recommend it 
53760,Charlotte Street Hotel, The only negative was the speed of service in the bar restaurant when we 1st arrived however once we asked to be served everything was prompt and efficient , Check in and check out very prompt and efficient our car was already waiting for us when we left The hotel was very nicely decorated and stylish The breakfast was delicious and served to our room hot and on time a wonderful boutique hotel we will definitely stay there again 
53761,Charlotte Street Hotel, I really don t know , The atmosphere decor position of the hotel created a very comfortable ambiance The breakfast was served into the late morning 
53762,Charlotte Street Hotel, I m sorry folks but I didn t like the room service breakfasts No toast or bread with full english And when I ordered just toast and chose wholemeal they couldn t supply that only brown Also in this age of wonderful coffee choices I suggest the hotel look at their filter option Not much flavour and weak , I love the decor the feeling of comfort the overall warmth in atmosphere from the surroundings and the staff I feel pampered and safe This is my favourite London hotel and I hope to return A fantastic location for good food choices and shopping 
53763,Charlotte Street Hotel, I m really sorry I have been staying at the Charlotte Street for many years and this time I was Shocked by the english language capabilities of some of the staff on a number of occasions I found myself having to repeat myself several times and whilst it was nice to interact with some of the more senior staff certain individuals at the reception and bar should have more training or better communications skills before being let loose on customers I mention this in the hope that management takes my comments seriously as this was also mentioned by two other guests that shared there comments with me whilst we were enjoying a drink in the rear living room Also whilst this does not apply to all the service at the bar was dreadful lack of knowledge a total lack of customer skills and general apathy ruled , The room was extremely comfortable and exceptionally clean well done house keeping Special Thanks to Sebastian for all his kind help 
53764,Charlotte Street Hotel, Not a lot , A real home from home feel A proverbial Swan of a hotel All employees working hard to make you feel relaxed and welcome Can t fault it 
53765,Charlotte Street Hotel, This is not a complaint more a funny comment The bed was so high that you almost needed a ladder to get into it Made us both laugh especially when my wife was trying to get into bed , The staff were very welcoming and friendly The room was absolutely fabulous The bed was very comfortable Oscars Restaurent was tremendous and the bar area is great Yes it is expensive but you get what you pay for Highly recommend this hotel 
53766,Charlotte Street Hotel, Nothing, This is a fabulous hotel with a real boutique feel in the heart of London The staff are exceptional and the breakfast was one of the best I ve ever had
53767,Charlotte Street Hotel, Bar closed at 11 because it was Sunday and nowhere to sit and have a night cap with friends very disappointing, Love the bar great lively atmosphere Hotel superb location
53768,Charlotte Street Hotel, Nothing major only that 2nd study room was being refurbished and we couldn t get a late drink to finish off our evening with friends the other study room was full , Just a pleasure to stay there great staff clean attention to detail loved this hotel had a fab time with friends 
53769,Charlotte Street Hotel, Nothing except when in guest lounge had to chase twice to have order taken for tea, Delicious breakfast friendly cheerful staff without being over attentive relaxed warm atmosphere lovely room
53770,Charlotte Street Hotel, Public spaces over run with business people conducting interviews workshops discussing incentive schemes Even the residents lounge unusable as a leisure traveller , Bedroom Bathroom and Breakfast food only
53771,Charlotte Street Hotel, Would have liked complimentary tea Coffee , Drinks on the terrace A perfectly stocked mini bar Spotlessly clean room Complimented by beautiful decor Gorgeous room 
53772,Charlotte Street Hotel, All was really great Would definitely recommend The Charlotte Street hotel , Really great stay The staff were fabulous I would go so far as saying that they were the best trained and friendliest team that we have encoutered 
53773,Charlotte Street Hotel, No prosecco in the bar, Breakfast excellent Staff extremely efficient and welcoming Good attention to detail the reception staff remembered our name which impressed me 
53774,Charlotte Street Hotel, Nothing really It s a great place with a similar price tag , Beds are amazing Service is very friendly and quick Drawing Room and library great for teas and drinks Top boutique hotel 
53775,Charlotte Street Hotel, Didn t like staying just for one night Needed to stay longer , Loved the breakfast and room So comfortable like being at home without doing all the work Loved the complimentary champagne and all the staff were charming and helpful Beautiful bathroom with Kit Kemp products and TV Location is perfect Charlotte Street has a great vibe good restaurants and bars but not too rowdy Very classy place our favourite place to stay in London and we will be making it a regular treat 
53776,Charlotte Street Hotel, Nothing to dislike , Beautiful hotel in amazing location All the staff are fantastic and we had both our rooms upgraded as it was my eldest daughters 21st birthday The bar and restaurant areas are full of atmosphere and always busy Breakfast was excellent Perfect hotel for a special treat 
53777,Charlotte Street Hotel,No Negative, Turned up short of cash for the taxi and the hotel team helped out Upgraded to a suite with great rooms Staff really helpful and sorted packaging and sending a gift to aged parents Restaurant bar and breakfast areas are top class 
53778,Charlotte Street Hotel, There wasn t anything we didn t like about this hotel Could not complain at all Possibly the addition of coffee making facility in the room would have been helpful but that is a minor comment , Everything was wonderful Perfect base for a 4 day visit to London Excellent location in very pleasant neighbourhood Plenty of bars and restaurants close by but never any noise or disturbance Beautiful bathroom and toiletries Extremely comfortable bed and pillows Appreciated the BOSE bluetooth player and radio in bathroom also TV in bathroom if needed and a well stocked mini bar Very friendly and helpful staff 
53779,Charlotte Street Hotel, Price is little on the high end considering room size and view from the window secluded alley , Overall a very nice hotel with friendly and helpful staff 
53780,Charlotte Street Hotel,No Negative, We didn t like the view from our room but for the second night the staff arranged for us to be moved to a much nicer room even though it was a Bank Holiday weekend excellent breakfasts 
53781,Charlotte Street Hotel, Room view, The staff were great They were every accommodating and helpful and the room was quiet although the hotel is on a busy road The best part is the location 
53782,Charlotte Street Hotel, The hotel has charged my card with a completely different a higher amount than it is stated in the written confirmation Additional charges beyond the sum of the booking has been charged separately and properly It s just wrong to charge the card of the client for the stay itself the higher amount which is not in line with the written confirmation and most importantly not according to the invoice of the hotel ,No Positive
53783,Charlotte Street Hotel,No Negative, Amazing front desk staff who where so attentive and helpful Luxury room really was fantastic and the honey was for breakfast was to die for How hotels should be in terms of service and facilities 
53784,Charlotte Street Hotel,No Negative, Amazing hotel great location very cozy and chic For 240 on a Saturday night it s hard to find a better hotel but I saw prices can go double or even triple on some weekends 
53785,Charlotte Street Hotel, The bar was heaving when we arrived on the Friday night but I guess that s the price you pay for being right in Soho And I am not sure how many days I could cope with seeing myself in all my glory with that many mirrors in the bathroom Note to self must be back on the diet At least once the shower steamed up I was spared the view , This is the first time I have stayed in such an expensive hotel You certainly get more for your money but then you are spending a lot o money So all the usual boxes are ticked it s clean water was hot beds were comfy but it was certainly luxurious lavendar pillow mist and bespoke chocolates it felt like a very personal service the room had an upstairs which was nice to give my friend and I some space the breakfast was fantastic Watching TV in the bath was a novelty I imagine if you want exclusivity and to be treated like a VIP it would hit the mark 
53786,Charlotte Street Hotel, Misrepresented on the website superior rooms supposed to have a bath no bath in the room and no room with a bath available I had specifically rung the hotel to check this when I made the booking I had to suggest to the concierge that a complimentary drink may be in order because of my dissatisfaction This was forthcoming after they had had to check back with someone else View of ductwork from the window rather ugly Nowhere to sit and eat breakfast together V heavy upholstered chair against the desk Newly upholstered armchair had no springing in the base far to soft a seat pad which you dropped into offering no support already needs re upholstering , Good quality linens and towels Good quality mattress Newly decorated 
53787,Charlotte Street Hotel, A very small point the crossiants in restaurant were not crossiants Not flaky no flavor dissappointing , Great location for walking to museums galleries great restaurants There was a buzz and energy about the place especially in the lobby and restaurant which made it fun I appreciated the good bedding and comfortable bed 
53788,Charlotte Street Hotel,No Negative, From arrival to departure The Charlotte Street Hotel just gets it right Great location stylish and immaculate throughout with efficient friendly staff This was our first stay but won t be our last 
53789,Charlotte Street Hotel, Nothing Every thing was cool calm and effortless , The hotel oozes style from the beautiful frontage to the bedrooms Charlotte Street is a fantastic location with a cool neighbourhood feel yet metres away from the hustle bustle of Oxford Street 
53790,Charlotte Street Hotel, I arrived an hour early to checkin and was told that I would be put on a priority checkin this did not happen as I wasn t allowed to checkin until almost an hour after the official hotel checkin time I found some of the staff to be insincere and unwelcoming This is a shame as I previously stayed at The Soho Hotel a sister hotel of The Charlotte Street Hotel and had a wonderful stay there I would not recommend The Charlotte Street Hotel , The hotel itself is very stylish and comfortable 
53791,Charlotte Street Hotel,No Negative, Everything the attention to detail the design the atmosphere the guest areas downstairs that make you feel like seating home in your living room the friendliness of the staff The bar and restaurant are very lively and the food is good It is not a cheap stay but worth the money You feel looked after 
53792,Charlotte Street Hotel,No Negative, Staff were fantastic very friendly and helpful They even arranged an Easter egg hunt in the lobby for our daughter The suite was great size and very comfortable 
53793,Charlotte Street Hotel, Sofa and chair cushions were a little soft for my taste Shower drain was a little slow at draining the water so it could fill up an inch or two Bathroom could get a little hot , Staff was excellent all very nice Love the fruit plate they provided me every day The Champagne on ice and bottles of water when I arrived was a nice touch The bar downstairs is good and the bartenders are helpful and can mix a good cocktail Doormen were also helpful with directions and finding shops within walking distance Free wifi was decent and easy to use with multiple devices 
53794,Charlotte Street Hotel, Not have a kettle and tea in our room You need to request it when you arrive , The continental breakfast is a must as is the selection of cocktails The twisted Mojito is second to none according to my partner 
53795,Charlotte Street Hotel, Breakfast a little expensive for what it was No coffee machine in room or tea making, Nice bed calm Well placed in London Nice check in staff
53796,Charlotte Street Hotel,No Negative, Definitely my first and favorite choice in London Like no other place They were very understanding with check out time and the service is flawless as usual 
53797,Charlotte Street Hotel, No tea and coffee facilities in the room Such a little thing but when we are on holidays we love to wake up have a coffee in bed and read the paper in our own time A little on the expensive side the kids didn t appreciate it as much as we did , We really enjoyed the Charlotte St Hotel and the area Great little communal sitting areas towards the back so nice and quiet We felt comfortable with our teens running out and exploring on their own Super comfy bed 
53798,Charlotte Street Hotel, No tea and coffee facilities in room, We booked a Junior Suite and when we checked in we got upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite All staff wonderful very clean and comfortable we enjoyed spending time in the room
53799,Charlotte Street Hotel, The bed was a double which we found quite small and high we haven t slept in a double bed for quite a few years would of preferred a king size bed I would have given a 10 if there was a spa facility on site and a larger bed in the room , Very friendly professional welcome and offered a free glass of champagne upon arrival Our room had a lovely welcome note with a complimentary room spray oscars bar served amazing cocktails great staff and atmosphere 
53800,Charlotte Street Hotel, Having to leave but will be back , Great location fantastic selection touches for breakfast great restaurant atmosphere excellent staff concierge taking care of all luggage for next few days and parking car the night before when I was staying at the other side of London in a different hotel for a night before staying at Charlotte St luxurious bedroom bathroom bedding a true 5 hotel Spotless well done 
53801,Charlotte Street Hotel,No Negative, Flawless Everything was without an exception fantastic and I m definitely coming back again All the staff was more than nice and kind and made it even that much better The room size is very generous and the decoration is unique and very well done 
53802,Charlotte Street Hotel, The location forced us to use the tube or a taxi as few of the restaurants or shows we went to were within walking distance Surrounding area lively but not interesting , The bartenders made great cocktails the bar area was comfortable always lively Most staff were friendly efficient Our room was lovely the bathroom superb The drawing room was beautiful 
53803,Charlotte Street Hotel,No Negative, I was staying in London with my 7 year old son who suffers with a rare genetic disease He requires tube feeding and does not eat anything by mouth I brought my own special pur es for his tube feeds and the hotel staff were so accepting and accommodating of my sons special needs It made my life so much easier to have this type of experience I loved everything about our stay here and feel very lucky to have had this experience in London we are a long way from our home in Australia 
53804,Charlotte Street Hotel,No Negative, Just a fabulous country house like hotel in the centre of London Spent New Year s Eve there as a treat for my husband we re actually quite local Everything was gorgeous staff room lunch with the family and best of all the chocolate brownies Best ever Would really recommend the hotel nothing to dislike 
53805,Charlotte Street Hotel, The bed was too high difficult to climb into Would have benefitted from step ladder In the shower would have benefitted by having a handle to hold onto to avoid possible fall , The staff
53806,Charlotte Street Hotel, The only bad thing was the weather , Staff were always there to help Made us feel comfortable Access to almost all tube lines within a couple of mins walk 
53807,Charlotte Street Hotel, This was not really a problem but the bath is so large that it was not possible to relax and watch the TV on the wall without floating about , Wonderful friendly and helpful staff Extremely comfortable beds and the most luxurious bathroom 
53808,Charlotte Street Hotel, Hospitality tray with tea coffee would be nice in room , All staff very helpful and very smooth check in Super choice at breakfast Very quiet wouldn t know in centre of London and excellent sleep Excellent cleanliness ok room 
53809,Charlotte Street Hotel, Nothing everything was perfect, From check in the staff went above and beyond we had mentioned it was our anniversary and were given a glass of champagne to enjoy in the bar and our room upgraded Nothing was too much trouble and we were even surprised with a small cake as we relaxed in the fantastic drawing room later in the evening We could not highly recommend this hotel enough 
53810,Charlotte Street Hotel, Absolutely nothing , The staff were wonderful They gave a truly genuine service with a smile The room junior suite was sumptous and aesthetically decorated Fine details and gifts were appreciated The hotel is a popular media hub and very busy in the bar and restaurant But in our room we were in a private and perfectly quiet haven 
53811,Charlotte Street Hotel,No Negative, The concierge staff were very helpful in arranging various activities for us The kitchen staff were excellent in catering for our dietary restrictions The overall experience is almost faultless
