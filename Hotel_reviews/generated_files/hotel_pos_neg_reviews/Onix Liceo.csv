389263,Onix Liceo, it is really sad to have two different rooms with the same price the first room definitely didn t worth its price but the stuff helped a lot to solve the problem thank you, the place was wonderful staff really helpful we were given a really bad room at the beginning with no light small and with a problem in the bathroom but they changed our room to a really nice one the next day 
389264,Onix Liceo, Mold on the walls hairs in the shower The showerhead didn t work properly The remote for the TV didn t work at all WiFi was practically non existent Ordered a double bed got 2 singles Windows can t be opened so only air conditioned air Not what you expect for the price , It s super central and looks very modern
389265,Onix Liceo,No Negative, The hotel was in a great location stay on the top floor with balcony which is good and relaxing Pool is small but is prefect for a city break Hotel is quite Would book again 
389266,Onix Liceo, The design of the hotel interior although spectacular to look at was noisy because any sound made travelled right up the central atrium we did not sleep well , Handy location
389267,Onix Liceo, Nothing, The welcome from the staff was great very helpful and friendly The whole place was clean and modern Our room was comfortable and everything supplied 
389268,Onix Liceo, Questionable confusion over booking resulting in additional charge, Great hotel rooms good breakfast and facilities good and great location Perfect all round destination from which to explore central Barcelona
389269,Onix Liceo, The breakfast was really poor The room I stayed in definitely needed an upgrade and especially the shower looked quite dirty , staff was very friendly location is excellent and it has a nice little pool
389270,Onix Liceo, At first they have given us a bad room but when we argue with them they changed the room and gave a good one This is not a good example for hospitality and goodwill , 24 hours lounge coffee water apple etc service and the location of the hotel was great 
389271,Onix Liceo, Had to leave to come home , Had an amazing few nights here Such a hidden gem very laid back atmosphere made for a fantastic stay So much so have already booked for a future stay 
389272,Onix Liceo,No Negative, The hotel was in a great location Walking distance to La Rambla and also located on the same street at Palau Guell Great friendly staff Really good hotel for the price and location 
389273,Onix Liceo, The air conditioning struggled and there was no blind in the bathroom which meant with the sun on it all day at 30 degrees outside it was sweltering and effected the heat in the bedroom as soon as you opened the adjoining door Small points in what was a great stay , Very clean and modern hotel Nice courtyard pool area Staff on reception were extremely helpful and polite 
389274,Onix Liceo, Poor sound proofing of rooms can hear conversations in ajoining rooms Coffee machine in lobby only and often out of order , The location is outstanding 2 blocks from the center of Las Ramblas and 1 block from Guell Palace by Gaudi Can walk to most attractions 
389275,Onix Liceo, Customer service is non existent You know what they do next door Enjoy breakfast in town not at the hotel, location ONLY they have nothing but location to offer
389276,Onix Liceo, Breakfast was very basic and below expectations nothing like you would expect for this price and this kind of hotel Also in the breakfast room you could see the heavily moulded wall under the pool which was not the best of sightings , Very close to La Ramblas and many places you want to go while visiting Barcelona
389277,Onix Liceo, nothing, The property was close to the waterfront and good seafood restaurants The price was reasonable We also found the staff to be friendly and helpful We arrived early early for check in because of our arrival from the airport but the staff accommodated us and stored our luggage while we started our site seeing 
389278,Onix Liceo, No carpets meant acoustics very bad and the noise from corridors other rooms and even the street outside was very very bad Doors need soft closers on them as slammed Plumbing very noisy Basically would be excellent if they could reduce the noise all day and night , Cleanliness Friendliness and helpfulness of male reception staff Location as close to Ramblas 
389279,Onix Liceo, Very loud talking in lobby at night while we were trying to sleep after a long journey However when we called the front desk it was taken care of immediately and we were able to sleep , large comfortable room great location and very good staff 
389280,Onix Liceo, Room next to lift problem Could be noisy , Position of hotel perfect for exploring Barcelona Classic Spanish hotel very clean Breakfasts very good 
389281,Onix Liceo, Very thin walls till midnight constant loud noise from other rooms Breakfast does not worth at all and located in the basement you cannot really drink coffe and smoke ourside Tv has nearle nothing just checked briefly had only 6 channels in bad quality Big areas in the building but small rooms Staff not really kind ig you arrive late or leave early , Convenient clean close nice modern minimalistic 
389282,Onix Liceo, Terrible atrium design making it very noisy paper thin walls meaning you hear everything , Handy location clean room clean facilities good breakfast selection 
389283,Onix Liceo, It is a 4 star hotel but probably wouldn t be at the level of facilities and decor as I would have expected of a 4 star I d say it was the equivalent of a 3 star , This is in a central location and ideal for getting around to the main tourist attractions The room was very clean and the reception staff were friendly and helpful 
389284,Onix Liceo, A C was not switched on yet Opening windows was giving nice temperature but was noisy So was a bit of dead lock situation , Reaching there was quite easy Excellent location like 2 mins in La Rambla Very friendly and helpful staff I definitely recommend for your next trip 
389285,Onix Liceo, No safe in rooms Took few days to get light fixed and to get English channels on TV but maintenance man good when he did come Guy on front desk not very friendly in beginning , Location Day and late night staff good Clean rooms
389286,Onix Liceo, Couldn t open window in our room was an internal room got very hot in room when the shower was on and no extraction, Breakfast was great Staff were really helpful Hotel in perfect location for seeing the sights
389287,Onix Liceo, No kettle in room Also a chair instead of the little stool would be better , The breakfasts were very good Plenty of lifts to acres upper floors if you needed one 
389288,Onix Liceo, Thought the safety deposit box held at reception a bit expensive especially if you are staying more than a few days really missed not having a safe in the room Bit disappointed with the location of our room 201 window was opaqued as looked onto the marble stair well had to ask for it to be opened closed noises at night if left open as sound travels up the marble stair way when people are coming in in very jolly moods Room could have done with a main light as it was a bit dim with just the small bedside wall lights so not having an outside window made this worse , Location of hotel was excellent Room was very clean comfortable with plenty of wardrobe space for 2 people Shower was brilliant as hot as you like with plenty of space to move about plus plenty of hooks rails to hang towels things Breakfast was good good choices with the bread nice fresh lovely coffee even though it was from a machine Enjoyed the added coffee water facility in the lounge area perfect after a long day out about Staff all very helpful pleasant 
389289,Onix Liceo, They lied in there advert they say they have air conditioning which was my only criteria when booking and when we got there it was not there apparently it s seasonal and they only turn it on for a small part of the year reguardless of whether it s hot or not They offered no refund or even part refund When I questioned the desk I was told there was no one there who could deal with it and the manager wasn t going to be in until the day we left and there was nothing they could do this is supposed to be 4 surely there should be someone who can deal with your problems especially at a weekend They say they have double beds but their idea of a double bed is 2 singles pushed together which resulted in me or my partner falling into the gap each night when the beds split apart The walls in the room were dirty there was mold in the shower This won t affect most customers but it just shows another lie that they told me I m a big f1 fan and previous to my stay I rang and spoke with the hotel to check I would be able to watch the race I checked again when I got to the hotel and both times they told me yes I would and it was on a certain channel when I looked the hotel didn t have that channel so missed the race I have stayed in a lot of hotels all around Europe including Barcelona and have to say this was an awful experience the problems are one thing but there customer service to deal with them was shocking I thought I was treating my partner to a nice long weekend away for our anniversary so thought I would spend a bit extra and get something a bit more special but cheaper places I ve stayed at before would of been so much nicer I would never stay here again and would advise anyone looking here to find something else There are so many other nicer and cheaper hotels in Barcelona to stay in Where they have got the good reviews from completely baffles me , The breakfast was good that s about it 
389290,Onix Liceo, The window of the rooms cannot be opened to get some fresh air the cleaning of the bathroom tiles could be better the wc was constantly dripping breakfast is served in the underground with no natural light the orange juice was not fresh common areas in the ground floor could be more cozy and comfortable it was cold in there , The location of the hotel is excellent 
389291,Onix Liceo, Needed a safe deposit box although not available in your room they were held at reception at a cost of 5 50 Euros per day plus a fifty euro CASH deposit Which I felt was rather steep and totally unaware off When you travel only for a city break of a few days to hand over a steep deposit was totally a shock However happy to pay a deposit but by card would be much easier and simpler , Ease of access to all the activities around 
389292,Onix Liceo, Room was dark no overhead lighting and no natural light Also very noisy from other guests Not that they were particularly noisy themselves just that with wooden floors and entrance doors so close to each other it s impossible to keep the noise down , The location is great Our metro card was a waste of money as everything we needed was in walking distance Interesting local bars and shops nearby but just off La Rambla for the touristy stuff 
389293,Onix Liceo, was supposed to be a double bed but there was a gap in the middle that was very uncomfortable Breakfast was lovely but there was a lack of hot food that let it down , location decor staff bathroom
389294,Onix Liceo, The walls of the rooms are very thin I could hear my neighbor having a pee Room wasn t cleaned well there was dust everywhere Great localization however it didn t feel safe walking alone at night after a certain hour , Breakfast and the employees 
389295,Onix Liceo, Beds and pillows were uncomfortable and lighting in the room was poor Tea and coffee provided was downstairs would have preferred a little kettle in the room and milk to be provided , Great location right off of la ramblas Very helpful staff and a clean hotel with great showers 
389296,Onix Liceo, They should work with better taxi companies When the standard rate to Barcelona airport is 30 35 Euro I had to pay 44 Euro even it was early in the morning no traffic jam and it took only 15 20 min drive time Too noisy ,No Positive
389297,Onix Liceo, They don t guarantee your bed type so even if you choose double you might end up with twin I wanted to check two rooms one with double bed and one with twin and the receptionist acted like I ve committed murder I found a pair of women underwear hanging in the bath and after shaving hair on the toilet seat , The heating was awsome as I didn t feel cold a second Breakfast had an amazing deal and loads of things to chose from 
389298,Onix Liceo, In the hotel information it says that the hotel has parking but in fact the parking is not in the same hotel and it is just a concession with a third party without surveillance , Location is great 
389299,Onix Liceo, I was very disappointed to be charged 20 extra at the desk when I arrived I had named two guests on the booking form myself and my wife Mary Copeland but had in error clicked 1 guest I feel this was unfair and you should request the hotel to refund 20 to me,No Positive
389300,Onix Liceo, Lighting was very low in public areas and bedroom making the place rather dark overall , Breakfast was good value Bed was large and comfortable Hotel very handy for La Rambla 
389301,Onix Liceo, NO windows in the room no ventilation almost suffocating The bathroom was not in a good condition also some outfit missing such as tissues or cleaning the toilet No cable Tv or international channels Not sound proofed enough In general very poor room with no air conditioning and much to expensive for what was offered Plus the breakfast was very poor almost a joke Poor WI Fi signal , Excellent location Very friendly stuff very nice sitting lounge 
389302,Onix Liceo, Some areas of the hotel were very dark i e Seated area near outdoor terrace on ground floor Equally not enough light on the private terraces within bedrooms slightly more light would encourage people to sit out at night I upgraded to a extra large bed with private terrace based on the online photos which makes the rooms and bathrooms look huge sadly that isn t the case, Staff were very friendly breakfast was good with a reasonably wide selection of breads meats cheeses etc and the fresh tomatoes were excellent Location of the hotel couldn t have been better
389303,Onix Liceo, 1st room didn t have windows it was very very small and awkward we asked to changed it because no windows wasn t mentioned anywhere when we ve booked but we only received another room the next day the windows existed but it didn t had a handle was matte and it was towards an inner court but you couldn t open it or see through it , clean good position near rambla 2nd room was big and nice with small balcony over the street large bathroom 
389304,Onix Liceo, Room was not as requested very poor lighting had requested a balcony if possible staff smirked when asked to change room Saying fully booked but when looking on website they were not fully booked Croissants were stale Tea and coffe in foyer did not work in the four days we were there Very very noisy at front of hotel Have always previously stayed at the back Shall be looking else where mainly as staff had lied about room availability , Location Had stayed twice before 
389305,Onix Liceo, basic amenities in the room no kettle in the room to make coffee however there is coffee station in the reception area for free with water tea and apple no view only building, the stuff were very good specially the reception people very safe place very clean quiet spacious room
389306,Onix Liceo, Our room was too small the view was inside the hotel and the there was no handle to open or close it when we wanted it was broken also there were no air condition so was unbearable the hot room sometimes , It was close to the city centre really clear room with king size bed
389307,Onix Liceo, not in a good street but safe hair dryer is old type and not strong enough to dry long hair some room doors are very close to each other so that you should wait for others to enter into their room for you to enter , Close to La Rambla Palau Guell Clean rooms Good breakfast Not spacious but enough sized rooms
389308,Onix Liceo, noise from the elevator, The room the kindness of staff and the rent a bike shop just next door We were provided with electric bicycles of excellent quality 
389309,Onix Liceo, The hallway is so loud In the middle of the night people are running through stairs with screaming Hotel staff must have warned them It happened all nights So loudly , Great location Close to the metro and city center Breakfast is awesome Room is very large and cool Free wifi Thank you 
389310,Onix Liceo,No Negative, Great location just off La Rambla and very close to the Marina Really friendly staff and breakfast being served for 4 hours was ideal to fit in with all our plans 
389311,Onix Liceo, No bar for a nightcap The rooms would benefit from having safes installed would help visitors store valuables , Room and bathroom very clean apart from stickiness on bedside table 
389312,Onix Liceo, I was without power for an entire evening and night With no torches or candles being provided I found it difficult to find my way to the toilet as my mobile battery was drained Given the power outage for 8 hours in the evening I was still expected to pay in full for the night at the hotel During the night I was disturbed by a drunken guest who kept falling in the corridor outside my door as the emergency lights did not work during the power outage I could not call reception to complain as the phone lines were also not working ,No Positive
389313,Onix Liceo, Very basic room boutique style Would be good to have the coffee tea facilities in room Thin walls , Great location and friendly staff Clean hotel 
389314,Onix Liceo, Rooms do not have a safe Hefty deposit and daily charge to leave passports at reception , Great location down a side street from La Ramblas though the street itself looked a little run down Extremely friendly and helpful reception staff nothing was a problem Rooms well equiped and comfortable but decor a little on the minimalist side Lovely amenity area behind reception with free refreshments No problem with wifi worked perfectly Good variety at breakfast and nice coffee from the machine 
389315,Onix Liceo, Hair dryer Bring your own It s one of those you can spend an hour drying your hair Loud street to sleep with balcony door open, Good location in a pretty busy and loud street Not a cute street but Palau G ell is across the street Close walk to everything Two blocks from Las Ramblas Voltage adapter 220 110 in bathroom 
389316,Onix Liceo, Room was very clean and fresh but Shower facilities could have been cleaner Black damp on tiles and shower heads , Our second time here Will use hotel again Staff very nice and helpful Rooms very spacious Simple but tasty breakfast with lots to choose from All very fresh 
389317,Onix Liceo, Prefer to have a safe in the room rather than the available rental facility at reception Care needed walking the street to hotel late at night La Rambla known to be worse however street populated with useful corner shops souvenirs etc Breakfast a little too expensive , Requested a quiet room and was allocated one overlooking great pool rooms were lovely well renovated clean with good A C Located with easy walking distance to central La Rambla better not to be on it close to Gothic Quarter Port Vell and metro station Staff were helpful and spoke good English 
389318,Onix Liceo, It would have been nice to have tea coffee making facilities in the room e g kettle tea and coffee milk etc Also it would have been better to have had an exhaust fan in the bathroom to get rid of the steam , The room was very comfortable and the bathroom large 
389319,Onix Liceo, Swimming pool area is ok but not very comfortable and rather small 2 blocks away rather grungy poor area with electronics shops and kebab eateries, Rooms a little small but can t beat the location and the efforts of the staff to help
389320,Onix Liceo, I was in room 501 and unable to open the 1 small frosted window so absolutely no natural ventillation and liitle or no natural light which I absolutely hate pretty claustrophobic The dining room is plain depressing it s so dark They d be better served removing the extremely small swimming pool which is a total waste of space to let some natural light pour into the dining room , Brilliiant location and even better as I was unaware it was pretty much next door to Palau Guell so as Gaudi fans that was an added bonus Hotel staff extremely helpful accomadative Bed was big comfortable Overall it was a very positive experience and very good value given the brilliant location but some fresh air would be nice Overall a positive experience
389321,Onix Liceo, Clenliness could be much better Beds were not that comfortable as could be expected from a hotel The room we had was quite small and cupboards were OK for a one night stay only Sound isolation is bad One can hear discussions and TV in the neighboring room When the door of the next room closes one is immediately completely awake , Very friendly and helpful staff Centrally located 
389322,Onix Liceo, Plastic bed sheets Bathroom was tired and a bit dirty no safety deposits box in your room Hotel price but more like a hostel Very disappointed , Nice lobby and pool
389323,Onix Liceo, We could not use the swimming pool they didn t mention this we had to change the room the bathroom door was could not closing and then the AC was doing a lot of noise we could not sleep with the window open lot of noise in the street , The location it is very clean and super pretty super nice staff
389324,Onix Liceo, Would not let me cancel when I requested Were quite ruthless about it despite the circumstances Looked more like a 2 star hotel and was very basic Massively overpriced Really bad value for money I would not recommend anyone booking this hotel , Nothing 
389325,Onix Liceo, Nothing really we would certainly go back , Perfect location for sightseeing very central but on a fairly quiet street Breakfast varied and tasty We particularly appreciated the free drinks and fruit on offer in the lobby very welcome after a long day 
389326,Onix Liceo,No Negative, Amazing mix of Spanish architecture and Modern renovation Loved it Plus on a great street so close to everything you need and walking distance to las ramblas the port and the metro for all the key sights Great atmosphere
389327,Onix Liceo, Mattress hard on one of the beds Better pillows AC took awhile to cool room , Very friendly and helpful staff Complementary water and fruit appreciated Great WIFI 
389328,Onix Liceo, Noisy cramped claustrophobic rooms and misleading in all aspects Not a good neighborhood at night Reviews not correct in many aspects of location convenience and service Some rooms no windows And you can here EVERYTHING next door , There was not much to like as it definitely does not meet the 4 stars 
389329,Onix Liceo,No Negative, The hotel staff was very kind especially osama and malesa the hotel very clean the rooms and swimming pool are small aircondition in the room was very weak n
389330,Onix Liceo, The room was not what I expected Very small No window I thought it was overpriced for what we got Breakfast was in the basement A dismal affair they had a lovely sunny courtyard upstairs where breakfast could have been The pool was super disappointing So small Not what it looked like in the picture , The bed was super comfortable The breakfast was okay The location is ideal for travelers 
389331,Onix Liceo, Sometimes too noisy but not from outside from the street but from hotel inner places and next room Front doors and walls very not very isolated , Great position good breakfast clean and tidy comfortable big bed good value
389332,Onix Liceo, The hotel is located close to the ramblas but on the dodgy side Walking back to the hotel after 1 00am isn t that nice During the day there is absolutly no problem with walking back to the hotel , Good comfortable rooms with customizable airconditioning The house keeping used anti muskito spray every day to keep the room muskito free 
389333,Onix Liceo, VERY NOISY WOODEN FLOORS MEANT THAT CLEANERS WERE AUDIBLE IN THE ROOM WE WERE IN FROM EARLY ON EACH MORNING NEEDS A BAR AREA ENCOURAGING VISITORS TO MAXIMISE USE OF THE LOVELY POOL DOWNSTAIRS AREA , BIG COMFORTABLE ROOM LOVELY POOL AREAL ON TREND ARCHITECTURALLY AND VISUALLY HELPFUL RECEPTIONIST 
389334,Onix Liceo,No Negative, We had a 2 night stay before a cruise and found the hotel in a perfect spot for getting to Los Ramblas and to the Hop off Hop on bus so we could cover as much as possible in a short time 
389335,Onix Liceo, the wifi was very slow in our room as it was the last room on the floor 311 we asked for the quiet room but we were given a whole modem to put in our room which was great and the wifi was fast no iron in the room but we were given one right away we were given two single beds put together which served as one double bed which was annoying coz they kept moving away from each other, Great staff always super helpful and nice helped us chose few places around the city all questions were answered and all we asked was done in regards to our stay also helped us rent a car beautiful pool area and they provide towels for the pool good breakfast the best thing is its open till 11 30am super location the hotel smelled really good the mini bar prices are very reasonable as well we got a bottle of water pringles m ms and oreos for 7 euros amazing hotel worth its price
389336,Onix Liceo, The air conditioning in the room was very week The hair dryer did not work The rooms do not have a safe deposit and if you want to secure your docs cash etc you must do so in a safe located in the reception where everyone is watching you The hotel does not have a snack bar or the like so you must go to the street to pick up something to eat or drink , The staff was nice and very helpful The swimming pool is just right to relax 
389337,Onix Liceo, Nothing, Beautiful and quiet room just minutes away from the bustling Rambla Great coffee machine at breakfast and the tranquility of the pool area was just superb 
389338,Onix Liceo, Fantastic location but still quiet for sleep Excellent value for money We would want to stay again, Parking not near the hotel and expensive No Bar 
389339,Onix Liceo, Staff not helpful no bar car park a nightmare very small the other end of a one way system when I paid for our room the hotel card machine took my payment but put a block on my card couldn t use it for 2 weeks until I got back to UK , Close to port
389340,Onix Liceo, Would have expected superior room to be more spacious nice large bed but took up most of the room , Good location for La Rambla and Barri Gotic Much nicer inside than it looked from the immediate area Good breakfast buffet with plenty of choice
389341,Onix Liceo, Evrything, Difficult for senior people Breakfast is not at all good Accommodation is just like a jail We never expected booking com will enlist this kind of accommodation I expect refund of my money 
389342,Onix Liceo, As usual walls are quite thin you can hear next room , Location is perfect 5min to liceu metro Stayed in a Room with balcony it was very comfartable and cleaned every day and big enough 
389343,Onix Liceo, Poor balance cost quality bed sheet not too clean wrong unclear assegnation for the room despite of the booking done , Great Position large quality inner hall with free coffe and comfrotable sofa very carefull morning night shift staff 
389344,Onix Liceo, Nothing for breakfast every day you have to eat cheese Front desk workers not all are tough I arrived at the hotel one day after the date of arrival and I connect to booking com to change the booking date and they agreed to that but the hotel did not agree And the hotel forced me to pay a night that i didnt stay at the hotel do not order a taxi from the hotel try to take a taxi alone from outside or you pay 15 euro more, The location was excellent clean and nice
389345,Onix Liceo, A few weeks earlier I had cancelled a 2 night stay and was charged for 1 night but the cancellation policy did not make it clear that they would start charging at midnight of the date you could cancel I contacted the hotel and they never replied to me I since have stayed there upon booking again and I was very happy but I think their customer service could ve been handled a bit better , Location modern clean Loved the entrance hall and staircase and the patio outside Quietest place in the middle of Barcelona
389346,Onix Liceo, It cannot be classified as 4 stars NEVER it cannot exceed 2 3 stars MAX the ONLY good thing in this hotel is its location ONLY Hotel is OLD and Rooms are small as well as bathrooms Breakfast is VERY poor ,No Positive
389347,Onix Liceo, We did not get the room we booked through booking com again Reception staff incredibily unhelpful Location average due to drunks outside Would not recommend ,No Positive
389348,Onix Liceo, All good, Stayed there before in November 2015 Booked over night as attending an event in Barcelona We were given free room upgrade Which was lovely on previous stay the room was very good also
389349,Onix Liceo, They should provide a safe in each room or provide the reception one for free as opposed to charging 5 50 Euros a day plus a 50 euro deposit I would have hoped for bathrobes The pool wasn t maintained but I assumed it was probably there for aesthetic reasons as it s small , Perfect location Loved the Netflix option in the room which is only available to only some rooms for some reason Great design minimalist yet fun Helpful staff The night receptionist Jesus is a godsend The recommended Flamenco show next door is a must see Reasonably priced mini bar The terrace is really relaxing 
389350,Onix Liceo, Being british i would have liked a better cooked breakfast but i know other nationalities don t always go for that choice , Location to la ramblas Not noisey at night time 
389351,Onix Liceo, Didnt have a safe in the room No tea and coffee making provided in the room , Room and bathroom very clean and lovely and spacious Staff were very nice Lots of variety at breakfast 
389352,Onix Liceo, Could have done with a kettle tea coffee in room machine in communal area only served black coffee which I find to strong , Bed was lovely big rooms cleaned daily
389353,Onix Liceo, A bit hard beds Would have been good to have a safety deposit box in the room , Good location close to La Rambla and the harbour Nice room with good bathroom Breakfast was varied and had all we needed 
389354,Onix Liceo, Very very noisy hotel not from the street but from the hotel inside very bad accoustics from open lobby all the way up to 5tg floor Walls between rooms must be cardboard Small bathroom , Very good location near Ramblas Good shower 
389355,Onix Liceo, First night I have got a room without window or to be more precise with blurred not transparent window to the inner chairs without possibility to open and air conditioning was not functioning at all Answer was there is no air in the system What Sleeping at night was disaster But next day the girl from reception without any discussion change it to normal room with nice view to the inner yard with the possibilty to open it Breakfast was very poor with very limited choices sometimes even in two stars hotel you can fond beter There is no bar in the hotel in the 4 star hotel , Friendly helpful stuff good location free coffee at lobby
389356,Onix Liceo, Quite a few things could be improved First the breakfast was basic nothing special really No facial tissues in the bathroom Poor quality of pillows TV had only Spanish language channels Air conditioner was average Most annoying was the bright blue light from the TV that could not be turned off and shined directly on the bed Outside the patio was nice but the tiles were loose The pool is not suitable for swimming , The location is excellent Facilities appear modern but with some quirks Staff was very friendly and helpful 
389357,Onix Liceo, even though we are in April it was very hot at the night I couldn t sleep my room windows inside the building the air condition was t working during my stay The staf could work a littel in welcoming the guest Weak lighting in the rooms, Best Location in barcholona very clean room bed comfortable
389358,Onix Liceo, Our room was pretty much directly above the London bar a couple of stories below and the bar and street noise was loud each night until around 5am Also our room was very hot and when I asked at reception they explained that as yet the cooling for the air conditioning had not yet been switched on for the summer My view is that there is better value accommodation in Barcelona than this hotel , Good location although please read the negatives room was very clean and the staff were very helpful 
389359,Onix Liceo, Nothing, From arrival to departure the staff were very friendly and helpful Our room was cleaned daily and fresh linen and towels Breakfast was excellent Ideal location 
389360,Onix Liceo, There was a coffee machine in the lounge but there was no milk Reception was very dark at night as were the rooms, Location was excellent just off las Ramblas Bathroom was lovely bright and spacious 
389361,Onix Liceo, Just wish there had been facllities in the room for making a hot cuppa , Location was very central the staff were very helpful The rooms were clean and comfy 
389362,Onix Liceo, If I had a room that I could open a window If you are not out partying in the evening the hotel is loud as a bar with live music is next door , Rooms were very stylish but I had an internal room with only window locked and shaded as it opened into the stairwell Bathroom is quite nice and bed very comfortable The afternoon desk person Melisa was exceptional I was having issues with my card key and she came to my room to make sure it worked She was always friendly as I came in often to work from my room 
389363,Onix Liceo, If you stay longer like I did for 6 days then be prepared to eat the same breakfast again and again, I loved the location Layout of the hotel front office staff and everything about the hotel
389364,Onix Liceo, No concierge no safe in room I asked for safe and they said it cost 5 euros daily extra Restaurant is at basement level room has very minimal furniture just the bed, Modern comfortable hotel with excellent location For tourists who need to spend a lot of time on the Ramblas day and night
