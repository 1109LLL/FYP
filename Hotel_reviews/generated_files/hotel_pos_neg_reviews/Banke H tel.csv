100374,Banke H tel, Cold air from air conditioning duct blew directly to our face position in bed hence not comfortable while sleeping We had to set the temperature such that the air conditioning system operated intermitently , Clean rooms Friendly staffs Walking distance to major shopping area 
100375,Banke H tel, The staffs is very lazy rude and bad Bad experience for my Paris trip , 24 euro per person for a little varieties of breakfast is a rip off worst the hotel charged the same amount of payment for my 8 years old son 
100376,Banke H tel, nothing really although the bar and restaurant is a little pricey but not excessively , The building is amazing and the staff very friendly helpful and attentive It s in a perfect position to explore Paris as most of the Paris attractions are within reasonable walking distance and the hotel is 100m from the Metro station so others are only a train journey away very clean very comfortable rooms 
100377,Banke H tel,No Negative, Service was great it was a short stay but so relaxing wouldn t even get out the room to visit Paris and we decided to come back every year

100381,Banke H tel,No Negative, The customer service was outstanding When we had an issue it was dealt with instantly and so professionally The manager and his colleagues went to extra lengths to ensure our stay was more than amazing 
100382,Banke H tel, That you only get four instant coffees and the rest are chargeable They are not replenished by cleaners each day , The beautiful entrance hall and the history of the building which the staff happily tell you about 
100383,Banke H tel, The rooms are surprisingly small and the gym has only a few pieces of equipment which disappointed my husband , The Banke is a beautiful hotel and the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful The added extra are lovely pick and mix sweets in reception etc We were celebrating our first wedding anniversary and were treated to champagne which was lovely The rooms were immaculately cleaned every day as well as a daily turndown service My husband and I were able to walk to all the major tourists sites from the hotel though we did clock up a lot of miles We would definitely stay there again
100384,Banke H tel, Better breakfast deal included with the accommodation , The staff we re incredibly friendly helpful Loved the complimentary sweet sour lollie jars the best martini bars I have ever seen

100387,Banke H tel, Mini bar service needs improvement On checking out did not understand why they charged different rates for both rooms and on different dates adding up to slightly higher amount than the original price of 250 EUR per night per room with Booking com, The lobby the staff the rooms the ambiance 
100388,Banke H tel, Tea and coffee not included in price 15 euros is a bit steep for a basic necessity Water 8 Euro per bottle We also dined at the restaurant for Christmas meal Found the food mediocre and over priced Actually we both felt ill afterwards , Location was very close to city centre and main metro lines
100389,Banke H tel, Room was quite small and difficult to use facilities in it due to position of furniture , Staff were wonderful and very helpful Managed to get tickets to wonderful art exhibition we otherwise would not of heard about or been able to go to

100392,Banke H tel, A mini bar full but had to pay a fair bit extra Almost a tease it being full I feel if you had to pay for them they shouldn t have been sat their waiting Giving this was the first thing we were shown on entrance to our room we thought they were complimentary , Hotel was beautiful
100393,Banke H tel, Food and drink very expensive Had a club sandwich 25 processed packet chicken no egg and no bacon very poor Also had two pornstar martinis 40 normal city price but no champagne shot Need to improve food , Great location fantastic lobby and nice rooms Spacious clean nightly turn down service fantastic and staff knowledgable And helpful on how to get around and where to visit 
100394,Banke H tel, The room we had was very small and a bit of a disappointment after the stunning entrance of the hotel This did not put us off returning here but I think I would pay more to have a bigger room , The location was great and the entrance and bar restaurant in the hotel were stunning The staff were very friendly 
100395,Banke H tel, 5 star hotel This should be a bad joke When I arrived I had to ask the luggage boy to help us with out luggage and he had absolutely no reaction He was acting he he wouldn t hear me I wanted to speak to the manager about this situation and the only thing he said was that he was sorry The furniture in the our room was ruined and must have been 20 years old , The only good thing about this hotel is the location near the opera

100397,Banke H tel,No Negative, All of the staff there were incredibly happy and helpful with everything to the point of the doorman helping us find cool unknown bars and less touristy thing to visit They were always happy to talk and find out more about you Definitely recommend staying here such a great location and great hotel

100402,Banke H tel, Providing tea and coffee facilities kettle etc Replacing the dirty wine glasses every day with the other glasses, The location The reception personnel The size of the room comparing to Paris hotels
100403,Banke H tel, the rooms were very small even compared to Paris standard We had to upgrade to a larger suite as staying in the small rooms would have been uncomfortable breakfast was very expensive, The location of the property was excellent it was walking distance to many attractions ie louvre opera gallerie Lafayette gare du nord etc There were several restaurants around the hotel The staff were polite and generally the service was good
100404,Banke H tel, The air con was set to automatic so the room was hot and cold at times but apart from that everything was spot on , The room was lovely clean towels and fluffy slippers The White Company toiletries sweets by the entrance friendly staff gorgeous decor very central with easy access to all major attractions and landmarks and of course the safest district even at 4am we walked from a restaurant to the hotel and it felt so safe Can t wait to come back 
100405,Banke H tel, When I arrived after check in I found cleaning lady in my room fixing her clothes That was weird , Excellent location nice breakfast friendly staff

100410,Banke H tel, Toilet in the room smelt of smoke The luxious double bed was two singles They were very comfortable but the gap was not ideal No kettle in the room,No Positive
100411,Banke H tel, It could have been better if there were coffee facilities in the room, Beautiful hotel with the most charming staff Rooms were slightly small but very stylish and comfy Service was outstanding
100412,Banke H tel, There was a sewage smell in the corridors Tea coffee facilities in the room would be great Bit in the toilet not only in the bathroom, Staff were really nice Appreciated the curtecy water bottle
100413,Banke H tel, Internet was a little slow but it picked up speed later in my stay , Breakfast service ambiance all excellent Very cozy hotel I highly recommend this hotel 
100414,Banke H tel, Staff obviously badly coordinated people kept trying to come into our room happened 3 times in two half days Room showed lots of signs of age despite the hotel being relatively new Its design wasn t very impressive either nor were furnishings and size I m honestly not sure what makes it a five star hotel for me this was a classic four star level which is fine but makes the hotel rather over priced despite the significant Booking discount , The open access sweets in the lobby are a very nice touch Staff is very friendly albeit a bit slow The cocktail bar is pretty good Design of the common areas is nice 
100415,Banke H tel,No Negative, I have stayed at Banke before but this time I was in an updated room refurbished and absolutely lovely with great atmosphere Congratulations Banke

100418,Banke H tel, wifi could be better and if the bed is bigger will be nicer , the location very close to shopping super market across street short metro ride to attractions service was great we traveled with our toddler and she doesn t drink cold milk so the staff took the milk to heat up for us everyday and brought it back to our room staffs always willing to help room is actually not as small as the other places we stayed in Paris Still roomy after putting a pack n play in the room bed was very comfortable 
100419,Banke H tel, The bedroom doors slam very loudly a gadget to enable them to close more gently would be welcome to all the guests , Very comfortable bed and linen Good sized bathroom with the loo in a separate room The room was cleaned to a very high standard 
100420,Banke H tel, sinks in bathroom were very slow to drain window was left open in room unable to close ourselves as special key required window was fixed as soon as reported, Room was excellent dinner was excellent location was really good for us staff were very helpful and left extra chocolates in our room as a birthday gift
100421,Banke H tel, Not the same standards you d expect from a top 5 as far as the little touches service standards and eye to detail Like a very nice 4 hotel reflected in the reasonable room price , Opulent entrance great central location perfect for shopping 
100422,Banke H tel, The Gothic decor particularly in the foyer bar area t, The staff and the way they dealt with not having a room with twin beds which I had requested on the booking form available when I arrived late on Friday night with my daughter Instead we were given two room at no extra cost for that night with a twin room for the following 2 nights of our stay We even had six delicious chocolates and a bottle of water together with a note of apology left in our room on Saturday evening The hotel is ideally situated for the Opera Garnier and is a 15 20 minute walk to the Louvre If you re travelling on the Eurostar the no 42 bus to the Gare du Nord stops virtually outside the hotel 
100423,Banke H tel, We were on honeymoon and got upgraded but we heard that many guests also got an upgrade So we dont feel we got any special treatment Problem with heating in the room but staff responsive and helpful so eventually ok , Great location for shopping near to metro station great atmosphere and very friendly staff Breakfast a bit costly but worth it Great room and unique decoration We loved it all
100424,Banke H tel, The room was not as expected and did not match the picture We would have liked a larger more luxurious room as it appears in the pictures on the website, Staff were very friendly Hotel was beautiful
100425,Banke H tel, Staff was not very helpful I reserved a superior room but they gave me a very small room I paid extra to get a better room , Good location impressive entrance lobby but very dark 
100426,Banke H tel, We had to change 3 times because there was no heating or better improper heating Staff was unhelpful They simply did not realize they were the face to the hotel The final room was in poor condition drapes didn t really close and it was cold we just felt it was pointless to move There was also a strange smell in the sheets Wi fi was terrible In all a very sad excuse for a five star hotel this should be reviewed shameful ,No Positive
