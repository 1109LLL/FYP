452047,Hotel Royal, Wish the shower tub wasn t so narrow and that they would have a non slippery mat in the shower But it was quite manageable so I am not complaining , GREAT LOCATION Smack dab in the center of the city where it all happens Off Stephenplatz 20 steps from the Underground U1 U3 our room did not have a couch and instead it had a desk which was very helpful for doing work on the laptop Our king bed was two twin beds put together with comfortable mattresses The room is pretty large for Europe with hardwood floors and relatively large bathroom Shower tub is narrow but manageable Service is good and the continental breakfast included in the room rate is absolutely GREAT The best breakfast I ve ever had in all my trips to Europe A large buffet of meats cheese fruit bread dairy cereal juice and good coffee 4 Nights cost us 438 euros a very good deal including breakfast The hotel has a working elevator and a safe and AC in the room Our room is on the first floor which is really the 2nd floor for Americans The location is absolutely dead center to everything you d want to see in Vienna and you could walk everywhere if you wanted to 
452048,Hotel Royal, Having tea coffee making facility in the room would make this hotel even better Not complaining but just a remark , Stayed in this hotel for the last 5 night All was great and surely nothing to complain about Location couldn t be any better its just where Grabenstrasse and K rntner strasse meet two of the main Vienna streets Our room was spotlessly clean just as all the hotel Some people were writing about the room furnishing and saying its outdated Well i look at it in a different way its the hotel characteristic just as it appears on the photos so surely whoever booked this hotel knew what the furniture looked like All staff from the front office the porter the chambermaids the restaurant staff etc were very friendly and although in a professional way they were always with an honest smile on their faces Breakfast was also great and well organised Surely worth staying there and if visiting Vienna once again thats where i ll stay 
452049,Hotel Royal, The view wasn t much from my room but I really didn t expect much of one for the good price , The staff was always so nice I asked for an extra pillow and it was delivered right away My sink was a little clogged and when I reported it they fixed it immediately They were always friendly and remembered who I was at all times 
452050,Hotel Royal, No window or fan in bathroom and a young trainee all by herself at reception with very little knowledge of the city , Nice large bedroom excellent location good breakfast 
452051,Hotel Royal, We liked everything , Nothing bad to say about this hotel Location amazing breakfast very good staff excellant Hotel right in the square you walked out the door and you were in the centre of everything Walking distance to many attractions from this location example Opera House Museums churches etc We used the subway from the train station very easy 4 or 5 stops from the station Would stay here again and would highly recommend it 
452052,Hotel Royal, We returned to this hotel after 10 years based on a wonderful previous stay On entering the lobby there was 1 staff at the reception and 1 resting on it No one made an attempt to assist us with getting our suitcases up the curb step Previously the porter came right away with a smile and a hand Our arrival seemed like a great nuisance especially to the staff holding up the counter The staff who checked us in was pleasant and friendly the room was basic and we had twin beds not a double and the room we had previously was just amazing with period furniture The furniture now looks like it needs some attention the manager couldn t be bothered to even stop and say someone will be with you when he saw us at the reception but just indicated someone would be along So dismissive when we asked to settle the bill the night before we left we were told to do it in the morning we said we we were leaving at 5 someone was always at reception is what he said Later that night when I asked why we couldn t settle the bill the staff member became quite aggressive and said that was not what we were told and when I expressed my disappointment in the whole staff attitude and sadly we wouldn t return he responded well I m not Viennese and neither are you so what do you care We were stunned A real disappointment , The location is excellent Good breakfast selection
452053,Hotel Royal, For a reservation of 450 euros I was first charged 2530 euros I had to contact them they corrected and apologized to me and after my stay I was charged twice 450 euros I had to contact them they corrected and apologized to me but it was not easy for me to deal with this situation twice ,No Positive
452054,Hotel Royal, We experienced some noise in the bedroom from the adjoining room which had a party door for when the two rooms are taken as a family unit There was also some noise from the corridor both from staff and guests , The location of the hotel is excellent walking distance to all the city centre facilities and attractions and also the underground station is close by for venturing further afield Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful The breakfast buffet was generally good and had plenty of choice The on site restaurant is good but a little pricey 
452055,Hotel Royal, Probably my only complaint was that the bed was incredibly low to the floor and rather too firm for us Could have done with a topper on top of bed , Croissants were delicious Restaurant at the top of hotel had fantastic view of cathedral Staff were friendly and helpful and food was good Reception staff were very friendly and helpful with very good English Location was really good near stephenplatz with lots of open air cafes nearby 
452056,Hotel Royal,No Negative, Excellent location in the heart of the city Views from rooftop bar area not to be missed Rooms comfortable and well cleaned Staff are very courteous and helpful We have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and have never been disappointed 
452057,Hotel Royal, Pillows were very odd and flat but not a big deal No kettle in rooms but this is typical of all Vienna hotels , Staff were friendly and helpful chocolates on the pillow every day Excellent central location within easy walk of many sights e g Spanish riding school 
452058,Hotel Royal,No Negative, Nice view from the bar restaurant on the top floor The cathedral looks like a mountain Perfect location at the corner to St Stephans Cathedral and U bahn 
452059,Hotel Royal, Bed and little uncomfortable, Good location Friendly staff Nice rooftop bar Partner was given a free bottle of sparkling wine after meal on Valentine s day
452060,Hotel Royal, noisy morning thin walls you could hear your next door room guests sneezing curtains movements etc smoking smell all over hotel in halls and rooms rooms cos we were there with some other friends and their room was same even we had a non smoking room staff could have been more polite even if they hate their job no need to be so grumpy important tip check your bill as you may have some extra things added on probably by mistake at lunch then at dinner again at the ground floor restaurant cannot comment the top floor restaurant it was booked for a party only one thing i know its a smoking one , great location good breakfast
452061,Hotel Royal, Restaurants only average particularly one on top floor which was expensive for what you got , Excellent location Pleasant staff with good English Nice breakfast
452062,Hotel Royal, One of the facilities listed was Airport shuttle which we understood to be mean the existence of a hotel shuttle bus service that included the Hotel Royal as one of its stops and this was one of the reasons for choosing the hotel It turned out there was no bus shuttle and the facility only meant a taxi could be ordered through the hotel In the end we used public transport and had no problem in getting to the hotel but I feel the information given in the description was misleading The restaurant was on the pricey side , The location of the hotel couldn t be better It was very easy to communicate with the staff even before our arrival 
452063,Hotel Royal, There was no bar in the hotel for Non smokers The restaurant downstairs was non smoking but the try to clear this by 22 00 and it does not have a bar area anyway The restaurant on the top floor the one with views over the city and cathedral opens later and has a designated bar area but you have to put up with the smokers who by the way have little concern for anyone else We would not consider returning to Austria because of this , Free Wifi Large room safe Staff Location
452064,Hotel Royal, A little mix up with the meal booking one early closing night but this was very quickly rectified by the reception and restaurant staff and the evening meal was superb Just a little surprised that both restaurants were closed on a Sunday after 8pm , I was so impressed with this hotel The staff were all so helpful friendly and welcoming The rooms were very comfortable and spotless The breakfast buffet was amazing in both variety and standard and the evening meals were excellent I will definitely recommend this hotel to friends It could not have been better located or more enjoyable to stay in Thank you for making our holiday memorable for all the right reasons 
452065,Hotel Royal, I m nit picking Pillows were a touch flat If I d have mentioned it I m sure they would have replaced them , Staff were exceptionally friendly and accommodating They went out of their way to provide a bath seat for my Wife when we only requested a bath mat Fantastic location and nice to stay with a small local chain 
452066,Hotel Royal,No Negative, The location was amazing in the center of everything we used to spend the evening around the hotel in the best spot of Vienna Staff are all very friendly and helpful with special thanks to Atef Mohhamed Amin Sabine Melane and all reception staff Comparing to many hotels in Europe with the same category the breakfast was very good Can not wait to come back to Vienna and stay in The Royal Hotel 
452067,Hotel Royal, Evening staff in restaurant Rude when we walked in to enjoy a glass of wine when the rooftop bar was closed for a private party They acted as if we put them out when we were not eating anything , Staff breakfast and location 
452068,Hotel Royal, Couple of incidents with people coming in off the streets The staff dealt with these well but it is unpleasant at that moment in time, Excellent breakfast and two good restaurants This hotel is so well placed to visit the sites and explore the city We would certainly stay there again 
452069,Hotel Royal, It was a letter for me and the reception forgot to tell me They noticed 24 hours later about that when I was not more interested , The Hotel has a very good location
452070,Hotel Royal,No Negative, Only the placement in the Center near the StephanPlatz Otherwise nothing to worth it 4 stars not the room bathroom not the breakfast Prices are huge but all just for placement 
452071,Hotel Royal, If they can provide variety of asean food that s the big advantage , The room is bigger what it looks like from the advertising photos Hotel Location is superb at the heart of vienna 
452072,Hotel Royal, There was not anything I did not like , The breakfast was very good with plenty of choice I also liked the room where it was served it was spacious and elegant The location of the hotel right in the centre of the city was excellent for sightseeing 
452073,Hotel Royal, No tea and coffee facilities in room Ironing not allowed in room No free water bottle in room, Great location everything is nearby including shopping restaurants cafes and metro station 
452074,Hotel Royal, Uncomfortable Pillows, Amazing Location near St Stephanz Cathedral and shopping stores Great Breakfast and Restaurant Near the pedestrian area A step away from the metro tram way and Billa Supermarket Near Albertina Art Museum
452075,Hotel Royal, would have liked 2 pillows and maybe a sheet on bed as too hot for duvet and air con one of us liked on the other did not too noisy to keep window open , shower was great plenty choice at buffet breakfast staff very helpful and friendly Rooms made up and cleaned very quickly in the mornings 
452076,Hotel Royal, the only same issue is that the mattress in the room was to hard and the single pillow was to soft that apart a really good hotel , The location could not have been better just yards from the underground Staff very helpful 
452077,Hotel Royal, The price is a little bit to high but in generally you know this about Vienna , Very nice place and restaurant with delicious italian food Good located in Vienna near to the main turistical objectives 
452078,Hotel Royal,No Negative, Great location next to the Stephanplatz station and St Steven s Cathedral Close walking distance to all the sights Rooms were very nice with a good view Breakfast was great 
452079,Hotel Royal, The receptionist chinese looking with black hair was very negative and rude she was acting like she is not in the mood for anyone Never saw her smile for 4 nights of stay So many roles Like water boiler and irons are not allowed in the room and if they were found by the staff it will be taken away till the end of the stay Breakfast is very limited, Only the location
452080,Hotel Royal, More than one English channel on the TV BBC World News this is a very minor grip , Nice spacious room with plenty of storage space which is not always the case in city centre hotels Good quality food both at breakfast and dinner Staff extremely welcoming and friendly 
452081,Hotel Royal,No Negative, Prime location spacious and comfortable room with all the amenities needed Excellent wifi and super helpful staff I would stay here again in a heartbeat 
452082,Hotel Royal, We asked for the king size bed and got 2 separate beds The beds were not very comfortable the mattress too hard for my taste , The location is excellent the staff very friendly and helpful 
452083,Hotel Royal, Pillows were too soft Breakfast hot selection was minimal I e scrambled eggs and little sausages which were cold the day I tried them But the cold selection was very good , The room was comfortable The restaurant on the ground floor which I ate in one day was very reasonably priced and the food was very good All the hotel staff were very nice I would definitely recommend this hotel 
452084,Hotel Royal, The bed was hard as a rock First night I didn t sleep hardly at all I complained Housekeeping did an excellent job they made my bed soft enough to sleep , Location is excellent Staff is very friendly and professional 
452085,Hotel Royal, Our room was not cleaned up until 4 pm I asked at the reception what was the problem and received an answer that room cleaning continues through 9 pm Cleaning lady approached us at around 7 30 pm We declined her services Next day when asked to call a taxi to the airport we were given a private car and the driver charged us almost twice as the regular taxi EURO 55 , Location 
452086,Hotel Royal, Asked for another duvet as the bed was a little firm for my partner who had just had back surgery only to be told they had no spare duvets at all , Great location in the heart of stephenplatz Good breakfast room was clean and a good size 
452087,Hotel Royal, The room which was not very comfortable even though big enough and had a view on the very small and dark courtyard, The location very central next to a metro station
452088,Hotel Royal, uncomfortable beds breakfast the same each morning , location staff wifi works absolutely wel metro station in 1 min by walk all sightseeing around you 
452089,Hotel Royal, even when double room is for single use two pillows could be available also they should correct Booking settings and do not offer smoking rooms when they are not available at all in the hotel, perfect location very friendly and handy staff
452090,Hotel Royal, Reservation was confirmed as a smoking room But hotel doesn t have smoking rooms Room furniture was poor and very old Roof garden bar was below expectations Breakfast was terrible Hotel is more of a 3 stars , Location was superb Adel Maknoun from the reception was very friendly and professional 
452091,Hotel Royal, Even though I payed bigger price for free cancellation the hotel charged my credit card one week before even the free cancellation period ended The hotel staff explained that the sum was blocked to guarantee the room availability Then without informing on check in they blocked another 30 Euro At check in I tried to pay for the entire stay but I was told that the room was paid So at check out I lost a lot of time into clarifying all this Moreover the payment system showed a different amount than what I should have payed for So I almost lost my airport bus having to run to Schwedenplatz to catch it I think the hotel shoul clarify their pre payment funds blockage system with Booking com since it appeared to me that I can pay upon arrival with no charges beforehand It s ok to take deposits from credit cards but the Booking com reservation should state so to the clients , Excellent location right next to Stefansdom but quiet Very comfortable 
452092,Hotel Royal, No WLAN in room Incredibly rude restaurant staff in particular one person who was so rude that it really ruined my stay Yelled at me loud and obnoxious in the lobby for moving a cup of coffee from one table to another Unaccepatable I ve had rude staff before everybody can have a bad day so I don t give bad ratings for that but this person is in the wrong job After that loud bad mouthing to the reception staff from said person in the lobby which I caught while exiting the elevator Very unprofessional No apology from Hotel nothing NEVER AGAIN , Room small but o k Reception staff very nice
452093,Hotel Royal, Staff in the rooftop terrace could have been friendlier and much more accommodating Were quite rude and unhelpful even though we just wanted a quick drink before it closed to enjoy the view on our last night , Location was incredible perfect for everything Food very good and room comfortable and clean 
452094,Hotel Royal, You must step into the bath to use the and this was not very convenient In addition handset is not well located for the shower Only small things but out of step with everything else we enjoyed , We stayed at Hotel Royal in Dec 2012 and after considering several possible alternatives we happily returned in Jan 2015 The hotel is incredibly well located in the very heart of Vienna and has access to the Metro only metres away The room with living area and couch was comfortable and spacious with good storage The bathroom even has a bath The buffet breakfast offered a generous spread Desk staff were efficient and helpful We arrived early and were given our room without an extra charge much appreciated after all night train travel 
452095,Hotel Royal, Wifi kept having to be renewed No tea and coffee facilities and bad pillows But otherwise fantastic value for money , Big room and location Right in the centre of old town 1 2 min walk from metro exit Best hotel yet for getting from train to hotel 
452096,Hotel Royal, I asked for a large bed and had twin beds instead In addition the hotel is showing and talking about the view on the cathedral from its rooms on the website but I had a room without vue , Location of the hotel in the city center very close from the cathedral
452097,Hotel Royal, The bed was very uncomfortable , The location could not be better the room was very quiet the staff were courteous and helpful the included breakfast was an excellent deal and the amenities were better than expected 
452098,Hotel Royal, The room was not as clean as it could be bathroom had some things that were clearly not cleaned and the pillowcase had fluff over it I was only given one doona pillow towel etc which I found stingy as other hotels had provided 2nof each regardless of the fact i was travelling solo The heater radiator took a long time to heat up then it was far too hot It was the loudest radiator so sleeping was a problem as it powered on when the temperature got low Wooden floors meant that I could hear people stomping around in the middle of the night The pillow was flat and the bed hard so all these made for some restless sleepless nights One morning housekeeping came in to service the room butbI was still there The man knocked and just unlocked the door and barged in without even waiting for an answer The buffet breakfast that was included was very average uncooked bacon one morning then no bacon any other morning Tiny glasses for juice soggy cold eggs stale pastries Hotel offered booking services for tours etc enquired about airport transfer and they were going to charge 55 euros For a 20 minute trip and one that another company charged 27 euro for Good location but that s about it , The location is great right in st stephens square 
452099,Hotel Royal, The disadvantage of the central location was that the streets were somewhat noisy at night though not such as to disrupt our sleep , A centrally located hotel with a superb staff The reception staff were unfailingly friendly helpful and linguistically adroit Similarly the waiting porting and cleaning staff were notably dedicated and conscientious We enjoyed the easy access to the pleasures and beauties of Vienna and as well the luggage storage arrangement of our room 
452100,Hotel Royal, A bit expensive but worth the price for the location , Great location close to the main attractions shopping and restaurants Very good breakfast Friendly staff Large comfortable room The room was quiet even though the hotel is located on the main pedestrian walkthrough 
452101,Hotel Royal, The mattress was a bit too hard for me but this was no big problem , The hotel is cozy and clean The furniture is a bit oldfashioned which I liked very much Rich breakfast and a very nice breakfast room which was not too crowded on any of the mornings I was there 
452102,Hotel Royal, Only one thing rather obtrusive music at breakfast when you want peace , Superb position in the very centre of Vienna next to the Ubahn Welcoming feel and very nicely appointed
452103,Hotel Royal, The reception staff were not very nice The price , The details in the room like mirrors desk lamps mini bar comfy room nice staff in the breakfast area and warm breakfast restaurant area easy to reach by public transport and its close to city centre
