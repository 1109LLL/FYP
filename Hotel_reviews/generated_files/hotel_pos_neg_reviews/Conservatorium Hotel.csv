469602,Conservatorium Hotel, The breakfast is really expensive unless you have it included in your room fare Two coffess and 2 scrambled eggs for 40 euros , The room was large and fantastic Staff was very helpful Sauna and swimming pool are definetly a plus after a day walking around the city 
469603,Conservatorium Hotel, The hotel is pricey and being charged Euro 4 for a jug of milk enough for a cup of coffee to be brought to your room when you are already paying almost Euro 1 000 per night maybe nit picking, outstanding hotel brilliant location wonderful dining experience at Taiko
469604,Conservatorium Hotel,No Negative, Host desk is extremely helpful and knowledgeable Spa and swimming pool amazing Location is so great for museum lovers we managed to visit all four museums in a short stay Rijks Van Gogh Steflijh and Diamond museums within vicinity 
469605,Conservatorium Hotel, Nothing to complain about , The whole place has a great feel about it a splendid conversion of a grand old building Great place to escape the ghastly summer Saturday afternoon in overcrowded central Amsterdam The Conservatorium is run with a flare and a generosity than one does not always associate with hotels in this city Reception was five star and checked us in early and checked us out late The Restaurant off the lobby has good food and friendly service we felt welcome And its only just round the corner from the Concertgebouw one of the very finest concert halls in western Europe We ll be back 
469606,Conservatorium Hotel,No Negative, Upon arrival the room an upgrade was offered was still being inspected Rather than telling us to wait only 5 minutes we were offered a glass of champagne while waiting The staff is excellent They always responded instantly with a smile 
469607,Conservatorium Hotel, Their Taiko restaurant was disappointing It is a Japanese fusion concept but for us we found little on the menu that appealed and what we ordered was underwhelming and very expensive , Smart stylish hotel in close walking distance to all that you wish to see And the rooms are really lovely spacious and comfortable The Brasserie cafe offers an ice bar lunch option of beautiful salads which was delicious and very healthy 
469608,Conservatorium Hotel, A small thing a simple hook was missing to hung your coat when entering the room and one had to go to the bedroom to find a small cupboard for clothes ,No Positive
469609,Conservatorium Hotel, Very poor house keeping Forgot to clean the room twice and our basin in the bathroom was clogged It wasn t cleaned well in the beginning Concierge doesn t call back and my husband put the baggage in the car none of the bell desk people did anything just stood there Not sure if you can call it the leading hotel of the world ,No Positive
469610,Conservatorium Hotel,No Negative, The experience was flawless from the get go the staff is exceptionally well prepared the suite was fantastic and all the food was spot on Don t miss the spa too 
469611,Conservatorium Hotel, However a general impression of the restaurant and lobby bar staff was really poor They all seemed to be just young students at interim job with no experience at all , A contemporary hotel design and hotel location were just perfect The hotel lobby and lobby bar are really amazing with its glass roof and walls The room interior design was nice and cosy and the interior perfume in the room was adding much to a general relaxing atmosphere 
469612,Conservatorium Hotel, Some rooms are quirky need to be specific about your requirements One of our rooms had bed up stairs with bathroom on lower level not v convenient , Breakfast excellent Staff v friendly helpful
469613,Conservatorium Hotel, Waiting staff had impeccable manners but were slow and didn t always bring what you d asked for so be very clear The breakfast is expensive 32 for the buffet and 42 for cooked eggs etc so be ready for that or go out there s a healthy cafe a few doors down that was open Sat Sun morning , The staff were super helpful at concierge parking reception couldn t fault them The Japanese restaurant Taiko was fantastic a foodie s dream The room was quiet spacious the bed was amazingly comfortable Lovely shower room with Floris products Ask for a kettle tea if you want it but there is a Nesspresso machine 
469614,Conservatorium Hotel, We did not like the two floor room with the bedroom upstairs It makes the downstairs area cluttered and small , Fantastic environment and fabulous staff
469615,Conservatorium Hotel, Bed was too hard stiff and not comfortable Also the quality of the other guests staying and using this property was a bit sketchy As an example we were awakened at 4 00am by some very inconsiderate party ers who decided to use a sitting area outside our suite to party on quite obnoxiously The hotel made a small accommodation to our bill as a result but a high end property would not allow this partying to happen for the length of time it did Very disappointing because it changed an otherwise quite please stay , Beautiful property with excellent architectural features
469616,Conservatorium Hotel, Bar area was comfortable but always full When my guest arrived we couldn t find seating So we took drinks to the room Also finding the elevator was a bit tricky at first although the staff did lead me to my room , Room was extraordinary and service impeccable The concierge station was always available and gave great recommendations and booked everything right there 
469617,Conservatorium Hotel, Matress a little hard and pillows too soft other than that everything was prefect , Most beautiful hotel in Amsterdam Great facilities luxurious feeling and atmosphere Superb location around the corner from the main museums Stedelijk Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum Highly recommend 
469618,Conservatorium Hotel, Breakfast was poor for the money and should be included at this price WiFi could have been faster Swimming pool was chilly The room we had was a little clinical and covered up all the original features of the beautiful hotel building which is a shame , Staff were fantastic Location great Atrium was stunning Taiko restaurant is great 
469619,Conservatorium Hotel, Location is is not central to heart of Amsterdam though very close to museum district , Beautiful property rooms were amazing Staff was incredibly friendly throughout our stay On property bar and gym were top notch Will return 
469620,Conservatorium Hotel, the a la carte food in the brasserie seemed over priced for the standard, We luxuriated in the experience of stunning surroundings friendly and personalised service and great attention to detail made to feel very special as it was a birthday treat 
469621,Conservatorium Hotel, At first they tried to put us into a small room no windows it was changed afterwards but that put me off a little bit as it was my second stay , The room is great Very comfortable 2 bathrooms and 2 showers are great to share with my mother This was an excellent choice to bring my mother as a present The hotel facilities are excellent the staff as well The days are cold and because we leave the hotel early we come back at night and it s a pleasure to spend a little time in the room 
469622,Conservatorium Hotel, What not to like , A superb hotel not cheap but Amsterdam does not so cheap and still fairly nasty rather well The Conservatorium is a startling and wonderful exception From the moment of being welcomed in through the doors through to friendly and helpful reception to the young man who showed us to our room it was all 100 and I never thought I d see a room as good as this in Amsterdam high style quietness comfort you name it Didn t eat in so cannot comment on the food Great location literally just round the corner from quality shops museums the city s greatest concert hall etc 
469623,Conservatorium Hotel, Nothing, Everything was great Great room comfy bed lovely efficient friendly staff Very cool stylish decor and beautiful building Excellent Asian restaurant too
469624,Conservatorium Hotel, The bar was a bit disappointing and felt a bit tucked away on the 1st floor it was quite small with seating relatively pokey or on large communal tables DJ music admittedly after dinner was unappealing and surprising in a 5 hotel The hotel deserves a large stylish bar with comfortable seating in a great setting and a bit of wow factor Instead it feels like a small rather average nightclub The impressive glazed atrium is probably tricky space to make work but the present set up doesn t feel like it quite does it the lounge with uncomfortable low backed sofas gave the feel of an airport transit lounge whilst sharing the atrium area was the bistro but we didn t eat there it felt a little soul less for what was an expensive menu Uncomfortable pillows were flat soft and too large insufficient support stiff neck guaranteed every morning , Very stylish hotel indeed with beautifully appointed modern bedrooms Lovely pool Knowledgeable hosts at concierge desks with good restaurant recommendations Great location next to the top museums also being a very nice part of the city there were lots of super restaurants only a short walk away and being outside the most touristy parts of the city centre Excellent staff
469625,Conservatorium Hotel,No Negative, I love this hotel this is my second time staying here Excellent service great dining options and a comfortable room Everything tastes fresh and organic at breakfast there are great wine and cocktail options in the lounge and dinner at Taiko was a nice experience I also had an amazing hammam treatment at the spa 
469626,Conservatorium Hotel, I guess service quality in the Netherlands is below average in general so you don t expect too much even when you stayed in a hotel of which tourists commenting extraordinary or something alike Also I was told that Justin Biber was staying in the hotel at the same time so always fans waitng in front of around hotel kind of wierd , Decor and ambience are very comtemporary and morden
469627,Conservatorium Hotel, The bed mattress could be improved , The professionalism and friendliness of the staff the location of the property the cleanliness of the property 
469628,Conservatorium Hotel, The prices of the bistro and breakfasts were excessive , The staff are very attentive The style of the hotel and our room were excellent Our room on the annex side was exceptionally quiet and the blackout curtains were very effective in allowing us to sleep late 
469629,Conservatorium Hotel, The superior duplex rooms have great double height but are very narrow and therefore feel very small Possibly more suited to a single traveller , Fabulous hotel and location The staff and service they provided were exceptional 
469630,Conservatorium Hotel, Front desk and security staff are poorly trained to handle situations lack communications skills and curtesy towards their guests Except for the concierge staff who were very cheerful and helpful , Beautiful Building and and ambience The suite was well equipped and comfortable The Concierge staff are very good 
469631,Conservatorium Hotel, There was nothing that we didn t like it was perfect , The hotel felt like home Amazing architecture and it had so much class Walking distance to all the attractions the staff were extremely helpful We could not find any faults The best hotel we stayed at in Europe 
469632,Conservatorium Hotel, The service in outside terrace was A little bit lacking attention when we wanted a drink in the evening , Beautiful building Excellent impeccable staff at all levels Delicious breakfast with unusual choice of food Overall quality Super cocktails from the barman 
469633,Conservatorium Hotel,No Negative, the hotel is magnificent in a stunning location the food sublime rooms ultra luxurious most important was the slick concierge service and the front of house who called me up a couple of times to find out if they could arrange a doctor hot tea etc as I had bad flu cant wait to return to this hip cool and trendy hotel soon 
469634,Conservatorium Hotel, There was an incident with our check in our room was delivered with two and half hours delay The duty manager apologized for this situation and offered us a 50 discount on first night as well as s late check out at 18 00 Our room was with an inside view to the lobby which makes it a bit noisy In addition one of the windows has only a night curtain without a day curtain therefore people from the lobby can see you This is a bit annoying if you want some privacy , The hotel design is just amazing and the service excellent it is located in the museum district close to a very nice park We reserved a deluxe duplex room with view to the interior lobby It is a very spacious duplex with two bathrooms The breakfast buffet is simply excellent and great value money as well as the japanese fusion restaurant Taiko a bit pricy but excellent food and service 
469635,Conservatorium Hotel, I paid the room and took deposit in cash when I check in at the first day instead of the hotel every night charged my credit card with o lot of money , It s an elegant hotel with very professional staff 
469636,Conservatorium Hotel, the account billing as I was charged for another couples dinner bill as well as my own the staff even knew they were doing this but did not tell me, super room bed facilities
469637,Conservatorium Hotel, Some straff were great others were not so great Overall uneven quality of staff The bread at the otherwise very good breakfast buffert was dry , Very good gym Dom Perignon by the glass Great modern rooms 
469638,Conservatorium Hotel, The duplex room was beautiful but awkward with kids We were 1 adult a teen and a child and the room configuration did not work well for us It had a sofa downstairs that made into a toddler size bed The only bathroom was upstairs with the king bed and no extra space The only closet was very small and downstairs basically unusable with the bed and bath up a steep staircase , The common rooms bar restaurants location and the spa are all incredible 
469639,Conservatorium Hotel, Restaurant staff was bit iffy Depends on who you encountered Some were very friendly and others bit snooty The outdoor terrace is amazing but sometimes made to wait for no apparent reason , Truly a beautiful property As I travel often this is the first I have seen of its kind Kudos to the designers Bit of old and new and the loft rooms are amazing F B offerings befit the property and the high level of shopping offered inside and around the property Walking distance from the Van Gogh museum and a beautiful park to lay in the grass Will definitely return Door staff was very friendly and front desk staff definitely followed process and procedure Lacked a Bit of warmth but they are young 
469640,Conservatorium Hotel, Not that we don t like it but if you travel with small children like us Do not pick the duplex room Those stairs keep us alert all day long Our shower room door could not be close properly When we use rainshower water leak from shower room and flooded the floor badly I had informed hotel staff They sent someone to clean up but did not fix the door We ended up decided not to use the rainshower That s the only complained I would like to say , We love everything about this hotel Located in the heart of city Museums are nearby The hotel itself is really beautiful Taiko Hotel restaurant is a must It was one of our best meal in AMS Breakfast is nice Bed is big and so comfy Hotel staffs are great and helpful There s a cosmetics shop in hotel which has good selections of perfume 
469641,Conservatorium Hotel, Our room had perfect modern design but it wasn t convenient Heavy doors to much confusionig mirrors Who needs mirror inside the toilets , Amazing hotel excellent food and great location Staff see friendly and well coming 
469642,Conservatorium Hotel, Whilst the hotel looks impressive the smaller details were lacking for the price paid The sheet didn t fit the bed a used pot of individual mayonnaise served with our meal no offer of assistance with suitcases up the stairs These are usually the little things that you pay the extra money for , Good location
469643,Conservatorium Hotel,No Negative, The staff are very polite and friendly Willing to assist all the time They great all the time and are always happy Style of the hotel and restaurant options 
469644,Conservatorium Hotel, duplex rooms are the worst bathroom downstairs near the front door bedroom upstairs closet downstairs bedroom upstairs small narrow stairs An architect drew this out on paper and thought it was hip but it makes no sense from an activity or flow basis A terrible concept for a high end hotel felt like a cramped student apartment, location lobby staff
469645,Conservatorium Hotel, Overpriced Took delux duplex room air conditioning can t be fixed Very uncomfortable and small Best advice not to take duplexes at all poor breakfast for almost 37 EUR per person , very helpful and nice staff Interestingly designed building 
469646,Conservatorium Hotel, Couldn t stay long enough , Superb luxury hotel in a beautiful building Fantastic bar restaurant Taiko staff attentive polite and friendly 
469647,Conservatorium Hotel,No Negative, We loved the sympathetic blend of old and modern to create a fabulous 5 star hotel All of the staff were so friendly and welcoming We will definitely stay here again 
469648,Conservatorium Hotel, Couldn t figure out if there was a blind curtain on bathroom s window, Everything was great Room service food was delicious great staff superb location if you re interested in the museums nice room design 
469649,Conservatorium Hotel, Nothing, The staff were very friendly The building is unique and beautiful Even though i thought the hotel is a little far away from amsterdam city center it appeard that it is next to many good restaurants the street of the famous boutiques in addition to many other meuseums It has a great location 
469650,Conservatorium Hotel, The tech can get pretty confusing as there are a huge number of light switches many without labels The two story rooms can get pretty uncomfortable especially when packing and unpacking Some ceiling lights hang so low that I was hitting my head extremely frequently but then we moved a table underneath it The shower in my first room deluxe duplex smelled like excrement Three housekeepers and an engineer couldn t fix it so we were upgraded to the royal duplex The manager who moved us forgot to mention that a prior guest had ripped off the closet door so the closet had no door this was made more annoying by the motion sensing light that turned on whenever anyone walked within a few feet of the closet At least one wake up call never came To make up for the issues the hotel begrudgingly gave us complimentary breakfast and a massage each for me and my wife but the manager who gave those to us made it very clear that he was unhappy about doing so He was extremely gruff and rude although another manager that we dealt with was an absolute pleasure every time we spoke As we were checking out the nice manager let us know that apparently the hotel had reserved us a pretty amazing suite for our last night but the front desk had neglected to tell us about this so we did not get a chance to try that suite While the trip had some negatives the nice manager fantastic breakfast staff ideal location and stunning building will bring us back to Conservatorium I am hoping that all of this was simply our bad luck and not indicative of the hotel s general quality , The hotel was absolutely gorgeous and had a fantastic breakfast as well as a lovely pool and spa area Massages were nice The rooms were huge and had very large windows 2 story in my rooms Because we were traveling for our honeymoon the hotel had delicious macarons waiting for us in the room at check in They also gave us a coupon for free glasses of champagne but for religious dietary reasons we were unable to use that The inclusion of a Nespresso machine in each room was a nice touch I come from an espresso obsessed family but when we requested more intensely flavored pods and espresso cups our first room had no espresso cups it took over an hour to get those so we were already on our way out for the day by that point One manager was fantastic and made us feel extremely welcome the other one that we dealt with would not have been out of place in a road side Holiday Inn 
469651,Conservatorium Hotel, The breakfast was limited in the buffet, Loved the service the amenities Amazing location The archetict and design is very artistic and creative Nice lobby Loved the care for small details
469652,Conservatorium Hotel, The staff at the restaurant brassiere were disorganised At the Boxing Day dinner the service was bad the waiter s did not understand the concept of the wine arrangement there was no wine with the courses or wine was served in the wrong glasses Breakfast was the same long waits for coffee and cooked breakfast It was a shame as the food was really good , Beautiful hotel the staff at the reception were lovely and made us feel special as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary The location was also great near the museum really loved would come back again 
469653,Conservatorium Hotel,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and eager to recommend good restaurants and places to go out at night Though the rooms were immaculate the staff made the place feel like a home away from home 
469654,Conservatorium Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is a visual delight from the moment you walk in The exposed bricks the glass cube divider for the braserie the lighting Fantastic The staff especially the hosts were very helpful and accommodating with our children around The icing on the cake was the gin cocktail Menu at the bar and the fabulous meal at taiko 
469655,Conservatorium Hotel, We had some problems with the conceirge restaurant bookings in particular we had a very bad experience with The Duchess restaurant where they did not have a booking from the hotel we leaked for two hours then had to leave find another restaurant at 23 00 which totally ruined our evening , The entire hotel experience was excellent 
469656,Conservatorium Hotel, NOT A THING It was heaven on earth , EVERYTHING The service is just beyond exceptional And the attention to details of every little thing is superb I can t wait to go back 
469657,Conservatorium Hotel, the rooms are high quality and interesting but not very intimate or cozy and the electric controls like the lights and window shades are awful they all look the same and the worst ergonomics they re a nightmare to figure out and absolutely maddening trying to mess with them in the dark , The staff are terrific super friendly but professional and helpful The lobby restaurant and main area on the ground floor are really cool and ian incredible design The restaurant is cool and has great food 
469658,Conservatorium Hotel, service was friendly but not that great staff fairly dismissive service in the breakfast restaurant was particularly poor waited long to attract their attention got the orders mixed up, Great facilities and location nice feel about the common areas The old building is great and quite special The area is nice you are central but yet outside of the real hubbub
469659,Conservatorium Hotel,No Negative, Beautiful hotel building with a lot of character the rooms had very high ceiling and a clever design to separate sleeping and living areas The hotel has a good location next to major museums and concert hall The staff was very attentive 
469660,Conservatorium Hotel, Nespresso as a coffee in the room choice I am an Illy fan , The building the interior the staff the vibe the beds the shower the lovely bikes to rent the french toast is to die for the Vitamin C Zink supplements in the mini bar room service 
469661,Conservatorium Hotel, Our bedroom had stairs to where the bed was located We are both older so this was made it hard to us to go up and down Service in the breakfast area was terrible, Location
469662,Conservatorium Hotel, Broken elements of the wardrobe do not fit a hotel of this class , We had lovely stay The room is huge for conditions for Amsterdam The well trained staff lets you think that you are in true 5 star hotel
469663,Conservatorium Hotel,No Negative, This is a wonderful glamorous hotel in the best location in Amsterdam Stayed two years running and I wouldn t stay anywhere else in Amsterdam now 
469664,Conservatorium Hotel, Good hotel but accomodation and personnel level not in the 700 euro night hotel league No bath in deluxe room The top quality is just not there , Good hotel and location 
469665,Conservatorium Hotel, One and only issue that I had Which is solely my issue is that it was a bit far from the centre of town and that was what our trip was about , Hands down the most fabulous hotel I ve ever been to I travel a lot and never have I encountered such service If Burj Al Arab gets 7 stars these guys should get 8
