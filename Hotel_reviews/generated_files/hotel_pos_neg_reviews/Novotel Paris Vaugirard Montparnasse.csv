123017,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, The toilet was separate from the bathroom which I simply cannot stand The bars on the ground floor and roof top both closed at 10 30 pm and the staff stopped serving because they said it was too quiet The breakfast was being charged at 18 euros per person and for a family of four I m Sorry this is unacceptable especially with the 27 euros car park fee and city tax bolted on Wouldn t stay here again , Clean modern hotel in a convenient location
123018,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Room carpets need steam cleaning We couldn t find an information folder in the room only found out about the rooftop terrace as we were leaving had to ask for tourist brochures in English Interactive screen was good but didn t know it existed til the last day , Having adjoining rooms for the extended family was great single sofa beds for the grandkids were ideal Nice to have a fridge as well as tea coffee facilities Beds were comfortable bathrooms were spotless good having a separate toilet Never had to wait for lifts plenty of space in them for luggage Noon checkout was brilliant Staff were always friendly spoke good English compared to our French 
123019,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Parking was supposed to be included then got detail from hotel that there was a height limit restriction 1 85m only after we booked So we had to use local parking in any event Which was very close by , Staff very friendly
123020,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Smaller room but the view made up for it Aircon didn t really work , Great view from the room Waking up to the tower every morning was great The staff were really helpful and were understanding of my bad French The breakfast had a good variety of nice food 
123021,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, 1 It took me 30 mins o checkin Checkin was pathetic 2 The receiption was not sure of breakfast timing Huge gap in coordination between staff which is not expected from Novotel , 1 Location is good 2 Rooms are good
123022,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Nothing, Be sides the room is large enough my family very love this room because the room has connecting door So my both daughter very happy to run one room and another Thx Novotel
123023,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Nothing , All was good 
123024,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Parking was convenient but neither intuitive nor cheap , Comfortable beds really good food in the restaurant and a variety of breakfast foods available 
123025,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Unfortunately the room we stayed at was awful Broken down used and dirty I booked a Superior Family Room for 3 and a small dog The rooms had a double bed and a couch that could be opened as a bed The room was very small The hallways were also ugly and had the feeling everything was cheaply done and dirty My wife used the toilet near the reception and later told me she had never seen such a dirty toilet in her life , The hotel has a good location close to Line 12 metro station and the Eiffel Tower is a 30 minutes walk It has an underground parking but you might find the 27 EUR daily free a bit steep well it s Paris Staff was friendly and helpful all speaking English They are pet friendly so if you are travelling with a dog it could be a plus 
123026,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Aircon was not functioning but they provided us with electric fan , The hotel is in a safe place and almost in front of the Police Station They changed the reception to have better interaction with guests You can view the lighted Eiffel Tower from their 7th floor at night My room has free minibar The room has bluetooth speaker Ms Laurence at the front desk is very accommodating and helpful It made outstay in the hotel more personal Very near the Metro train and bus station groceries and pharmacy Strong unlimited wifi Good soundproofing
123027,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Oh boy Hotel is worn down full of families with kids breakfast area is so crowded that you may come to que for 20 minutes to get a seat location is far from tourist areas and the real Parisian atmosphere won t stay again here Before leaving the hotel my wife wanted to have a tea in the lobby the guy was so rude saying to her that he is not making any tea for 1 person he is busy and that she should go to any coffee shop in the neighbourhood for a croissant and a coffee We went straight to the shift manager who after listening to us promise to compensate us by refunding us the parking fee 47 which didn t happen not even now 3 weeks later you can judge by yourself btw entering the underground parking is really an achievement parking spaces are so narrow that only mini cars fit in just to be aware of but so is almost every parking in Paris , variety of the breakfast and the fact that there is an underground parking staff is ok
123028,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, wifi system does not work properly connection constantly drops and is dead slow totally unacceptable, location room size service staff friendly and efficient
123029,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Restaurant and in room dining options are minimal Barely 3 4 vegetarian dishes Tried in room dining once pasta was burnt Temperature control in the room did not work it has option only to increase the temperature On couple of days of our stay it was hot and we had to keep the window open as the air conditioning was not working well T, Great location it is located near the metro station and is safe to walk around in the evening Many super markets and restaurants are nearby Rooms are modern Staff are very friendly and helpful they promptly provided an additional fan to compensate in the middle of the night when air conditioning was not working 
123030,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse,No Negative, The staff are all so lovely Each person was so welcoming and helpful and all so approachable The beds were so comfortable and the location is perfect we walked to the Eiffel Tower Would definitely stay again next time I m in Paris 
123031,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Breakfast was expensive Parking was a bit tricky but a nice safe location to keep our vehicle during our stay in Paris , Good breakfast Spacious clean rooms Comfortable beds Nice helpful staff 
123032,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Bit out of the way to most attractions , Lovely view of Eiffel Tower from top storey Staff very helpful especially with outside transport to n from tourist attractions 
123033,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, At breakfast one usually had to go through quite a few plates to find one which did not have food remains on it Our room was cleaned for 3 days in a row and glasses with juice in it were left in the same position we left them each time One day we came back to find our toiletries had been left in the sink after the room was cleaned In general the facilities need to be improved if this is indeed a 4 star hotel otherwise this isn t worth the money, The staff were mainly pleasant and tried their best
123034,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Thw sofa bed was not good for sleeping The room was too little Pillows big and hard , Location is very good Breakfast is very good Staff very friendly 
123035,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse,No Negative, We really liked the buffet breakfast there s something for everyone The hotel was perfect for what we wanted it for to tour the city It s conveniently located right by the station and as we were a family of 5 we were lucky to be offered inter connecting rooms which were more than adequate 
123036,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Breakfast room not welcoming Dishes were many times unclean or smelled of egg Coffee machine did not work properly on one of the days Less than average pastry The sink in the bathroom is unnecessarily wide and tap small and far Bathtub shampoo gel is clumsy and of poor quality On the first night there was something gooey chocolatey on one of the sofa bed sheets One of the windows handles did not work properly, Nice and helpful staff Welcoming reception Nice room size Good location in a nice neighborhood with metro and bus stations few mins away
123037,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Sofa beds not quite so comfortable There aren t a lot of restaurants nearby to choose from , The beds are very comfortable Breakfast was very good 
123038,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Shower was a bit tricky and water temperature changing Parking is underground and quite small but having a parking spot for your car in Paris is worth a lot , The hotel is on a busy street full of little caf s restaurants and boutiques The room was absolutely okay nothing to complain about But the biggest asset of this hotel is its staff They and ALL of them were super helpful friendly and child friendly 
123039,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Room too hot at night The parts of hotel not recently refurbished are a little shabby Better signage from the car park to find the lift into the hotel we had to struggle with the stairs , Large comfortable bed We had adjacent rooms which worked well for us as a family Breakfasts were excellent
123040,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, 1 We couldn t change the room temp and we were feeling hot and we had to leave our window open for hours to cool down 2 Breakfast didn t had much variety Very basic There were just 1 2 staff people in restaurant so service was very slow They were helpful though , Beds were comfy The fridge mini bar in the room was very handy as we had 2 kids There were Complimentary soft drinks There was supermarket across the road which was added advantage Everything was local 
123041,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, The bar service was very unfriendly and slow very disappointing considering that the remaining staff was so friendly The air conditioning was turned on a bit too much in public areas but could be due to the very cold and rainy weather the weekend , Staff at the reception was very friendly and helpful they had umbrellas for the rainy weather and helped us with the printing of documents we needed for the weekend The rooms were perfect size for a weekend getaway for two with an extra large balcony Rooms were equipped with modern TV and the bathrooms were very well kept View from the rooftop terrace is amazing with an amazing view of the Eiffel Tour WiFi works fantastic Good restaurants in walking distance of the hotel 
123042,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Check in check out was a little slow Paris is of course expensive If you are on vacation there are more economic places to stay , A no fuss well presented business style hotel which suited my purposes My room was very good clean comfortable Lots of places to eat locally so didn t sample the dining possibilities 
123043,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse,No Negative, Good size rooms which are well equipped but to need to book it while there s a deal on as it s often expensive Good area for business in Portes de Versailles area but not so handy for tourists
123044,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Pillows too hard and only one each of little extras in the room like water moisturiser etc when it was a room for two , Seeing the Eiffel Tower out of the bedroom window and breakfast was nice Location was also good 
123045,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, breakfast box replacement for a paid breakfast when we had to leave early to go home waiting to see if they take something off the bill , nice clean room and very good showers 
123046,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, It s a self service hotel any thing you want you have to go and collect by yourself from down, Location it s just in front of the Vagiguard Metro station 
123047,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, The staff were arrogant and rude from the moment we stepped into the hotel we requested an early check in and they made us wait for four hours they were not helpful didn t speak full English spoke in French with other colleagues to talk about us called us taxis that cost a bomb made us carry and iron and ironing board to our room they were not accommodating in any way the customer service was terrible would definitely never stay here again ,No Positive
123048,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Internet one of the worst wifi No enough tea bags milk in the room in a family of 4 there is only 2 tea bags parking for customers should be free , Beds were good and so was the sofa cum bed Staff were friendly the entertainment for kids at reception was very good Complimentary drinks were refilled everyday 
123049,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, We booked an adjacent room for our children and prepaid for both rooms on that confirmationbut on arrival they told us there weren t any left My husband had to sleep in one room with 2 of our young children and I stayed in the other room with the third child Very disappointed,No Positive
123050,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, 1 Breakfast One of the most horrible breakfast experiences ever Customers expected to make their own fried eggs omlettes using pans etc make their own orange juice using oranges and extraction machine No service on the table at all unlike other 4 star hotels 2 Room size and layout Horrible layout of standard room with very small size that leaves no room once the sofa bed is opened Toilet on one side of room entrance and showers on another Very odd combination my first such experience in 15 years of travel 3 Housekeeping No individually packed shampoos a squeeze bottle provided instead with no idea of the content and integrity of the contents No body lotions No dental kits provided on request out of stock as per front desk first such incidence in my 15 years of travel , 1 Location Centrally located and easy access to Metro and Bus to all attractions 2 Children Play Area Right at entrance there is a small but beautifully done children play area with books toys chairs and a cool touch screen tv table Good job 3 Hotel lobby Very lively hotel lobby Cool setup and well lit 
123051,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, The only complaint i have is i wished that the room service was 24hr , The croissants were amazing soft and flaky the staff was very accommodating and it was not a terrible distance from some of the major attractions of Paris I walked from the hotel to every attraction i visited 
123052,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, We did not receive the type of room we booked Payed for top quality but was put in a standard room due to availability We paid in advance Room was old in need of repair ,No Positive
123053,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse,No Negative, Wonderful staff At my request a surprise was organised by the staff for my wife who was celebrating her birthday My greatest and sincere thanks to the staff my stay was short but I will be back during my next visit 
123054,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, facilities at the room was not fully functioning and I had to change my room 2 times to have a good air conditioning breakfast is not at the same value of money i think with less money you can get a better place in Paris , the staff are helpful at the front desk 
123055,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Breakfast is expensive but great that kids eat free, Rooms were very clean staff helpful and breakfast great Hotel location is great and has easy access to train and buses 
123056,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, The hotel is tired and dated with a very expensive roof top bar that isn t that special, The drinks in the fridge in the room are complimentary the room rate is reasonable and enables a family to visit paris on a budget There at some nice restaurants nearby 
123057,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, The little lady from the breakfast room she is agressive with the clients you can seat only where she wants and if the breakfast is until 10 o clock she locked the door from 9 30 and not letting clients get in the breakfast room I think she had several complains during our stay , The room was clean everyday Location near the metro station 
123058,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, The toileteries and the tea making stuff was not replenished daily , Excellent location near the metro station The rooms were comfortable The view from the top floor of the hotel of the Eiffel Tower was simply magical 
123059,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Needs to have cups and saucers in room and not paper cups Tables in top bar were unstable resulting in some drinks being spilled Needs some weights fitted We paid extra for a mini bar but this was soft drinks only This needs to be made clear when booking, The bar was very good on top floor Has excellent view of Eiffel Tower Well located to bars cafes shops and Metro Quite modern and comfortable and decent value for money Nice bar on ground floor with outside tables and seating in garden area About 20 minute walk to Eiffel Tower
123060,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, the room is a little bit old need to refresh only one bottle of water for 2 person just one plug in all room , corner room a little bit bigger then the other rooms open windows
123061,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, The rooms are small I was deceived Some reception staff are rude The room had no aircon I couldn t sleep , Do not believe details in booking com everything here is a lie The rooms in reality are not the same as in the photos Not all staff there are nice 
123062,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, 1 The cooling was just a normal air It was pretty bad The first room I got was on the corner of 5th floor The cooling there was horrible I then complained to which they changed my room as if they know that this room had problem with cooling The new room was on same floor it was better with cooling but still wasn t enough They have provided thick blankets with which sleeping was a nightmare I even have to open the window in order to sleep well 2 The mattress in sofa was with springs and springs literally pinches you while sleeping 3 The room service wasn t efficient On the first morning while leaving the room I put their provided tag mentioning that you can clean the room and when I was back on night nothing was cleaned Next day I did the same and went directly to reception in order to tell them The lady there said that have you put something on the door to which I said yes and then she said that s why they didn t service your room But I said the tag was mentioning that you can clean the room mentioning directly that I am not in the room so you can clean it God knows what are there policies but the impression was quite bad , The room was clean and has all the facilities The sofa bed was also fairly good in which two people can sleep easily Other than that the provided master bed was also good The location is not that great but considering the size of the city it was adequate One can walk to Eiffel tower in 10 to 15 min The staff was good and handled the situation quite efficiently 
123063,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse,No Negative, The Staff were very helpful with all of our questions The view of the Eiffel Tower from the top floor was spectacular especially at night whilst enjoying a few cocktails 
123064,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, We booked for four people There were towels for only three people Shower products were also very few , The location and the rooftop terras with the beautifull view at the Eifeltower kind staff 
123065,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, So they said they upgraded one of the rooms but there was only one bedslipper n one robe and it was very small when we went downstairs to ask for another bedslipper the night reception wanted to argue with us saying he did not see n upgrade breakfast wasn t included and it was too far plus we had to buy drink inorder to sit on the balcony and see the Eiffel tower and the safe wasn t working food is too expensive other than that it was ok won t be going back tho, We liked the beds the view and the showers 
123066,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Cleaners didnt do a great job left loads of rubbish in room most days , Great location n easy metro access Friendly staff Many places to eat out balcony with Eifel view was a bonus
123067,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Worker s attitude especially female workers N their house keeper is not stay their 24 hours so we couldnt ask abt house keeping in the late time after 4 pm, Good to use other convenience system near hotel coin laundery system n mart n restaurant not in the hotel bt the workers r not good maybe the france style will be like that Bt except their support little bit weak others r good
123068,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Very inflexible on every small request check out time till I told them that I m a Gold memeber and this is not really a favor I m asking for changing the dates of my stay though I proposed to pay penalty if needed or buy with higher rate I felt dealing more with an intransigent public administration than a leisure hotel , Nothing
123069,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Called front desk once and got no answer for a long time Entrance is small and no easy access for bags and baby stroller , Staff are helpful and polite Clean and comfortable with good service
123070,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Hotel is old tho Breakfast was nt great Did nt have many options for the price we had to pay , Rooms are spacious Location fantastic Next to metro station
123071,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Be warned that this hotel will purposely try to hide charges from you like breakfast costing 18 euros a day PER PERSON The reception will inform you that breakfast is upstairs and tell you what hours it takes place but will not make sure to let you know that you will be paying an arm and a leg for a breakfast that isn t even worth 5 euros per person a day When reception told me this at the end of the stay and told me I owed 95 euros I was very disappointed Reception should explicitly tell their guests that they will be charged for this rather than surprise you with it at the end It all seemed very sneaky to me and not a way a hotel should want to run their business , Hotel was nice and clean 
123072,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Money went missing from our room we didn t complain as didn t use the safe provided so our fault I guess and always the element of doubt so didn t accuse anyone but we had some Stirling money on arrival and didn t after the 2 nights, Reception staff were great good location beside a Metro station and room was spacious and clean
123073,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, This hotel is listed as a 4 star hotel however it is very dated The carpets are worn the rooms are stuffy due to a lack of air conditioning and the paint is peeling in the bathrooms This is more like a 2 3 star location , The beds were very comfortable and the location was very convenient to the metro All the main tourist attractions were accessible withing a 20 minute metro ride The breakfast was expensive yet very filling The kids wating for free was a great bonus 
123074,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, All the staffs were very helpful like Mr Ahmad who printed our airline check ins and booking our taxi to cdg the next morning But the big minus was on the day we checked in and were told by Ms ghania at the reception that we were not going to get our confirmed TWO adjacent rooms for 6 persons non smoking which were confirmed and charged for since may 18th she should not be at the customers facing position because she was arrogant impolite and even told us that the rooms were taken by expedia who booked many rooms that day Is booking com lesser important than expedia Really After 20 minutes of arguments she offered to move us the next day which we decided not take it as re packing was a waste of energy Had she been polite and not so arrogant we would have accepted the two separate rooms willingly She kept to her true form when we checked out by asking twice if we had taken breakfast even when we answered No to her first question already If you are checking in and see Ms Ghania at the reception I would advise you to avoid her to keep your sanity , Location Comfort Cleanliness Good price value We had been staying in this hotel the last time we came to Paris so this was our second stay 
123075,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, the breakfast was really expensive 18 per person the rooms which are in street side have no proper view just a building in front of you only a few of executive rooms have the Eifel Tower view , the bed was good and comftable the Hotel is near to Metro Station and it is a good Advantage most of the stuff in reception are friendly and help you if you Need to find an address 
123076,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Rooms are too hot with no way to cool like an air conditioner can The entire hotel has an air cooling system that you can only make warmer not colder , Friendly helpful staff Good breakfast Less than a one minute walk to the 12 
123077,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Reached the hotel at around 7pm and i have been told that my booking was cancelled systematically although i have confirmation from booking com The receptionist told that confirmation is different than the hotel confirmation which actually didn t understand So i they offered me one room instead of two and told me they can help me in finding another hotel Finally they got me another room in the same hotel , Location Reception environment Cleanliness
123078,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Arrived at hotel to be told the joined rooms we had booked were not available As we were travelling with 3 children we had purposely chosen this hotel as it offered joined rooms Were at least given rooms beside each other Prices for breakfast bar were ridiculous Only 1 small bottle of water supplied per room 5 of us staying and had to ask for this to be replenished Thermostat in room only for heating no air con , Close to metro Good sized room for central Paris 
123079,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse,No Negative, Amazing view Had a view of the Eiffel Tower right from our balcony The mini fridge was stocked and complimentary Great location near the metro only 15 mins or less to the Eiffel Tower Also good assortment of stores close by 
123080,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, They did not honor my first reservation with a conformation number They said that wasn t there fault and it was booking com issue Had me pay 183e more for the same two rooms , It was clean and central near coffee shops and metro 
123081,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse,No Negative, The staff were friendly attentive and professional The hotel was situated in a really good convenient location and the roof top bar was stunning Breakfast was delicious Great coffee hot chocolate the fresh fruit was fantastic with fresh grapefruit an abundance of yogurts and ham cheese Delicious various breads croissants pain au chocolate were yummy fresh every day We were incredibly impressed and we would certainly return We were visiting Paris Disneyland with our daughter son in law and 3 grandchildren we decided to stay outside Disney as we thought it would be more restful We were telling our family how great everything was and they were very impressed Well done to the whole Team 
123082,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Breakfast could have had more cooked choice such as beans tomatoes Only choice for this was sausage egg and bacon Lots of cold buffet choice but just needed more of a selection for cooked , Lovely room Friendly staff No problems at all Good location for tower and metro 
123083,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, No comment, Location was nice easy to get around on the metro line plenty to see the hotel was nice the food drinks was enjoyable at the hotel some of the restaurants we went to 
123084,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, The hotel refused to switch the aircondition on as they said it was still the winter and therefore not needed The nights were uncomfortable as the rooms were quite warm and due to a busy street it wasn t possible to open the windows I wish the hotel had respected the description which clearly listed airconditioning as an option , Good location and friendly staff The food at the hotel was also very good 
123085,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Electricity was announced to be cut for 30mn and it lasted 1 5 hours Could not work in the room no wifi power and it did not seem to bother any of the staff hotel Communication door between my room and the next one was not closed I had to call security at 1am to come and lock the door , The hotel as a parking 
123086,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Well I had expected to be next door to the station , It is a real problem that they call the hotel vaugirard monparnasse There is a Novotel IN the Gare vaugirard at monparnasse they tell me at least three clients a day go to the wrong hotel and it is too far to walk to the correct one 
123087,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, No way of cooling the room Tea and coffee in the rooms was poor and only one of each Drinks overly expensive including water, Great multilingual friendly staff Clean 
123088,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, The rooms were extremely hot We couldn t turn heating down so slept with windows open We had originally booked 4 rooms and needed to cancel one The hotel wouldn t even respond to emails Kept saying it was up to Bookong com to ok changes We were really dissapointed in the treatment we received ,No Positive
123089,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Toilet and bathroom were in two separate rooms Toilet did not have any water to wash yourself The room could have been a bit warmer Breakfast was always the same and not very variable , Location was good and near a metro station It was a clean and quiet hotel with a police station opposite of the street So it was safe Staff were friendly and helpful 
123090,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, I had an issue with room service I had ordered a burger well done but was given a medium well i had informed them but they only offered to re cook but my girls were so hungry and tired from our outing that they ate around it because they couldn t wait I had to pay for it they didn t even offer to credit my account , The staff were very nice When they learned I was traveling with young girls they gave them free little gifts Multilingual staff which is a big plus 
123091,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Inefficient air conditioning in room which led to having to keep the window open overnight Very disappointed by the poor state of the carpet not reflecting a 4 star hotel rating at all I have seen far better standards in Premier Inn and Travelodge in the UK both of which set a far higher standard of room cleanliness , Excellent customer service from very professional and helpful reception staff 
123092,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, I have been in better Novotel s Sauna is small no place to cool down and relax and no changing facilities the room was ok but the douche was leaking and you re becoming intoxicated by the air fresheners , the breakfast was fair 
123093,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Too warm and had to open window and fan ran all night Unfortunately my room is facing the street so it was very noisy during the night and could not get good sleep ,No Positive
123094,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, room was old and outdated could do with some much needed renovations not worth the money we paid Paris is an expensive place to stay we should have budgeted for more Lol, Staff were lovely on most occasions a couple of them could learn to smile 
123095,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, The breakfast is boring not variativ Same day by day, Good location strategic Easy to find restorant near to eiffel tower and closed to metro station Very recommended place for stay in paris
123096,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, The people next to us were quite loud and in the end I had to notify staff and it quietened down for a while and then there was banging Perhaps he was annoyed after that , I liked the location near the Eiffel Tower Room was very clean 
123097,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, There is nothing we didnt like, Everything about this hotel was perfect The rooftop bar was amazing staff were friendly and helpful was also in a great location 10 10 from us 
123098,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, The rooms were VERY hot we slept with the window open most nights which helped but the police sirens didn t , The hotel was lovely staff very helpful The coffee machine was fab 
123099,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, The sofa bed was uncomfortable but we ask for an extra duvet to lay over the mattress which helped but she could still feel the springs , The breakfast were very good lots to choose from 
123100,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, The sofa bed is only for kids I can feel the metal chassis of the sofa bed A bit pricey for in house parking but it s Paris , Very helpful receptionists Close to almost everything even a small kids area just 5 min walk Metro and bus also available Convenient stores like Dia Carrefour express very close 
123101,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Didnt t like that the top floor bar with outdoor seating and views of the eiffel tower was not open The bar with the view was the selling point that led me to book this hotel , Liked proximity to metro station
123102,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Very near to metro but metro exit only has stairs Room had a musty smell needed to open the window everytime we came back to air it Street was quite noisy so couldnt leave the window open the whole night No clear instructions on how to view Eiffel from L7 , Everything a Novotel should have Was pleasantly surprised by the welcome gift when we notified the hotel that we were on our honeymoon View of Eiffel from 7th floor was nice 
123103,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, One of the staff caused a stir when he seemed to accuse one of our family of not being on the guest list for breakfast demeanor was rude Fortunately management rectified the situation adequately The rest of the staff were quite pleasant , An excellent value for the location Metro is only 2 minutes by walking Breakfast was better than I expected reasonable buffet options for this level of hotel ability to make own hardboiled eggs crepes already made in a pile bacon sausage variety of breads yogurt fresh fruit I also greatly appreciated the coffee options from the automatic machine espresso cappuccino coffee w creme 
123104,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Hotel could use some small touch ups paint small renovations to make it look a lot better breakfast was a little spendy should be included, Very close less than 5 min walk from metro station fairly roomy for 2 adults 2 kids conveinent parking just under hotel
123105,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, Family bedrooms are very small when you open the sofa bed no way to walk in the room minibar was empty not even a bottle of water breakfast room should be refreshed , Staff at reception was very nice and helpful Not at restaurant some were commenting clients behavior together Kids play area in the lobby

123109,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, The room and hotel was clean but the room required maintenance Broken stoppers in the bath and sink some light bulbs weren t working and such My biggest complaint was the itchiness of the sheets which from my experience comes from being a little too cheap on the laundry detergent , Loved the centralized location and the majority of the staff were really friendly Other reviews had complaints of the wifi but I thought it was excellent perhaps we didn t travel during peak times

123115,Novotel Paris Vaugirard Montparnasse, We didn t like the fact that we had to ask several times for toiletries to be put according to the number of people in the room 4 because the replacement was deficient We also didn t like the way one female staff member responded impatiently to a request we had since we were facing difficulties in a foreign country , What we liked best was the perfect location which allowed us easy access to practically everywhere we wanted to go We also felt welcomed by most of the staff We liked the way staff responded promptly to a technical problem we had with the fridge when we arrived
