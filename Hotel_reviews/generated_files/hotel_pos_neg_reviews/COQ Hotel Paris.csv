55389,COQ Hotel Paris,No Negative, The hotel is amazing and I highly recommend it It s located at a quiet street in close proximity to the center of Paris and Place d Italie where public transport is available Had a very pleasent stay 
55390,COQ Hotel Paris, The room size could have been a little bigger but it s ok because we spent most of our days on outside anyway , The common areas were well decorated and cozy The people working there were very warm friendly and attentive to the guests 
55391,COQ Hotel Paris,No Negative, We loved this hotel It is a 2 minute walk from the metro and ALL ofthe staff members were welcoming and super friendly So many lovely features and quirky little touches througout the hotel The beakfast is lovely and the coffee excellent I will definitely be back very soon 
55392,COQ Hotel Paris, Some of the staff were not that pleasant customer orientated The rooms are small but then again it s Paris , Very clean and cool design Nice crowd Some of the staff were great 
55393,COQ Hotel Paris, Fire alarm went off two days in a row because of a supposed shower and someone else smoking in their room which was annoying to have a rude awakening , Very comfy bed Chickens outside our room were fun Staff very helpful 
55394,COQ Hotel Paris, The rainshower didn t work so had to use the handheld , Excellent welcome We were a bit early and the staff made us feel at home with a coffee and a fresh juice The location is also excellent close to the Place d Italie and a range of public transportation options The room is a decent size it s Paris after all and is well appointed including a Nespresso machine for coffee in the morning The lobby restaurant area is great with a nice sunroom for reading or just hanging around 
55395,COQ Hotel Paris, Room was a bit noisy neigbouring room hallway , The C O Q Hotel is conventiently located just steps away from the Place d Italie metro stop making any location in Paris within reach Very friendly and helpful staff Lovely decorated interior with eye for detail the right kind of bohemian with plants and nice little touches like old oil painting portraits and deisgn books in the lobby Plus the chickens in the patio are absolutely adorable Classic rooms are small or let s call it cosy but include all you need Very clean and good A C Delicious breakfast quite exceptional in Paris hotels 
55396,COQ Hotel Paris, I did notice that the staff of the hotel is used to stay and work in the common areas of the hotel which are very nice and have meetings there It can be tricky to have professional meetings and discuss business while the clients of the hotel are around But apart from that it s the perfect stay , The bed was super comfy The room was spacious and bright The bathroom was beautiful too The decoration of the entire hotel is amazing The staff is super friendly The coffee is very good 
55397,COQ Hotel Paris,No Negative, Really a lovely place to stay at in Paris The decor is beautifully stylised rooms and amenities are great and the bedding was so fluffy I slept really well Location was perfect for me as well 2 minutes from Place d Italie Staff was super friendly 
55398,COQ Hotel Paris, Bed is good but a little hard but thats usually my dificullity with hotel bedes i like it very soft , Lovely place with great breakfast area Rooms are very nice and wih good details
55399,COQ Hotel Paris, I was given by mistake a lower level room compared to what I booked I had to inform the reception about it They offered to compensate for the mistake It is fine but it is a disapointment that it could happen with the current technology I am still awaiting for the money to be transfered , I stayed many times in this hotel and I like it Nicely design and friendly staff Perfect location 
55400,COQ Hotel Paris, Sorry I could only stay for 10 days new assignements, This hotel is fantastic staff is supernice interior is nice breakfast good I have ca 150 hotelnights pr year and I loved this one cool and relaxed
55401,COQ Hotel Paris, Noises coming from the bar until late evening and unavailability of the restaurant because events were taking place , Cleanliness and decor of the hotel
55402,COQ Hotel Paris, Breakfast could be seriously improved Cheap coffee and industrial cakes are not fitting with the rest of the hotel I expected a better food organic fresh made creative from the pictures posted online , The hotel has a cosy hipster design I guess that the idea is to make you feel at home offering a lobby with free Ipads netflix games and an inexpensive selection of good wine 
55403,COQ Hotel Paris, Nothing , Everything this hotel was perfect amazing staff amazing breakfast and beautiful rooms Couldn t fault the hotel at all everyone was so lovely and it really contributed to an amazing short trip in Paris The focus of the hotel is community and you can really see they ve achieved that It s so lovely and friendly 
55404,COQ Hotel Paris, More diversity for the breakfast would be appreciated , Cosy and confortable hotel Nice deco and nice furnitures Convenient access to public transport facilities Lively surroundings with restaurants and bars 
55405,COQ Hotel Paris, I emailed to request room service champagne before my arrival for my partners birthday and they didn t remember to do this for me which was a little disappointing , The breakfast was delicious they serve you dippy eggs from the hens outside and the decor was super cool and quirky 
55406,COQ Hotel Paris, Wifi speed is low breakfast choice is limited nogo for vegan or vegetarian , Authentic Parisian style with excellent international finish and quality of service Fantastic quiet compact rooms we stayed on 6th floor 
55407,COQ Hotel Paris, Service could be better we asked to bring us champagne glasses to the room and needed to wait for a long time Also needed to bring iur luggage to the luggage room by ourselves There was no omlete and fresh fruits vegetables for breakfast The staff just need to work on this small things will definitely come back , Very stylish cozy hotel The room was perfect the bed very comfortable friendly staff 
55408,COQ Hotel Paris, The only thing that let this hotel down for me was that I could hear loud bass in my room 17 so you can avoid it from the music downstairs I had to wear earplugs at 1am so I could sleep I did tell the receptionist who turned the music down but when I came back three hours later it was back to its original volume What a shame as it s almost the perfect hotel and this is such a simple thing to fix , I travel a lot for work and this has to be one of the best hotels in the world Clean beautiful friendly staff great breakfast 
55409,COQ Hotel Paris, the only minus was the bed but that s a personal opinion I need a very hard mattress, everything was perfect from the very welcoming staff to the design of the room from the ideal location I have my favourite Vietnamese restaurant around the corner close to the metro 
55410,COQ Hotel Paris, 1am shuffling of furniture in the room above 6am slamming of doors shame this hotel could make itself a bit more soundproof, The bed was comfortable the room was adequately spacious the bathroom well designed
55411,COQ Hotel Paris,No Negative, This is a really cool hotel run by a relaxed team We liked the lounge the background music and the quirky details The location was easy to reach by metro and close to some good restaurants 
55412,COQ Hotel Paris, There are not really a lot of nice restaurants in the 13th We went to the 11th which at the end is not so far , Very nice hotel lounge clean and nice decorated rooms The toilet is seperate from the bathroom Very good breakfast and nice staff A hotel like this makes your business trip more relaxed 
55413,COQ Hotel Paris, Bathroom was a little on the small side but that s just Paris Certainly wouldn t stop me staying there over and over again, Decor and ambiance were understated effortless cool Spent a wonderful evening curled up in front of fire in lounge
55414,COQ Hotel Paris, While they did do a good job with the interior decor the architectural planning is lacking the walls are paper thin so expect to find out about your neighbor s snoring bathroom and closet habits more than you d like and falling asleep is a bit of an ordeal Wish the WiFi connection was more secure private The bed throw had a four inch stain of what can only be described as dry gunk not the type of substance you want to see on your bed when you walk into your room They could pay more attention to that sort of detail , The hotel is a two minute walk away from an M7 stop so convenient The toiletries from Rituals were a pleasant surprise You ve probably guessed it from the pictures they did a great job with the d cor and the object branding and this is a case where the photos actually do the reality no justice my room and the common areas definitely did not disappoint in person The included WiFi is strong fast enough Very pleasant check in staff Two very nice touches the separate WC and a complimentary bathrobe slippers set
55415,COQ Hotel Paris, Very small room although I had booked a luxury room which was supposed to be more spacious Serparate toilet but it was impossible to fully open the door as it hid the bed , Very comfortable bed pleasant staff good wifi 
55416,COQ Hotel Paris, The concierge service is not satisfactory I understood that the staff worked all night but I gave up to ask because I heard an unfaithful answer , The bath is GREAT and room is very clean 
55417,COQ Hotel Paris,No Negative, It was the most comfortable bed I ever slept in The location was just great for me and my daughter It was close to the metro and shops and we felt safe walking to and from the hotel Each and every staff member was more than helpful We got great advice on things to see and places to eat and how to get around I would definitely stay again 
55418,COQ Hotel Paris,No Negative, Staff were super friendly great location if you want to stay away from tourist central but still super easy to get around from Place D Italie and the room itself as great 
55419,COQ Hotel Paris, Faster elevator , The bed was awesome They have an expresso machine in the room I loved that they are very close to several metro lines that lead straight to major parts of Paris Rooms are smaller yet they have ample common hangout spaces as pictured below 
55420,COQ Hotel Paris, Pillows were skimpy Would have been nice to have extras Washcloths would have been nice too for we Americans , Beds were comfy Most of the staff were very pleasant Luggage storage was convenient Sunroom and lounge areas were very unique and pleasant Loved having a balcony 
55421,COQ Hotel Paris,No Negative, Went on a short business trip to Paris the location was great near the metro station and a lot of restaurants safe also late at night Hotel is new quiet great service helpful and friendly team 24 7 very nice design and breakfast was great would certainly go back 
55422,COQ Hotel Paris, I thought the room would be bigger it said 20m2 on the booking com site I would have liked a bit more lighting inside the room , The bed was nice although it is a French kingsize smailish at 160cm instead of 180cm It is very clean and comfortable 
55423,COQ Hotel Paris, The cleaner opening the door without knocking, Beautifully designed great breakfast food and loved our deludex room Would love to go back for few more nights to spend time in the hotel 
55424,COQ Hotel Paris, The hotel is situated a bit away from all the city sights in Paris but on the other hand you get to sleep a nice and quiet place AND you have the metro a few minutes away , Lovely hotel with unique interior and atmosphere You feel at home at this place and you have the greatest surroundings to relax after a long day of exploring Paris 
55425,COQ Hotel Paris, The location is not great Chinese restaurants aplenty and sleepy neighborhood Not as close to Saint Germain as I was led to believe , Great European breakfast gorgeously designed spaces super comfortable bed and wonderful rain shower 
55426,COQ Hotel Paris, Room was a little tight for 2 with big suitcases but cosy We were facing into the Courtyard with Residential properties around so was a little noisy in the morning time but not the Hotels fault , The Decor was amazing Very Quirky and Modern Staff were very friendly Food looked amazing but didn t get a chance to eat there Beds were soooooooo comfy Metro 3 mins walk Nice eateries around and Great cake store 
55427,COQ Hotel Paris, the standard rooms are quite small and there is not much storage space , Friendly and very helpful staff small but very delicious breakfast buffet french cheese and ham selection fresh fruits fresh juices very comfortable bed Free Nespresso at the room great metro connection to the city center 
55428,COQ Hotel Paris, The room was on the smaller size but that s Paris , The breakfast was looked forward to each morning with real fresh orange juice The room had a small balcony which was nice The overall ambiance was one of comfort and serenity 
55429,COQ Hotel Paris, Nothing, The hotel is located in a quiet side street very close to Place Italie with its Metro Station and also close to Gare de Lyon Restaurants are in abundance 5 min in walking distance I came by car for business and there were parkings directly at the hotel in the street free from 20 00 to 9 00 perfect for me The hotel is fairly new and it excellent condition Standard rooms are small but well equipped with Nespresso machines which I loved bed is large and very comfortable lighting is excellent there are LED reading lights at the bed and one can dim the room lights flexible Many electric sockets available Fairly large TV screens with international programs and good quality The noise protection of the room was excellent I barely heard anything when I was located on first floor towards the street Due to a problem with the AC I was moved to the upper floor towards a large courtyard and here it was dead silent despite the hotel was pretty occupied Being a frequent traveler I have to say it is very rare but absolutely great to have such a hotel where you can enjoy an undisturbed night especially in a metropole The breakfast was yummy espresso cafe machine fresh orange juice baguette butter croissant and good selection and quality The staff was friendly and helpful and solved the issue with the AC that had broken down over night by offering immediately a different room The location was perfect for me as my business was 5 min away but if one is there for tourism most places of interest are within a 30min Metro ride 
55430,COQ Hotel Paris, Nothing, This hotel is a wonderful home from home with welcoming staff and a very relaxing guests lounge area Its all stylishly furnished and first class refreshments are cheerfully provided all day Breakfast was comprehensive and very fresh Our room was luxurious and spotless The hotel is close to public transport and very easy to get to and from We felt because its not in the centre of the tourist area guests benefit from the extra effort and care the staff take generally Paris hotels are not remembered for their service 
55431,COQ Hotel Paris, Definitely not most centrally located but easy enough with ubers , Excellent property even though the rooms are small they have a chic and smart design practical for daily use The front reception office was excellent with suggestions the breakfast alley in the back is really cool to just chill have a coffee drink or just laze 
55432,COQ Hotel Paris, Bedsheet had strands of hair here and there bed cover had dirty stains which felt disgusting and even after complaining same cover appeared next day also Room needs to have a fridge with some soft drinks All guests are generally from other countries but no adaptors for plugs in room or reception No international tv channels , Staff was excellent No good snacks in hotel 
55433,COQ Hotel Paris, Had to wait an hour till rooms were ready so checked in 4pm Showers were cold the first morning although fixed the next day , Cute boutique hotel with great communal entertainment area
55434,COQ Hotel Paris, First night I was not put in the deluxe room that I had paid extra for and I suffered a disturbed night s sleep with noisy neighbouring guests Breakfast has the potential to be somewhat oversubscribed with some items running out , Friendly helpful staff 
55435,COQ Hotel Paris,No Negative, Easy to find from metro excellent though chaotic breakfast but really good quality products Nice room small but big for paris and equipped with all needed things
55436,COQ Hotel Paris, The breakfast service was a bit disorganised they weren t really prepared for the number of guests they had , The interior is lovely very nicely designed
55437,COQ Hotel Paris, I would have liked conditioner but this is a very minor point I m a girl with long hair so I really should have bought a small travel size at the airport , Staff are lovely and so accommodating The rooms are extremely clean and the bed is comfy The continental breakfast was great Good location 15 mins on metro to Louvre and River area Would definitely recommend 
55438,COQ Hotel Paris, I was on a high floor and unfortunately there was a brief shortage of hot water each morning one day at about 9AM the next at 8 20 Each time the problem disappeared within about 20 minutes , The room and bathroom were attractive although a bit small as noted on the Booking website The buffet breakfast was great It included various cheeses hams preserves and breads and was served in pleasant surroundings In addition there was a 24 hr machine in the lobby for hot drinks including expresso and a variety of teas The staff was delightful and provided sound advice and assistance The hotel is located a short walk from a variety of cafes and small restaurants in addition to two large super markets and several smaller grocery stores Also nearby is a metro station and stops for a variety of bus routes 
55439,COQ Hotel Paris, The door of our room was left open after cleaning When we complained about this the reception clerk did not say sorry or showed that he was going to do something with this complaint He just said the hotel is very safe and we need t worry Still this is a weird response when your valuables and private things are lying in a room for the taking It just felt bad that our door was left unlocked for a whole day and we did not even get an apology Furthermore the breakfast was not replenished when we arrived at 10 00 the breakfast service ends at 10 30 When we asked the reception clerk if some fresh food could be prepared in the kitchen he told us there would be enough in a few moments but as stated above there wasn t sufficient bread butter jam dairy or anything else even after 10 minutes On top of that the bar where the food was presented looked messy This didn t really convince us to stay and wait for fresh food Instead we chose to have breakfast at a local boulangerie One more point but this is personal I guess the queen bed comfortable but quite small so unless you like this a hotel with a bigger bed could have your preference So all in all the hotel was allright but you can certainly have better service elsewhere Because of the above we would NOT recommend this hotel , The bathroom and the hotel theme
55440,COQ Hotel Paris,No Negative, The location was very close to public tranport and lots of restuarants The hotel was quaint but recently renovated and very comforatable The breakfast was outstanding with excellent local produce The staff we always friendly and spoke very good English generally We thoroughly enjoyed our time there and would recommend it to everyone looking for a Paris trip

55443,COQ Hotel Paris, The breakfast staff a woman on both mornings should have a less rude attitude while the check out woman at the reception could have been a bit more kind , The warm welcome on a rather already late check in given by one of the male staff was very pleasant The location of the Hotel was convenient for my needs and as well connected to the Paris main sights served with supermarkets and restaurants in the streets nearby Despite the tiny size of the hotel building and its corridors the 4th floor room was very well divided and with a nice small balcony but most important and for the Paris standards it was very comfortable with a clean and nice toilet The buffet breakfast was limited but it was very well selected and as well very tasty I will certainly come back if I have a chance to 
55444,COQ Hotel Paris, Room was a bit cramped and dimly lit Air Con settings are complex if you need to change from the defaults which we did Light evening meal although advertised was not available , Quirky interior design Quite location Close to 3 line Metro station 
55445,COQ Hotel Paris, The shower hot water was a bit inconsistent at times Never took a cold shower but it was lukewarm at times , Hotel was simply charming Clean cosy and great decor 
55446,COQ Hotel Paris, The wifi in our room was really slow and kept disconnecting all the time Very uneven heat in the shower , Nice design and friendly staff Calm location close to Place D Italie with lots of asian restaurants nearby 
55447,COQ Hotel Paris, It would have been nicer if we didn t have the plumbing problem Not enough accessible electrical outlets for all our eletronic devices They were behind furniture , Staff was very friendly and helpful Especially the gentleman at night Sorry I didn t get his name Enjoyed the decor of the room Close enough to the city center yet far enough from the loud touristy areas of Paris Comfy beds Had a problem with the plumbing the tub leaked and lots of water was all over the bathroom floor but it didn t taint our favorable opinion of this hotel Good price for Paris

55450,COQ Hotel Paris, Check in could be earlier than 3pm, We didn t have breakfast at the hotel the hotel itself was stylish with friendly receptionist overall great experience
55451,COQ Hotel Paris, Breakfast was 12 euro and that wasn t made clear Extremely good quality food but limited choice The room was on the small side and had very dark colored walls which would have bothered me if I d spent more time there Overall it was on the expensive side , Extraordinarily quiet I had a room overlooking the inner courtyard it was the quietest city hotel I ve ever stayed in Very comfortable room and the downstairs area breakfast lounge was very welcoming 
55452,COQ Hotel Paris, The location was far from the city centre by foot I can t say I didn t like it but for my stay this made it slightly less perfect But as I say this was not a problem , The hotel staff made me feel so welcome the room was perfect and the breakfast was really fresh Great coffee But for me the staff were superb and really cared about me and my stay 
55453,COQ Hotel Paris, The rooms were very small but if you appreciate the quality over the quantity like we do then the size of the rooms at this hotel will not bother you at all , We have enjoyed our stay at this small gorgeous hotel Very chilled fashionable atmosphere Clean rooms beautiful cozy lounge area helpful staff Nice quite location with many cafes and shops within a short walking distance If you are driving hotel also provides you with a discount almost half price for secure parking across the road which is a great bonus since parking in Paris is expensive 
55454,COQ Hotel Paris, Small bedroom , Staff was really nice Location is just a short walk from the metro Price was good for Paris from my experience I got much worse for more money 
55455,COQ Hotel Paris, staff was nice but forced room was ok a touch dirty not cleaned well kinda of expensive for what you get, Nice location 13th arr a little more authentic

55457,COQ Hotel Paris,No Negative, Cosy boutique hotel with an excellent price quality ratio thanks to the attention to detail the tasteful decoration and very clean and comfortable bathroom eg rain shower Choice at breakfast was limited but quality absolutely OK On top there is even a vinyl record player in the cosy seating area at ground floor Ask no more 
55458,COQ Hotel Paris, It would be better to have a real caf instead of the coffee machine , Splendid hotel it s very well located truly cozy and charmant Breakfast is very good Books furniture and architecture design are beautiful and unique Absolutely recommended 
55459,COQ Hotel Paris, The staff ordered an expensive express taxi for me without asking my opinion , The decoration is new There is a self service living room beside the front desk which is really good We can have fruit there And coffee wine board game are offered as well 
55460,COQ Hotel Paris, room is a little small the painting on the wall is scaring better to remove it water in the room charges money and there is no clear notice for it, lovely hotel with stylish room and public area close to bus and metro stations easy to get around really nice staff good service downstairs public washroom provides us with great convenience clean and really thoughtful
55461,COQ Hotel Paris,No Negative, Exceptionally delicious eggs for breakfast as well as its extended duration Front desk did a great job in making my stay pleasant and birthday surprise really delicious Rooms are exactly as they appear in pictures AC is adjustable in a wide range of temperatures Even though the location is not in a very heart of the city it is still in a historical and safe part of Paris with the local chick off the beaten tourist track just the authentic Paris Underground station of the convenient line is 5 mins from the hotel location thus getting to the city center takes a bit less than 20 minutes 
55462,COQ Hotel Paris, The bathroom had no shower It only had the bathtub For a tall guy as i am it is not comfortable Despite the metro facilities for the centre of the city the hotel stays a little bit outside , All the Design of the hotel Price quality
55463,COQ Hotel Paris,No Negative, Beautifully designed and clean spaces Great location in the Asian neighborhood with many Asian food options close to metro Quiet area Great value for money 
55464,COQ Hotel Paris, A bit noisy doors are too close to each other customers lack of respect is a pretty bad combo Small room maybe I didn t realise that Superior room only meant a bigger bed , Comfy bed quality furniture
55465,COQ Hotel Paris, Room size is quite Parisian The lightning in the rooms seems to be rather poor It would be great to have a kettle and some tea and coffee in the room but of course it is just a suggestion Breakfast in not very rich though still very nice and consisting of high quality products , The hotel is very well located in the beginning of calm China Town disctrict 2 minutes from Place d Italie underground station It has a wonderful lounge area with self service bar and generally nice ambience Rooms are clean and staff is helpful This hotel is certainly a good value for money

55470,COQ Hotel Paris, More hanging space in the bedroom would be the icing on the cake , Great breakfast Beautiful fluffy chickens in the central courtyard Great lounge bar area 
55471,COQ Hotel Paris, The only down side would be the selection of breakfast cause I like to have some green salad otherwise all are great Oh also no hair dryer in the room , Location is perfect to access the place of Italy Metro station with 3 lines cross over there The deco of the hotel is great and full of sense of design and style The staffs are very friendly to welcome you and I was even offer an espresso when I came back to pick up my luggage Room is nice 
55472,COQ Hotel Paris, Room is way too small even for Paris it doesn t have a fridge and the bathroom is very very cold I can t imagine how hard it is to take a shower during the winter on that bathroom For the price I paid the hotel is great but for the full price 240 for a deluxe room no way BTW I booked the most expensive room deluxe and on the reception desk I was informed that I won a upgrade but how come an upgrade if I already paid for the most expensive room And the room was exactly the one I ve booked on the website Weird , Breakfast for 12 is a great deal and the hotel is well located on a nice neighbourhood with easy access to several metro lines via Place D Italie station Shopping Mall ItalieDeux is two blocks away very handy with nice stores and big supermarket Everything is quite new and the hotel itself is gorgeous on every detail Staff is also very nice and helpful The bed is big and very comfortable and the TV offers a small selection of French Italian German channels No English channels though 
55473,COQ Hotel Paris,No Negative, The most enjoyable stay ever It s all about quality and perfection Don t be afraid that this hotel is not situated in the center of Paris the metro station is very close and in 7 min you can get to Louvre 
55474,COQ Hotel Paris, The room is a bit small toilet and bathroom are separated which is quite inconvenient, The design of the hotel is very stylish and modern staff is helpful very great location just a few minutes to metro station highly recommended 
55475,COQ Hotel Paris,No Negative, Staff was very forthcoming and helpful Hotel is located very close to Place d Italie and Metro station You re even in walking distance 1 hour from Notre Dame de Paris taking you via the Rue de Mouffetard and past the Pantheon if you re up for a stroll Hotel decoration is a pleasant mix of styles and periods Breakfast buffet is nice and the coffee machine delivers very nice and tasty coffee s cappuccinos or whatever your heart may desire The only point we thought that might further improve the breakfast experience would be to have a slightly wider selection of available bread All in all we re definitely going to come back 
55476,COQ Hotel Paris, No proper standing shower just a tub and a shower head you have to hold by hand Toilet separate from bathroom but no faucet to wash hands No fridge Small room , Quiet close to mrt comfy bed looks clean and new Relatively good value for money 
55477,COQ Hotel Paris,No Negative, This hotel is perfect Depending on your culture it s a big A or a 10 10 or 20 20 I was on the 6th floor Metro and bus very near Also night bus 
55478,COQ Hotel Paris, Originally we were given a room on the 2nd floor facing the courtyard It was very small rather dark and right next to the elevator well which could be a little bit noisy Luckily we asked and were moved to the 5th floor , We had a lovely room on the 5th floor with a balcony and quite a nice view The bed was extremely comfortable The whole place was clean and designed in a very stylish way There were only nice people that we got in touch with especially at the reception I would definitely recommend it 
55479,COQ Hotel Paris, Although visually appealing perhaps a wardrobe or rack to accommodate jackets and hooks for towels possibly over the bathroom door would be a bonus , The room was spacious and quiet and the bed was comfortable The shower was also roomy We enjoyed the location near Buttes aux Cailles Rodrigo was particularly helpful 
55480,COQ Hotel Paris, TV and Heating good but complex system Room very comfortable great bed and duvet but very small ok Paris double good for one , Stylish modern hotel good staff Great casual lounge area great breakfast

55482,COQ Hotel Paris, My room smelled of strongly of mildew and the walls were painted dark gray which made the small room seem like a little damp cave , The lounge area is very nice with a very hip mid century modern decor mixed with older formal portraits The staff were great and one helped me print my train tickets
