202331,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, The public areas were generally good but I noticed some wear and tear for example a worn carpet in the corridor that led to my room 533 , My executive room was very spacious stylish and comfortable It was also very quiet so I had an excellent night s sleep after a long tiring day 
202332,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, Small bed definitely not large as stated in the room s description no iron should be according to my room s descripton mediocre breakfasts The biggest dissapointment the view on Montmartre which you can find while browsing hotel s photo on booking com website is only available from some of hotel s rooms So don t expect you ll be eating breakfasts on the hotel s terrace and looking at Sacre Coeur Unless you book the proper suite , Location is the main advantage of the hotel Clean and neat Professional staff 
202333,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, The room was flithy one of our rooms smelled awful like sewer There were stains all over the floor and walls The bathrooms had stains in them Just wouldn t chose to stay here again would sacrifice proximity just to be comfortable , Close to train station
202334,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, It was pretty far away from all the tourist attractions but using the underground you were able to get to each attraction with each One reception staff spoke barely any english which was difficult as we wanted to ask a gew questions however all the all reception staff spoke brilliant clean english, It was extremely close to the underground station which was handy and only one stop away from the train station which was handy as we were getting the train to our next destination
202335,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, The breakfast is very standard Not much choices But with 15 per person its quite cheap than you have breakfast in the cafe near When we arrive there are many tourist sitting in the lobby and the lobby looks mess , Spacious then other room in Paris In front of gare de l est Many resto around very clean Like it very much 
202336,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, my travel plug wouldn t fit and when requested at reception they only had one and it had been loaned out already the plug sockets have an extra prong so your travel plug need a little whole to fit A new travel plug has now been bought for next times stay , everything the room was small but the view from our window was lovely It was adequate for what we needed bed was very comfy after such a whirlwind day sight seeing Have booked already for a Christmas visit 
202337,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, Crib could not fit in room I requested one at booking Baby had to sleep in stroller Air conditioning didn t work in one of the 4 rooms we booked And it was HOT, Staff was great rooms were nice Breakfast was great 
202338,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, Power cut on the first night despite the two cafes either side still having full power No lifts no lights in the room so couldn t use the bathroom as it was windowless No apology from the staff We asked how to use the safe a staff member was promised to visit our room but he she never materialised so completely wasted our time Very expensive breakfast at 15 Euros per person Across the road we got two hot baguettes fruit fruit juice and tea for half that price Paris was lovely the hotel was awful WILL NOT BE USING HOLIDAY INN AGAIN, Location of hotel was good for central Paris
202339,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, Woman on reception was very grumpy on check out Second lady huffed and puffed when having to look for our bags Bar man was awful after a long discussion asking if I could get my GnT in a long glass he didn t understand why I basically had it pour and handed to me as was no ice no lemon lime no stirrer I had to ask for each thing one at a time No pint glasses for a large beer Maids were noisy in the morning Toilets were rotten If you just looking for a clean room cheap with no frills this is the place to go But do not hope for more , The room was perfect clean and comfortable We had a balcony also Very compact rooms but for the price couldn t have asked for more 
202340,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, had to wait a while at reception Staff could have been more welcoming, Clean and good location Close to train station and lots of bars and hops nearby 
202341,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, There is no kettle in rooms so feel a bit inconvenient , The staff in this hotel are very kind and helpful The location is good and convenient to go to airport 
202342,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, Ants in room Most likely coming out of a vent located in the skirting board, Right next to Gare de l est which gives it such an easy location with so many nearby conveniences
202343,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, The hotel doesn t respect the terms and conditions described at booking com as they imposed me to pay for an extra room cause we were two adults and two young little children although my kids were under the age that is allowed to stay for free as quoted below Free All children under 2 years stay free of charge for children s cots cribs Free All children under 12 years stay free of charge for extra beds and that s what i did exactly i booked a room and asked for an extra bed but when arrived at the hotel the answer was sorry we can t accommodate you in one room but when i said that is as per your terms and conditions when i booked the room they told me that those condition are not applicable any more when i asked to see the responsible person he didn t want to even walk out of his office which is a very very very bad attitude from the top person of the hotel so imagine the rest of the staff although also i had a loyalty member ship with this brand of hotels also this didn t give me and advantage I would like to also request booking com to review the T C s so people wont get in a situation like the one the that I ve been through Please post every word i said , The metro access front of the door
202344,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est,No Negative, Excellent location if you use the Paris Gard L Est train station Not far from Eurostar station at Paris Gard Nord Room is excellent with wide screen tv Bathroom is very roomy 
202345,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, Very rude staff at the front desk unclean rooms people entering the room while we were in manager Xavier very unhelpful Do not stay here , Nothing at all it was a horrible stay
202346,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, Room is ridiculously small even smaller than a single room The parking is across the road in a separate public CaPark and verrrry expensive Beer is average 10 euro a pint , Good Breajfast
202347,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, The area is crowded with too many people small local shops that aren t the kind you want to be a tourist at its noisy all the time and most things shut very early with the exception of street side bars unlike a lot of the other places in Paris They don t place a kettle in your room and other amenities along with towels bed room slippers bath robes and hot water for tea were either out of stock or took too long to be sent to our room The standard room for 2 people is too tight and might be fine for one person If you re going to Paris and you want to have a pleasant time book a place in a more touristy area so the places around you stay open and is a safe place even at night Also be VERY careful about your belongings everywhere holed your bag to your heart , I stayed here with my dad for 3 nights and I wouldn t recommend this area for first time visitors to Paris The staff was very helpful with directions and other information needed But they seem to be either understaffed or have people who don t speak English at all because no one but the front desk pick up calls so you have to request all your house keeping and food information there They too sometimes don t pick up The rooms and bathrooms were well maintained and were very clean and tidy but are very small The location is good as the metro in a two minutes walk and there s a big bus stop near by too 
202348,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, The Room was too small for 2 persons we had to upgrade to the bigger room so we can move freely The pictures they are using shows the more space for each room but in reality its too small The Hotel facilities are not clean all the time , Good location
202349,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, We didnt like the fact that it doesnt serve dinner in the evening and doesnt have an indoor and outdoor pool , The bed was very comfortable staff was very friendly and helpful Thanks for making our stay a memorable one Moreover the hotel is situated amongst many amenities mentioning restaurants mini markets and pubs Above all it is situated in front of the metro station gare de l est 
202350,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, Service was super slow staff called me at 5 am to take the iron from my room hotel is a bit far from attractions, Room was nice great size if you re traveling solo
202351,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, The hotel is situated at a place very close to the train station but very unsafe because my purse containing all my belongings 4 passports all cash 2500 euros 1600 swiss francs 1000 aed 4 emirates I D s credit card camera watch iphone etc was stolen within seconds when I was talking to the receptionist in the hotel lobby at the time of checkout The hotel personnel refused to take any credibility refused to show the cctv footage tried to tear the police report on the pretext of taking photocopies for us I still have the torn copies even telling the indian consulate that this did not happen in the hotel I am pretty sure that the hotel staff is in collusion with the thieves as the receptionist saw what was happening as there was no else around me at that time It was a terrible experience and I do not want anyone else facing the same Please be very careful staying in this hotel ,No Positive
202352,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, Breakfast could have been better for paying 15 per person we didn t buy breakfast with hotel room we went once and didn t go back there was limited option for hot breakfast foods was nice though but could have done with there being more choice , The hotel is literally a 10 minute walk from main train station we got the Eurostar to Paris got off at gare du nord and walked down a Main Street full of cafes and restaurants hotel is in the perfect spot underground train right outside the hotel enterence gare de l est train station directly opposite on the other side of the road hotel room was a little small but had everything we needed and was absolutely spotless bed was extremely comfy and we could actually open the window in the bedroom to look out of lovely restaurant 2 doors down from hotel can t remember the name but is on the corner and serves the best burgers and cocktails would highly reccomend Reception staff were all lovely and helpful and always greeted us as we entered reception to go out for the day Would absolutely reccomend this hotel 
202353,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, There wasn t any welcome drinks in room fridge It used to be once This is downgrading the service , Great Location The breakfast is excellent You have your breakfast like a king 
202354,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, The hotel is not up to 4 stars standards The room provided by the staff doesn t exceed 16 sqm along with the bathroom which is more like a boutique standard Not to mention The rate The property was way over priced The staff were very extremly rude arrogant and ignorant especially Xavier gay tall guy with light moustache He should be working in a butcher shop instead He has zero knowledge about how to provide normal hospitality services to clients To be fair the property shouldn t be rates more than 1 star hotel This is the worst hotel I have ever visited and definitely the worst and most expensive Holiday inn Worth to mention that I am a good member of Holiday inn chain , The location is very convenient
202355,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, There should have been a kettle for making tea or coffee in the room The staff at the reception needs to be more as there were only two and they need to be clear and pleasant when they talk , The location and the breakfast is excellent The room was nice and big The bathroom was also nice and big 
202356,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, Too expensive booking for me in this budget hotel Very difficult to get a taxi during peak hour , Location Just opposite to Gare Est Railway Station 
202357,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, I didn t like that the hotel had a failure of their HVAC during a record heat wave I didn t like that their only option for relief was one of five fans available for the entire hotel Obviously I wasn t one of the lucky or quick ones and had to endure a room that was 84 degrees That may have been ok if I could open my window to let air in I did and until nearly 4 in the morning got to listen to the dance clubs and drunks from the massive station across the street One of my colleagues while enduring the opressive heat also woke up to ants crawling on him in his bed The hotel management refused to speak to our group and the rest of the staff was terribly rude I also didn t like the fact that staff kept telling us the air was fixed when 84 degrees on the top floor of the hotel clearly proved it wasn t Lastly having to change hotels in the middle of my trip doesn t rank at the top of things I like about this terrible hotel My advice if you re looking for a place to stay where staff treats you as a guest and not as if they re extending you a great privilege by letting you have a room go elsewhere , I like that there was breakfast I had the worst traveling experience of my life in this place and that s about all I have nice to say 
202358,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, Rooms on the small side and there was only 1 chair even though it was a double occupancy room No one wants to sit on the bed after coming off the metro, Proximity to the metro
202359,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, WiFI only free for 1 hour, Access to train station was great Staff very friendly and the room was very spacious and comfortable with large bathroom Excellent accommodation
202360,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, I had booked standard double room but they gave me very small and tinny room I complaint thrice and they told me to change the room but at the end they didn t change my room but they charged me full , Location and property This is my 4th stay 
202361,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, My room was looking over the Garde de Est and I couldn t sleep well due to the open air bar on top of the train station as it was open late I would suggest people to ask for a quite room if they have light sleep like me Thanks Gul,No Positive
202362,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, Upgraded for mini bar waste of money Had to ask every day to have it restocked Didn t take away dirty glasses when they did room , Close to train station
202363,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, slow checking process, right across street from train station very convenient staff a bit slow at the desk for checking other than that its a great hotel very nice room with a very nice modern design very clean will definitely use this hotel again in the future 
202364,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, The area itself is close to a major railway station which was good for us and surrounded by many poor value for money eating places which is a major city thing And food and drink prices at the hotel were expensive , Really nice stay over near to the Gare de l est and on our homeward journey from visiting several Greek islands The reception staff including John the Baptist were spot on Our room was of a good size as was the bathroom and we had 2 chairs We experienced no traffic or fellow traveller noise and the air condition was fine 
202365,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, We had a tiny room that was nothing like the size of the room shown on the Booking com website The breakfast situation is a joke the dining room is far too small the food runs out On our second day we waited and waited for a table When we finally got one we went to get our breakfast of which the hotel had run out of croissants meat and the Tropicana juice only to return to the table to find someone else sat down So we ended up taking a cup of coffee and a danish each up to the room hardly a great breakfast I asked for at tray to take food up to the room and wasn t given one We ended up at McDonalds down the road one hour later The phone in the room doesn t tell you how to dial out or reception etc so you end up having to walk down to reception There is apparently wifi in the hotel but nobody ever gave us the code There can be long queues at checkout There can be queues at check in and although there is supposed to be priority check in for loyalty card holders there aren t enough staff on reception to cope with this I would not stay again primarily due to the breakfast situation sorry , The hotel has a nice interior design in the common areas and the rooms the showers are good the location is decent 
202366,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, Staff was rude and impolite Kept us waiting for long and ignored us while attending other guests Even after requesting checkout at 5 30 AM they did it only around 6 10 We requested vegetarian breakfast to be packed it just had 2 biscuits and one small muffin and ice tea ,No Positive
202367,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, Could not walk to centre of Paris as just down road from hotel a very unsavoury area and very intimidating by groups on streets But used metro right by hotel to eliminate most of problem Safe walking from Eurostar Gare de l est and metro though , Well looked after by everyone and lovely clean hotel 
202368,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, Nothing to likr as i said I feel like being cheated for the money paid , Nothing to likein this hotel it is one of the worst hotrl i have stayed in The hotel is located at an obscure location and the rooms are just too small and dirty internet does not work in the rooms 
202369,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, I feel the property is slightly higher in price per night than similar options in Paris but I will continue to stay here because the quality is worth paying for , This is my 4th stay at Holiday Inn Gare de l est and I will continue to choose this hotel on my upcoming trips to Paris The location is superb You are directly across from Gare de l est so there is immediate access to the Metro Regional and High speed trains as well as bus lines Gare du Nord is within walking distance if you need to catch the EuroStar Gare de l est also has some shopping within the station and places to grab food if needed among which include two Starbucks a market a book store a cafe one of the Paris tourism offices and many souvenir kiosks if you need to buy gifts The staff in the hotel is always friendly welcoming and helpful As a native English speaker trying to learn French the staff is patient and polite as I sometimes struggle to communicate The hotel is very accommodating on many levels I typically request a specific room because I like the view and they always attempt to meet my request Additionally if you have a late train or bus but need to meet the 12 noon checkout time the hotel will gladly store your luggage until you are ready to depart the city or if you arrive early before check in The front desk is always quick to assist with maps and directions as needed and it appears many on staff are multi lingual The rooms are very clean modern and the hotel feels very secure The view from my 6th floor room facing the train station was amazing with a gorgeous view at night of the illuminated Sacre Coeur The wifi is very good The showers are roomy with a rain head and a removable spray and have good pressure The room temp is adjustable Although some may think the rooms are small by some standards I find them to be perfect The rooms are also very quiet the insulation must be very good I did not hear the street noises below when my windows were shut and locked 
202370,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, There were many people asking for money outside the property and they seemed to be hanging around the metro station a lot , The rooms were small but expected in Europe The property was clean and well located next to a metro The bathrooms were modern and clean 
202371,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, All electric sockets weren t working in my room and hairdrayer as well The hotel located on unsafe area And far away from Eiffel tower And I paid 2 times at check in but they said it s blocked so will not charge me and one time when check out the price was higher than what I booked on booking and the staff explained it s because of taxes which also different than booking So I need to check how many times have I charged and how much and why So I can avoid hidden prices , Staff are very friendly and helpful My room was clean and comfortable but my friend s room was very small

202373,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, It was difficult to find the number for the reception room service and or other services in the hotel as the telephone did not indicate which one was which Unfortunately I had a bitter end to my stay as I had trouble after leaving the hotel I remembered that I accidentally left behind jewelry in the safe box and that I had not emptied it correctly and left behind a necklace I contacted the hotel almost 6 hours later but they had no report of my missing necklace from their housekeeping staff The person responsible for lost and found was very helpful and assured me that they will investigate the issue It s definitely my responsibility for forgetting to take it but I feel that it could have been easily found had staff promptly reported the item left behind by a guest , The room was comfortable and clean Bathroom size was a little too small but very clean The Bed was very comfortable and they had different pillows from soft to firm for your comfort The breakfast was good a variety of fresh juices offered at breakfast and the pastries were all fresh and croissants were heavenly 
202374,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, No guide for the numbers of the reception housekeeping or room service No laundry bags Only 1 small bottle of water although I was in a double room on your arrival day they don t refill the water during your stay they don t refill the tea or Nescafe No instructions for how to program the code of the safe Being a tourist I asked for an electrical adapter as my cables didn t fit in the socket for 2 days I was being given the same answer all our adapters are taken by other guests you have to wait till a one is returned till I had to buy one myself Completely unacceptable behavior from the hotel very uncaring attitude from the reception staff The breakfast buffet is very poor the scrambled eggs are little sauce not well cooked with no option to ask for an omelette The boiled eggs as well are not well boiled Me my family almost found nothing to eat that on the second day we went to have breakfast out of the hotel although the breakfast was included in our rate On our arrival day was given a room in the 7th floor The room s air condition wasn t working properly as the room was too hot I had to go down to the reception since no guide in the room for their number to inform them about the problem they told me that someone will come to check 15 minutes later no one showed so I went down to the reception again they told me someone will come in 5 minutes finally someone came just to convince me that the air condition is working properly the funny part that while doing so I showed him that the 3 speeds of the fan are all the same none is stronger than the other he said this is normal too , Hotel s location is right in front of the Gare De L est station facilitating moving around in Paris
202375,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, No tourist information in the lobby or in the room and nothing offered by the staff The bar was very small and not manned half the time we gave up after waiting 15 minutes for someone to turn up It was very hot in Paris and the air conditioning was not very efficient , Close to the tube and station good sized bathroom

202379,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, The iron was ancient and did not iron at all The note Do not disturb disappeared from the door arm at night and was returned to the room only after the cleaning was done Might be an accident but looked like the staff might did it in purpose in order to clean the rooms according to their schedule and not to customer s one , The breakfast is good in comparison to classic French breakfast a good selection of food for various demands A variety of mini markets and bistro places all around the train station is across the street The personnel in the breakfast room and reception is very nice smiling and service oriented 
202380,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, Reception staff rude disinterested Was not acknowledged at all whilst standing at the desk as the receptionist changed the paper in the credit card machine for a good 5 minutes Rooms not as requested told we had interconnecting rooms but one had a door to adjoining room on the other side to the room we were given Changed to rooms on opposite side of hotel as no adjacent rooms were available one room was large spacious other was tiny could barely get around the side of the bed the windows didn t open and lacking toiletries On checkout I asked the difference with the rooms assuming they were of different standards and was ignored Broken light fixture broken kettle which tripped the electricity no kettle in one room never rectified despite assurances Also no baby cot despite a request prior to arrival I feel this hotel could be so much better simply by a different attitude from the reception staff and some attention to detail from housekeeping staff , Location handy for train metro Decor modern cool

202387,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, Room was perhaps small worst thing is there is no universal plug point for the mobiles and laptops to be charged unfortunately when checked with reception the answer was no proper I had to wait for the next morning for the shops to open and get stuffs charged instead you may need to change plug points as most people visit as tourists and if not atleast provide with suitable adaptors to fit the charging equipments I couldnt charge mobile phones cameras laptops and the next day plan was almost flopped , Location was good and has ease access to public transport and restaurants

202548,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, We did not enjoy the staff very much The stewardess woke us up every morning asking for service even when the do not disturb sign was hanging on the door The reception staff was not very professional We stayed over four days and nobody told us about breakfast hours It s a good idea to have late breakfast during the weekend however you should inform your guests upon check in We paid our breakfast in advance and lost a day because of this Money was reimbursed however it s still annoying When check out receptionist told us we still have to pay for our breakfast ridiculous communication has to improve This is embarrassing and could be easily avoid , We enjoyed the location and the facilities

202706,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, The internet in the rooms was slow a much better and quicker connection downstairs in the foyer and sitting area The service of the rooms was inconsistent with regard to replacement of towels and consumables , The location opposite Gare de L Est was fantastic Also walking distance to Gare du Nord for the train to CDG and an entrance to metro station Gare de L Est outside the door

202714,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, The only drawback to this centrally located place is that the rooms are not sound proof And as it is centrally located there is too much noise 24 7 , It s so centrally located to everything the fact that it is opposite a train station and in walking distance to the other and next to one a main bus station 
202715,Holiday Inn Paris Gare de l Est, The air conditioning did not work which was ok since it was cooler The staff were rude except during check in and out When we wanted a drink at 930 the staff told us that the bar was closed when everything stated they were open til 1130 , Nice rooms and bathrooms The place was very clean
