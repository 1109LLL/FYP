40750,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, It was too warm for us with the thick douvet could have done with a blanket instead, Our room was at the back as we asked for a quiet room so no view good breakfast plenty of choice Nice coffee about 8 mins walk from Kings Cross
40751,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Staff did not understand my request for room away from main street and above 2nd floor though after explaining was given room on third floor facing main street It was clear this particular staff had problem with understanding English though he was professional about his work Noise in room facing main street The room was so bright at night you could read a book even with all lights switched off , The location was just right staff very professional and clean room 
40752,Ambassadors Bloomsbury,No Negative, On arrival was given a free room upgrade very close to Euston Station Great value for money didn t eat at the hotel so cannot comment on on food Staff were really friendly and willing to help sevice with a smile 
40753,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Bedroom not designed for an able bodied person and a wheelchair person not much thought put into the needs of both people Access into hotel very difficult in wheelchair for although there was a slope the access door was locked and the bell was not obvious , Wetroom style bathroom perfect for a wheelchair user
40754,Ambassadors Bloomsbury,No Negative, Room was perfect for what we wanted Clean and modern with a big comfy bed and plenty of space for bags etc Bathroom bit on the small side but did it s job so can t complain Staff were super helpful from the minute we checked in until we left and when we rang down and requested an iron and extra teabags they arrived within 5 minutes 
40755,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Staff on desk not always quick to help I requested an iron that was never delivered Sex noises audible from adjacent room Somewhat overpriced but I guess you pay for the location , Nicely presented hotel Clean Restaurant Happy Hour Cocktails excellent value Good location Decent cafe just around the corner to avoid excessively expensive hotel breakfast 
40756,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Small rooms I also asked for an early checkin three days before and relieved a generic response from the hotel was greeted with the exact same generic response from staff at the hotel when I arrived and was unable to check in early I feel like they just brushed it off and didn t even attempt to accomodate my request , Comfortable bed
40757,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The room was very small and lacking in character Hated the wet room which soaked all my clothes and towels when I showered No shelf to lay toilet bag or toothbrushes etc Only one set of toiletries provided for two people , Great location and comfortable bed Nice soft fluffy towels
40758,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Room design was poor especially the bathroom Looks beautiful but completely impractical Hand basin attached to wall and no flat surfaces near the hand basin so no place to stand shaving cream or even contact lens cases Lighting from down lighters looks OK but none on the mirror so impossible to shave or insert contact lenses as face is in shadow Shower floor was mosaic and either marked or dirty Bedroom had Venetian blinds which didn t darken the room so was awake at sunrise at 0400 The rooms need dark curtains as well as the blinds I asked for a quiet room and my room overlooked an outside area of a nearby pub so was pretty noisy Enough pillows and cushions and cushions for a rugby team , Location was great Air Conditioning good but only could be used when your card key was in the room Nice control of shower temperature Coffee maker was good
40759,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Internet very slow and in order to upgrade I had to pay which I did not , Breakfast was really nice room a bit small The inhouse restaurant is excellent staff really good 
40760,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, yet again a hotel tries to charge a deposit allegedly in case i trash the place i am not a guitar wielding rock star on drugs please stop this ridiculous practice , good location room upgrade comfy bed 
40761,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Room was small dusty uncomfortable House keeping was erratic no clean towels provided coffee not replaced no water in the room despite being advertised as such Very noise air vents outside so couldn t open the window Aircon on the other hand was very noisy even when switched off ticking I used to be happy to stay in this hotel but over the past few years it has clearly deteriorated My room requests were ignored every time and the fact that I am a frequent guest doesn t seem to make a difference It s a shame but I won t be staying here anymore ,No Positive
40762,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The bedroom was in need of a good cleanup The carpet was very stained and grubby one of the pillowcases was also stained , Very convenient location Room is basic but functional 
40763,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, No fridge in the room No fresh air No fan ventilation in the bathroom Impossible to shower without drenching the bathroom Room too small for two people , The location and the food from the restaurant

40771,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Rooms are well equipped but a bit on the small side with only a 4ft 6in bed and little wardrobe space , Location and convenience Overall quite comfortable with good a c Right next door is a pedestrian street with good breakfast bars and Indian restaurant Good shops and pubs also close towards Brunswick centre 
40772,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The room was extremely small and when showering the water gets into the sink toilet area Also difficult to regulate the water temperature The room was somewhat stuffy necessitating opening the window which then made it loud due to noise of environmental systems Could have used at least one larger pillow , The room was quiet unless the window was open Great location for me Very friendly staff 
40773,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Reception were taking were squabbling between each other about our room the young lady said 101 but the you man said no 115 he then wrote 115 and 101 then crossed out 101 tbey had no respect for each other We settlled in to 115 to find our view was a generator or sometime We didnt take notice until we tried to sleep the noise outside the window was loud and noisey We tossed and turned for a couple of hours until the noise was unbearable We went to reception to explain abd moved us to 211 room was ok however still np view Not a happy stay Maybe the description should say room with no view , Cleanliness 
40774,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The room hotel is a no frills hotel very basic feels cramped dirty Rooms need updating Better for one person no room to open suitcases, Access to rail station Mirror in hall to dry hair hair dryer connected to socket in hall cupboard unable to be moved 
40775,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The bathroom floor and the bedroom carpet either weren t very clean or were old and worn stained they could do with being replaced or deep cleaned , It s extremely close to Euston a 4 min walk and very easy to find The bed was very big and very comfy There was self controlled air conditioning in the room which was great as we visited during warm weather The shower was hot with good water pressure They let us leave our bags there as we arrived before check in so we could go out and explore 
40776,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, They charge me 30 extra they said for deposit and will refund on 5 days Guess what its been a month and no refund I keep phone them they saying they will dort but they dont ,No Positive
40777,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Breakfast at 17 95 is steep, Great location spotless clean room although a bit small A bit noisy but expected due to location and much better than many city centre hotels windows cut out most of it Very plush towels 
40778,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The size of the space was quite small but well laid out functional Breakfast was somewhat pricey but nice coffee shops were only 1 block away , Near Euston Station so bus and tube access were excellent Parks nearby so it was a lovely area for walking The room was quite small but everything was modern and clean The tiny bathroom was spotlessly clean and the heated towel rack made for easy hand washing of socks and small items Lobby was a great meeting lounge space Overall a very nice 4 day stay 
40779,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Rooms a little small , Hotel was great for our needs TV did not work in the room Reception sent someone and they fixed straight away Great service would recommend
40780,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The mattress on the double bed was awful you could feel individual springs when you lay on it It was bad enough that I wouldn t go back despite everything else being great , Location was great and hotel was smart and clean
40781,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Cold food it was inedible and the price you pay for substandard food is not acceptable poor shower water flow quicker to have washed in basin than in the shower again this should not have been left like this for the cost you pay for the night pretty let down, The staff were very helpful
40782,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The staff at reception seemed confused both when we were checking in as well as during check out their communication skills were poor and they did not seem interested in giving us the level of service you d expect from a upscale hotel like this , The room was nice and spacious and the bed very comfortable 
40783,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Had a little rude awakening with the smoke alarm going off for no reason but we just laughed about it, Fantastic location 5 minute walk from Euston Train station and 10 mins from Kings cross giving great access to the tube and therefore the city centre itself We arrived early and was greeted by smiling faces and helpful staff and we were able to book in early as our room was ready The room was clean the furniture was a little tired but all in all a very comfortable room The afternoon tea in the hotel restaurant Twelve was absolutely A MAZ ING and such good value
40784,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, No ironing facility, Was attending a meeting close by The room was spacious Was clean The air conditioning was working Breakfast was good The front desk was very polite and courteous
40785,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Tiny bathroom The smallest type of double bed The least luxurious carpet Only enough milk to have one drink each The lift was very slow , They did change our room when we requested a room that had a window with natural light a view rather than opening onto a ventilation shaft 
40786,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, A C wasn t working very well small windows with no views at least in our room furniture and carpet were slightly worn out, Great location close to Euston Station underground friendly staff
40787,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, No Shelve in bathroom for toiletries and dingy carpet on floor of room , A comfortable stay and the room size was quite adequate except for the bathroom Some shelving in the bathroom would help so that one could leave toothbrush and basic toiletries at hand A suggestion to hotels remove carpets and replace them with smooth flooring which is much easier to clean 
40788,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, London itself is ridiculously expensive We paid 230 for the night for a basic room Relatively speaking to the surrounding areas this was exceptional value Rationally speaking the room was very small and a little dated for a fairly expensive rate The bathroom was my least favourite part of the room as any shower made the majority of the floor sopping wet and the door is opaque so not the best privacy for using the facilities Despite that though the hotel was great overall and I d absolutely stay there again and recommend it to anyone visiting London , This hotel is in a exceptional location We had one day in London arriving at Euston station and walked to the hotel in minutes The convenience of the location was exactly what we were looking for Just perfect for our needs 
40789,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Room was very very very small with a tiny window overlooking a fire escape shaft no natural light felt like a prison cell to be honest No mention of this was made when I booked the room,No Positive
40790,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Double room but rather small Only one chair No fridge , Staff were very friendly and helpful Bed was very comfortable Close to St Pancreas and Kings Cross
40791,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Enjoy a stressful night 2 0 book a standard room double bed you will be sheltered in a premium closed space named bedroom without window don t forget to aware reception if claustrophobic double bed inaccessible on one side recommended for jumping amateur greenish lighted shower space nice disturbing atmosphere equipped for disabled person ingeniously larger than the incommodious sleeping area Tv will help you to dream that you stay in a 4 stars hotel reception will not bother you by omitting to ask when checking whether you spent a good night comprehensive service Possible in this hotel Respect ,No Positive
40792,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The standard double room is a little small, Lovely hotel clean and comfortable with pleasent helpful staff 10 minutes walk from St Pancras station and within walking distance to central London A good size wet room but was disapointed with the small size of the bedroom 
40793,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Room small opaque glass door to small shower room and door did not close fully also no shelf to place things on Bed not very comfy blinds instead of curtains Very small flat cupboard to hang clothes , Quiet room at back of building no view 
40794,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Room was very small and not worth the money that the room cost The bed was uncomfortable and noisy The pillows were also on the verge of unusable Disappointing stay , Close to Euston station 
40795,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The room was small the bathroom was even smaller There was nowhere to put any toiletries in the bathroom we had to put our toothbrush on the bedside table ,No Positive
40796,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Everything room was dirty walls were dirty carpet had stains bed was so uncomfortable you can feel the spring by pushing with you fingers it was terrible Shower flooded the bathroom I took pictures I reported it to the front desk on April 25th the guy behind the desk was so rude he he said I don t know what to tell you I tried to get a room across the street at the Hilton and it was booked The next day the manager gave me a discount off the room although she kept saying she couldn t believe this staff member acted that way well maybe I m the only that has said something , nothing
40797,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Poor choice at breakfast for vegetarians Full English or crossaints for 11 Hardly worth it There s a separate room service menu with delicious pancakes on it but they wouldn t do it on my stay as no staff Also the complimentary milk pots in the room were off and clumpy,No Positive
40798,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Always wise to ask for a breakfast included deal Breakfast service is not so brilliant as the rest of service at the hotel the English breakfast is mediocre and quite pricey , The staff are excellent and helpful The rooms are comfortable and clean and have many facilities e g good TV Hairdryer iPad docking point tea and coffee making equipment The beds have Hypnos mattresses and are very comfortable Room service is prompt and the choice is good and reasonably priced Within a few moments walking distance of Euston station Although situated on a busy road the sound insulation is very effective 
40799,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, There are single travellers on the planet They are not dodgy people and still need somewhere to stay for 1 night for a reason In this case it was a business event Not a big fan of being approached with suspicion by members of staff ,No Positive
40800,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Some staff were rather stiff and unsmiling although others especially Joe were very friendly and helpful Not particularly cheap even by central London standards given that breakfast was not included , Location very handy for transport Although our first room was quite noisy there is a fire station and an ambulance depot very close by so lots of sirens and a bit of general traffic noise and the double glazing didn t seem all that effective we were moved to a quieter room when we requested it after the first night 
40801,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The bathroom is a wet room so when I showered the whole room got soaked There wasn t a lot of storage in the room , Cleanliness of the room was superb The hotel staff were very helpful and allowed us to leave bags at the property before we could check in and also after we checked out 
40802,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Glass door to small bathroom Why I don t want to be seen whilst on the toilet Also staff OK but just wish you could go to London and hear an English accent and for staff to know what you are talking about after all it is the UK , Location
40803,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Air con in the room a little noisey, Ideal location easy walk to tube Russell Sq which gave us access to West End Found a fab Greek restaurant close by too Staff very helpful especially when Euston station closed and we did not know our way around Wet room style bathroom was excellent for my friend who has limited movement on occasion 
40804,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Reception tad small but not a real problem there are seats and fresh water available, Excellent hotel centrally located walking distance kings x and Euston stations and on direct route to oxford street and Olympia and Hyde park etc pleasant restaurant reasonable bar prices for London nice twin room for London reasonably spacious
40805,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Small room A few snags in the room here and there I e poor working shower head no iron For me personally pillows too soft Free wifi poor quality and 5 99 to upgrade Cost of the breakfast far too expensive as are the drinks in the bar Spy hole in the room door too Weird Not sure about the wet room bathroom idea either , Value for money given its location Friendly staff and modern hotel 
40806,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, I had booked a double room however the bed was simply two singles pushed together which was quite uncomfortable when trying to sleep, the room was clean smart and efficient for purpose the room service was quick and the staff were very polite and professional
40807,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Room was a bit on the small side No problem as I was on my own Could feel tight if there were 2 sharing , Excellent location Good value for money Warm clean comfortable hotel 
40808,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Nothing g, The bed was really comfortable and the shower easy to use and good temperature staff were nice especially the man who works in reception helping people he has been there a few years and is very helpful
40809,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, We paid by cash yet they still took the payment from our card therefore until they pay it back we now have no money in our account they did not explain this very well ,No Positive
40810,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The room was very warm and the bed only came with a duvet not sheets this made sleeping uncomfortable Not entirely the Hotels fault as London was unusually warm but the lack of a top sheet we could use instead of the duvet was annoying , The room was quiet 
40811,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Bed was terrible worst nights sleep in a long time Breakfast expensive cooked items barely warm under the lamps, Great wifi powerful shower location excellent 
40812,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, we had a box room with no windows that was like a sauna and had the added bonus of the most uncomfortable bed imaginable All in all not a great night ,No Positive
40813,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Noisy fan in air conditioner VERY difficult to get shower to work could do with simple instructions in room , Facilities in room good nice to have a bath 
40814,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Shower drain didn t work properly so the bathroom was flooded , Great location but traffic noise bad although I accept that is hardly the fault of the hotel 
40815,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Although premium WIFI is offered nowadays high speed WIFI Should be included Many have mentioned about paying 50 on arrival this is for any charges you MAY place on the room just pay upfront and you wont have this The shower does leak across the bathroom , Staff were nice hotel was clean room was clean All you need for a nights stay in London 
40816,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, No pleasantries at check out No one asked if I d had a good stay or wished me a pleasant day Very perfunctory Room service food was supposed to be Bolognaise but was chopped up beef burger so it seemed with sauce on , Location good room and bed comfortable 
40817,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The first room I was assigned stunk of cigarettes it was in a no smoking section I was moved to a fresher smelling room which was great The bathroom was not as clean as it could have been , The staff were friendly and helpful It was fine for one night 
40818,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Shiortstaffed took 30 minutes to get pancakes and only about 8 people in the restaurant , Was not impressed with the staff in the restaurant However the reception staff dealt with my complaint efficiently and to my satisfaction
40819,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Rooms are small if you re with 2 persons sharing the room bathrooms are cramped and the whole bathroom floor gets wet when you re taking a shower due to a shower curtain that hangs at least 20 cm above the floor Even though the rooms have sound proofed windows the noise from the traffic especially the frequent sirens of emergency services are disturbing your sleep We moved towards the back of the hotel for our second night and still I was woken up by the street noise , Comfortable beds and the location of the hotel is very close to several forms of public transport
40820,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Breakfast was a bit expensive but you don t have to eat here, The location of this hotel is fabulous so close to Euston King s Cross St Pancras stations makes it so easy to get to everything The staff were very friendly helpful Terrific place we rebooked when our plans changed as we liked it so much 
40821,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The rooms are very small The free wifi is rubbish It s meant to be for e mail etc and then if you wish to stream videos etc you have to pay for an upgrade which to be fair isn t too expensive If you advertise free wifi then I expect to arrive and have access to good free wifi , Price for the location was good The room was clean Staff are friendly 
40822,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Wet room flooded water didn t drain particular well but not a big problem , The room was clean comfy and good value like the coffee machine etc close to Kings cross
40823,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The room is quite small so is the bathroom It was also a bit noisy , Very nice location close to Kings Cross St Pancras train station close to restaurants 
40824,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, A little noisy in the room but hey it s in the middle of London , Perfect location for using Eurostar Hotel had a boutique feel to it Great little bar area Room was clean and more than adequate and a Nespresso coffee machine 
40825,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Free wifi is slow speed Better speed is additional cost Rooms are small No safe in room to keep laptop or valuables when you want to go out , Location is excellent 2 mins walk from Euston station Room was clean and staffs are friendly 
40826,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, I didn t like they didn t explain about the deposit whilst booking and the 2 part payment I was expecting to pay full amount on arrival no deposit as with other booking com hotels I ve used before , The room was lovely and spacious especially the bathroom I was delighted there was a bath as well as a shower
40827,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, However there were fruits flies in the apartment didn t feel comfortable It was also above a gentleman s club When we booked this property it was advertised as Camden town but the apartment was actually in Euston One could also smell someone smoking either in the other apartment or coming from outside , The location was great 
40828,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, this is not a 4 star hotel its a non modern super small hotel with french and italian 20 year olds as staff and very small bedrooms, the guy downstairs tries to help everyone
40829,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Breakfast staff not helpful with dietary requirements Felt a bit of a nuisance, Very good location clean and tidy single rooms are nothing like as nice as double rooms
40830,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Bed too hard Restaurant in hotel not great Breakfast overpriced so we went elsewhere , Friendly staff clean and well kept property Indian restaurant round the corner was good 
40831,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Room temperature much too high for comfortable sleeping 27 degrees Celsius when I arrived air conditioning unit was not very effective plus it seems odd to have to use this kind of facility at night in February not very ecofriendly, Lovely shower and bed very comfortable Room well equipped and quiet as well in spite of the busy roads Brilliant location for Euston Kings Cross arrivals Staff very helpful and pleasant 
40832,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, no windows room really small bathroom was quite big but the room itself was small feels like in a closet , The bed was ok but a bit small for 2 persons
40833,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The rooms very small Why are the bathroom doors Glass so see through Why was the party charged 50 deposit for each room This was not in the booking details,No Positive
40834,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The coffee bar area was very small and not very impressive the coffee s were nice though And they were happy to sit for over an hour while we waited for friends , A small room but it had everything I needed and was always clean The location is very handy for Kings Cross and Euston stations The staff were very friendly and helpful and a real asset to the hotel 
40835,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Small room very small bed small bathroom very very small closet it is a 1 person room Poor room noise isolation , Location Staff Reception Restaurant Bar Cleanliness 
40836,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Hated the shower Why why why do hotels insist on putting those horrible power showers in where you have to wear a shower cap Hate them , Fabulous location and a quik check in Room was ready on arrival Lovely breakfast Relaxed atmosphere 
40837,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Pricey for what we got Small room Clean and decent but could have gotten same at Premier Inn for less if I had booked in time But it was New Years Eve so had to take what we could, Good location near St Pancras Station but off the main drag of Euston Rd 
40838,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, When we re entered the hotel just after midnight we were greeted with a locked door and amateurish sign asking us to push a button and wave our card at a member of staff to let us in I understand the need to keep the door locked at night for security reasons but a 4 star hotel of this size should really have a key card entry system in place rather than leaving its guests freezing on the doorstep for someone to let them in , Location is excellent just a few minutes walk to both Euston and Kings Cross as well as St Pancras International and their excellent transport links Rooms are Pretty average but a decent size for a London hotel Very clean a decent shower which is essential and the Nespresso machine in the room is a nice touch Overall a good stay and I would recommend to anyone who may be travelling to or from the above mentioned stations 
40839,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, There is a miniscule wardrobe so no good if you have more than 3 items to hang The rooms are functional and to a good standard but not luxurious I d take earplugs incase you get a room onto the road I did and slept well , Near to Euston and Kings Cross stations The rooms were small but had everything we needed Everything was clean and the basic facilities like hairdryer flat screen tv nespresso machine etc were all there We didn t eat in the restaurant so I can t comment about the food thre is a small cafe area which isn t luxurious but is fine to while away an hour waiting for your train 
40840,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Arrived to the hotel to check in to find a very unprofessional clerk person at the desk He was asking me questions about me travelling alone as a young woman and even about my relationship status making me feel very uncomfortable The hotel was ok but this experience makes me avoid this place in the future ,No Positive
40841,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Bed was very hard room 204, Breakfast was very expensive so I gave it a miss and stopped at one of the local shops for coffee and a danish Much better value
40842,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, This is a hotel which just doesn t try hard enough Nothing is quite as good as it should be Check in was complicated due to the member of staff s lack of English I ordered a newspaper but didn t receive it no idea why It remains a mystery as to why why room is described as deluxe small room outdated TV hard bed no do not disturb notice no room service menu Breakfast only average which is strange because it is cooked not a buffet Pot of lukewarm tea , Proximity to place of work 
40843,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Our standard double room was really small just about wide enough to fit the bed It was ok for 2 nights and we were out for most of the day but it wouldn t have been comfortable for a longer stay , The hotel is in an excellent location close to several tube stations and nice places for lunch and dinner Staff were very friendly and helpful I loved having an espresso machine in the room it really makes a difference when you can start your day with a great cup of coffee 
40844,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Room was slightly noisey at night sounded like heating system and couldn t figure out how to operate the shower head from the taps Just minor things really ,No Positive
40845,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The only criticism I would have is very minor in that I didn t take dinner or breakfast in the restaurant as I thought it was very expensive , Location is fantastic staff were spot on The price for the area is very good and the hotel is modern in feel as opposed to some of the others in the area which are a little tired and dated 
40846,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The room noise from heating ventilator constant loud hum street light coming through the bathroom all night no way to block it out and the toilet roll holder to close to toilet when sitting , Close to St Pancras Station
40847,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The size of the room was a shock If we had paid the full price for the room we would have asked to be moved Claustrophobic Not good compared to other hotels However decor made best of size, The location was excellent 
40848,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, it seems silly that you find a Nespresso machine in the room with one caspule of coffee and one decaf surely I m not the only one who drinks two coffees , the single rooms are very small but otherwise everything you need is there
40849,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Small room with very small ill equipped shower room no hooks or shelving For a 4 night stay very frustrating No doubt fine for a 1 nightbusiness stay which seems to be their target clientele, Very clean Staff helpful Bed comfortable
40850,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Bathroom incredibly small Room facing a pub which meant noise throughout the night Way to pricey for what it is Upon arrival was asked to make a pre authorization on my card with the amount of the stay 50 so when I made the payment the following morning I had payed twice the price of the stay plus 50 Even if it is just a pre authorization on your card it still means you won t be able to use that money for 7 days Doesn t make sense Why don t they ask for the payment upfront , Quite close to Euston Station 
40851,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Tiny room reception didn t answer phone could not turn light off diesel smell from generator outside the room noisy , Location bed wet room coffee machine
40852,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Bed wasn t very comfortable and also very creeky Not a lot of hanging space in wardrobe , Overall hotel and staff were great I felt at home in my room Good location Good value for money Warm room with nesspresso machine Shower was powerful with lovely toiletries Great facilities too 
40853,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Given what appeared to be a single room with a double bed You couldn t swing the proverbial cat in it because there wasn t enough space to get a cat in the room as well as 2 adults Reviews did say that rooms were small but reviews of many London hotels say the same but this was the smallest of any of the many I ve stayed in Price way too high for what is really only a 3 hotel at best , good location Staff pleasant enough 
40854,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Free WiFi so slow that easier to use my 4G which was also better than their claimed 4 x faster pay for it service These days in central London it should be fast AND free , Nice TV Nespresso machine always welcome comfy bed 
40855,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Some staff had some trouble with English This led to some misunderstandings which coupled with a sometimes brusque Easten European style was a bit frustrating Breakfast full English was at best lukewarm, Efficient service and quick check in and check out Clean rooms 
40856,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Opaque glass door of toilet staff could not recommend any bars or restaurants close by we arrived at 8 45pm dark asked reception if anywhere close she said no went to bar next door In the morning we got up walked 300meters to end of road Euston loads of bars restaurants , Comfortable bed good location 
40857,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Unfortunately our room faced the main road so there was a fair amount of noise from the street and plenty of sirens The hotel couldn t have done anything about that though and it didn t ruin our stay , Bed was massive bathroom was clean and modern the whole room was really nice 
40858,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The room was small and freezing The hotel restaurant was only so so and not worth the price we paid for either dinner of breakfast , The location and staff were great
40859,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, I m not a big fan of the opaque bathroom door particularly when it is right next to the bed Limited hanging space even for just one night , Loved the coffee machine in the room
40860,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Better selection of bar snacks , Staff were incredibly helpful we had left some belongings in the room on a previous visit and they were returned to us The location is excellent for our frequent visits to London 
40861,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, the bed was lumpy I could feel the springs through the mattress I didn t like the glass door on the tiny showeroom didn t afford a lot of privacy , The location was very good 
40862,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Although I was in a single room it was very small even for one person Very expensive to eat there , Very close to rail and tube stations staff very helpful and room very clean
40863,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, London hotel rooms tend to be small but on this visit my single room was the smallest I have had Wonderful property and great value but don t plan on entertaining in a standard room , Spotless room friendly and helpful staff location location location
40864,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Small room The room had a very bad smell also they charge very high for late check out 20 pounds per hour No shelf in the bathroom no separate bath tub, Comfortable beds Excellent location Coffee machine in the room
40865,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Was upgraded to ambassador room which had no slippers ni bathroom robe not the end of the world but disappointed and was deserted by bar staff mid drink pouring as he went on break Really Also no plug sockets beside the bed which I think is a must these days This didn t put me off I would stay there again , Great location 
40866,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The bathroom had hairs in the bath and looked dirty on the anti slip area the sink plug area was dirty the tea coffee station had 2 coffees 2 sugars only and the tray was dirty the water was left in the machine and kettle The sheets were clean but the throw at the bottom of the bed had some odd white stains on it that wasn t nice and could be seen so not a mishap This is our second stay here just hope next time it s better otherwise we will not return , The staff are brilliant and the location is great 
40867,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Duvet far too hot and no cover or blanket to use instead Shower not separate from rest of bathroom so floor gets wet Nowhere to put anything down in bathroom, Bedroom attractive and modern
40868,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, This is the only hotel I have ever encountered that does not provide shelf space in the bathroom Having to keep my wash bag cosmetics etc on the bedside table was far from ideal There is ample space in the bathroom to incorporate a small shelf , I loved the fact tha this hotel provides single rooms Although the room was compact everything in it was good quality I felt at ease and confident in the hotel The locations was perfect 
40869,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, An additional deposit of 50 on top of my original booking cost was payable as a pre authorised amount on check in so full stay amount plus 50 I was not aware of the need of the additional deposit being taken as this is not mentioned in the booking com important info This is very haphazardly explained before the amount is taken as a pre authorised deposit when in fact it is the total cost of stay and deposit taken there and then When I queried the amount the member of staff offered a blunt and rather annoyed tone to the response saying I have just told you it is a deposit Another colleague then explained in a better tone that it was the actual room amount plus room security deposit The deposit should be refunded on checkout The tone on the initial staff members comment was inappropriate unhelpful and a simply a poor choice of words , The room facilities were excellent Comfortable bed Nespresso machine only one decaffinated and one original pod provided plus house water tea instant coffee sugar and UHT milk Bathroom shower was excellent with complementary toiletries Excellent facilities overall for this one night stay 
40870,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Nothing All was good, I think the location is very good near nice to the best places to visit British Museum Theatres and different kind of pubs and restaurants 
40871,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Apples are a travellers friend and you have discontinued them A loyalty reward which requires you to buy a two course meal to qualify is more irritating than welcoming , Water in rooms Single room with good value rate 
40872,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, We weren t aware the price of breakfast was less than advertised had we known we would have had it , The super soft pillows and big room the cleanliness the little extras such as magazines the location 
40873,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Very small rooms I had booked the room for 2 people but in the end stayed there by myself the wardrobe had room for 5 hangers only and there was nowhere in the bathroom to put my stuff Not much space elsewhere to put my stuff away , Modern rooms and comfortable bed at least once I changed rooms the bed in the first room was very uncomfortable I think because the top mattress was missing 
40874,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Room decor tired in places My room window faced directly onto a roof which in itself was OK but had staff members walking right past at 9am when I was trying to get up and blinds don t fully close I complained and was offered an upgrade next stay not sure I ll be back though At checkout 2 other guests were complaining about noise from air con units outside their room , Great location for Euston easy shops and cafes nearby lobby ambiance room was a decent size
40875,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The free wi fi was atrociously slow , The location was ideal for a conference I attended at the BMA The hotel has a gym and all other amenities that are appreciated by a business traveler 
40876,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, I have stayed there several times and been very happy with the hotel However on this occasion the staff were not friendly or welcoming The bathroom was pokey with nowhere to put toiletries The d cor is now getting shabby Admittedly I was in a lower grade room than usual but they should all reach 4 star standard , The location and the 60 price reduction for a very last minute booking 
40877,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Check in was very slow only 1 person seemed to be on duty and it took a long time to get our room keys even though we had completed the check in paperwork earlier in the day Single rooms are very small , Beds are comfortable complimentary water in reception and in the bedroom complimentary Nespresso coffee in the room very close walking distance to Euston 5 minutes Euston Square 10 minutes Kings Cross 10 minutes and Russell Square 5 minutes underground stations willing to store luggage 
40878,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, I found the bed to be very hard and uncomfortable , The locations was excellent the room spacious and well appointed the staff friendly and efficient 
40879,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The bathroom is small but there is always room for some extra cups Shower curtain can certainly be longer to reach the floor , There are no special things we like a 4 star hotel has to meet its standard 
40880,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Generally I had the impression that the business model of this hotel is additional services I would not recommend the single room the city view on booking com was a wall 6ft away and the room seemed to be built around the bed I could upgrade the room for 30 just like I could upgrade my breakfast for 6 5 to match the pictures on booking com Generally low ceilings very narrow hallways to maximise the number of rooms , The location was excellent
40881,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The bathroom was way too small and it had zero shelves Nowhere to place even a toothbrush Worse of all it had a frosted glass door with the toilet right on the other side of it Definitely not recommended for more than one person Not something you expect from a 4 star hotel , Location is central but on a quiet street 
40882,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The location of our room at the front meant it was quite noisy at night with the traffic, The bed was very comfortable and a nice touch having the chilled water in the fridge 
40883,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, the hairdryer was located in the wardrobe and besides was broken poor and expensive breakfast, the bed was very comfortable exellent location near Euston metro and bus station
40884,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Breakfast As one who doesn t eat a cooked breakfast found the blueberry pancake disappointing pancake heavy and undercooked as a result Fellow friends enjoyed the cooked full breakfast, Cleanliness of room Bed was very comfortable No queueing for breakfast Service good 
40885,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, small closet free space in the room is small for opening two suitcases, facilities are good reception crew was very hospitable general toilet room in floor 1 is clean big and modern great investment for ppl who are waiting in the lobby or checking out 
40886,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Room was very small with the bed even smaller than the average Double bed We had not ordered breakfast in advance and at 17 50 per head we did not try it but plenty of cafes close by, Location was very good for train stations bar very nice air con good in rooms
40887,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, I would like a bigger desk for working or the coffee tray on a separate small table , Nice room large enough and good room rate for London very helpful staff Good Internet 
40888,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Room was tiny bathroom even smaller Worse still the bathroom door was almost see through allowing very little privacy , Excellent location for Euston station
40889,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Single room very small but adequate if using it as a base Bed a little uncomfortable , Great location opposite Euston station Nice and clean Bathroom really nice Staff really welcoming and friendly 
40890,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Lovely duvet but too hot and heavy for the summer Blinds in the bedroom let the sun stream in as soon as it got light so take an eye mask if you want to lie in beyond sunrise , Excellent location well appointed comfortable rooms and friendly staff 
40891,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, I booked a Deluxe room which is supposedly what I got so I was told but many of the facilities that are listed as part of the deluxe rooms were not there no bathrobe slippers mini fridge iron board Also the room was small while the small desk was taken up almost entirely by coffee tea making facilities The wardrobe consisted of 6 hangers while there was basically no space for other clothes in the small drawers by the bed No room for my toiletries in the bathroom All in all I was very disappointed with the the so called deluxe room which I paid a lot more for than the standard room which I usually get and is not markedly different other than the size of the bed , Staff are friendly and rooms are clean
40892,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The cost of my 15 minute phone call to France 43 , The room was extremely comfortable and quiet even though it was at the front of the hotel Facilities in the room were excellent much appreciated the proper coffee maker and the safe Breakfast was excellent with very good choice and the cocktails in the bar superb 
40893,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, There was pubic hair in the bathroom The kettle to make tea was broken Initially the key card to the room did not work The staff did not assist I have taken photos of this , There was pubic hair in the bathroom The kettle to make tea was broken Initially the key card to the room did not work The staff did not assist I have taken photos of this 
40894,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The new style bathrooms Nowhere to put shaving gear or any other toiletries Did not like the wet room style , How quickly the staff responded to a request for another Room How clean the rooms were 
40895,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The bed was uncomfortable and squeaked too much Such a lot of money for a poor quality nights sleep When I asked for some toilet tissue the next day a staff member sent me down to the ground floor to the toilets because they didn t understand English too well and we had to wait 30 minutes until we finally received some , Location
40896,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, There was a walk in shower but would have preferred a bath however there are a few rooms with a bath but numbers are very limited and we didn t ask at the time of arrival The bathroom had a glass door and although the glass was frosted you could still see someone if they were sat on the toilet which wasn t very private If the glass door had a pattern in the glass this could have given more privacy , The room was very comfortable and space adequate Would stay again 
40897,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, room was comfortable but a bit too small even to open my suitcase , Cleanliness location very close to Euston station very friendly staff asked someone for directions and he happened to work there He walked to the hotel with me and carried my suitcase 
40898,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Nothing , Good air conditioning fantastic beds and pillows quiet room away from the noise of London streets The breakfast was brilliant me and my son are big eaters and we were stuffed after eating eat it

40901,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The phone did not ring out there was no complementary gowns or slippers as advertised booked 2 rooms asked for same floor rooms booked seperatevfloor waited over an hour for room on same floor 4 10pm, Comfortable bed
40902,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, It is now 2 days since we have booked out and the 50 00 deposit that was given on my card has still not been returned The lower ground floor toilets were not available and as our room was not ready it meant a visit to a nearby pub to use their toilets , We have stayed here before and we were not disappointed with the hotel The room we stayed in was clean and had all the usual tea coffee shower gels soap etc that was needed Both my husband and I agree that the beds are the most comfortable we have slept in at any hotel where we have stayed 
40903,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, we asked for an early check in had an email to say that had been approved but the receprionist knew nothing about it we had to wait 2 hours for room to be ready then on sunday morning we were woken by housekeeping at 9am then again at 945 we eventually vacated the room 2 hours early as we were so annoyed, location was great rooms good
40904,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Opaque bathroom doors that let all the natural daylight into the bedroom first thing in the morning take an eye mask , Lovely quality bed linen good location arrive by train into Euston drop your case and explore London for the day better than the photo s show so pleasantly surprised 
40905,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, You could see through the bathroom door I don t know about you but I do not like the idea of my other half seeing me use the toilet , Room was nice and airy Not massive but enough space for 2 Free water every day and tea and coffee facilities were excellent 
40906,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Like most hotels in London the price quality ratio is not optimal , The hotel is situated close to the main tourist attractions Also close to main rail stations Euston and St Pancras 
40907,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The bathroom doors in double rooms could be changed from glass to wood for more privacy , Prime location in terms of transport connectivity makes this an excellent choice to stay for a week long holiday The staff is always polite and accommodated our request to increase our stay by one night on short notice 
40908,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Small rooms but not complaining about that Staff are nice though none seem particularly expert Fire alarm went off 3 30AM May have been a guest smoking but no apologies or info from hotel staff , Location close to Euston and St Pancras Kings Cross Quiet due to good windows despite busy urban location Hot water and good shower water pressure Amenities included bottled water and Nespresso and a biscuit Free wifi 
40909,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The bathroom was so tiny there was no room to put anything down and the shower wet area made everything else wet The cost of breakfast was ridiculous 18 pp, The convenience of location to St Pancreas station 
40910,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Wifi Beds were too firm for me but others might like that, Large enough rooms Bathroom was gorgeous Ample storage Wifi was intermittent kept losing signal We will stay again
40911,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Although the bed linen was clean the carpet and decorative bed cover had some dirty stains the room is quite small and does not have sufficient hooks and tables to hang and put your stuff, Location close to train stations was perfect for us many options for breakfast in the neighborhood although the hotel is at a very busy and noisy street the soundproof windows ensure quiet nights
40912,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Very small wardrobe space Glass door on bathroom No iron in room even tho booking com website says they do , Air con Very comfy bed Nespresso machine in room Great cocktails in bar Quiet even tho on busy road Blackout blinds

40915,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The single room was extremely small and faced onto another part of the hotel Wouldn t want to spend any time in that particular room For 162 per night room only not the best value, Staff very courteous and friendly
40916,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Rooms are very compact The bed did not feel luxurious like in some hotels and had a basic mattress However despite this we had a good night s sleep Our room was to the side of the hotel We were not affected by traffic noise , Despite being quite compact the rooms have all the basic amenities needed and we were travelling light Convenient for Euston Station the underground network and bus service Walking distance to British Museum and Bloomsbury and even to The West End theatres Good value for London We paid 286 for two nights We would stay again 
40917,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Room service food was appalling It took an hour to arrive the food was bland and the waitress taking the order was not that helpful I was in Deluxe Room so God help me if I was in the basic double room The bathroom was just about adequate for size The overall decor of the room was very plain I felt slightly claustrophic in the room as the ceiling was quite low and there was not much room between the bed and the desk The Receptionist was moderately polite but did not give the impression that he particularly impressed with providing good customer service This is the third time I have stayed at this hotel and I will certainly not be returning , The bed was comfortable The entrance to the hotel is glamorous and sparkling After this good impression everything rapidly deteriorates 
40918,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Room was very small for two people Much more suitable for a single traveller , Excellent location for travelling to and from Euston Pleasant staff and good bathroom 
40919,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The service at reception had me waiting as they was sat in the back the flush didn t work properly only one biscuit between us skirting boards and mirror was dusty, The bed was comfy but small
40920,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Soundproofing of the rooms could be better Double glazing isn t enough Water pressure in the bathroom was poor , Location between Euston station and the event we were attending was very convenient Staff were pleasant and helpful 
40921,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Room really small Not for long stays , Staff very very helpful in the two opportunities we needed support Close to King s cross and St Pancras International The small restaurant is quite good 
40922,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, I hated the glass door to the bathroom It was practically see through especially after a shower and I don t want to see or be seen while using the toilet There wasn t enough room to put toiletries out either a large shelf would have been good I also didn t like the wet room type shower it was difficult to find somewhere to place pyjamas while having a shower I guess overall I just hated the bathroom It was on a main road so traffic was noisy but I can t say that that bothered me , I liked the location only 5 minutes walk from Euston station The room was smallish but clean and there were 2 towels per in the shower room changed each day which isn t always the norm The bed was comfortable the room the staff friendly 
40923,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Bed could have been a bit comfier mattress was very hard That is just personal preference though Wouldn t stop me from staying here again , Excellent location just a few minutes walk from Euston station Room was a decent size and very clean Nice compact bathroom Option to leave luggage after checkout if you are out and about which is handy We didn t try the restaurant although the menu sounded good and it looked as though it would be nice Checkout isn t until midday as well which was great most places seem to make you leave by 10 or 11 so we were impressed with that 
40924,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Reception staff never indicated at check in that i had a second room booked that would have made sense as i made no attempt to check into the second room , Got charged for two rooms due to a screw up on bookings com 
40925,Ambassadors Bloomsbury,No Negative, I personally found the bed a touch too firm the deluxe room I upgraded to was sufficient for our 2 night stay though the lack of hanging storage was slightly lacking for a longer stay 
40926,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, I was running late for a meeting and wanted to leave my stuff in a room but there were no rooms available I occupied the only double room that was available at the time They did not provide an iron and I had to ask for it as it s included in the room price When I returned late in the evening I found both an iron and an ironing board in the room but they removed ironing facilities again the next day There was only a fixed head shower in the bathroom and I could do with a detachable hand shower , I stayed at this hotel two years ago This time my room was facing a small garden The location is excellent The staff is very helpful I asked them to call a small village in Kent in order to confirm my arrival the hotel was family run and I couldn t catch anyone there in the morning and the manager left me a note saying she had contacted the hotel I did not have breakfast at the hotel 
40927,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The late check in 3pm would be nice to have had the possibility of earlier check in , Excellent service very friendly and attentive and aware of Gluten Free requirements without any questions 
40928,Ambassadors Bloomsbury,No Negative, Nice hotel in a great location 2mins walk from the Euston station Good for a short London stay with good tube and train connections from Euston Polite and helpful staff Rooms are clean and nicely furnished but rather small with pod style bathrooms so would not recommend for longer stay but definitely fine for a few days Enjoyed my stay there 
40929,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The alarm clock in the room made a frustrating high pitched noise throughout the night which left me with tinnitus for a couple of days Unfortunately I didn t realise the source of the noise until the morning , Nice bed and shower Very small compact room but perfect for a one night stay 
40930,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, due to the location of are room their was road noise but i think if you are on a higher floor it would be better my other pet hate not enough power sockets in the right places breakfast cost to much as their are loads of places to eat near by at a better price , hotel was ideal for us as a location and the room was good
40931,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Room and en suite a tad small but perfectly fine for a short stay Had everything you need I didn t use the coffee machine so can t comment on that , Location excellent 5 min walk from Euston 10 min walk from St Pancras Cooked breakfast to order excellent choice Also good variety on cold buffet

40934,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, small bedroom not particularly clean under around the bed Quite noisy , handy for the course I was on coffee machine although more than 2 pods would be good for those working in the room at night 
40935,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Very small room with a tiny wardrobe that could only hold three coat hangers Very little space for a case and a tiny table which was taken up by the coffee machine etc Very expensive for what you got , This hotel is in a good location especially in relation to St Pancras if travelling on the Eurostar The room was clean and the bed comfortable Staff were friendly 
40936,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, I should like to have stayed longer to experience the full range of facilities My train left at 6 30am so that was just not an option on this occasion , My stay was very short so didn t have the opportunity to sample more than a few of the services your offer which were reception the bedroom and room service all were excellent 
40937,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, No mini fridge in room as advertised A good tip about the WiFi decide if you want to upgrade to premium WiFi before you log in to the regular WiFi The free WiFi was sufficient for email surfing not for YouTube I connected with a pop up window on my mac I then bought a Premium upgrade for 6 GBP but couldn t use it because I couldn t get the pop up window back again to enter the premium code , Great location 10 minutes walk to the British Museum 3 mins to Euston tube station Friendly staff that thought along with me

40943,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Our room was on the front so very noisy but there is nothing the nothing the hotel can do about that No place to put toiletries in the bathroom, Very helpful reception and concierge who helped with our bags and offered us information about how to get where we were going Friendly staff throughout 
40944,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, I was the victim of being ripped off by Bar staff I was over charged for my drink and when I checked the receipt I realised Before I left the bar I said the woman who served me I think you ve overcharged me for my drink Without asking or looking at the til she took a fiver out of the til and threw it on the bar Now how did she know she had overcharged my by 5 pounds Why did she just throw it down without even an apology Add to this a mandatory service charge on drinks for absolutely no service at all and someone is definitely trying to rip people off It s a great pity because I loved everything else about the place but we won t stay there again not whilst they have that attitude, Location is excellent

40950,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Despite the fact that I had given my card details upon reservation and my reservation was 100pounds I was really upset with the fact that upon the check in even I was forced to pay an pre authorisation deposit of 150 on my credit card Still have to check my card details and make sure only 100pounds was charged as per reservation and not 150pounds as per pre authorisation Really tine single room , Close to Euston location is great

40975,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Was supposed to be a room for disabled wheelchair user yet there was no shower chair seat Disabled access was through restaurant not satisfactory when people dining , Location
40976,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Breakfast disappointing and not worth the special price let alone the normal price The full English included items that seemed to be burnt , Location is good a short walk from the centre Otherwise no frills which is fine Good Eggs Florentine

40978,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The single room was very small and the breakfast was expensive so I did not have it This is true of many hotels in London not just this one , I liked the area as it is very near to Russell Square and the tube is very near There are also plenty of buses and a lot of eating places in the vicinity The Brunswick shopping centre is close by The staff were polite and helpful I liked having a kettle in the room and tea and coffee and complimentary water The room was cleaned every day and the tea etc was replenished

40997,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Slightly noisy due to the hum of the air conditioning, Excellent location near the stations and great value for money Room was well decorated and the bed comfy
40998,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The heating could have been a bit warmer than it was , The room was suitable for a short stay as quite compact Liked the wet room and having a proper coffee machine The bed and pillows were very comfortable 
40999,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Nothing I liked it all although the restaurant was closed but we got Deliveroo Wagamama so it didn t matter Oh and the white wine cost me 30 which was a bit annoying But hey if I will drink a bottle in a nice hotel , All of the staff were super helpful the room was comfy clean and well decorated Our heating didn t seem to work but they sent up a maintenance guy and he fixed it in a matter of moments We had an Ambassador double room loved it all

41002,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, There was no way to turn the towel heater off making the room very warm It was a bit of a waste of energy , We arrived well before check in time but were given access to the room immediately Staff were very friendly and helpful The bed was enormous and very comfortable For London it was actually rather cheap and quite luxurious Will likely stay again next time I need to stay overnight in London 
41003,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Breakfast choice for continental breakfast left a lot to be desired My husband and I went to dining room about 9 15 every morning and had to request certain items as nothing appeared to be replenished Also staff not particularly welcoming or helpful Found this disappointing and quite a contrast to our previous stay in this hotel , Location was excellent and staff at reception both welcoming and helpful 
41004,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The room is way too small and the toilet as well , Location is very convenient and within walking distance from Oxford street Euston station is 5 minutes walk from the hotel 
41005,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Needing to pay to upgrade wifi should be included in price of room, Comfortable spacious and clean room with large TV Nice bathroom Very convenient to Euston station Friendly staff 
41006,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Tiny little bathroom and bedroom I know it includes room size in text but you don t realise how smallit is till you are in it , Location was great for access to transport
41007,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Double bed was made by pushing two single beds together At check in I was asked for a 50ukp pre authorisation for extras on my credit card which apparently is refunded after a few days I was not happy with this , Very clean Quiet considering city centre location 
41008,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The coffee tea machine had not been properly cleaned and water was dirty Size of shower room was poor with nowhere to put cosmetics Hotel should tell customers there is no bath, The staff were extremely helpful and polite Hotel was on a bus route with easy access into the heart of the city
41009,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, a bit cramped hair drier didn t work, Great Location room was spotless and to a good standard Had to ask for towels on second night and fresh ones were delivered very quickly 
41010,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Cost of breakfast small and hard bed bit dusty at edges of carpet etc room was 1st floor above a busy bar very noisy the wet room was certainly wet to say the least barely any room to hang clothes , Nice Breakfast which was via Room Service
41011,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Beside breakfast food was nothing to rave about Slow WiFi Rooms are small , Staff were always cheerful welcoming and helpful Beds super comfortable Location was great 
41012,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, I thought a continental breakfast could have been included , I felt the facilities available in the room were great Amazing location but not too noisy 
41013,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The mushroom risotto was very tasty but too undercooked for me The bite was more of a crunch I m afraid If you like rice cooked more chose something else , So easy to find Close to Euston and very central Very pleasant reception and restaurant staff Room was compact but huge bed which was very comfy and small but very clean and efficient ensuite 
41014,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Front end of hotel looks very glamorous however the reception bar and in particular my room was very cold looking and small I requested to relocate but no joy Poor nights sleep as a result of constant police ambulance sirens , Ease of checking in out process
41015,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Food within hotel average although service good The first nught we hv dinner at the hotel rest both our steak n salmon are slughtly burnt, Helpful n v nice staff Convenient location Near to tube eateries Easy access to places of interest
41016,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Some furnishings starting to look very slightly tired minor issue and still great value for money , Friendly reception staff Great location near Eurostar 
41017,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Bathroom door frosted glass meant lack of privacy Bathroom design meant that water from shower made all of bathroom floor wet , Comfortable beds enjoyable breakfast location Affordable late checkout 
41018,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, On first stay the single was very tiny and noisy from other guests my bed shook every time someone slammed a door Wardrobe space was very limited in both the single double was o k for 1night though , 2nd trip to hotel was upgraded from single to double when explained about noise from other guests on my first stay the receptionist was very helpful and accommodating and found a quiet room Clean tidy and a really comfortable bed Wi fi Was fast enough for normal purposes and plenty tea coffee etc Would liked to have stayed another night though the lack of wardrobe space would have been difficult Even tho the double was cheaper than the single Very convenient for Eurostar etc 
41019,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Cost of breakfast was on the high side hence the trip to the cafe Also wifi very slow but you could at a cost upgrade, Good transport connections and many of the tourist attractions were in easy walking distance We did not have breakfast in the hotel as there was a little cafe round the corner that did beautiful smoked salmon and scrambled egg on toast with a coffee or tea for 5 99 Hotel was very clean I had a single room which was rather small but had all the amenities including a nespresso machine
41020,Ambassadors Bloomsbury,No Negative, This hotel is well located near Kings Cross and is bright and well appointed with very friendly helpful staff The room was comfy with a great bed and nice bathroom Even better i was upgraded Paid 99 and for London this is good value for a nice hotel 
41021,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Could not find switch to turn off bathroom light The views from sides of room were rubbish Listed as having city views but view i got was dirty walls and buildings , The location is excellent The bed is very comfortable 
41022,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, the room was small no where to put things bed was NOT comfortable room not clean dusty way over priced evening meal rip off and steak was poor confusion about the rate as it didn t include breakfast have stayed in far better for less in London, location was ideal for our stay in the city
41023,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The bed was very comfortable but there was very little space in the room No table very small wardrobe very small luggage rack Bathroom extremely small and under equipped The door was semi transparent glass and didn t have a lock No shelf to place one s things Shower space had no rim so water flooded the whole bathroom OK if you just want to sleep here but not comfortable if you want to spend any time relaxing , Convenient location 10 min by foot to St Pancras station Eurostar and 15 20 min by foot to the West End Good wi fi TV and breakfast 
41024,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Being on the front was quite noisy with the window open which was needed some of the time although not unbearable , Although the room was quite small it was very well decorated and clean and adequate for our short stay
41025,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The only thing I didn t like was the firmness of the bed it was far too firm for me and caused me to have a back ache but that is literally the only thing , The room the location the service the cleanliness the amenities All of it was wonderful 
41026,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Other guests slamming doors which made the bed shake noisy footsteps overhead this went on until the early hours why can t people be more considerate , Stayed twice a week apart the first room a single was exceedingly small the other guests were very noisy banging doors etc So a sleepless night On my return I was upgraded to a double and it was a lot quieter so I thoroughly enjoyed that stay A decent breakfast for an extra cost 
41027,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The only thing I didn t like was the carpet in the room was a little tired looking , Excellent location for arrival from Kings Cross Staff are very friendly The bed in the room is super comfortable 
41028,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Free wifi is very slow I expected more The alarm was set for 7 30 I did not notice I wanted a lie in I would expect the alarm to be turned off when room was serviced, Central location Clean and pleasant room
41029,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, First was given a twin room directly opposite the lift which would have been noisey but on the plus side the reception staff immediately changed us to a quiet room Very limited bar menu which was all that was available on Sunday evening but very helpful bar staff , Helpful staff clean modern room nice modern shower wet room compact but well designed room with good sized TV hung on the wall Appreciated check out time at 12pm and reception staff asked if we wanted to leave our luggage all day after check out free newspapers on reception The room had nice touches like digital alarm clock bottle of water proper coffee making machine Plenty of sockets Free internet excludes digital TV and some downloads Would definitely stay again we got a good deal on a Sunday 89 for a twin room excluding breakfast I chose this room as it was walking distance to UCLH hospital and it had many different tube bus routes within walking distance 
41030,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Some staff were helpful some not We had to ask to have our room cleaned in the afternoon having left our paper hanger on the door handle in the morning Never replenshished our tea and coffee Sunday when we checked out we told one of the staff and he offered us a complimentry breakfast he couldn t have been more helpful i wish we had took his name , location 
41031,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Bathroom quite small and cluttered , Staff were good and helpful Location great for train and for things to see do Room very comfortable with nice extras 
41032,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Bit hot in the room , Perfect for a central location being close to Euston station Comfortable couple of nights an s quiet Staff were very friendly and helpful 
41033,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, We arrived at 10 o clock and so did all the registration stuff Arrived back at 3 00 to collect key and found Reception a bit chaotic and slow to process guest check in ,No Positive
41034,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Bathroom was horribly designed The shower is just in the middle of the room there s a curtain but no delineation on the floor so water gets everywhere You can t reuse towels because you have to leave them all over the floor so you don t slip on the wet floor afterward The sink is tiny so you also end up with water on the floor after washing your face I ve stayed in cheaper tinier hotels in London that at least had a standard bathroom this looks like someone designed it to look cool but not be used by anyone , Room and bed were large compared to typical central London hotels Location was convenient 
41035,Ambassadors Bloomsbury,No Negative, Fresh cooked English breakfast with excellent quality ingredients Really friendly helpful staff Lovely comfortable mattress and high quality linen towels
41036,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The room was at the front of the building not far from A E at UCH so there was some sirens during the night , Large comfortable bed with sufficient quality pillows Walking distance to 3 mainline train stations in London 
41037,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The glass bathroom door style over function Why Just hideous that your room mate can see you sat on the lavatory Absolutely no wardrobe space two coats hanging up and it was full Again style over function These are the only two issues with an otherwise fabulous hotel , Great location 10 mins walk from King s Cross 20 mins from West End Clean comfortable hotel excellent staff Lovely restaurant Would recommend 
41038,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Minute room Even eith a single bed there was no room for my suitcase Window out onto a miserable back lane and brick wall Room was so tiny I had to sit on the bed to do emails , Comfortable bed clean bedding hot shower 
41039,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Well we couldn t complain about the size of the bed it was great it was a bit big for the room though and made getting around a bit awkward Not really a complaint For room only it was bit pricey but we did book last minute , Great location Walking distance to Covent Garden L Square and China town Loads of places around for breakfast if you are room only The room was very clean and had plenty towels and a great coffee machine
41040,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Key card to door was unreliable but staff resolved it , Good location close to Kings Cross and Euston Good choice of places to eat and drink close by 
41041,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Extremely rude staff at breakfast Requests ignored Try getting an order taken Just one ordinarily pleasant girl seemed liked an angel by comparison Also a ridiculous lack of any storage space How about some drawers under the bed like Citizen M , Nice location comfortable rooms 
41042,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, After first night I didn t get fresh coffee capsules instead the staff member had placed the already used capsules back in front of the machine Room was quite small and ventilation was noisy , Nespresso machine Good location Clean 
41043,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Bedroom was tiny it was difficult to move The monochrome grey is depressing in such a small room No herbal fruit tea in bedroom Breakfast was expensive No view to room , Good wet room Breakfast was varied

41045,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Just one little niggle nowhere to hang my wet coat could do with a coat hook Minor consideration , Very nice clean room perfect for a solo one night stay Staff very friendly Definitely would stay again 
41046,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, I had a lovely room but unfortunately it was at the front of the hotel As the hotel is on a main road the sound of traffic was loud all through the night I was told the following morning that quiet rooms can be requested , Very comfy and modern rooms
41047,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Very small double room not enough storage so ended up living out of our cases , Location near several key stations and 10 minute walk to the British museum
41048,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, No check in until 3pm was a bit of problem I did hear two other guests complaining about their rooms so I was very worried But to be fair my room was clean and comfortable , The shower room was modern and nice The bedroom itself was fairly comfortable if small Small ish single bed but it was okay Ordered room service which okay too It was quiet Staff were helpful 
41049,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The room Although a single I couldn t work the chair didn t fit with the desk as it clashed with the tiny bed The desk was covered with the coffee machine who was wired to the wall so you couldn t move it No bath Not enough space to put a suitcase Very expensive compared to other hotels of a similar price , The staff 
41050,Ambassadors Bloomsbury,No Negative, Reception staff offered without asking to keep my bag for me while I attended a conference They were also very charming on my arrival the day before 
41051,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The first room Zi was given had no window I was not told this and being somewhat claustrophobic was dreading the stay there However the young lady at the desk later asked me if the room was alright and I was able to tell her that I hated the room I was given a room with a window right away When Zi returned to the hotel 3 days later from Zparos I was given a lovely room with a window onto the nun road without hesitation I was also grateful that I could leave my suitcase at the hotel while visiting family in Paris I think that the closeness to the wonderful st Pancras station is a wonderful asset , The location and the room itself and although expensive it was worth it for centrality of travel and places to be 
41052,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Would have liked breakfast INClUDED in rate but would not have wanted to pay more , Very close to where I needed to be and excellent for Euston and Kings Cross All facilities I needed for a one night single room business trip 
41053,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The wet room bath was annoying but could be worked around Would have liked a couple of hooks in the bath , Great location awesome front desk staff very friendly and accommodating comfortable room with nice beds good air conditioning and very quiet 
41054,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Having sent over a pre payment authorisation for for my business colleague they were still asked for payment personally , Facilities and Location was very good
41055,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Bad experience No customer focus they did several mistakes from booking to room assignment to breakfast I had to ask for the manager who actually never took the effort to come and discuss with me I don t care about the discount at the end but I do care about the attention when I travel so much , Location is good near Euston Station and the center 
41056,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Noisy air conditioning fans or other machinery outside my window on the 6th floor , Great location for Euston Kings cross stations and very comfortable room 
41057,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Breakfast a little pricey for what was offered Cereal or yoghurt toast and beverage as an alternative light breakfast would be appreciated for those in a hurry , Convenience to St Pancras station Lack of noise from busy street 
41058,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Charging 17 95 for breakfast Mad Luckily several caf s in alley at side doing full English with tea and toast for 6 Bathroom is wet room which doesn t suit all and has slightly see through door , Very close to Euston Has left luggage facility Short walk to Russell Sq tube which gives fast access to theatres and Covent Garden Extremely clean comfy bed nice linen great shower Staff very helpful 
41059,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Bed very soft and quite uncomfortable air conditioning loud and causing uncomfortable wind in the room and it turned on automatically every time the hotel card is inserted to turn on the lights The room was very small While the hotel is overall ok the 200 UKP per night I paid is way too much for such a hotel even for London , Hotel in a very good location near Euston station well connected to central London overall very clean
41060,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Little noisy, Had a good trip Slightly noisy and could hear lift or doors in the middle of the night but I would expect this in the location and on that budget Overall good 
41061,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Not a bad experience I just personally don t like wet rooms the shower was great however, Really loved location room was so quiet which was suprising bed really comfy
41062,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Didn t have a bad experience at all The hotel was on a reduced rate which fell within my budget I wouldn t normally be able to afford to stay here , The rooms were amazing 
41063,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, The pillows smelled like feet It was pretty bad Also the room does not have enough electric outlets for modern use Only had two around the desk , great location and staff are friendly and helpful 
41064,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, Don t ask them to call you a taxi for the airport The hotel charges between 20 30 the driver and obviously this will be added to your fare at the end Get a taxi in the street or use the public transport , Very modern and fairly spacious room Wifi is excellent 
41065,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, When checking out i like to just drop the keys of at the desk and leave Here it took a few minutes because i added the bar meal to my bill Had to pay using my card again at check out Thought it would be done automatically because you give your card details when you check in , Great location for Euston and Kings Cross stations Bar food was good and reasonably priced for London Free Wi Fi is good for most needs No need to upgrade to the paid version

41069,Ambassadors Bloomsbury,No Negative, Two things the receptionists on arrival at 2130 and departure at 0800 were really warm and friendly And although I have delivered many training courses in this hotel this was the first time I have stayed I like the idea of the room number in bright coloured mat on the doorstep 
41070,Ambassadors Bloomsbury, They till need a deposit even though I booked and paid this room with a visa credit card If there is something wrong with the room you can always charge on my credit card without asking for a deposit with a receipt , The room is so abstract class simple style fancy I really like the bedding except the mattress I like this glass wall in the bathroon with everyting of good quality The people was kind and warm hearted
