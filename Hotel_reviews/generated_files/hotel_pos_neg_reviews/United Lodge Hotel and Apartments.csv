163345,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, There was nothing i did not like, excellent everything you imagine to put in a room for convenience is in your room Best hotel room i have ever stayed in the staff very friendly and polite Recommended most definetely
163346,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, I d have made the space for the toilet in the bathroom a bit bigger but when you re shoehorning modern amenities into an OLD building well sometimes you have to compromise , To paraphrase what my wife said on Facebook I quite like this hotel It s run by a family and they are so proud of everything In fact the current owner grew up in the basement of the house The mosaic tiles around the reception window the inspirational plaques in rustic wood focused on kindness the small art prints of small London moments that float on the wall above the handrail that winds up the narrow staircase the newly refurbished hotel kitchen Try our new toasties for an afternoon snack We will bring you your choice of breakfast to your own room and the bathroom toiletries highest London quality It won t ever win awards for class but on the friendly and clean scale they are winners Two blocks away is a grimy looking street in all fairness a LOT of London and Paris score extremely high on the grimy scale full of people shopping at tiny stores of all kinds Turkish markets hot nuts delivered locks phones phone repair clothing stores fabric stores and more Turkish restaurants than I ve ever seen Last night s dinner was at one of those Walking back in the dark we could see the ragged looking apartments above the commercial properties lining the street Real life in London away from the tourist center When we left we left with hugs from the owner If you re looking for a place to stay that s about 20 minutes from the center of London and won t cost you an arm and a leg the United Lodge Hotel is a winner 
163347,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Breakfast wasn t it They ask for deposit at point of checking even they have your card details very odd The staff are taught their hotel policy and not customer service, Good sized rooms and functional wifi
163348,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Couldn t fault it great location great facilities and very kind and helpful staff Staying for two nights was a pleasure , Very comfy bed staff were very helpful and accommodating as we left our bags behind reception before the check in time
163349,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Pathetic housekeeping Had to complain several times to get the room cleaned properly No telephone or AC in the rooms Had to go up and down 2 floors no lift to talk to the reception if we needed anything The table fan provided was not enough and room was uncomfortable and too warm at night They are not equipped for summer , Close to many halal restaurants Close to Manor house underground station and bus stop Friendly receptionists
163350,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments,No Negative, Ideal for us we were at a festival at Finsbury Park so perfect Bathroom a bit small and room was a bit smaller than we thought they would be but not complaining it was clean Staff were really nice and made us welcome would definitely go there again 
163351,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Limited double single beds room choices and required to pay extra to get the choice , Staff were very friendly and special mention to Antonio who was extremely helpful and attentive He was quick to address the issues and queries raised 
163352,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, We stayed in a superior room which was for 3 people however I don t feel it was big enough We managed but there was a lot of squeezing past each other and no space to put anything really other than on the beds I think the photos are a little deceiving Also at the time of booking I was told i would pay on arrial which although did happen the hotel put a pre authorisation for the full amount of the room 5 days before we arrived This does impact on your available funds in your bank so is pretty much like the payment has been taken I queried this with hotel but nothing was done Theresfore I was 300 less in my bank account for the 5 days before arriving at the hotel This was dissapointing as I was not told this at booking despite me specifically asking the question about payment Also the booking site does not state you have to give a 50 security deposit when checking in , The location was perfect for an event we were attending in Finsbury Park Was close to good amenities too retail park tube restaurants Staff were really friendly too The room was really clean and the bed was comfy Free bottles of water and tea coffee Was also good to have a fridge 
163353,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, We did have Ant problems but the worse thing by far was the strong smell of sewers , Very close to the tube The room was at the rear of the property so very quiet 
163354,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Size Price Advertise as an apparent Is a hostel no 4 stars, This is over priced Worts value for money ever a rip off Over 200 euro per night in very small room A bed fired on a broom room in a basement Shared Toilet that was dirty For less moneney You can get much more Real value of this room 50 euro per night been generous I have worked in hotel distribution over 10 years David
163355,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, The room was like a corridor turned into a room Not a nice room , Room was not at all similar to the photos Expensive and not value for money at all 
163356,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, The google map photo left me a little apprehensive as to the condition and standards of the building but all was absolutely fine and I would recommend this accommodation to anyone, I liked the location so convenient for tube the friendly helpful staff and the comfortable warm clean room It met all my needs and expectations The tea making facilities with the small dining table and chairs in the room left my stay so relaxing Suitable for all age groups I felt secure and safe
163357,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, There isn t any sound proofing We had the room behind reception so we can hear all the guests coming in and out and talking in the hallway Generally wasn t an issue as it seems most guests were in by the time we went to bed although there was one night someone was taking a shower at 1am and we could hear the sound of the shower , The staff was super friendly and helpful and generally very pleasant to deal with There was a small kitchenette complete with cookin utensils for basic cooking so we were able to save some money by having breakfast in our room before we started the day Location was excellent only a 5 minute walk from the Tube and there was a supermarket just outside the station for the previously mentioned breakfast We really enjoyed our stay 
163358,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, The room turned out to be soooo small it is normal for London but we were very surprised Despite of daily cleaning overall cleanliness could be better Another point is that was too dark in the room so we had to call an electrician to change several light bulbs Even after that the room remained too dark to my taste , The metro tube station is quite close The neighborhood is green and comfortable with lots of different stores and the park The hotel is quite good we liked it The staff is always there to help The room had the kitchenette and some utensils we needed for cooking The room temperature is easy to regulate whether you like it hotter or colder ask the staff it s not a problem Another good point is that we had the better room type than what we paid for without extra charge We had our own bathroom though the hotel also offers rooms with shared bathroom So pay attention while choosing the room type 
163359,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, The bed was very small only a double too small for us I m a big person and was very uncomfortable perched on the side of the bed trying to sleep A room with a larger bed was available but that room was not as quiet, The staff were lovely and the room we had on the top floor was very quiet
163360,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, In the room there was cold but we could not turn on the heatener we realised this in the evening so we did not ask for help , The building is good located opposite to Finsbury Park The staff was nice and helpful We could leave our bags there till we could check in 
163361,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, The awful carprt and welcome tray everything on the tray was old and gross , The place was great except for the carpet it was gross Ant they left out old yucky candy for us The staff was great The beds were super comfy and it was a very short walk to manor house underground station 
163362,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Not much we didnt like some machine noises at night but they didnt go on for too long tv was showing no signal in the 1st night but was rectified promptly after being reported cant really fault our stay these things happen , We liked the location being close to the tube network in the cheaper zones The service and efficiency of the staff was excellent The room was well equipped and more than sufficient for us All in all a nice place in my opinion 
163363,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Hotel no lift which is a bit hard if your room were other than ground floor , It is a short walk from Manor House tube station Picadilly line Zone 2 Daily house keeping was provided Equipped with kitchenette which allow to do simple cooking It was helpful especially travelling with young children 
163364,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Manor House tube station is not steps free There were 5 7 minutes walk to the hotel It was diifficult to carry a big luggage from the station to the hotel Hotel do not have lift we have to climb up to 3rd floor with the luggage , Location on Picadilly Line Manor House Tube Station Zone 2 Great when you have the 7 days travel Oyster card which cover Zone 1 Zone 2 Staff are friendly and helpful Room with kitchenette which allow to do simple cooking Daily housekeeping provided Down the road there are shops restaurants If not wrong we were upgraded to superior room which can accommodate 3 guests Thank you for the upgrade

163366,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments,No Negative, What a Wonderful Hotel Everything was excellent Staff was very courteous especially Antonio Ferit and Alecia who was very friendly and helpful The room which we stayed in with my daughter was very modern with a kitchen where we were able to make coffee and tea Well furnished rooms with a very comfortable Bed We stayed 2 days and on the second day we met Andy who is the Director of the Hotel who was very welcoming and caring for his guests I have been using Booking Com for many years and i have been in many many Hotels but this one is the most pleasing and fantastic hotel i stayed in This Hotel should have 5 stars not 4 as it was given The location is excellent if you want excellent food as many top class restaurants round the corner I am one of the fussiest customers of Booking com but happy to say i could not find any fault with this hotel Well done to Andy and his team and thank you for the pleasant 2 days we had in your excellent hotel as guests

163368,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, No lift no phone in the room they took money from my account for things i didn t use And when I called them to complain about this they kept saying their manger is not around This is second week after I checked out , The location
163369,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, We booked a twin room but it was a room with a double bed and a very little foldable one My daughter and me used the same bed to sleep And the room didn t have good light at bathroom to make up only works one bulb And in a room for two people only have a chair to take breakfast , The bed was comfortable and the room was very clean The staff very nice 
163370,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, The room size was smaller the bed was not comfortable overall the hotel was not more than three stars but the internet shows four stars which is overrated, WiFi
163371,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, I felt a bit boxed in but it had nice big windows for fresh air so that was fine, The staff are delightfully polite and they are really obliging and helpful
163372,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Costumer service they would rather argue me down then change my sheets after 4 days and also the heat wasn t working so the brought me a space heater, Location and comfort
163373,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, bijou bathroom with loo ever so close to the bath but really that is hardly a problem , Nice reception from the staff a clean warm and airy room with comfy bed nice little kitchen facilities with loads of hot water Close to the Tube buses and some fab Turkish restaurants and shops open all hours Half an hour by bus from Ally Pally
163374,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, The room was clean and tidy kitchen was great too the only downfall was the bathroom poor ventilation so nothing would keep dry in there towels and toilet paper always felt damp I mentioned this to the young lady on reception duty when returning apartment keys booking out , Perfect location to visit central London bus service and underground Five minute walk from apartment Plenty of nice places to eat locally supermarket small retail park just around the corner Reception is manned 24 hours staff very friendly and welcoming young gentleman receptionist Bareed provided excellent service helping us with enquiries his customer focus and attention to detail is second to none Bareed is a credit to the hotel and we would not hesitate returning to stay again after receiving such a warm genuine welcome Thank you so much Bareed you are a star and the hotel is very lucky to have you there 
163375,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, I was happy with my stay, Overall it was a good stay room clean bed comfortable everything I needed in the room good shops nearby transport available near hotel all good 
163376,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Unfortunately the toilet was outside of the room of course I already knew when I made the reservation but always sparkling clean , The room even if small was full of amenities and the WiFi was very fast and the staff was very helpful and friendly felt Just like be some friend s guest 
163377,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, They take out my food and toothbrush shampoo when i go out to travel the hotel return me the most food and shampoo in next day but i still lost my chopsticks and some sauces The manager never say anything for it , They can respond any question that include to change room for the radiator
163378,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, The shower seemed to be broken and couldn the be moved up Also when the bathroom was used in another room we could hear the fan in ours disturbing our sleep , Beds were extransferred comfy
163379,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments,No Negative, Lovely staff Very clean and comfy good value for money Approx 3 miles from Alexandra palace Shops and bars near by Opposite the park Overall very impressed
163380,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, The curtains didn t cover the window so was very bright Also being on a noisy main road didn t help We had to give a 50 deposit on arrival which we were not aware of , Good location Close to the underground to get into the city centre 
163381,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments,No Negative, Staffs are very nice and friendly The houses are decorated as a warm house and make you feel like home for Christmas time Room are cleaned everyday and very close to tube station 
163382,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Not much to say here , Staff were amazingly friendly Less than 10min walk to the nearest tube station and great selection of restaurants nearby Hotel also offers parking options for a good price 
163383,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, The breakfast could have been better and my girlfriend went back to our room to change her trousers but the cleaner was inside so we had to wait 15 minutes for her to finish, Loved the facilities and the homeliness of the hotel
163384,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, The 2nd double bed was a bit small the picture actually showed a double two singles but this wasn t too much of a problem , Very reasonable price and good location so ideal for our needs The place was clean and staff helpfull with easy safe access at night which was just what we needed 
163385,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, When we returned a few days later without our adult children we were told that we would be getting a very nice room When we arrived our room had been changed It was very cramped pushed up against the wall so you had to climb over your husband to go to the toilet at night Also no lift I had to struggle up all the stairs to the room with the luggage Bathroom was very small with no shelf to put your toiletries Wouldn t bother with breakfast next time, The family room we had for 2 nights was lovely and spacious The pull out beds mattress was too thin so we asked for an additional duvet for extra padding this worked well
163386,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments,No Negative, I payed for late check out at 8 in the morning I was woken up by men knocking on the door to check the boiler I refused them to come in as there was 4 girls and we did not feel commutable Then we were woken again by builders on our roof and in our yard looking through our window smoking at our door and dropping things off the roof I had to leave early as it was scary uncomfortable I asked them to move also reported at reception and still waiting on a call back now nearly a week later Before leaving on two more occasions they knocked on the door to come in the bedroom and check the boiler Disappointed after a lovely stay I have videos of this 8 in the morning but it will not allow me to upload but I would like everyone to see what we woke up to 
163387,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, I stayed at this hotel with my partner and was extremely unhappy when at 4 am we were woken to the male receptionist screaming to some young girls to get out of his hotel this is extremely unacceptable to wake other guests up shouting the main reason you stay in a hotel is to sleep not be woken up if the screaming wasn t bad enough at 5 30 there was a frantic knock at the door it was the male receptionist accusing my boyfriend of having the girls in the room and demanded to see who he was with I think this was very unacceptable when I spoke to the female receptionist in the morning about this nothing was done hardly even an apology , the rooms are basic size with basic decoration average double bed however bathroom was quite modern hotel in good position close to underground 
163388,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, I had booked two rooms one was self contained for a purpose and to my dissapointment we found out on the day of arrival that the staff couldn t find the keys to the self contained room instead i was offered another room that didnt have all the facilities , Facilities
163389,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, We vacated a little later thank check out time and we re charged 10 for the privilege but staff we re polite about it and the overall cost of the room for a night was acceptable for the quality , Small but more that adequately equipped with what we needed A nice stay friendly staff 
163390,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Slightly bigger bathroom toilet would have been nice But it was clean and adequate so not really a cause for complaint unless you like to swing cats in your bathrooms in which case the poor beast wouldn t survive one revolution , Everything we needed kitchen with fridge no oven cutlery crockery even a hair dryer for the Mrs Walking distance to Piccadilly Line Shops close at hand for any necessities Staff friendly and helpful And all at a very agreeable price for London Would definitely use again 
163391,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, The shower temperature was a little awkward to control and maintain The mattress on the double bed was smaller than the base and seemed to be not quite double sized , Pleasant stay The staff were all very welcoming and helpful Room was basic but comfortable good fridge and sink area Free wifi was good We were on the ground floor near reception and partly under the stairs but there was very little in the way of noise or disturbance 
163392,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, The rooms have been crammed in There was a boiler in our room which was v noisy , Location was perfect for our needs It was very clean and nicely decorated 
163393,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Tiny room Dirty floor dirty toilets shower head full of limescale Dirty table stove and toaster Tatty No lift or phone to contact reception Very disappointed Misleading website , The bed was clean and the location was pretty good but some of the local residents were very dodgy 
163394,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Breakfast was 8 and poor quality Room 20 has a boiler built in to the corner of the room and despite opening windows I could not cool it down I should have suspected something when I saw a large fan in the room , Staff were very pleasant 
163395,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, wifi not working at all in the rooms we had to go to the lobby counter to access the free wifi when we arrived at the place we couldnt use both rooms we booked because there was problem with the electrical connections in the room however 2 5 hrs later which was 4 30pm one of our room was ready and the other was not so all 8 of us had to cramp in the room meant for 4 ppl when they told us that the room will not be ready until 8pm we decided to go out when we came back at 9 30 pm the other room was finally ready but sadly none of the sockets in the room was working I asked both the staff guy and lady whether we will be compensated for our sufferings they told me that they will have to ask the manager on duty the next day however the next day we were told that they were not able to give compensation then and will contact me again on the compensation issue however i have yet to hear from them till date the premise was near to Manor House station but the walk there from the accommodation is uphill which is not very convenient when youre bringing lots of big heavy bags , we were given a room with private terrace which was wonderful the water heater works fine kitchen was satisfactory 
163396,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, It was claimed that i brought crokcroach to the hotel and without evidence Next i was asked to park out with my family within the next hour without sorting another accommodation for me I was also charged for fumigation of a croakcroach that i never saw , Nothing
163397,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Our room was a double and the bathroom facilities are shared with other guest a floor above our room This was a new experience and we survived , Andy was really great and offered exceptional service 
163398,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, the absence of beakfast only but no big deal there are a lot of bars near the hotel , everything was ok staff is very kind and always available for any need reception is open 24 7 wi fi was fast 
163399,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Super tiny room for 3 Very noisy traffic from outside Slum kind location Safety box broken Fan broken Chairs broken Very very dirty Houskeeping didn t add toilet paper even when asked Continantal brekfast was an joke , Pathroom was nice all tough the path was quite small but least we got plenty of warm water Staff was nice and maded the best what they could 
163400,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Family room accommodation smelt bad foisty like mouldy potatoes One member of staff rude about refusal to pay room security deposit of 150 on top of cost of accommodation and about not wishing to have confidential documents like drivers licence or passport photocopied also photocopies not being returned on departure Shower height adjuster was broken and wouldn t stay in height position tap in kitchen was also dodgy Finally the showers were cold Would not recommend to stay here , Being able to use kitchenette to reduce food costs of the trip Hotel manager was lovely 
163401,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Breakfast was expensive for what was served Shower pressure temperature was very poor Complicated need for photo IDs meant we had to pay in advance make sure all your party have ID before you book, Pleasant staff Good facilities kitchen etc Good location
163402,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Tea and coffee not available in one room room 3 smelled very bad of damp for 360 per night No car parking for nearly 700 for 2 rooms for 1 night, Nothing
163403,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Purchased option with breakfast and in my opinion overpaid very little in offer for breakfest for that money better to go shop and spend that money on products and make your own breakfasts or go to a cafe for a breakfast it will still be cheaper per person , Nice clean room clean bathroom close to tube station nice quiet location fairly close to London centre
163404,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Room size was too small and cluttered Beware shared bathroom 3 flights of narrow stairs with luggage was no fun Beware no A C I missed that point and it was middle of JUN Room was right off and facing road Noisy traffic and had to keep window open to get cool air , Staff was courteous and very helpful 
163405,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, The kitchen floor could have been a little bit cleaner there were stains on it and the bathroom was very tiny but still i enjoyed my stay , The staff were friendly and so helpful The ease of the hotel and environment is nice and relaxed My room was looked after and nice and quiet The location is perfect and only a quick tube ride from the centre 
163406,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, a bit far from central London very narrow corridors small rooms a bit of a walk to underground around 10 mint , comfortable beds large bathroom helpful staff who brought a fan for us as we complained of hot weather close to overground trains
163407,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Found the following issues with a Compact double room Bathroom was shared it was not mentioned in the room title as most other hotels do much clearer but only with a short sentence in the room description easy to overlook also because two photos on the four available in the room description were related to a bathroom although then the room contains none The staff was clearly aware of the possible issue as this is the first thing they reminded me immediately after having charged me with the price of our stay proposing also an expensive upgrade to a room without shared bathroom Bad smell in the room Room with a window on a trafficked road one must choose between fresh air or silence to sleep No kitchnette and no microwave but such facilities now seem to have been removed from the description of that room No refrigerator Tea coffee making facilities the kettle had a so short electric cable that it could not lay on the table or on the floor ridiculous but it was even not working hopefully it was changed with a brand new one but only after having requested it Cutlery and crockery were not present at first We received them only on the third day on four for our whole stay still after having requested them But it was then removed and didn t reappear on the fourth day On the hotel website a toaster ironing facilities and a hair dryer are also supposed to be present in such rooms Not present either A complimentary water bottle on arrival was supposed to be provided we ve never heard of it Free WiFi It was so weak and instable in that room that navigating web pages was really frustrating waiting time and streaming anything audio or video nearly impossible Flat screen TV oriented toward the ceiling which is not exactly the best for a good vision I don t understand how this hotel can be part of the Booking com s preferred property programme ,No Positive
163408,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, The customer service the over pricing and the attempt to charge unnecessary extras, This was the most terribly run place I have ever stayed I would not reccomend it to anyone
163409,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, blind curtain could help to have darkness early in the morning, Good location close to tube station and night bus stop Cosy bed and fully equipped kitchenette 
163410,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Well I had booked for a classic double room which had wa kitchnette like a studio all in the room and the pictures were lovely when I booked however when I reached there the room I was showed was in the basement one with a compact double room and the separate kitchen area and an extremely small bathroom I refused to be in that room stating that this was not what I had booked I insisted and showed the lady the pictures of the supposed classic double room and she told me that this is a Superior double studio which is normally for 3 persons I insisted on having that room which I got ROOM 21 It was nice cozy but with a double bed so I wondered how come 3 persons and the room was not as big as well but nice with clean bathroom as well To my surprise I was then told that I will charged extra as this is not the room type I booked even if the pics were those on the website I stayed for 5 nights and while check out I was not told anything about the extra charge I assumed they had figured out their mistake of misleading pics and hence not ch oarged but to my surprise in the evening while checking my credit card balance they had charged me an extra almost 80 pounds I had already paid 355 50 pounds for that room SO YES IT WAS A NICE PLACE LITTLE NOISY BUT GOOD BUT MISLEADING Really dissapointed for having paid so much extra when I had booked that room only So do make sure you have the price and the room in the pics before booking guys , Clean proximity to tube central London within minutes nice staff everyday cleaning
163411,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, The studio was incredibly small for 3 people The bed for the 3rd person was a sofa bed really uncomfortable and it was beside the wardrobe that couldn t be opened due to the lack of space The table just had two chairs because there was no space for a third one even if we booked for 3 guests We couldn t wide open the window thus making the studio even more claustrophobic One day when we came back we found the door of our studio open probably left like that after the daily cleaning , Good location Near the tube and small supermarkets Nice staff 
163412,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, No elevator very compact room We didn t mind this though and I m merely putting these tings down in case others will have a problem with that However on the day of checkout they tried to charge us an additional 15 for early check in on the day of arrival They claimed we checked in 1 5 hours before we actually did which simply wasn t true I explained that it wasn t right and we didn t have to pay in the end Still it needs to be addressed here in the review Make a note of your check in time , Clean room and bathroom Comfy bed 
163413,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, A bit of cushioning on corridor doors A bit noisy when people coming in out Lack of car parking that s London , Cleanliness Couldn t fault the spotless room All basics ie tea coffee milk kettle table and basic utensils for snacking etc Quiet room at rear Closeness to Manor Underground Stn Staff All pleasant 
163414,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Upon checkout the lady tried to charge us 4 50 for what we thought were complimentary drinks left in the fridge when we arrived She said it was in the guest book but they left no guestroom So be aware unless you want to pay for the drinks they leave in the fridge for you when you arrive don t drink it leave it as it us and bring your own , The room was so comfy and the staff were really friendly 
163415,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Shower didn t work sink was blocked curtains were so thin the room got flooded with light far too early and the staff walked in to the room at 8am 3 hours before checkout time , Walking distance from station and restaurants
163416,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, angle of tv difficult to watch Should have bath mats shower very slippery , everything Bed very comfortable staff very friendly room had everything very clean 
163417,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, The only thing was the room smelled of cat litter and the breakfast wasn t worth the money we payed For four of us we we re given two bowls of cereal four apples four pieces of bread and four glasses of apple juice with two yogurts No way near enough to fill us up and we all payed 8 each for it , Staff we re excellent and our apartment was lovely and spacious 
163418,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Stuffy little rooms I believe an entire overhaul is required to bring the place up to an acceptable standard Cleanliness wise then maintain this standard ongoing , Friendliness and helpfulness of staff
163419,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, The safe wasn t working The staff promised to fix it but never happened , Has little kitchen with all facilities to cook hot meal in the cold weather 
163420,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Only 2 minor quarrels really there was no iron facilities when states on website there would be Also the beds and towels weren t changed made after the 1st night , Very close to the tube and the staff were very nice and friendly The apartment we had to was very big and spacious 
163421,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, On arrival we couldn t check in as even though we put the guest name as different to the name on my booking com account they had to cancel the booking and rebook in the new name, The room and location were fine
163422,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Not really a good location for the money i paid I stayed in location closer to the city and paid less Loud neighborhood Mattress too hard for my liking , Staff 
163423,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, It s not too easy getting cases and baseball gear etc to the top of the second floor with windy staircases but we managed it For anyone who is perhaps not as fit or is incapacitated in anyway you may want to ask for a lower floor , For us the location and price were excellent We play baseball for London Mets whose field is directly across the road so stating regularly means we need vfm So the location is great as I could eat my continental breakfast whilst watching the baseball out of the window The room was good for a mum and two boys It has a double and a sofa bed both of which were very comfy The kitchen area had everything we needed and as Sainsbury s is only round the corner we were able to easily stock up on milk and cereal etc so the boys could eat early The room did smell a little musty when we first arrived but after an hour or so with the window open it soon went 
163424,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, I bit noisy at night when we were trying to sleep with people talking loudly in the corridors and at reception , I liked the 24 hour reception service The staff were very friendly and always happy to help with all enquiries The appartment had a well equipped kitchen 
163425,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, a bit noisy because close road but it was OK , Good location 8min walk to Manor House station Staff very very friendly and helpful Luggage deposit for free There is a park across the road and a lot of shops including a large Sainsbury just about 5 mins walk away Kitchen fridge microwave oven in the room very convenient Room is tidy and clean Do recommend to family stay or business traveller 
163426,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, It was noisy from the traffic The heating in the rom was timed in correctly either too hot or too cold Didn t like the bed against the wall , The staff were really pleasant any issues we had they did accommodate I was disappointed with the overall stay though 
163427,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, I had some trouble shutting down the CV brcame too warm , If you ate visiting a football match of either Tot Hotspurs or Arsenal this is nice place to stay Next to that by underground subway you can get to Piccadilly Circus very fast and easy I would recommend this place for young couples individuals city hoppers and travelers who are looking for an easy one night stay 
163428,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments,No Negative, Without a doubt one of the favorite hotels I stayed during my time in London Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the staff The staff were extremely friendly and helpful The hotel has a warm personality feel to it Great quirky decorations throughout The bed was so comfortable you just do not want to get out of it Very clean throughout Will defiantly stay here again The kids also loved the free sweets 
163429,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Not much , Fantastic place Easy to go to east and west london and much cheaper than those in town Very cool place with good facilities and superb warm staff Highly recommended to all 
163430,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Toilet and shower area was very small , Close to Manor House tube station and also No 29 bus route which can take you right to Trafalgar Sq I also liked being close to the Turkish area with restaurants and great shops for fruit etc 
163431,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Room very cramped Does it really need a cooker and hob Hard for 2 people to negotiate round each other No curtains on the window , Staff lovely good location good public transport
163432,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, The room is a bit too small for four adults , The location was great Very close to the supermarket Sainsburys and Manor House tube station Staff were very nice friendly and helpful There was a loud group of guests on the second day we were there but the situation was settled quickly and the hotel gave us a cake as an apology 
163433,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, I had trouble with noise one night but that was resolved very well , Really liked the staff Friendly personable and ready to help I work all over the world and the personal service was very good

163435,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Main road only parking close by was 2 50 per hour Had to park 2 miles away at a park and ride and get a taxi to and from car Later told by general manager that he had parking we could have used Would have been great if that info was available to us on check in before we wasted hours and Single glazed Windows very noisy and difficult to regulate temperature Shower is a shower tap needed some tlc as it leaked from the tap and spayed water all over the floor After a change in who was staying I requested a change to a twin room from a double and paid 20 extra to get a family room This consisted of a double bed and a couch bed We ended up sharing the double bed anyway as the couch bed kept tipping over when he turned in his sleep Result was no sleep and despite having booked for two nights we checked out in the morning unable to stay another night We were offered a discount on our next stay but no refund So about 180 spent on 1 night of no sleep plus the parking and taxis Should have just spent the 200 on a room at a chain hotel In short a really expensive mistake , Close to where we needed to be Staff were very nice polite and welcoming 
163436,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Kitchen utensils were not very well clean when we get in to the apartment and mattress was not comfortable , Staff friendly and hotel very good located

163439,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Thought I d got a really good deal through Booking com and got a few nights at a great price wrong I wouldn t call it a hotel but more a bed sit bed cooker microwave fridge table and TV I was not happy at all with the price I paid and would have been furious if i I had paid any where near the supposedly 140 a night Uncomfortable old bed with thin duvet and paper thin pillows Drafty windows and door , Well the photographers obviously very good 
163440,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Bed very poor Mattress is a nightmare Totally worn You ll place your body directly on the springs Very sad as this is a key feature for a nice hotel stay Even with good will this fact is devaluing the hotel entirely , Room has good size bathroom okay all inventory in good working order Plenty of storage Staff super friendly 
163441,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, We had to pay a deposit of 50 for just in case we loose the key Although I ve stayed in central and big hotels in London I ve never heard such a policy I think the hotel in general doesn t justify its value for money , It was clean and close to the tube station
163442,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, No bad impressions , I really liked the proximity to bus and tube stations as well as to a park and a supermarket It was very warm in the room the bed was cozy and the kitchenette was just what we needed to feel like home 
163443,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Right next to fire exit that was used for people to go out for a smoke Woken up several times through the night with voices and slamming doors , Very clean had cooker fridge and microwave
163444,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, The hotel is Awful it is not a hotel actually Its only a villa with some rooms divided inside and they are very very small no telephone inside no restaurants too much noisy they don t have elevator the stairs are scary too much light in the rooms the curtains very old They wanted to charge me 10pounds for each hour late my last day and the guest relation executive was very rude I have asked for the General manager they said that they don t have any general manager I was really chocked Anyways what I suggest is to remove hotel from the website and just say it is furnished small apartment This would be better and remove those fake pictures on their website because this is not true at all the rooms are not the same of the one on the website This is a shame to betray people , Nothing 
163445,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Nothing , Seriously wonderful staff very friendly and helpful Rooms are clean and self contained with very good mini kitchens Close to tube station park corner shop and really good pub I really would not consider going anywhere else for future trips to London 
163446,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, the shower hasn t been working as it should killingly hot water an issue was though fixed but in total it took 4 days out of 8 days of my stay the hotel is on it s rennovation extencion phase and if you are comming there for leisure get ready to workers being noise while they work once they even asked me about a favour to open the door so they could plug their perforator into the socket of my room to say i was shocked is to say nothing i was terrified , the staff was friendly and supportive i had apartment with a kitchen so could make my own breakfasts Sntsburry is not far from the hotel the hotel owner brought me a B Day card and flowers in my birthday wasn t expecting that made my day underground station is veeeery close Finsb park is close for all those who love morning run jogging
163447,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Description of the room provided by Booking com was misleading was supposed to be a one bedroom and in fact it was a studio with separate kitchen and bathroom squeezed into the room space itself with four beds two portable That ruined our stay for us and our friends with child By no means four stars but the price was like from four stars accommodation , Very friendly staff very apologetic for any issues and trying to resolve ASAP Problems with locking room

163464,United Lodge Hotel and Apartments, Avoid Room 18 because of the noisy reception During the day it s ok but I was woken up at 5am by the noisy people on reception chatting very loudly in the corridor Why there are two people on reception at that time I don t know but could they not chat in their reception room maintain some quiet in the corridors To be woken up by noisy staff at such an early hour is a bit of a let down , The small rooms are good if you re a single occupant but you might want a larger room if you re a couple Comfortable bed clean nice kitchenette Good location to supermarket and tube
