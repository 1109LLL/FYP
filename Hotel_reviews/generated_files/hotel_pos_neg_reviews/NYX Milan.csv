410102,NYX Milan, I don t like that they take deposit or put hold on the credit card when you check in Breakfast not included in the basic price The room is small and the bathroom door is very close to the bed , Good location couple of minutes waking to the central station Comfortable bed Clean room Very good TV channels never seen these paid channels in any other 4 stars hotel in Italy Good sound isolation
410103,NYX Milan, The coffee may not have been the best and I only mention this because it is Italy and I d expect more But it was alright and served its purpose The sky terrace bar was not open but the bar in the lobby was nice , The hotel has a great location right next to the Central Station You can actually see the CS from the rooms which also provides a nice view The hotel is calm and quiet we could not hear any noise from other rooms nor from outside The rooms are spacious enough maybe on the smaller side but include everything you could need and are very well organized I loved how they left a welcome note from the management and a cookie Rooms come with great beds very comfy so it s really a great place to get a good night sleep when traveling The bathrooms are well equipped everything worked perfectly nice shower good and very clean towels soap etc included The whole hotel and the rooms are extremely clean they pay special attention to little details everywhere which was highly appreciated and made our stay more special The staff is incredible thanks to all who have booked restaurants and taxis for us given us advice and offered help well beyond their jobs I ve notices comments complaining about the stairs at the entrance of the hotel there was always someone there to help us carry all of our luggage and they were also extremely friendly all the time The hotel has many lifts and they rarely get crowded The breakfast is good beyond average with something for everyone You can find interesting things and combinations Special mention has to be given to the muesli station well done In the evenings they have cocktail hours with free appetizers in the lobby bar Definitely a hotel where I plan to return for another holiday 
410104,NYX Milan, Most of the hotel staff were very friendly but the waitress at the hotel bar was very poor I would have to ask twice for a coffee wait 15 minutes for the coffee to be made even when there were no other customers and the waitress was not busy then I would have to wait another 15 minutes for the same waitress to take my money even after asking for the bill She was definitely making things purposely difficult This made me stop going to the hotel bar There were pickpockets and thieves operating near the hotel My mobile phone was stolen from inside a restaurant near the hotel ,No Positive
410105,NYX Milan, Actually tv channels could be more international , The view was great Also 3 minutes walk from central train station Room decoration was also excellent 
410106,NYX Milan, Noise from the restaurant and no view from the window, Brand New stylish hotel in an excellent location very close to central station Friendly and helpful staff 
410107,NYX Milan, A very minor thing I m pretty sure the shampoo offered is just body wash Would reccomend bringing your own if possible , The hotel is very quirky and extremely clean Our room was a good size and the bed was very comfortable Also it was nice to have a TV with lots of channels in English 
410108,NYX Milan,No Negative, The fact that the hotel is right in front of the central train station is the best thing It is very very nice and staff are very friendly and helpful Reception downstairs always helped us with the necessary It has a very nice comfortable relaxing lounge area a bit expensive to buy your drinks from there but overall it was great and convenient would book again
410109,NYX Milan, Nothing, Great modern hotel very close to Milan Central station Chic rooms great service from the reception 2 minutes from the station subway wouldn t stay any where else now when in Milan 
410110,NYX Milan, Nothing, Very stylishly equipped room with everything that you can be needed very clean and comfortable Also I d like to thank the staff at a reception for the room upgrade It worth noting an amazing relax zone as well On the whole there s a good impression from the hotel so we can advise this hotel to everyone 
410111,NYX Milan, we requested for the complete invoice as I stayed there from Jul 2 tii 19 and my invoice covered only till Jul 14 I called them twice and sent several emails till now no response, location was good
410112,NYX Milan, House keeping making too much noise in the hallways in the morning , Great location to the station Nice staff Funky art Great room design quality 
410113,NYX Milan, Nothing, It is near milano train station and modern hotel Mid Strong wi fi They also provide a kettle which is a good thing I recommend everybody to stay in this hotel 
410114,NYX Milan,No Negative, All staff we encountered were extremely nice helpful and handled needs quickly The room was clean and new And the location across the street from the train station makes it a great area for acceibility to Milan and regional train transportation It s also very sexy but comfortable bar and lounging area 
410115,NYX Milan, We ve got one big bed instead of two single beds we ve booked , The hotel atmosphere is fantastic Nice garden with comfortable cusions A diverse breakfast ice cream cake gummy bears Afternoon snack on the bar for free Very good location few meters from the train station with shops and subway 2 stations to the Dome 
410116,NYX Milan,No Negative, Avant Garde I loved every single thing about this hotel We stayed there for only one night but it would take me a whole page to describe it The best lounging spaces ever Fatboys laying on the grass at night to hang out with your drink two amazing terraces classy restaurant a super modern bar with rocking chairs and design couches The bed was oh so comfortable and the buffet breakfast was unforgetable and this is difficult because I try to go gluten free which is usually a nightmare in Italy What really worked perfectly for us was the location Just across the street from the train station Milano Centrale you arrive with the train and don t even need a taxi Them from there you take the subway to go to the Cathedral and all the shopping mecca s in Milan and also from the same station you catch the train to the airport no taxis no hustle 
410117,NYX Milan, Unfortunately during our stay we called reception to ask whether the snacks in the room were complimentary and we were told yes Perhaps there was some sort of miscommunication as in the days following our departure I received an email with a charge of 20 Euros I explained the situation and I would have expected that upon describing the situation the fee would be waived out of goodwill It was not Additionally there is a large number of stairs that you have to lug your luggage up to get into the hotel , Convenient location rooms are clean but ours was hard to reach 
410118,NYX Milan,No Negative, Me and my friend who are both students stayed here for 1 night The hotel is nice clean and modern It offers good facilities great breakfast and decent rooms Me and my friend got back to our room late after a long night in the city This is when we noticed that our air con did not work Along with the heat our room was also placed close to the ground facing the central station This meant that all the trams that went past the hotel would make extremely loud noises as well as give a shaking sensation to our room which made it hard to sleep We would have asked for a new room if we would have noticed these flaws earlier but decided to just go with it and try to catch some sleep
410119,NYX Milan,No Negative, Very cool quirky hotel All the artwork was amazing and the general atmosphere was great Ideal location literally 2 minutes away from the train station and transport links Staff were all very friendly and attentive 
410120,NYX Milan, Locals have told us it s a dodgy area and to be aware of pickpocketing We didn t find any nice restaurants in the area but they are only a few minutes away with public transport , Modern and clean Great breakfast buffet Friendly staff Nice lounge area Good location for public transport 
410121,NYX Milan, The staff could be nicer and more attentive specially the receptionists that were rude during our check in and check out Furthermore we forgot a charger in the room and when we called the hotel to search for changer they said that we had to send an email that they took more than 2 days to answer saying they did not find it Two days later they send us an email saying that they had found it The price is too high and the restaurant is more like a bar with very few options , The hotel is great very clean and the rooms are extremely comfortable 
410122,NYX Milan, Tram was quite loud very time it passed by remember to wear earplugs if you are a light sleeper Overall it s a good hotel the only thing made me a bit uncomfortable is the lady at reception forgot her name was pretty rude when I checked in no smile fine no greeting fine questioned me that if I was checked in earlier already fine she just gave me the key card and kept talking on phone didn t tell me if it s done didn t even look at me and answer my questions rude , Location is great only 3 mins walk from central train station easy to get anywhere Room is new and clean bed is comfortable 
410123,NYX Milan, Housekeeping were lax bin wasn t emptied left used tea bags in a plastic cup tea cups left uncleaned someone had left a tube of product under the bench and was still there the day we left so no properly cleaned floors Disco music very loud in the bar too loud to sit there The barman Antonio charged 25cents for each ice cube we asked for after the initial glass of ice we received on first day although other bar staff didn t and were very helpful when Antonio wasn t there also no milk in the rooms for tea or coffee , Bed clean and very comfortable shower very good air con very good wi fi good location fabulous 
410124,NYX Milan, Noise We were allocated a room above the bar on the first floor which was extremely noisy and we were unable to rest well at the hotel The room vibrated with the bass of the music which went on past midnight and it also vibrated with every single train and tram that passed by so we were constantly woken up and tired during the trip The front desk was very slow at responding to requests concerning the noise from the bar , Decor and style was great a hotel with personality and good vibes 
410125,NYX Milan,No Negative, The hotel is brand new with a young trendy vibe The young staff is exceptionally friendly and accomodating The location literally across the street from Milano Centrale makes it perfect if you re in transfer We arrived late in the evening walked there from the train station and walked back to the station in the morning to catch our train to lake Como Very smooth We had a late night dinner of fresh salads at the hotel restaurant The bed was comfortable and the room was incredibly quiet Breakfast was adequate We really envoyed the open air lounge and so did our three year old 
410126,NYX Milan, Loud music in the lobby and restaurant nice for young people a bit disturbing to older , A very good location Rooms are nice and clean even though not very big The staff is friendly 
410127,NYX Milan, During our stay the staff knocked the door and came to check the mini bar It s really strange when customers didn t check out yet I also booked this hotel for the rooftop but now is not accessible Maybe the hotel can remind customers before or at least when they are checking in , The location is quite convenient just next to the central railway station where you can also take the airport shuttle 
410128,NYX Milan, Staff Vant remember two times in a row to infor other colleges about staying more days Next day being kuckes out because they arefully booked Not even trieng to find salution arogant and rude , Modern new place Price would be suitable for 4 stars hotel but rooms are not equiped 
410129,NYX Milan, Charging us for things we did not use from the mini bar in the room We were lucky to discover the charge in our credit card one day after check out Booking com helped us negotiate with the management and get the money back The hotel should really check more carefully because that ruined our good impression We are happy it was resolved in the end , Friendly polite and attentive staff Fabio arranged us to have a corner room with an amazing panoramic view The room was brand new spotless comfortable with a nice design Nice overall atmosphere perfect location good breakfast and free luggage storage 
410130,NYX Milan, A package was delivered to the hotel for me a day or two before I arrived with clear instructions to hold the package for me However someone on the staff received the package but did not follow instructions to hold the package and sent the package back to the sender I never received the package I was disappointed that the hotel was not able to follow simple instructions I expected better from this hotel , A package was delivered to the hotel for me a day or two before I arrived with clear instructions to hold the package for me However someone on the staff received the package but did not follow instructions to hold the package for my arrival Instead he sent the package back to the sender and I never received the package I was disappointed that the hotel was not able to follow simple instructions I expected better from this hotel 
410131,NYX Milan, Calling the room service many times at night but no one answer , Brand new design and furnitures The location is very great 2 minutes walk to the Milano central train station few minutes metro to the Duomo The hotel is modern which looks more expensive than it s actual price 
410132,NYX Milan, 1 The room location was much to be desired 440 is located at the far end of the hotel 2 I asked for a queen size bed but was given two single beds put together the bed was comfortable until you fall through the middle which I did and sprained my ankle in the process Especially annoying due the the fact I called the lobby when I entered my room just to express my concern yet they said they think I will enjoy it 3 The shower was very small hardly enough space to turn without hitting your elbow on the glass door or wall 4 Elevator broke but wasn t confirmed fixed before letting the public us it I got stuck on the 4th floor which is weird cause another guy got off at the 2nd floor The elevator was out of service for a couple of days but when it was supposed to be fixed I got trapped inside Luckily it still moved when I pressed the 5th floor button and got out walked the stairway down after that , 1 The location was great just across the street from Milan central station Easy access to the metro and railway 2 Room deco was unique and the mood light in the bathroom was a nice touch 3 Free arcade games in the lobby 4 The coffee machine was great with 4 capsules to chose from 
410133,NYX Milan, First night was a disaster Room on the first floor and they had a disco going on loudly until past midnight apparently that happens very often The room also faces the main road where a tram passes by every 5 minutes and that is like an earthquake throughout the night impossible to get any sleep and very stressful They arranged for me to move to a room higher up on the 4th floor and facing the back the following night so it was ok Wifi is poor There is no password and it resets every 24 hours or so so if your phone is on roaming and the internet resets in the meantime you are in trouble Also the network disappears quite frequently Room service is very poor the menu in the room has old prices and when they give the receipt it has a higher price in it They also charge you an additional 8 on top of the prices quoted in the menu for having it served in the room which is not stated anywhere in the menu itself, Clean and bright hotel Great location very close to Centrale where most tours depart from
410134,NYX Milan, I think NYX is a brand new hotel and it showed in a few ways especially regarding customer service One example It was difficult to get ahold of the front desk over the phone I asked for an iron and the front desk personnel said I needed to check in at the front desk to get clearance to go to an ironing room I went to the front desk and waited and waited and waited I decided to wear something else to dinner Their processes were just a little clunky and lacked a service mindset for their guests , NYX is very hip and was a great one night stay especially since it s across the street from Milano Centrale train station 
410135,NYX Milan, The advertised rooftop areas are almost non existent One of the appliances in my room wasn t working Could use more extra services, Very nice and varied breakfast Nice design and outdoor areas Friendly and quiet staff Fully equipped rooms FREE ARCADE MACHINES
410136,NYX Milan, Two bottles shampoo but no body cleanser same for the next day Seems not a mistake but the routine of hotel Prefer to have one bottle of shampoo and one bottle of body cleaner , Bedding is comfortable Coffee is good Spacious room 
410137,NYX Milan, I requested a quiet room in my booking and got a room over the bar overlooking the tram stop It was noisy the floor was vibrating from the bar and the windows were vibrating from the tram , Beautiful rooms 
410138,NYX Milan, When booking a room I asked for a room with one double bed Upon arrival I got a room with two single beds joined and with separate blankets etc more they tended to split so there was no way to use them as one bed I asked the staff to change the room but it did not happen, Great location friendly staff
410139,NYX Milan, Experience at front desk definitely a 1 star standard Front desk is short staffed with some poorly trained staff who have minimal understanding of customer service I will definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone There have been multiple developments of hotels in Milan in the last few years Pick one of those Would suggest further hospitality training for staff in the future Long wait lines are multiple times during the day and night Bill was not ready upon return to pick up luggage despite giving 3 hours notice Instead of reimbursing the 50euro fee for incidentals that was charged at check in i was informed to wait 10 business days to have that refunded by the bank This is not how incidental charges should work I shouldn t have to follow up with bank to confirm days after the fact especially when no additional charges were incurred during the stay ,No Positive
410140,NYX Milan, Hard to carry big luggage moving up 5 more step when we arrive hotel about 3 00 pm It is bad room layout to remove luggage to the other bedside due to the small space is less than 10 cm from bed to TV bracket , good location
410141,NYX Milan, More staff for check in and check out but it was less than 5 mn wait, beautiful amazing hotel very cool and luxurious at the same time staff very helpful especially the Senegal man called Max
410142,NYX Milan, Check in and Check out took a long time Most of the check in attendants were nice and personable however one Ran not so much We arrived early around noon and couldn t check in until 2PM as we were told that s the standard check in time However when we were checking out around 11AM a couple of days later we saw several people check in and immediately get their room keys I d like to think their rooms just happened to be ready and ours wasn t but when we checked in before we even begin the process we were told we couldn t check in until 2PM or after Though the rooms was nice there were a ton of ants mainly in the bathroom It appears to be an Italy issue or a Milan issue bc we ve seen the same but not as many as at this hotel in other hotels The lighting system in the room seemed a bit complex , Hotel is very close to the central train station which was great Also located near a number of restaurants Room was nice clean and modern The host at the restaurant was THE nicest person we ve met in Italy 
410143,NYX Milan, On the second night I had to change room due to an invasion of ants unusual on the 5th floor of a building The staff were quick to put me into a different room and offered to help with the relocation The internet kept dropping out which is rather irritating The breakfast is poor for this class of hotel I checked it out and decided not to bother Finally the lobby music is far too loud and very obtrusive I could hardly hear the staff on check in and also I decided not to eat in the hotel restaurant because of the loud music , The rooms have a comfortable bed with nice pillows and a good working space The minibar has an interesting variety of snacks The shower works well and does not leak into the room 
410144,NYX Milan,No Negative, The service is good the staffs also very helpful The hotel location is really close to the enteral station The prize is very reasonable Good hotel 
410145,NYX Milan, The breakfast had a good variety in general but was not very tasty the scrambled eggs for example were cold and without any salt , the location was very close to the central station and metro and the room was very clean spacious and nicely decorated 
410146,NYX Milan, Design was not good enough as a brand new hotel details were not so good there is no slipper bed was not so comfortable room was small there was not enough staff for example for store and delivery of luggage I thing that there is better choices in Milan with the same price ,No Positive
410147,NYX Milan, The fact that I never used the minibar yet 2 days after checkout I receive an email stating that I am being ccharge 20euro for using the minibar This seems to be a scam to take more money from their guests ,No Positive
410148,NYX Milan,No Negative, Very convenient location 1min from stazione centrale especially if you want to visit other places by trains Clean room and friendly staff Our room was ready from the time we arrived there 11 00 in the morning 
410149,NYX Milan, Room keys don t work after back to the hotel and need go to the reception to change however only two staffs are on duty and waited for long time for that Our room is on the 1st first floor and can hear the noises from the pub and outside due to the steercars even can feel shake when steercars pass by Not sure whether the rooms of the high floors have same problem anyway I would like to suggest the hotel staffs explain it to the customers in case they want a quiet room to have a good rest , Good location as it is very close to the train station Shower is very comfortable since the water pressure is strong 
410150,NYX Milan, They need to change their cleaning company as they are somewhat inconsistent The linens are not changed when requested or needed Also room service orders were kept outside the room doors in the corridor Mine was kept for 3 days without collection , New Hotel good location and front staff super helpful and friendly Close to the train station so you get easy access to the property from the airport Breakfast is nice lounging areas and bar are decorated in a modern style 
410151,NYX Milan, The room was too small opening the bathroom door while I m still on the bed was very annoying especially they have plenty of space to put the bathroom door right after you enter the room They asked me to leave 50 euros deposit You need to walk at least 15 minutes to reach a good area of restaurants and shops, The best TV channels in Italy Few minutes by walking to central station Modern design good sound isolation Good size bathroom Loved the Arcade game next to the entrance
410152,NYX Milan, The staff was not familliar with the booking over Booking com especially with the payment over PayPal Still they were very friendly while clearing the case ,No Positive
410153,NYX Milan, We got the room on the second floor which was a little noisy at night when there was music playing at the bar just below us The entrance of the hotel had quite a few steps so it is inconvenient for those bringing a lot of luggage Also if you need to iron your clothes you have to go the the ironing room as they do not provide irons in the hotel rooms that was the greatest inconvenience to us , Design of the hotel was unique Location is very near to Stazione Centrale which was very convenient since we could get around by taking the metro Very easy to get to the main shopping area of Duomo Staff were also very friendly and willing to help 
410154,NYX Milan, The golden head artwork has been moved to an exebition in London Cannot took this photo , Uniqe stylish place Hotel bar with DJane great cocktails stylish room fantastic breakfast
410155,NYX Milan, Given the May heatwave its a shame the hotel didn t offer a swimming pool roof bar The music likable funky and deep house dj set or remixed albums was a bit loud in the common areas which perhaps timing seemed to be for no ones benefit with an empty bar The room was soundproofed so I couldn t here this though The air conditioned rooms and bedding was a bit difficult to find the perfect sleeping conditions , The location and decor were contemporary and modern This was a new hip hotel and had a personality that could be seen through the decor Kitch and provocative furniture prints and artworks was a contrast to the outside The room was big bright clean and very well equipped and was able to have family 5 people in the room for a pre dinner drink with ease 
410156,NYX Milan,No Negative, That it is new and I loved it Also very comfortable bed and mattress Pillow and linen sheets very proper to have a good rest Guys the hotel was AMAZING in one word Bravo 
410157,NYX Milan, I was very disappointed because I was given 2 small accessible for persons with disabilities rooms even if I booked 2 Double Rooms with a big double bed The accessible rooms look different they do not have a shower cabin and they have a really small bed I gave the bad grade for the staff because of the persons who managed my booking it is unprofessional to do this without announcing After complaining about this they gave me an upgrade for a suite and a normal double room so they had availability for the rooms I booked , The hotel and the rooms have a very cool design and it is also cozy The room was clean and comfortable The hotel is more for young people because it has loud music with a dj at night we loved it The breakfast was good and also very nice bar to chill at night Great location 2 minutes away from the central station and 10min with the subway to the city center 
410158,NYX Milan, Lobby was loud with a DJ but it was probably great for the younger crowd I did not have a desk in my room , Excellent location in terms of getting out on foot and exploring the city 
410159,NYX Milan,No Negative, Perfect location near central station M and tram to town centre Spacious and comfortable room and bathroom very clean Helpful staff good service Couldn t find anything to complain about 
410160,NYX Milan, someone interrupted me while im in the middle of a call to tell me its not allowed to stay in the terrace of the 5th floor Even though the Elevator have a sign for all the terraces on the 5th 6th floor and on the roof which means its public are for residentes, location room size
410161,NYX Milan, The reciption area was very loud with music No help with carrying the lugguage They dont provide an iron in the room you have to leave your room go to reciption sign a paper take a key and go to an ironing room The wifi is weak The hotel doesnt offer free parking they would charge 36 a day to park your car or you have to find a spot on the street or near by parking buildings which charge 25 a day, The size of the room and the cleanliness The location was fantastic
410162,NYX Milan, It took a while to get checked in Beds were a little stiff , The room was very nice the shower and bathroom were great The staff were very nice and helpful 
410163,NYX Milan,No Negative, This hotel is Gorgeous the rooms are big and modern Do not look anywhere else this an excellent option if you are staying in central Milan This hotel deserves a perfect 10 
410164,NYX Milan, I paid a higher rate with booking com compared to the one via the hotel link as tet offer 10 discount with the member card , It s a brand new hotel wth modern and new interiors and it s 1min walk from the main station 
410165,NYX Milan, I think its quite unpractical to have to bring your luggage into the hotel via stairs of course you can leave it outside and ask staff for help but I didnt like the idea of leaving a suitcase outside unattended I saw some half drunk people walking in the neighbourhood , The hotel is close to the central station and Metro
410166,NYX Milan,No Negative, Excellent in every way Brand new hotel right next to the Milan central station so easy to get to when arriving by train Ambience in bar restaurant and room was great Service with a smile Great cocktails too Will recommend to friends and family travelling to Milan 
410167,NYX Milan, No HEAT Was told they turn off the heat for summer The first week of May is not summer Room was very cold wore sweaters and coat to bed , Great location friendly staff
410168,NYX Milan, Room temperature Controlled centrally I believe however we asked for extra bedding it was there within minutes You can also ask for slippers dressing gowns , Vegan friendly with options for breakfast dinner Smart quirky great views of the Alps from higher rooms terraces Very friendly staff Comfy beds Nespresso coffee machine Just perfect for me my daughter
410169,NYX Milan, Nice good bathroom but cold floor couldn t find any heating options no for towels nor for the floor, Extremely helpful staff good English Perfect cocktails at lobby bar amazing view from our room we were on the top floor
410170,NYX Milan, I think you should do something about the noisy Air con Not an issue yet but in the summer guests will start to complain , I was really impressed and in all aspects it exceeded my expectations Well done I m rarely this kind in my reviews The Bar is also super funky and such great staff 
410171,NYX Milan, To start with Entrance is HORRIBLE specially if you are a girl carrying huge bags there is no one to help you with your bags and the entrance are all stairs which makes it a nightmare to carry ur heavy bags all the way up Then Breakfast Nothing hot is severed VERY LIMITED they have bread and cheese and some cold cut meats Nothing else Bed size is really small for two Oh It was my birthday they didn t even bother to send a card or anything complementary even though i mentioned earlier that it will be my birthday too expensive for what you get and treats you like a 3 stars hotel or LESS, Location and design 
410172,NYX Milan, The coffee at the breakfast buffet was poor for Italy from a pretty bad machine , The location is brilliant if you travel with the train anf also for public transport 
410173,NYX Milan, I didn t like the beds they were very uncomfortable the tons were lovely clean new but the beds were really disappointed they felt like a hostel bed , I like the location right across the street from central station it was convenient to get to the airport 
410174,NYX Milan, Fake 4 stars Small Room No loyalty understanding by staff I am a business travel that said could become a regular if satisfied since they just opened I was given a crazy small room with no view leafs If you are looking for an expensive 3 stars with fake design is the place you are looking for , Nothing
410175,NYX Milan,No Negative, Interesting and fun decor easy to find from central station comfortable room finger food served with drinks at the bar lots of choice at breakfast helpful reception staff
410176,NYX Milan, It s very difficult to open the doors to the room the keys don t work properly , Amazing rooms very clean and new The atmosphere of the whole hotel is amazing
410177,NYX Milan, We had no information that at the end of our stay Milano city tax will be charged and in this case around 40 eur for 2 ppl 3 day Also upon our arrival check in they block from our credit card 100 eur and at the end of the stay no matter they already blocked 100 eur they made you pay for additional costs the blocked amount stayed blocked for next 10 to 15 days even thought receptionist said it will be directly unblocked the same moment after he uses the same card very very bad system and unfair for guests , Staff that work at the bar I find very friendly while those at reception are not so welcoming Rooms are clean and location is perfect 
410178,NYX Milan, The staff made silly mistakes First we were charged a wrong amount of deposit a lot higher than it should be Then during the 3 nights of our stay the key cards failed to open the door twice which appears that they registered the duration of the key cards wrongly Even though all these problems were fixed later a bad impression was left ,No Positive
410179,NYX Milan, Rooms little small Its not suitable for a family with kids Naked decoration No one can help you with your bags You have to use the stairs which was almost 10 stairs to get into the hotel with your bags We were only 2 women reception told me that i have to help my self with my lagguage x x, The view from my room was super Direct to the central station of milan Every floor has a private terrace 
410180,NYX Milan, Nothing , We are lucky the room upgarded to suite room Wifi network is strong Hotel design is modern room is clean Location is good near Milano Centrale station just 5mins by walk Service is good We will stay here again when we come to Milan 
410181,NYX Milan, Everything was perfect there was nothing I didn t like probably one of the best budget hotels I ve ever Stayed in and so contemporary , The staff were so accommodating and welcoming we had arrived early after a long flight and they made a room available for us straight away as our assigned room was not ready this was so nice as all we wanted was a shower and to Freshen up before heading out again to explore the city Excellent customer service 10 10 to Fabio at concierge
410182,NYX Milan, No iron and iron table available Restaurant very expensive and overrated, Great location and next to central station Very clean and new hotel Comfortable beds
410183,NYX Milan, The housekeeping is falling off the normal standard We stayed there 3 nights and found out there was something missing every night foot towel small towel etc Moreover there was no directory at the phone We wanted to call for the missing towel but didn t know which number to dial We tried dial 0 but nobody picked up the phone It s weird for this class of hotel , The location of the hotel is very good It s just next to the Milan Central station making convenient to travel by train and metro 
410184,NYX Milan, Nothing immediately comes to mind , For restaurants we were there for a very short turn around So we did not go to restaurants The bar in the hotel was lovely nice service and staff tasty drinks and light snacks The location to the train station was perfect for 0645 departure Coordinating with Blacklane for transportation to and from concert for the location was perfect I would absolutely stay again 
410185,NYX Milan, No luggage friendly entrance ice cold floor can easily get sick which I did Inadequatly expensive dinner in hotel s restaurant no wonder we were the only people there , Good location near train station and metro station Hotel has a very outrageous interior design D you ll definitely like it want to take a walk through the hotel to explore it Staff is nice room is clean
