82333,Best Western Premier Op ra Opal, Bonjour I have no complaints Had a lovely stay Merci , Loved the location very clean and more than enough shops and bistros and cafes on the doorstep Various metro stations within a minutes walk The hotel staff very friendly The room was sound proof and slept well clean clean clean Not only the hotel but the whole area 
82334,Best Western Premier Op ra Opal, Room was not ready when arrived at 2pm or even when returned at 5 30pm Basic breakfast with limited choice Basic facilities , Great location with very helpful staff 
82335,Best Western Premier Op ra Opal, Nothing naught nil zip nada, I tested the bed on arrival and had to get off as it almost demanded I went to sleep as it was SOOOOO comfortable The hotel is lovely in a superb location for exploring Paris the staff have been super friendly helpful and even appreciative of my petite French 
82336,Best Western Premier Op ra Opal, I know it s Paris but room is small and price during my stay was a bit too high, Safe and strategic location Super helpful and knowledgeable staff New Clean 
82337,Best Western Premier Op ra Opal, But it is a very small hotel especially the reception area From the road it doesn t seem like an hotel , The room was clean and staff are helpful Easy access to many restaurants w shops nearby in the area 
82338,Best Western Premier Op ra Opal, Could hear noise from nearby construction site and subway Room was very small Be careful when you drink water the hotel privides They put two water bottles in the fridge but only one bottle throughout your stay is free , One of our rooms were upgraded The hotel privided little snacks in the lobby area The hotel is near restaurants and stores 
82339,Best Western Premier Op ra Opal, The hotel is really small not the room itself but everything else the frontdesk the lift etc The hairdryer in the bathroom looks like a vaccum The personnel give you the minimum information The girls at the front desk smiles to you and everything but it look fake I come back to the hotel one night at 22h30 and the front door was locked no body at the front desk and no phone or place to put my room key in order to open the door I waited outside looking for something to open the door or call someone Finally someone came up after 20 min and opened me the door , Great location The room was clean confortable and not too small for an hotel room in Paris It has all you need for a nice hotel near the touristics attraction in Paris 
82340,Best Western Premier Op ra Opal, During the checkout we have paid the city tax in cash After 2 hours the hotel charged the city tax again from my debit card and it took 2 weeks to refund , Perfect location close to Madeleine and metro station It is also possible to have a short walk to Place de la Concorde You are in the middle of the Paris center very shortly great Clean and quiet room 
82341,Best Western Premier Op ra Opal, The poor receptionist was run off her feet when we arrived We had to wait which we didn t mind but we only ever saw a single member of staff working no wonder she was so busy , The hotel was very quiet despite being on a busy road Bathroom facilities were very good a shower can make or break a hotel for me 
82342,Best Western Premier Op ra Opal, All staff was very nice except for the one short little gal at the front desk RUDE We arraigned for transportation several days before we had to leave the day we left we waited outside in front of the hotel taxi was late so husband went in to ask about taxi and she said we weren t standing in the right spot Um sorry the width of the building is the door Where do you want us to stand A ways seemed like we were bothering here if we had a question Other than here everyone was great Oh the elevator lift was so tiny Sounded like a train or subway every time it was in use , Bed was very comfy pillows absolutely were not 
82343,Best Western Premier Op ra Opal, The breakfast wasn t included and we found that it was too expensive 19 euros each to eat there , Our room was very nice and modern The view was in front on Tronchet street Just Wow We really enjoyed staying in this hotel 
82344,Best Western Premier Op ra Opal, Nothing Everything was great , The hotel was nicely decorated From the moment we stepped in we were wow ed by the lush red black decoration The breakfast area was simple clean with a good choice of spread 
82345,Best Western Premier Op ra Opal, the electric kettle wasnt functioning too well keeps on boiling despite it reaches the boiling point n i had asked the reception in the morning to replace one for me when i returned to the room in the evening the kettle had been taken away but no replacement was made followed up with the reception n they told me that no replacement is available actually this surprised me a bit i therefore requested them to bring back the original one so that i can continue to have hot water in the room n they said they will try to find it but at the end they didnt bring it back to me nor revert to me even if they couldnt find it , excellent location staffs are generally nice
82346,Best Western Premier Op ra Opal, Really large bath which had jets but they didn t work or we couldn t work out how to make them work Also there was no shower only an extendable shower head attached but not the most practical for a city break could have done with a shower , Upgraded to a suite on the top floor lovely large room with great views Close to the metro and loads of cafes Free sweets in the bar All for 100 
82347,Best Western Premier Op ra Opal, Hotel is tiny and would be difficult to live in if you are a couple with several suitcases There is also some noise during the day , The closeness to everything from Printemps to the Madeleine square and other shops and variety of restaurants around the hotel 
82348,Best Western Premier Op ra Opal, traffic noise from the street breakfast is very basic for buffet breakfast we came at 10 00 breakfast served till 10 30 and had to wait to get supplies available as almost all plates were empty , Location quality of rooms people at reception were nice and helpful
82349,Best Western Premier Op ra Opal, They take a hold fee of 50 incase you take anything from the minibar nothing taken from the minibar and still waiting for the money to be be put back into my account they said it would be back in yesterday afternoon , Very modern room bathroom Very comfy bed Very helpful polite staff Good value for money Great location not far from Eiffel Tower or Disneyland
82350,Best Western Premier Op ra Opal, Breakfast are overpriced We was eating att Caffe next side of the street there was nice and way cheaper , Caffe machine make up table LED mirror lights bathtub big windows to the street Small things that made to feel uss like home Room was spacy and clean Bed really comfy We could take care regulate of our room temparature what was really nice

82352,Best Western Premier Op ra Opal, Hotel lobby and elevator too small and a bit disappointing at first and breakfast area underground so didn t have breakfast at the hotel although I was looking forward for a daily nice Parisian breakfast in the hotel Overpriced for the above reasons, Perfectly located and walking distance away from the main shopping area and the main attractions in Paris and 2minutes walk from the metro station Room space is quite good cleanliness bed comfort and great WIFI

82355,Best Western Premier Op ra Opal, the elevator was out of order for 7 days during my stay which was quite inconvenient specially that our rooms were on the 5th floor also the housekeeping service standard was inconsistent , all of the front desk team without exception are outstanding helpful and professional the night receptionist on the day of departure was quite helpful and he took our many pieces of heavy luggage down the stairs from the 5th floor when the elevator was out of order the location is superb the hotel manager reacted positively by sending us sweets and an apology note when we complained about the housekeeping services the size of the rooms is very good as compared to the usual size of rooms in Paris
