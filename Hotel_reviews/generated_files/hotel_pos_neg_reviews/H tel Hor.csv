63612,H tel Hor, The wifi wasn t that great It kept getting disconnected and wouldn t work half the time , You can get coffee tea or hot chocolate whenever you want to free of cost The location is excellent They have luggage storage facilities and a place to relax in case you have to check out early 
63613,H tel Hor, Nothing, nearly across the street from Gare du Nord but with soundproof windows and super comfortable beds The room was generous for Paris with a very large and modern bathroom The whole place is modern and very well designed Staff was extra gracious to us speaking English and the whole experience which was really only a stop over became a highlight of our whole European trip 
63614,H tel Hor, All was very well done great stay, Wonderful staff clean delightful breaky close to train stations close to some nice dining umbrellas at front door useful and very accommodating team Would recommend 
63615,H tel Hor, The location was ideal for Gare du Nord but right next to two sex shops depends what you re after I suppose , All 3 receptionists that we spoke to were extremely friendly polite and helpful a real credit to the hotel 
63616,H tel Hor, Even though hotel is located 3 min from the main train station I was highly diasappointed with the area I know it s not their fault but the smell of urine outside was unbelievable Needed to block ours noses What s more on a way back to the hotel late in the evening we did not feel safe due to a number of dodgy people on the street trying to get our attention Thus the hotel itself is nice however once you step outside of it this feeling changes automatically Another thing the rooms are a bit overpriced for the standard they offer They are very tiny with dirty walls , Staff were helpful and very polite We felt really welcomed and had good time at the reception and while having breakfast thanks to their hospitality 
63617,H tel Hor, My check out didnt go very smoothly and in the process the woman was very rude , Comfy room with nice view of the garden The male staff were great and friendly 
63618,H tel Hor,No Negative, This hotel was a great place for a quick trip to Paris Great Location Staff was very helpful Loved the courtyard and free beer I plan to stay here again the next time I am in Paris 
63619,H tel Hor,No Negative, Great Hotel for a short term stay Across the road from Gare Du Nord A fantastic hotel spacious clean friendly staff and easily located for those coming in via Eurostar Although the area it s located is very seedy everything else was great 
63620,H tel Hor, Keep in mind that the hotel is adjacent to a large railway station at the heart of Paris and the streets may be active sirens loud vehicles and people even in the small hours of the night Do not forget to bring earplugs , The location is excellent for access to the Gare du Nord for the Metro and Eurostar The staff were all very nice and I especially appreciate their being so understanding when my tour changed its schedule unexpectedly and I had to change the dates I was planning to stay here My room was quite comfortable Bless you for having a kettle in the room after staying at two other French hotels that didn t have this amenity I was delighted to be able to make a cup of tea again 
63621,H tel Hor, No room service The reception ordered a pizza for me and I had to pick it up at the reception desk 4 stars no room service The area where the hotel is located looks quite dangerous, Rooms were quite nice
63622,H tel Hor,No Negative, On arrival we asked for an ice bucket so that we could chill a bottle of champagne The friendly young receptionist suggested that he put it in a fridge and serve in the courtyard garden when our friends arrived This he did and there was no corkage charge He also recommended an excellent restaurant nearby and secured us a 10 discount We loved our bird s eye view of seven Parisian streets from our tiny balcony 
63623,H tel Hor, WIFI was sometimes off in the room , The amabilty of the employees has been so special and rare for Paris The bar with biers and wine good prics good choice The saloon with TV and external terrasse 
63624,H tel Hor, sink is design but not confortable, The Staff is really a plus of this hotel nice cosy clean and confortable in the train station area recently renewed so everything is brand new I actually returned already Easy to go anywhere with public transportation
63625,H tel Hor, The standard rooms at the street side may be a little noisy during the weekends but it didn t really bother us We were tired after a full day of exploring the city so it didn t keep us awake , The beds were very comfortable we loved the rain showers and the interior in general The staff was very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was also good We took the Thalys from Amsterdam to Gare du Nord and it was only a two minute walk to the hotel Just cross the street twice and you re there 
63626,H tel Hor, Neighborhood not so desireable which is usually the case when you re that close to main train station Not a great area to enjoy a nice walk outside the hotel , Clean size of room staff friendly and helpful quality of linens Nice courtyard although we didn t have time to enjoy Very close to gare du nord station 
63627,H tel Hor, Wifi was not working at night Resolved by morning Thin walls , very convenient location from train station Good Vegetarian including Indian cuisine options within walking distance 
63628,H tel Hor, nothing, The hotel is an easy walk from Gard du Nord and an excellent base to get around Paris Very professional staff and the concierge had some great recommendations for places to eat in The boulangerie across the street baked the bread and croissants at breakfast as you d expect in Paris they were excellent Nice hotel good staff great place I ll use it again
63629,H tel Hor, Our room was noisy noise from the street The window insulation could be much better , The close location to the gare the l Est is great Free coffe and tea all day long
63630,H tel Hor, Wifi a bit difficult to access Good support however from the staff to get internet access organised in meeting room , Good location 1 minute from Gare du Nord Good breakfast for Paris eggs fruit smoked salmon a varied offering Small but comfortable room 
63631,H tel Hor, The air conditioning keeps turning off Shower was broken and exteremely noisy, Next to the train station The hotel is well presented Helpful staff Free coffee in the morning
63632,H tel Hor, The area is quite sketchy but as its so close to the stations it was fine for just arriving departing , Close to both Gare du nord and gare du est Clean and comfortable room Friendly front of house staff 
63633,H tel Hor, The bed was a bit too soft for my liking but all in all it was a very nice experience , The rainshower was amazing and towels were big and fluffy The staff was very friendly In addition at the reception they had beautiful black pencils with red stone on the back which were available to be taken 
63634,H tel Hor, Neighborhood a bit seedy Sex shoppe on the same block and several rough characters along the street Hotel was well isolated from street But coming and going from hotel through the street was unpleasant , Convenient to Gare du Nord Very helpful and friendly staff All staff members were extremely helpful and very nice 
63635,H tel Hor, The location absolutely dreadful I wish it werent the case because the hotel itself is like an oasis in what is pretty much not a pleasant neighborhood , Coffee is strong breakfast was lovely staff are so friendly and helpful 
63636,H tel Hor, the rooms are small , The reception staff are extrememy helpful and friendly The location is perfect for Eurostar The rooms are smamm but cosy ask for one on the inside away from the road 
63637,H tel Hor, Room smelled of weed on the evening as we came back, Very close to gare du nord very friendly personnel and the bathrooms and showers are new and awesome
63638,H tel Hor, as it is across gare du nord it can get very noisy I was assigned a room on the first floor and I could hear people from outside talking shouting , very friendly people at the front desk comfy beds very clean nice showers fast internet 
63639,H tel Hor, room was dusty had a courtyard facing room which I expect would be noisy in summer if you wanted the window open There was a persistent knocking noise in the room like someone putting a cup down on a wooden surface Thought it was a noisy neighbour but it didn t stop for two days It wasn t constant just enough to be annoying , Pleasant staff breakfast wasn t bad bed comfy shower good easy to find 
63640,H tel Hor,No Negative, Excellent Rooms and great Front Desk service Will surely recommend and 2 mins from Gare Du Nord Station Lot of room space being in Paris Loved my stay 
63641,H tel Hor,No Negative, The hotel located just couple of minutes walk from Gare Du Nord station Few minutes walk to Galeries Lafayett the biggest and most luxurious department stores in Paris The Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful Rooms are spacious and clean with enough amenities Price is reasonable and the hotel is value for money There is a small but lovely garden inside the hotel where you can have a cup of tea or coffee which is available always for free of charge Wi Fi is available everywhere and free of charge also 
63642,H tel Hor, Breakfast on the second visit was not as fresh It appeared we had just missed the rush and there was not much of a fresh choice for the English breakfast , Front Desk staff very friendly and helpful 
63643,H tel Hor,No Negative, Staff were very helpful and gave recommendations of where to visit eat The room was clean comfortable and a good size Breakfast was varied coffee which was free throughout our stay was great
63644,H tel Hor, Heating did not work Room was smelly I guess they never open the windows Questionable staff, Location across North station ideal for Eurostar travellers
63645,H tel Hor, For a hotel advertising its showers they should really work as intended Not have a surge of colder water every 8 seconds And by the reaction of the guy at reception that problem is pretty well known , Comfy bed great WLAN 
63646,H tel Hor, Leaving , A wonderful welcome from staff who could not do enough for us throughout our stay Large clean room with long balcony Something a little different design wise Excellent breakfast and lounge area Super quiet room despite location bordering Gare du Nord Even has a mini table tennis table Recommended Oh and the staff were soo lovely 
63647,H tel Hor,No Negative, Location is really good and the staffs are friendly and helpful But we had the bad luck the internet was broken when we stayed in hotel However I still recommend this hotel 
63648,H tel Hor,No Negative, The staff were extremely helpful and friendly Room was very clean and comfortable and the breakfast was delicious Excellent location Highly recommend 
63649,H tel Hor, The neighborhood was not to our liking however it had easy access to public transportation , It was adequate but no frills for sure It was clean and felt safe No breakfast included We stayed there because it was near the train station unfortunately not the right train station for us 
63650,H tel Hor, Not much to improve with the hotel but Paris really needs to up its game regarding the Gare de Nord in terms of cleanliness and the intimidating nature of the area , A great oasis in the middle of the mayhem and scruffiness that is the Gare de Nord area Great staff very helpful and nice breakfast 
63651,H tel Hor, Bed not particularly comfy wifi was not working in the room for our stay , Staff were very friendly and helped us with our navigation around paris and the best views on the places we wished to visit 
63652,H tel Hor,No Negative, It s a great hotel that looks new We had two connecting rooms and though the rooms are small Paris they are nicely furnished and convenient The stuff went out of their way to help in every matter The breakfast was good and in the lobby you have free hot drinks all day long and also some games The hotel is located across the street from a 2 line Metro station and 120 meters from Gare du nord which on one hand is very convenient but not very nice area at night 
63653,H tel Hor, wifi was broken and only possible in the reception area but they were working on it, super friendly personnel clean quiet room even when facing the busy street luxurious breakfast buffet comfortable room
63654,H tel Hor, No WiFi connection during my stay They had some technical problems with it and could get it fixed for days even while they had business guests who require it to carry out their work WiFi was only working in the lobby , Refreshments always available
63655,H tel Hor,No Negative, Friendliness of all the Staff nothing was too much trouble We arrived early and that was no problem 5 minutes walk from the Eurostar Train Terminal making it so conveneient
63656,H tel Hor,No Negative, The thing that sets this hotel apart is the staff Exceptional Friendly helpful professional The facilities are all good pretty standard fare for the hotel class and it could not be more convenient for the Gare du Nord 
63657,H tel Hor, Sketchy neighborhood We never felt unsafe in and around the hotel but this isn t the most fetching area , Amazing staff Exceptionally accommodating The room was clean and well appointed Nice bathroom with generous amenities Comfortable bed Delicious breakfast 
63658,H tel Hor, Noisy, Very friendly and helpful staff Offered to change our room immediately when we said it was noisy Nice breakfast Good to have tea making facilities in rooms and access to refreshments in breakfast area 24 7 
63659,H tel Hor, Breakfast not good value at 13 Euros better to use one of the many cafes in the area Not the nicest area of Paris at night so people of a nervous disposition might not like it , Convenient location for an overnight stay to pick up Euro Star the next day Also for walking to visiting Montmartre Some great Restaurants close by 
63660,H tel Hor,No Negative, Changed my booking from a different well known chain at the last minute and switched to this hotel based on reviews of this property Very glad I did this hotel did not disappoint Service from this hotel staff was exceptional Exceeded all expectations Perfect location for our travel needs room very comfortable clean good value very happy with this hotel Do not hesitate to book 
63661,H tel Hor, The 13 euro breakfast was mediocre , So convenient a less than 5 minute walk from the Gard du Nord dragging 50 lb suitcase engaged friendly service oriented young staff members at the front desk 
63662,H tel Hor, The room was not organized as twin beded which is booked a month before, I had booked twin beded superior room but it was unavailable so given deluxe room with separate bed
63663,H tel Hor, We could not fault Hotel Hor , Hotel Hor was a very short walk from Gare du Nord and easy to find The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room quite comfortable Cleaned to a very high standard and a pleasure to come home to each night 
63664,H tel Hor, Nothing really Room rate a bit pricy but it s Paris after all , Desk staff were very helpful and went out of their way to get us an early checkin and even walked with us to gard nord station to get train tickets Plus super friendly Will make sure to stay with them my next trip to Paris
63665,H tel Hor, A bit of a rough area for a long stay but we were only there one night, very close to the station for the Eurostar and selected for this reason Good restaurant recommendation
63666,H tel Hor,No Negative, I honestly could not fault this beautiful hotel a pure gem From the moment we arrived to the moment we left the staff could not been more helpful Spacious room which we were very surprised with Spotlessly clean with a very comfy bed I have stayed in Paris on many occasions and nothing can compare to this Will definitely be a regular visitor and looking forward to it already 
63667,H tel Hor,No Negative, Convenience of being close to Gare d nord Very pleasant staff and comfortable room with an adequate continental breakfast Even though close to a busy road the room was very quiet and there was good air conditioning We travelled on from Gare de l est which was a 3 minutes walk 
63668,H tel Hor, Hard to fault it the only irritation was the extremely shallow basin , Easy to find from Gare Nord just go out the main exit and look left you can see the Hotel Hor sign Clean and comfortable Good express breakfast Amazingly quiet inside despite being on such a busy street 
63669,H tel Hor, Next door neighbor, The friendly staff allowed us to leave bags there after checkout for two days It is super convenient to the train station and around a lot of restaurants No problem to find food after 10pm The hotel is pretty new and quiet
63670,H tel Hor, There was no bar For a four star hotel I d expect a proper bar There were fridges with drinks available for purchase and consumption in the lounge small garden but this is not the same as a proper bar service , Good location for arrivals at Gare Du Nord Clean modern hotel with friendly staff 
63671,H tel Hor, Not much to criticise really The room was a little cramped so two open suitcases were a bit of a squeeze But if that was the price to pay for a really quiet room it was worth it , Excellent location for Gare du Nord 5 minutes walk Quiet room Double glazing made room very quiet especially overlooking the courtyard AC could be switched off so room was almost silent a bonus for light sleepers Our room was right by the lift but we heard no noise from it during the night Curtains kept out light at night Good choice of food at breakfast Friendly and helpful staff Tea making facilities in the room Very clean 
63672,H tel Hor,No Negative, If you have some suitcases and you arrived by train then Gare du Nord is really 2 minutes walking away The staff is great as always We have been coming here for 5 years now Even mr Halime of the breakfast room welcomes us every year 
63673,H tel Hor, The breakfast choices could have been better but still it was a very good breakfast being tasty and fresh , The area near the Paris Nord train station is not the best in the city However this hotel was an excellent choice and as foreigners unfamiliar with the city we felt very comfortable and safe in this hotel I would most definitely stay there again 
63674,H tel Hor, Nothing all is good , The front office staff is very very friendly and accomodating He makes the welcome atmosphere feel so homey and warm The hotel located just 200 m from Gare du Nord exit not too far for traveller with big luggages The room is somehow bigger than average room size in Paris but not too spacious The room is clean and the wifi works just fine 
63675,H tel Hor,No Negative, My wife and I could not of wanted for more from this Hotel Our first trip to Paris and it was fantastic the staff here were wonderful they couldn t do enough for you friendly very helpful advice on where to eat and how best to use the Metro what direction to go to a place if you wanted to walk they really made our short stay worth while One of the best hotels we have stayed in anywhere 
63676,H tel Hor, The mattress is a bit too soft for me There is a gap in the shower door therefore when you shower it is quite inevitable that you will flood the toilet , The room is nice with a lot of sunlight There are a lot of cafes and restaurants nearby 
63677,H tel Hor, The location wasn t great but little else to complain about, bed was comfy staff were very polite and no hassle over early check in Very close to metro stops and train sations which was very convenient
63678,H tel Hor,No Negative, The bed was really comfortable and the room was well appointed with everything one might need The staff were so helpful and pleasant directing us to an excellent restaurant with a discount and most solicitous of our needs As we were travelling the next day the location close to the Gard du Nord was convenient but even though the streets are lively all night the sound proofing was so effective I wasn t disturbed at all A thoroughly pleasant experience and this is on my short list for staying in Paris in future 
63679,H tel Hor, It was unfortunate that the in room wifi was unavailable during our stay We had to go to the lobby to access the Wifi which was rather inconvenient , The location cleanliness and comfort and the friendly staff Such a nice stay though I wish we d have discovered this place in our earlier stays in Paris 
63680,H tel Hor, We could not connect to the wifi at all Surrounding neighborhood was somewhat sketchy so felt a bit unsafe , The location was excellent Staff were friendly and helpful Rooms were small but cozy and had modern decor and good amenities Shower was good 
63681,H tel Hor, Gare du Nord area can be a bit noisy at night , Excellent proximity to Gare du Nord train station for our journeys on Eurostar to London and Thalys to Holland Late night convenience store next door 
63682,H tel Hor, The hotel was great but we had to park on the street outside for a bit before dropping off our hire car it s a bit of a dodgy area slightly dodgier than at the actual train station But it was fine just a bit off putting when we arrived , It was the last night of our honeymoon and they bumped us up a room level which was very nice of them 
63683,H tel Hor, Area around hotel not nice Many beggars and every second person trying to sell stolen phones Not a very clean area , Friendly and helpful staff Close to main train station of Gare du Nord Comfortable room 
63684,H tel Hor,No Negative, The staff were excellent welcoming helpful and seemed to have a real pride in their establishment and their work The hotel was very clean and comfortable and secure It is perfectly situated for the Gare du Nord though the district around a major station is never going to be the most scenic No evening restaurant but there are plenty locally and some good ones The Hotel Hor has a good ambience a bit of style and is excellent value Recommended 
63685,H tel Hor, They could have a larger menu They only 3 choices so I went for the salad which was about 50 mozzarella balls 10 tomatoes and 2 lettuce leaves Still nice though , Great location very friendly lovely clean and modern rooms Staff couldn t do enough to help 
63686,H tel Hor, Maps and info about the city not offered , Very clean lovely facilities area is not great but close to the gard du nord Great breakfast and nice out side area 
63687,H tel Hor, Wish we could have stayed longer , Habib and Jan were the people we dealt with the most and they were the best Both helped us so much on how to get to different places and where to eat They pretty much had a solution for everything we needed and wanted to see and do I would stay at this hotel everytime we go to Paris 
63688,H tel Hor,No Negative, There was a officer at front office who really went out of his way to help me He took the trouble to explain what I should do in Paris He was amazing His name is Jan
63689,H tel Hor, Id asked specifically for a quiet room and the room I was given was on the 4th floor but not only could you hear all the traffic noise from the street as well as people talking at street level there was a locked door to an adjoining room through which I could hear the man in the next room sneezing and clearing his throat there was also a broken floor tile and one light in the bathroom not working Id initially asked very politely just after going into the room if I could move to a quieter room but was told no because I had used the soap and there was no housekeeping staff around Later on when I was trying to et to sleep before a full day o meetings that next day the noise was just too much so I called reception and explained how shocked I was at the level of noise considering the price of the room etc and they then agreed to move me to another room facing the inner courtyard which was quieter , Proximity to the Gare Du Nord
63690,H tel Hor,No Negative, Wonderful location Wonderful rooms very clean very stylish very comfortable Quiet rooms Especially garden comfort rooms Super welcoming and helpful staff Got free upgrade Will choose this hotel again and again Great experience Super close to Gare du Nord 
63691,H tel Hor, The neighbourhood, Additional space for luggage in the room is required The neighborhood is not the best but we do not suffer any incident at the street
63692,H tel Hor,No Negative, Great place to stay near both Gare du Nord and Gare de l Est with very welcoming staff Comfortable rooms with wonderful shower in the en suite bathroom Very helpful and friendly staff too 
63693,H tel Hor, The gym is not a gym The location of hotel is not a nice area There was banging coming from somewhere in the hotel that staff couldn t identify resulting in poor nights sleep Hotel was clean but rough around the edges Certainly wouldn t stay again when visiting Paris ,No Positive
63694,H tel Hor, Location is not for everyone Tourists should better stay near Louvre , Super friendly Staff at all Time Welcome chocolate Thank s to Habib Modern and clean rooms Good for Late arrival at gare du Nord 
63695,H tel Hor, Approaching late at night from Gare Est via a back street brings you through quite a worrying area I would recommend sticking to the main road up Lafayette Approach from Gare Du Nord would not be a problem the area around front is actually nice lively with some restaurants bars Hotel itself has no restaurant, Hotel is very conveniently located between Gare Du Nord Gare Est and is within walking distance of Montmartre Sacre Coeur and The Moulin Rouge Staff were very nice and attentive Some good eating places to be found around
63696,H tel Hor, Insufficient wardrobe space TV set mounted too high on the wall Bedside furniture too sparse, Very helpful staff Only 5 minutes wall to Gare du Nord High quality in bathroom ware Subtle effect with the concealed lighting
63697,H tel Hor, A room right by the lift made things a little noisy but no problem really, The delightful helpful staff with great spoken English Couldn t do enough for us Excellent
63698,H tel Hor, Sometime you cannot connect WIFI signal , The hotel is very close to Paris North station Gare du Nord metro station and bus stop include open tour bus Friendly staff There are many restaurants nearby 
63699,H tel Hor, A larger bed would have been nice , The shower was the best we used in France for ease of use All very clean Aircon kept the room cool Lovely room on the 6th flr with balcony overlooking the intersection Quiet at night considering location Close to Gare Du Nord station which has trains direct to CDG Airport 
63700,H tel Hor, Partial shower enclosure did not prevent water from splashing floor , Staff were friendly and knowledgeable Breakfast buffet was excellent Great location in sight of Gare du Nord 
63701,H tel Hor, Quick breakfast was not great for 7 euros but it sufficed , The hotel was centrally located to bus and train It was clean and modern Room was comfortable and bath room facilities were modern and shower great Would highly recommend this hotel
63702,H tel Hor, The shortest way from Gare de l est goes thru a shady street but it is very short way 5 minutes , Good location between Gare du Nord and Gare de l est Neighbourhood is lively with several bars so some street noise will reach small but nice hotelrooms In general neighbourhood might raise some eyebrowns but we did not have any problems Staff in reception was very friendly and helpful 
63703,H tel Hor,No Negative, The staff were particularly helpful especially Strphanie The rooms although small were well presented especially the bathroom Double glazing prevented noise from the busy roads outside 
63704,H tel Hor, The hotel was exactly as described if I was being fussy I could say the room could maybe be a little bigger that s all, Room great very clean jan the member of staff at check in was great the facilities in the room were excellent the location of the hotel was exactly where we were looking for the night member of staff Habib was also excellent breakfast was although basic well presented and tasted good if you need a good base for an overnight stop choose this hotel
63705,H tel Hor, Bed was too small for two persons They told us that the rooms are soundproof but it still was kinda noisy U can hear ur neighbours and the cars outside , Staff was very friendly and helpfull There was a young man working at the front desk who took the time to explain us how to travel with the RER and metro through paris Location is great its near the Station Gare Du Nord Breakfast in the morning delicious 
63706,H tel Hor, No criticism really , It was near the station the receptionist was a delightful young man genuinely helpful and gentlemanly to an older lady on her own The room was clean and I liked the decor particularly the bathroom Bed was comfortable and TV OK for size 
63707,H tel Hor, Nothing, Jan the receptionist was incredible truly made my stay a delight all staff were amazing amazing and all the facilities were 5 be staying again 
63708,H tel Hor, Nothing , Enjoyed the delux room quiet and high above street level with good lift Will definitely choose again when needing to stay near the Gare du Nord Really great shower 
63709,H tel Hor,No Negative, good bed good equipement and perfect location to take an early train from gare du nord very helpful staff as well very quiet despite the proximity to a busy street
63710,H tel Hor, The heat in the room Only April but very warm Had air con going and window closed very uncomfortable Said it to reception the following am most apologetic , Staff were fantastic very friendly and helpfull
63711,H tel Hor, I was given a room on second level too close to road level n had to draw the curtains all the time Not big issue but an upper level would have been good as I requested for a quiet room , The location just across Gare Du Nord station was excellent accessible to many parts of Paris via the metro and trains The staff especially Stefanie was very helpful in giving directions n answering my queries Thank you Stefanie 
63712,H tel Hor, Tiny room for two people , Location excellent effortlessly to spot from the moment jump off from the Eurostar train staff were nice free breakfast even the room rate didn t mention clean with free toiletries 
63713,H tel Hor, Limited range of breakfast , Great location very close to the Metro line Very close to lots of restaurants too Rooms were very clean and comfortable Staff were extremely friendly and helpful 
63714,H tel Hor, We went to breakfast at 1000 breakfast finished at 1030 and hit food had run out The waiter never offered us anything more Another family turned up so a very displeased waiter had to cook more breakfast serving us burnt scrambled eggs He then totally changed and served us extra cooked bacon and sausages with a smile on his face , This hotel was in an excellent location close to central station underground and open top bus stop I had my elderly mother with me and staff were very helpful and gave us advice on how to get to places Reception staff were excellent 
63715,H tel Hor,No Negative, Staff were very helpful and location ideal being across from Gare du Nord The desk was good for a business traveller and the room clean and comfortable Great place 
63716,H tel Hor, The elevators did not work properly you actually have to push the door close manually I mean seriously It does not look very safe the location right next to Gare du Nord is dodgy but will be good for someone who needs to take a train early and avoid traffic , Regardless of the location I found this hotel very clean the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was very well equipped The hotel has a lovely courtyard ans is overall cosy and the room was slightly bigger than an average Parisian hotel 
63717,H tel Hor, Everything was okay, Welcoming staff offered tea or coffee on arrival Also food and fruit are left out throughout the day for the occasional snack Compact room but everything you need including tea making facilities ample coat hangers and a safe box Had a front room and no real noise came through from the street outside Supermarkets and convenience stores just minutes away to purchase items for daytime lunches The hotel is very close to the Gare du Nord 
63718,H tel Hor, To be honest it is difficult to think of anything detrimental to say maybe a little more storage space for clothes , All staff very helpful nothing too much trouble Rooms kept exceptionally clean and lovely little details like the towels folded in a special way Good location loads of restaurants close by and great metro access 
63719,H tel Hor, Although being close to the station is very convenient if you come by train the area is actually quite seedy and definitely not the prettiest neighborhood in Paris , Good value for Paris extremely kind and helpful staff very clean and a great shower Steps away from Gare du Nord convenience for TGV trains and multiple transportation options 
63720,H tel Hor, nothing I didn t like about the hotel or staff, very friendly staff nice clean small comfortable room Very nice place to stay if you intend on traveling visiting paris 
63721,H tel Hor, We had a room at the rear where a small time welder might cause a bit of noise in the summer with the window open The front overlooks the main road with similar issues No problem of course if the AC works but ours was a little temperamental The wifi on the top floor did drop if not used continually but revived immediately on re logging on We could have done with a set of drawers for clothes for which there would have been plenty of space in the room , Friendliness and helpfulness of the staff was brilliant There are leaflets telling guests how to get to all the main attractions by metro walk RER and importantly bus which is impossible to find out about beforehand At least this way you get to see the city enroute There is a permanent free coffee available Breakfast comes in two packages of croissants juice and coffee and the other an American style The location almost opposite the Gare du Nord is so convenient meaning no awkward transport transfer with luggage The hotel is new and ultra clean and with two lifts we never had to wait to access the upper floor 
63722,H tel Hor, Breakfast buffet is a little bit small but does the job, Ideally located in between Gare du Nord and Gare de l Est very friendly staff good value for money
63723,H tel Hor, It s location is a Catch 22 I wanted to be close to train station in order to catch an early train to the airport but being near ANY train station means the neighborhood will be anything from dirty to dangerous This particular location did not seem dangerous but it had its fair share of unemployed homeless pick pockets and sex shops , Clean clean clean Friendly helpful staff 1 block from Gare du Nord train station Modern facilities Walking through the front doors was like being transported I immediately felt relaxed after leaving the gritty train station environment behind 
63724,H tel Hor, Room was a bit small , Great breakfast and we ll presented Staff were fantastic Room very neat and comfortable and the bed was great to sleep on 
63725,H tel Hor, Model of the Eiffel Tower in the couryard had lights which flashed all night However staff noted our commment and promised to deal with it , Room overlooked a pleasant courtyard and was surprisingly quiet 
63726,H tel Hor, The kettle did not pour very well could be hazardous if not used carefully, The bedroom was warm and comfortable the bathroom very clean and modern Lots and lots of very hot water Although the hotel is situated on a busy street the room was so well insulated and sound proofed that I was able to sleep very peacefully I was travelling alone but felt very safe the lifts are inaccessible without a room key and there were staff on duty in the lobby at all times 
63727,H tel Hor, Only negative is outside Arrived late at night Lot of people standing on pavement outside late night supermarket next door drinking beer Didn t feel that safe , Walking distance between Gare du Nord and Gare de l Est Inside very modern and very efficient friendly staff Interior courtyard room very quiet 
63728,H tel Hor, Nothing, Clean nice rooms staff is just great The RR Station is not exactly the show case of Paris would not be wandering around at 2 a m if you are used to Paris and Europe a real gem on my where to say in Paris list We travel quite a bit and our hotels range from 5 star to 2 star the few nights before were more than 300 per night and the next night was as well 
63729,H tel Hor, The door to our bathroom became stuck closed with all of our toiletries locked inside Unfortunately this happened at midnight with only the night porter available He was unable to fix it He made available the bathroom in another room on another floor which was all he could do But not great to have to get dressed and get in the lift just to use the bathroom In the morning Jan was able to open the door and all was sorted By way of compensation we were given 6 free breakfasts for our party , The guy at reception Jan was great We had a few problems with our room and he was very helpful and courteous 
63730,H tel Hor, Room bit noisy as on busy street Nothing to do with actual hotel but neighbourhood felt very unsafe so we felt uneasy during our stay here, Very close to Gare du Nord train station Lovely facilities staff very pleasant and spoke english
63731,H tel Hor, Too loud outside and not at the best area lets say , All receptionist and specially Jan from CZ were fantastic They will take the extra mile Well located in the heart of Paris Nice breakfast 
63732,H tel Hor, Terrible surrounding Not a place for family , Perfect hotel for cleanliness friendliness of staff comfort proximity to Gare du Nord for a very early Eurostar trip 
63733,H tel Hor, Noisy rooms facing main road No aircon windows had to be opened and noise went on till about midnight, Location was convenient but in the middle of a mixed demographics area At least 4 5 statuons from any major attractions
63734,H tel Hor, Our reservation of 2 adjoining rooms was done via Booking com On arrival the staff had made an error by allocating just one They then gave us two separate rooms which with children was rather stressful as we had to split up to have some peace of mind for the first night s stay The manager was apologetic and did offer the children s 2 of them a complimentary breakfast which I felt was really a cop out as we had to then pay for 3 full breakfasts in order to redeem The Hotel itself seems far larger in photographs the lifts are minuscule but then again European hotels are known to be smaller and have a very different take on star ratings The surrounding area leaves much to be desired especially as we were travelling with children It was really busy constant traffic bustling sirens blaring and streets teeming with a varied mix of people Overall the area could be classed as rather rough It was also difficult to prevent the children peering out of hotel windows with a street view of shops of an adult nature or even being rather curious whenever we left from or returned to the hotel , The hotel is really close to Gare du Nord with some fairly good restaurants close by The close proximity to the train station does eliminate the stress of getting to there on time for any international travel 
63735,H tel Hor, Area around hotel was somewhat downmarket, Location very close to Gare du Nord Hotel was modern very clean and everything worked well Staff we friendly and helpful
63736,H tel Hor, nada , everything very friendly staff lovely beds great bathrooms had the best sleep in a hotel in paris here Close to gare du nord and gare de l est 
63737,H tel Hor, On the 2nd floor we could hear the noise from the bar in the evening But it didn t go on all night it sounded like everyone was having a good time the live music was great so it wasn t a huge problem , Charming helpful staff Complimentary tea in the hotel lobby Clean modern spacious connecting rooms So much better than Parisian hotels I have stayed in previously 
63738,H tel Hor,No Negative, Excellent location particularly for those who takes Eurostar Clean and comfy bed Small but adequate for traveller looking for simple and basic accommodation 
63739,H tel Hor, Bedrooms are a bit small but still comfortable, Easy walking distance from Gare du Nord so ideal if travellling on Eurostar Modern facilities including good wifi coverage Friendly helpful staff
63740,H tel Hor, The blokes that seemed to congregate near the hotel front at night could seem a bit disconcerting although we had no problems at all, the location the staff and the comfortable beds Only 2 minutes walk from Gare D Nord 15 minute walk down Rue Lafayette and you are right amongst some great Paris shopping spots 
63741,H tel Hor, We liked everything no complaints at all, We liked everything The girl at the desk was so nice and helpful location was great It was so very very clean
63742,H tel Hor,No Negative, We absolutely loved our room We had a sixth floor room with a balcony Everything was perfect Very close to Nord train station Neighborhood yes was abit sketchy Would not want to go out late at night but we were so tired out by early evening so we enjoyed our room Paying abit extra for the room with the balcony we had no complaints about the size It was very roomy and clean The staff were excellent and spoke very good english to us We found them very friendly Although we checked out at noon the staff kept our suitcase and allowed us to sit in the outdoor lounge and in the front lobby until it was time to go get the train The night clerk even gave me extra milk at night for our tea and coffee that was in the room After doing alot of research on paris hotels near Nord I am so glad we picked the Hotel Hor No complaints about anything I would not hesitate to book again with them 
63743,H tel Hor, A group next door to us was quite loud early one morning but that s not the fault of the hotel , The staff were really kind and courteous and they were quick to help us when we had a question The young man on reception was also very friendly and spoke very good English The rooms are very clean and very modern ideal for couples The beds were really comfy and I fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow When we were there the staff informed us of a small water leak so they had to temporarily switch off the water However this was resolved the same day The hotel is situated just two minutes away from Gare du Nord which makes it ideal for access to the Metro and the RER The surrounding areas are quite busy but you can t hear any traffic from your room

63751,H tel Hor,No Negative, The location was close to all public transportation It s far away enough from Paris proper so you don t feel completely congested yet there are enough amenities in the neighborhood that make it feel very cozy and convenient The staff at the hotel was unsurpassed They were helpful and knowledgeable about all areas of the city helping get to touristy locations with ease I will recommend this hotel to all of my friends that visit Paris
