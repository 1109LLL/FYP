195259,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , Signage for the hotel is small and it would be easy to walk right past the entrance There is an unfortunate lack of a sense of arrival for this very nice hotel The adjacent pizza shop with its flashing LED signage simply detracts from this hotel s entrance , Gracious reception desk staff Very comfortable and clean guest room with nice linens and generous amenities for the bath The hotel is just a few steps from the metro and makes getting to and from the airports a breeze and for just a few Euros though the hotel can make more convenient direct airport transportation arrangements for you 
195260,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , I honestly couldn t find a fault with this hotel, Spacious room with a nice layout and design bathroom the same spacious and modern Staff were fantastic especially adiel think that s his name went out of his way to help provided me with local information on bars and restaurants even walked with me to find it Would recommend highly 
195261,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules ,No Negative, The bed was very comfortable decor in the hotel is modern retro and not dated at all The staff were so helpful and very lovely to chat to For both of our evenings they recommended us two great restaurants The hotel was clean and fresh smelling shower was nice and hot we even were given robes and slippers Great location it was just couple of metro stops from Gar du Nord and a couple stops in the other direction to the Louvre close enough to travel but far away enough from the touristic traffic Thanks for a great stay
195262,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , There wasn t any street noise but there was a really persistent noise that went on throughout the night not sure if it was from the metro line below or an inconsiderate neighbour above I didn t sleep well at all so I m not sure I would go back as I don t mind a small room but I need sleep , Room was very small but clean bed comfortable I was there for one night so it was fine for that Close to a couple of metro stops area felt safe 
195263,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , Rooms are really small you have to pay additional 30eur per night as a deposit with no information before arrival to hotel , Original decoration atmosphere service excellent bed 
195264,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , Air conditioning in room is sub standard not a problem in April but I expect it would be in July , Good sized rooms comfortable bed excellent location
195265,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , The room are too small and really bad smell on the corridor floor think it is time to make a change in this hotel in the capital of Paris we can find better breakfast outside Dont need to have any breakfast in the hotel But the biggest problem is realy bad bad smell on the corridor , Only good thing in that hotel is close to opera and close to metro Unfortunatly thats all what i like in this hotel
195266,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , The whole point of booking this hotel was that we were travelling by car and I requested this hotel as it advertised of having a car park and it hasn t so apart from having to trek about 500m with luggage you ll be hit with a 32 a day parking fee additionally not good Booking com plus the room was VERY small probably OK for a weekend but not much longer than that , The room beds itself was comfortable even if the room was a little small we were upgraded at no extra charge to a larger double room plenty of choice at breakfast and the location of the hotel was great 
195267,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , bed was very hard no bath a vibration through out the building day night maybe caused by trains on the Metro that maybe directly under the hotel , location and clean 
195268,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , Bed a little too soft staff friendly but no personal approach didn t feel wow, Nice clean room good complete breakfast very good location 100 m from nearest metro station between op ra and Seine
195269,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , Room was very small and very dark No plug socket in bathroom and no mirror in main bedroom so unable to use hair straighteners Night staff very unhelpful and wanted to charge almost 200 euros more than the advertised rate Refused to discuss the issue and were rude Manageress offered part refund the next day but still waiting for the refund to come through Felt ripped off Breakfast is not worth 19 euros Room is in basement very dingy and food was not good Taxi meter ranked up 10 euros waiting time before staff advised taxi had arrived am sure this was deliberate , Room was clean and manageress tried to help resolve issue with the bill
195270,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , no early check in even tho we requested it well in advance, the breakfast was amazing plenty of choice good array of fresh healthy items lots of French options

195273,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , The heater in our room didn t really work and the staff told us it s central heating which is obviously not true Luckily they brought us a small heater after our complaint , The location is perfect if you like shopping since Galeries Lafayette and Printemps are within walking distance I like the stylish design of the hotel and its rooms even though rooms are still tiny which are just like those in most Paris hotels 
195274,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , Nothing, Excellent location Paris Walking distance from Opera in one direction and from Le Sacre Coeur which is a major monument in the city Very nice staff and spacious room for Paris 
195275,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , I would have liked greater availability and information on how to get around the city and how to move by metro and bus from the front desk Very disappointed when on departure I was told that metro and bus malfunctioned because Sunday and I was offered the hotel shuttle bus about 60 euro or a taxi about 30 40 to go to the airport IT WAS NOT TRUE I managed to get well at Charles De Gaulle Airport by metro and RER 10 euros Why that s wrong when it was so easy to use public transport , The place in Paris is good to visit the town and very close to bus and metro The hall the room and the breakfast room are cozy and confortable Good quality breakfast varied of sweet and savory and waiters very kind 
195276,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , I asked for the toilet to be fixed at 8am by the time of checkout at 12 it had not I had to use a communal toilet in the meantime which was extremely frustrating,No Positive

195278,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , The breakfast was quite expensive , I liked that the suite had a curtain separation between the rooms for privacy Mini fridge was stocked and free of charge the bathroom was spacious and cute and most everything was within a 20 min walk 
195279,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , All was really fine , Location is very convenient for both visiting the city and for shopping The main shopping galleries as well as boutiques start in 700 meters from hotel or 10 minute walk It takes about 20 minutes to get to some attractions by walk The reception was very friendly and helpful and I actually stayed there for another few days after coming back from travelling around France 
195280,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , The top floor rooms are a little smaller due to the typical Parisian slanting roof this can make it feel a little claustifobic but staff are upfront about it and if available are happy to relocate you your rewarded by a fantastic view of the Eiffel Tower, Great location we didn t use public transport once and went to all of the normal tourist spots staff are really freindly some good restaurants in the area that are open late and comfy cozy rooms
195281,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , The rooms are very small and very hot The heating is central and can t be controlled in the room Opening the window helps but then you get the noise from the street , I liked the staff and their dedicated service even to arrange for a dinner reservation at a lovely French restaurant 
195282,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules ,No Negative, We loved the room especially beacuse it was on the top floor with the small balcony overlooking the roofs of Paris and the Eiffel Tower in the distance Really nice and quiet neighbourhood Proximity to the city center Place de la Concorde some 20 30 minutes by foot Metro station is almost in front some 100 meters away from the hotel The satff is very pleasant and helpful Breakfast is just fine 
195283,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , The room that we stayed was small even it was a superior room Also the sheet on the bed was not useful it was getting out the bed all the time , The hotel is at the same street with lafayette just 500 meters far 
195284,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , rooms are too small we booked premier room but I find it is smaller than the standard one shower water is too small to take complete shower , location is ok many good resturants are around there breakfast is ok 
195285,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , thought breakfast was a bit overpriced our room was quite small but as it was a last minute booking we couldn t complain, decor was quirky not a cookie cutter hotel which we appreciated we were in paris after all room had a balcony very nice modern bathrooms very comfortable bed also very quiet so no interruptions to sleep we were able to walk everywhere from the hotel
195286,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , The room was noisy because it overlooks the street and not spacious for two persons , The location is great The staff at the Reception are all so kind and helpful The breakfast is amazing 
195287,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , The lift stopped working and my mum had severe arthritis so she had to walk up and down 4 flights of stairs , The staff could not have been more helpful They went out of their way to help us with anything we required

195289,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , Make sure you know you have to tip the airport shuttle driver , The room was quirky but beautiful with a lovely view of Paris streets The reception was welcoming and very helpful on how to walk Paris which can be rather a challenge 
195290,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , This hotel does nt deserve 4 star in my opinion There is only one old and small elevator to cover 6 floors you need to wait long time untill the elevator come to your floor there s a painting smell between there corridor the hair dryer is not working and the ventilation in bathroom is not working also , Location
195291,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , The room was too small for 2 people The lift was broken during our stay and so we had to walk up and down 5 flights of stairs There was a small 1 person service lift but this was unusable We tried to buy a coffee at the breakfast bar in the morning but were not allowed as the girl said she only dealt with express breakfasts We booked the shuttle bus to airport Would not recommend as it arrived late and you have to pick other guests at other hotels up on your way , Location good 
195292,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , Had to ask for toilet rolls one day as none left but werebrought up promptly In my son s room damp towels left in shower cubicle which he hadn t used and sugar or similar spilled on bathroom floor I told reception staff about this as we went out for the evening but this hadn t been cleared when we returned to our rooms , Location Good breakfast choice Helpful staff 
195293,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , The facilites should have been improved During the last stay I changed rooms twice the first time for the problem of light which can t be turned off the second time for the problem of the air condition , The Staffs are Nice the location is good
195294,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , Air conditioning in the room was leaking and all they did was put a towel underneath it I assume this is because the clients were young 17 and 15 years old my son and his friend and hmm of mixed origin aka non white , Location

195296,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , Wifi signal is too weak to get you online in some rooms , Good location for shopping eating and staying in Paris There is a supermarket next to the hotel so you may not worry to get something which you need Very good hotel staff to make you warm when you stay in this hotel You may buy some local tour packages at the front desk with a cheaper price Highly recommended to you 
195297,Best Western Premier Op ra Faubourg Ex Hotel Jules , Some rooms are on the street which means a little bit noisy in the morning but not so critical you can feel vibration of subway if you are in the 2nd floor, Personal was good helpfull place is perfect very closed to subway and not so far from downtown Room was nice and clean WIFI is OK
