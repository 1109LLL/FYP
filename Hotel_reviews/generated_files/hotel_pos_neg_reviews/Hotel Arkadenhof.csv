499406,Hotel Arkadenhof, No aircon in restaurant, Lovely hotel but Vienna was hot we were in business clothes We made sure we had aircon in rooms when booking but aircon in restaurant would make breakfast more comfortable also in the reception and bar
499407,Hotel Arkadenhof, They have a Computer facility which should be connected to a printer Instead of that you need to send the information to the Reception and then they print it for you , The hotel is close to an Underground station Nussdorfer which is a very eficient way of travelling in Wien The room was very nice very spacious nicely decorated and most importantly with a very comfortable bed The attention in the reception differs a lot depending from the person It can vary from simply correct to very good 
499408,Hotel Arkadenhof, None , The room s space is large and enough Breakfast is good and staffs are pretty The decoration of room and hotel are classic and wonderful Check out time is 12 00 pm which is very excellent for travellers haveing a finally shopping before check out 
499409,Hotel Arkadenhof, Was difficult to sleep with open windows due to traffic from the street and too hot when the windows were closed Bathtub was very slippery , Well connected to city center ether by tram or by metro Very clean well mantained everything new nice big bathroom good breakfast with many options all very comfortable Some nice places to eat in the neighbourhood
