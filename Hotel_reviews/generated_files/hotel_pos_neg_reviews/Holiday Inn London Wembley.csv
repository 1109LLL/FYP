316748,Holiday Inn London Wembley, A kettle that had brown sludge and fungus in the bottom It took 24 hours and reporting twice to be changed , A very comfortable and generally well maintained room The restauarant was value for money and bothy breakfasts and evening meals were full of choice and generally good quality Handy for train and tube services to Central London 
316749,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Washroom sink was blocked power shower was not working bath tub was also blocked These are things that should be inspected by the staff anf fixed ahead of guest arrival Breakfast was ok and pretty bland Could have been better , Location was convenient as it was close to the Underground Stations Rooms and Hotel was of good standard 
316750,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The breakfast was dreadful Very processed and tasteless They still increased their room rate to 600 for the Saturday night even though the Adele concert was cancelled No morals Pure greed , Bed was comfy and nice shower 
316751,Holiday Inn London Wembley, It was linked into the Adele concert nearby so location was only positive AFTER concert was the bonus as walking distance the only problem was they let the world and his wife in to use the bar who were trying to arrange taxis Not only did this flood the bar which closed ridiculously early there were dozens of people sitting sleeping in reception awaiting their taxis Looked like a doss house Very poor management Breakfast was utterly disappointing, Room very small for its title Basic average
316752,Holiday Inn London Wembley, There is a lot of noise due to the building works which started at 7am I was not told there was leisure facilities when booking so did not have the availability to use these , Breakfast was lovely 
316753,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The cleanliness attitude of staff broken bed I could go on when I complained to Holiday Inn and asked for a refund they wouldn t issue one as I booked through booking com, The only thing was that it was walking distance from Wembley Stadium However for the amount I paid I am disgusted 
316754,Holiday Inn London Wembley,No Negative, Hotel was within walking distance of an abundence of facilities of a wide variety The hotel its self was very welcoming and had a really nice atmosphere Simple check in complimentary bottled water chocolate bars with the room which is a nice touch The hotel had a pool also The parking was good value especially in comparison with previous experiences Plenty of parking available Overall a great stay 
316755,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The tube is only 5 minutes away to inner London however it takes 50 minutes to inner London Which is not a problem if you know and the hotel is a little cheaper , We didn t have breakfast but there were plenty of places in the shopping mall 2 minutes away to eat Clean and tidy 
316756,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Was concerned to find the cleaner had not closed our room door properly after cleaning so the room was insecure for many hours Hotel staff responded appropriately when we reported it All our valuables were in the room safe , Decent hotel near outlet shops restaurants and easy access into Central London 
316757,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The breakfast service can improve when busy too few tables available no food at the buffet no plates knives and forks available , Good location for easy access to the National Stadium Wembley Good shopping nearby 
316758,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Breakfast was dismal ran out of everything no fried eggs no muesli as stated on the menu no tables available rather chaotic not organized at all, Location to Wembley and the train station
316759,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Shower head was loose in the room The car park is only 1 76m in places and being 2 0 m I hit my head a few times ouch The condition of the underground car park is reaching the end of its life towards the Wembley stadium end and should be fenced off as one car suffered bonnet scratches from falling concrete from the underground roof , Bed was too soft for my liking Room was in good order I asked for a high and quiet room and holiday inn came up trumps 
316760,Holiday Inn London Wembley, First room had a dirty shower and the replacement room had hair on the bed coverings Checkin staff on night were arrogant like they were doing us a massive favour checking us in , Breakfast was decent 
316761,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The fact that our rate was non cancellable Clearly with the Adele concert cancelled we would have liked to exercise this option , Excellent location and very well located for London Designer Outlet and Wembley Stadium We were disappointed that our visit was spoiled by Adele cancelling her concert at the stadium but managed to get into Central London very quickly via the Jubilee Line from Wembley Park 10 mins away 
316762,Holiday Inn London Wembley, I needed to leave my small cabin case to be stored so I could visit Madam Tussuds and they refused to store it so I was unable to visit the museum which was one of the main reasons for going to London I couldn t go sight seeing either because of the difficulty pulling along a case The manager made no effort to help me with this , Service was in the restaurant was great and the salmon dish wonderful
316763,Holiday Inn London Wembley,No Negative, Check in was very friendly and swift Room exceeded our expectations very lovely hotel room Breakfast was vast and very tasteful service was excellent 
316764,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Booked one of the suites for a night as going to see a concert at Wembley stadium be aware this is probably one of the most basic suites I have ever had and half of what was described as been in the suite is far from the truth no gown or slippers in room fully stocked mini bar was 2 bottles of water complimentary chocolate was a 2 finger kit Kat upgraded toiletries which was the usual 3 small bottles enough tea coffee facilities to make just 1 cup each before having to go ask reception for more Last bit is actually my own mistake none the less it s not what I would expect from a suite booking no breakfast included in the price I m sorry but when I book a suite I expect not be asked do I want breakfast or not I expect that everything is included in the price of 210 per night Honest opinion it was clean enough but very basic and is actually the standard of their top rooms is what I normally get for a basic double room just a little bigger but certainly not worth the money , Good location for wembley events 
316765,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The price of the room fluctuated greatly Friday night the room was 529 Saturday was 649 Sunday night was 129 this was due r Adele performing or not as it turned out, The beds were so comfortable I had the best nights sleep I have had for a long time
316766,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The food and alcohol was incredibly over priced 25 for a bland buffet and menu options were poor , Room temperature and beds were most comfortable I ve ever slept in 
316767,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Price of 400 pound for 2 nights std room because of an event in wembley stadium is outragous Massive buildingsites next to the hotel Work and noise started at 07 15 also on a saturday Swimmingpool and changingrooms are old not that clean and are also used by locals , Friendly staff clean rooms lots of restaurants nearby 
316768,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Downside is the height of the parking Even on our main car s lowest setting we would not have got in some parking areas Luckily we took our lower car I would recommend that the height of the parking is given out to all , Evening meal was very good and not too expensive as hotels go Right next door to Wembley which is useful 
316769,Holiday Inn London Wembley, We decided to eat in the restaurant as the menu in the room sounded lovely As we sat down to eat we were told it was only a buffet very average on event nights That should have been on the menu mentioned at check in or when we booked the table , Convenience to the Stadium
316770,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Sent wrong food to room uncooked Had to wait for them to get the order right and the food to be properly cooked Then they didn t do our breakfast in bed had it booked for 0815am so we could make the most of the day I wanted to take my son on the tour of London Woke up at 1030hrs didn t set alarm as I wanted my son to experience breakfast in bed rang thru n they told me they d send up had to have late checkout as checkout is normally 11am breakfast was sent up at 1130hrs our whole plans for the day where ruined Then they tried to charge 35 for parking Due to the incompetence of staff we never managed to do the tour of London really disappointed , The location and that was it 
316771,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Unhealthy limited breakfast options No fresh vegetables plastic and sweaty processed cheese fresh meat did not look fresh and also processed No bread options just toast or croissants Uncomfortable bed with either a very cheap or very old mattress or both Windows cannot be opened in the rooms The bed sheets had a chemical industrial smell ,No Positive
316772,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The room was very warm and the air conditioning only worked intermittently The sliding windows were locked so couldn t be opened The staff we encountered were very rude however they were very busy so probably not enough of them on Bar food was cancelled on Thursday 29th July 17 as the staff were too busy and the a la carte restaurant was full We paid 657 for 3 nights because we booked months ago however the daily room rate was 519 when we left on Saturday 1st July 17 There should be a law against hotels hiking up prices to that extent when a concert is on at Wembley however Adele was cancelled and the rate remained the same After our first night a letter was put under our door to speak to reception We went downstairs and we re asked to pay for the following 2 nights as the receptionist had only taken the first night on arrival We were told we d paid for our room in full twice but when we were checking out the receptionist got quite stroppy because of another colleague s mistake and we had to pay again before we left I now need to speak to my bank before claiming back the overpayment It was a shambles The hotel ordered us a taxi with no meter which charged us 7 to take us less than a mile to the train station The taxi driver quoted our room number so there was clearly a financial arrangement between the hotel and taxi firm That felt like the last straw , The shower and the cleanliness of the room were very good 
316773,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The car park charges tripped on the day of the event at Wembley even though we were staying at the hotel , The hotel was very close to the Wembley stadium It was also close to a shopping centre The car park was excellent 
316774,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Great service yet very expensive We had a bad smell in the bathroom possibly due to plumbing issues , Staff was very friendly and accomodating Breakfast was limited but sufficient Very close to Wembley Stadium and underground station Room was quiet and clean 
316775,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The one thing I missed at this hotel which we ve had at others was not having a little fridge mini bar in our room it would much improve our stay as it would be nice to have somewhere to keep drinks cold in , Checking in was easy the hotel staff were friendly and helpful our bedroom was clean and comfortable we had an evening meal in the restaurant we had a three course meal from the buffet plenty to choose from and as much as you like which was all very nice breakfast was also a buffet with plenty of choice which we also enjoyed the hotel is in a very good position being next to The Wembley Stadium also near the hotel is a good shopping centre 
316776,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Could have been a little bit cleaner bins in room hadn t been emptied and lots of room sevice plates left in corridor , The location to Wembley arena stadium is fantastic Lots of new shops and restaurants close by too Hotel beds were very comfy and monsoon shower was also excellent 
316777,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Beds were a little on soft side but were very comfortable Decor a little on dark side, Location Friendly staff Near train underground stations making it easy to travel to city Breakfast was excellent Lovely to get fresh fruit
316778,Holiday Inn London Wembley, I paid 409 for a basic twin room The hotel was nice but the price is bloody extortionate Not worth the money at all I only booked it because I had last minute plans ,No Positive

316781,Holiday Inn London Wembley, the room was a bit too warm when we arrived as it had been such a hot week but the a c was very efficient and it soon cooled down, the bed was definitely the comfiest hotel bed we ve slept in and a choice of pillows was good too 
316782,Holiday Inn London Wembley, We all loved our stay nothing negative about facilities However paid premium price for the room as staying for a high profile concert , Very comfortable beds Good power shower Staff very attentive Loved the pool
316783,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Food was served cold even though it should of been hot coffee machine at breakfast not working only one toaster that was extremely slow causing big queue s one of the reception staff not very friendly when checking out, The location for Wembly
316784,Holiday Inn London Wembley, A long way from the airport and a long walk to the train station to get back to Gatwick Also I could only book for two nights not one , Expensive for room only but the staff were friendly and helpful and the accommodation was clean and comfortable 
316785,Holiday Inn London Wembley, 10 extra for car park and room service was terrible food was very poor overpriced and took too long , Proximity to Wembley Arena and comfortable beds
316786,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The spa was awful Dirty dated Felt like I needed a wash after leaving the place The rest of the hotel is fine and as you would expect but the spa should either be completely refurbished or shut down as it brings down an othewise nice hotel , Nice room and good location 
316787,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Been charged for event car parking on the sat when our car was there fri to Monday same as hotel room rate was double for the sat a rip off, Fantastic for Wembley stadium
316788,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Unfortunately on event days the prices are hiked up dramatically 250 00 for the night 25 00 to park on site plus 9 99 for breakfast x 2 absolutely scandalous , Great location 
316789,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Bar prices, We stayed at Holiday Inn Wembley because we were going to an event a the stadium and wanted to be close by We paid a high rate for the room because it was an event day we were very pleased with our room on the 9th floor The view may have been a problem to some people as it over looked the building site next door but there was no noise and we weren t in the room very much The only issue we had was some old UHT milk in with the tea and coffee facilities The staff on reception were very helpful with this issue and agreed to allow us to receive free parking as compensation All in all a very good stay and nice hotel 
316790,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The room was very dated and the air conditioner did not work also we were unable to open the windows in our room which made for a very uncomfortable evening, Close location to Wembley and was able to book in early

316793,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The price of a glass of wine but then again it is London , We were attending a concert at Wembley Arena The hotel is a perfect location as it was a 6 minute walk from our room to Wembley Arena and Wembley Stadium The beds were so very comfortable

316799,Holiday Inn London Wembley, However Sunday morning was a total disaster since the hotel had no water for showers toilets nothing At checkout people were understandably very upset that they had paid a premium price to stay there because of the concert all had children and to have no water became a major issue Some people refused to pay their bills As a IHG priority club member I was instantly offered a 25 discount which I accepted from the nice lady who checked us in the day before Also the car park needs to assign more Disabled parking spots than they currently have , Everything went fine we have a blind daughter and we got an early check in because they were going to a concert at Wembley Stadium from 1500 to 2200 hrs The staff were very helpful and polite and could not do enough for us Our daughter is 14 years old and Blind so getting the room early was first class and allowed us to relax in the bar before going to the Concert I would stay there again since its ideal for Wembley Stadium or Wembley SSI Overall its was fine but the water incident was a major problem see comments below 
316800,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The hotel is actually 40 minutes away from Heathrow airport although they stated it was only 20 minutes so it cost my friend I 60 each way , Room service was super good staff were friendly and the rooms were very clean beds were comfortable

316810,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Price was hiked because of the event 189 for one night fair enough I was however slightly annoyed that the car parking charge was also increased from 10 to 25 , We went for the FA cup final and the location could not have been better Those of us with family attending the game were also able to watch it on tv in the bar Staff were friendly and the hotel was very comfortable We were also able to book in on arrival at 12 noon albeit in a twin rather than double room 
316811,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Hotel refused to keep our small travel case whilst we went out They cited SECURITY but we said please look inside at our little case and you can see it is not a bomb Whilst we can fully appreciate the need for high security this was compltetely illogical and caused us a lot of hassle The receptionist had said we could leave our case in the case store when we checked in , Nice clean room and toilet

316816,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Lack of information about how far from London it was located Coming back after being out for 10 hours to find my used half filled coffee cup sitting there The lack of information There was no concierge and the staff was too young to be helpful with more than checking in and checking out They were polite Having a breakfast buffet every day is too expensive They would be better off cooking for orders , The sheets and towels were clean 
316817,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Double room yet only one bath robe and one pair of slippers provided The cleaner entered the room in the morning without knocking first with two hours left to checkout time , Great location for Wembley Arena easy parking and very comfortable bed Nice breakfast too

316820,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The water dripping constantly outside the entrance to Room 1007 Not related to the hotel but when we called for an early morning pick up to Victoria Green line Coach station to catch a tour to Cotswolds on 14th May 2017 the driver didn t know the location neither did he have a GPS tracker with him He fished out a physical map and magnifying glass to locate it Ultimately reached our destination only because we had our GPS on Almost missed our expensive prepaid tour , Good breakfast Liked the Cumberland sausages a lot The Fish and chips we had at the restaurant bar for dinner over two nights was extremely delicious The grilled salmon with noodles a second best Convenient location to catch buses to Wembley Central or Wembley Park station and Brent cross Convenience of summoning cab service from hotel foyer dedicated phone

316824,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Dont think its acceptable to charge guests 25 pounds parking instead of the usual 10 pounds event day or otherwise 10 pounds per person for breakfast is also too much Not happy when the room costs are high anyway ,No Positive
316825,Holiday Inn London Wembley, No proper front desk staff was confused they gave the booked room to someone else and I have to shifted to nearby hotel they arranged for 1st night I was very tired after long air journey and I booked taxi to reach fast hotel to have rest But was shocked that no room in the hotel when it was booked from 3 pm onwards for me Next morning I came to holiday inn kept my baggage there and left for my work Night when I returned got the room later on it was just ok upto 13th morning I checked out The only answer from hotel staff was they apologize and say sorry but this is not the answer to deal with a pre booking, Breakfast
316826,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Food was rather pricey and staff were a little unhelpful, Room was very clean as was the bathroom Pool Sauna and Steam Room were great and open for the majority of the time 
316827,Holiday Inn London Wembley, a huge minus for the bad cleaning even though we put up the please Clean our room , perfect when attending events at Wembley arena or stadium Nice staff 
316828,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Booked the Executive Suite and got no 1034 I believe but the bedroom was literaly NEXT to the 3 elevator shafts which you could hear very clearly so I rebooked it the other suite was booked already and got the Executive no 1017 Didn t slept half of the night because of some ennoying buzzing sound I told the reception and I had to wait about an hour for the maintenance guy to check it out Whether it was the vent at the bathroom which they could not put off But I said this is not the sound which kept me awake So he came listened and said this isn t the bathroom vent but the equipment just above my room on the roof aircooler etc Then after a few minutes another maintenance person came and told me he had shut off the bathroom vent but you still could hear the buzzing he said Oh I could hear it when I came into the hall way He said well the whole roof is full of vents etc and he adviced to sleep one floor down They offered me a room 912 and I checked it out no buzzing sound So I agreed and I asked the reception girl okay I assume I get a refund because I payed for the executive At first she acted like she didn t understand me this is a twin room I said I understand but I payed for an executive and this is a standard room isn t it Finally she said we cannot give you a refund So I asked for the manager Her alternative was keeping me at the 10th floor as I paid for it and in this case 1015 en 1020 I waited on her she wanted to check it out for herself and gave me a cappucino She said don t hurry take your time So when I finished my cappucino I went to the reception And then the manager said oh well 1020 is already booked we are busy I said it has no use to relocate 1 room away but still she insisted to one of the staff going with me to check it out But what I thought the same sound obviously it was also noticable there , The reception staff restaurant staff concierge is very helpfull
316829,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Not a lot cannot say I could grumble about anything it would have to be something very picky to grumble , The breakfast was very good even though we got down there at just before 11 they still accommodated us and our friends didn t get down till after 11 and still managed to get breakfast The bed was so soft with firm pillows made for a perfect nights sleep and the location was perfect we managed to go to the London designer outlet and have a browse and when I noticed my shirt was dirty it took me about a 2 minute walk to get to it to buy myself a new one All in all the hotel was very good The pool is brilliant very big nice Jacuzzi and staff are very helpful Very good value for money In addition the tube and train station are only a short walk away meaning our night out in London was very accessible and when it came to going home we were right next to the station 
316830,Holiday Inn London Wembley,No Negative, Good value for London and reasonably fast to get to Central London via Tube which isn t near but isn t far away either Restaurant had really excellent Indian dishes
316831,Holiday Inn London Wembley, I do think for the cost of the room breakfast should have been included We did buy vouchers for breakfast , We were going to an event in the SSE arena in Wembley so it was great to be so close The room was comfortable and clean The staff were helpful and the breakfast was really good
316832,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Wasn t sure of the cost of parking keep in mind I was charged 25 usually 20 on non event days , Booked months early for the Joshua v Klitschko fight so got a twin room at a good deal Location is literally a 30 second walk from Wembley stadium lots of parking available below the hotel charge was 25 on the event day and a bar open until late next to the reception Hotel security were on the door too only allowing guests in which is helpful around midnight Room was large and comfy with a decent enough sized TV for a night or two and the bathroom was clean 
316833,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Over zealous security Made me throw away a Diet Coke at the front door and would not allow me to enter hotel with it They should have been concerned about all the drunks loitering in their parking lot instead of a guest with a soft drink, Location
316834,Holiday Inn London Wembley,No Negative, Easy to find hotel right next to Wembley Wembley central underground is around a 10 minute walk It takes around 25 minutes to get to from the city using the bakeroo line which runs through most major stops in the city We done the Harry Potter Studio tour and went from Wembley central to Watford Juncton in around 25 minutes 
316835,Holiday Inn London Wembley, I had better breakfasts especially the quality of the coffee at breakfast was relatively poor at the bar it was lovely temperature at the breakfast room was a bit low windows were single glass, location
316836,Holiday Inn London Wembley, the black lady staff in the swimming pool is worse no manners and one of my friend saw her that she wipes the holiday inn towel in the floor at the toilet so disgusting and specially our toilet when we first come inside the room is so istick, food is excellent
316837,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Car parking spaces are a little tight for the larger car and being underground make sure no top box is fitted no complimentary slippers in room was a tad disappointing from a high end hotel chain, Breakfast was substantial and tasty room was quiet and good sized with very comfortable bed not too far from tube station into central London which was a 15 minute walk and 20 min tube ride straight to Piccadilly
316838,Holiday Inn London Wembley,No Negative, The room was very clean the location of theI hotel is great the station is 5 minutes away the designer outlet is very close from the hotel I enjoyed my stay there

316944,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The breakfast we had ordered to the room wasn t great A member of staff entered my room at nearly 11pm and left quickly when I said hello when I heard someone open the door When my partner went after him to ask what he wanted he asked if we had called for a duty manager we hadn t Then claimed he maybe had the wrong room Why he initially left abruptly after opening the door without explaining why he was present Is past me I found that creepy If you re going to enter someones room it s only good customer service to address the people in there properly instead of running off , The room was nice and clean There was room service available

317088,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Having to pay for the car park when being a resident at the hotel and being made to pay the higher price due to it being an event day at Wembley stadium Also very unhappy with there being a blanket no non cancellation fee and that the booking couldn t be transferred to another holiday inn hotel should the need have arose,No Positive

317127,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The price was ridiculous for one night and breakfast wasn t even included even though the receptionist directed us to where breakfast was when we checked in misleading and extortionate , Location to stadium was excellent and that s the main reason this hotel was chosen

317134,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Bar was rubbish admittedly it was very busy with Springsteen concert and Mark Wright show in hotel but surely three rounds of the same drinks should come to the same price not three different totals bar staff seemed to out of sorts we waited for ages whilst others were served who weren t staying in hotel , Next to Wembley so great for concert nice hotel stayed before so knew what we were getting 
317135,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Long wait for check in and long wait to be served in bar at night bar area quite small in comparison to the size of the hotel so it quickly becomes crowded, Great location good size rooms

317137,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The parking fee for guests is a bit high at 25 for 1 night and we went to check in at 16 30 pm to be told the room was not ready and so we didn t get into the room until about 5 15 pm which subsequently made us miss the first support act for Coldplay , Lovely spacious executive room on 10th floor so nice quiet with complimentary tea coffee hot chocolate water Kit Kats toiletries slippers dressing gowns The cooked breakfasts were lovely and was served to us in our room for a 5 tray charge and it was delivered on time The shower was spacious and powerful and we would definitely stay there again 
317138,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Considerable amount of dust in the room and on the counters in the bathroom I left a note for the cleaner asking it to be sorted The note was moved so the cleaner had seen it but the dust was not dealt with , Friendly staff throughout the hotel location close to tube station very handy as you could get to central London in less than half hour without having to pay for central London price 
317139,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The staff seemed pretty inept at the times I got referred to a different person at the desk 3 times when asking for a comb to then find out that it was just in front of the first person It was also sad to see that the maid didnt speak english We had to tell her multiple times that we didnt want our room cleaned Yet she came in to do it anyway , Hotel was OK Standards were much high than expected Shower was especially nice 
317140,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The sofa beds for the kids was very uncomfortable They could feel the springs and metal work Also the car park charges were not clear I didn t have to pay to get out on Saturday to go out but I had to pay on Sunday for an overnight stay of 10 This was not clear and inconsistent ,No Positive
317141,Holiday Inn London Wembley, I understand the price going up a little for big events but feel it is too much taking advantage of people It s kind of like the price of holidays going up by a ridiculous rate when the kids are off school Shouldn t be allowed , Location for England game and very friendly staff 
317142,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Did not say that the parking was 25 extra and the breakfast for two 29 Was also quite noisy until late The spot lights in the bedroom above the bed were also ridiculously bright , Very comfortable bed 
317143,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The service was poor If you want a drink taken up they charge you 5 If your there when an event is on they will charge you 15 extra on parking So it costs 25 for an over night stay The service was awful asin noone understood us when we was speaking to them my questions werent ever answered asin I asked what is the price range for prosecco and just gave me a menu to look at After asking for it they wanted to charge me to take it to my room Beds were big but uncomfortable and there was hairs in it The shower was lovely , The location was fab 2 minute walk to the wembley stadium 
317144,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Got to hotel at 17 00 booked a double room No doubles available queue outside door with people trying get rooms told rooms would be available in an hour or two No acceptable for a big chain like this , Good location

317148,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Sign in the room said there was a choice of pillows although only 4 hard ones were left in the room Usually when I see this sign there are at least 2 types in the room on arrival so I assumed this was the case here but it wasn t , Staff were friendly and accommodating A good choice of food for breakfast Room including ensuite was clean and tidy Good views and plenty of space for clothes Good to have on site parking even though it was 10 for the 1 night s stay Worth paying it for the convenience

317159,Holiday Inn London Wembley, I was served drink at the bar in absolutely filthy glasses before we went to a concert Decided it might be a one off and would give it another go but later on that evening the same thing happened twice was enough to make me decide that I wouldn t be staying there again, Location to Wembley room cleanliness staff friendliness and general area for dining etc

317196,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Customer service follow up is extremely poor Nearly 2 weeks after having suitcase stolen absolutely no contact from hi insurance company despite being assured that they would be in touch It is quite obvious that the management of hi Wembley are keen to fob you off but nothing more Despite being reminded of HI s repute and integrity and to be trusting of them quite frankly its all lies I have lost a suitcase full of personal belongings due only to the negligence of the Hotel and despite requesting more than once not even a hotel report This is the last time I will have anything to do with Holiday Inn as any serious customer service issue will not be dealt with I really cannot understand how a suitcase can be lost within a secure luggage system and then so little after service when we live in a world where the customer is important and the customer comes first , Location perfect for an event at Wembley Stadium

317213,Holiday Inn London Wembley, We were all charged 2 extra for breakfast as we purchased it in the Dining Room We were unaware that had we ordered it at reception would have been 2 each cheaper This arrangement is unfair as hotel guests should be charged the same regardless of whether they order at reception or dining room Most people will just head straight for dining room , Waitress in dining room offered excellent service on Sun 24 April in the evening and gave service far beyond her duty tending to my grandson Sebastian s every need as he is only 2

317222,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Absolutely ridiculous that they bump up the price of parking on event days even for guests and you don t know which days are event days unless you check wembley stadium site I think if you are staying at the hotel you should always be charged the 10 regardless if there s an event going on or not , Great location

317253,Holiday Inn London Wembley, What I disliked was the lunch and dinner because twice I could not taste the dish of the hotel To top it off me and my girlfriend asked the porter what time was dinner and such porter said it was 6pm to 11pm But when we tried dinner at 9pm the restaurant was already closed I was even angry , I liked the fact that fast internet and the pool to spend fun I also liked the fact that the installation is excellent

317368,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The pool is very cold and also the jacuzzi is not divided from the big pool Therefore the water from the pool and jacuzzi has the same temperature Additionally the area for children is also using the same water of the big pool so if something contaminates the water from the kids area this will affect all the place In addition the hotel is very far from the underground and the entrance is not well located , The staff is very friendly

317372,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Draught beer at the bar wasn t the freshest, Very convenient for Webley Stadium and Railway Station 9 mins into London On site car parking great for leaving the car when going into town Nice facilities including pool and sauna Good Breakfast
317373,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The only real complaint was that the room was tiny, we liked everything about the photo everyone was friendly it was clean and the room served its purpose
317374,Holiday Inn London Wembley, One particular lady bar assistant could have been more friendly and less rude All other staff were very friendly , Hotel very close to arena and shopping precinct 
317375,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The cleanliness was poor in room and in everywhere else too The pool was closed for a day when we were there for 3 days so quite disappointing for the kids For us as well but rather for them Staff was so so Some kind manager some rather useless No sofa bed was made up on arrival although notice was given No means for putting it up later either other than bringing the bedding over Poor performance Breakfast was under cooked in all means no any veggies was offered at all , The pool was good and the sauna and steam room and the jacuzzi The room was spacious 
317376,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Same as when I stayed here before it can take a long time to get served at the bar even when it s not busy Didn t have a room with a view of Wembley Stadium like last time The luck of the draw I suppose , Excellent location A 10 minute walk from Wembley Park Tube Station 5 minute walk from Wembley Arena Stadium Helpful staff in the lobby area behind the desk and walking around Room was nice enough and had everything I needed Nice bar area 
317377,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Nothing, Reception staff very friendly and efficient Great room large quiet and comfortable Monsoon shower was hot and luxurious Spa swimming pool was available although we did not use it on this occasion Hotel close to Wembley Stadium and Arena 
317378,Holiday Inn London Wembley, All area in health club including changing rooms wasn t that clean so we didn t use the facilities even once Some staff at breakfast service seem unhappy while doing the job Car park spaces are so tight , Available car park 10 a night 3 minutes walk to stadium supermarkets and outlet designer centre which has lots of shops and restaurants 10 minutes walk to tube station Good Wifi reception Polite staff 
317379,Holiday Inn London Wembley, A bit confusing on how you approach the hotel no really obvious way if you are at the stadium side below the road , Fantastic location right next to the Arena where I was going to a concert and the restaurants of the London Designer Outlet Nice and quiet all night so I slept well 
317380,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The changing rooms including showers and toilet in the spa are in a need of a good clean and maybe more regularly , A woman in the bar was very helpful If you are visiting Wembley Arena the location is excellent 
317381,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Breakfast was quite poor for the price we paid and the woman at the breakfast room reception was a bit harsh to people sitting down at random tables each room had a reserved table Also the maids kept coming over our table to take away the empty dishes as soon as we d put down our fork spoon It felt really unpleasant to be constantly interrupted during the whole breakfast , Excellent position very clean and comfy 
317382,Holiday Inn London Wembley, When I booked the hotel I booked two Queens rooms to be given one Queen room one Budget room once we found this out 2 hours later I complained to the reception we did get the correct room Had we of been on our own and not with friends we would have been ripped off by being put in a budget room on floor 2 instead of the queens rooms on floor 9 Not happy no sorry from staff ever ,No Positive

317387,Holiday Inn London Wembley, A little noisy but not enough to stop us sleeping , Short stroll from Wembley Arena Comfy beds and well equipped rooms Nice bar to finish the evening off in 
317388,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The restaurant closed at 9 00pm and the service for food from the bar was poor Granted it was a busy Saturday night but they were clearly understaffed and stretched to be dealing with a frenetic bar and food orders , Location to Wembley Park tube and London city centre was great Breakfast was very good and the health and fitness facilities were more than satisfactory with a large warm pool well equipped gym and clean changing rooms 
317389,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The train station is a mainline less frequent trains than the tube or overground But fast travel to central London nonetheless , It s a comfortable hotel to a good standard
317390,Holiday Inn London Wembley, customer service from the bar staff leaves a bit to be desired They were informed twice of a spillage but just said it doesn t matter and ignored it despite being a safety risk I asked for chips to be told kitchens shut but if you go to your room then yes We finished our drinks went to pur room to be told no it s only pizza or sandwiches We chose a pizza and I found it a bit doughy and undercooked Bit disappointed and the fact that I had to pay 5 for it to be brought up when all I actually wanted was 2 50 worth of chips in the bar , The location was fab for Wembley stadium The hotel felt like a little bit of luxury and was very beautiful Breakfast was lovely lots of choice and well cooked Would definitely stay again 
317391,Holiday Inn London Wembley, My credit card wasn t taken at check in and I wasn t asked to provide it Later when I had the buffet I was told I have to pay immediately after my meal and the guy was very rude I felt embarrassed that he d said it very bluntly in front of my friend His name was Florin , The room was nice The breakfast was very good 
317392,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Only 2 staff on check in shower was cold on both visits Breakfast slow had to wait 10 minutes for the toaster Then 10 minutes for the chefs to top the dishes up with food 5 Kids crawling around the floor It was like a kids club , The location was great for Wembley 
317393,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The breakfast buffet wasnt great Undercooked sausages ran out of food and were slow to re stock the hot buffet , Room was lovely and clean staff were helpful and facilities were amazing The bar was also nice and had a nice atmosphere
317394,Holiday Inn London Wembley, It is a long way from both central London by train tube or bus and from Wembley Central walking and trains from Wembley Park just next door to Marylebone are infrequent and 2 were cancelled in 2 days It was a little noisy but then we went on a Saturday night We had a cot in our room my daughter is 8 that they were too busy to remove , Hotel has everything gym bar restaurant breakfast good choice if not quality Staff are friendly and helpful

317401,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Nothing bad to say about this hotel but we did say it would have been nice to have a bath in our room that would have made it 10 10, Breakfast was wonderful brilliant variety leisure facilities were great me and my other half loved the sauna and steam rooms and the bedroom was amazing to with a view to the city skyline the bed was so comfy wanted to take it home with me
317402,Holiday Inn London Wembley, I think that the location of the smoking area could have been different At night the idea of going down the stairs to what is the car park area where there is no staff near did feel unsafe , The hotel room was clean and tidied while I was away 
317403,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Only thing that was a bit annoying was that being on the 7th floor the lift machinery was constantly banging whilst in use , The staff were very friendly and the food was great Loved the gym and sauna facilities 
317404,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Steam room stank of curry Was like the Holiday Inn dia Spa area was disgusting Badly in need of a refurb Steep tiled stairs from changing rooms when you ve just had a shower are a complete health hazard , Nice bar restaurant breakfast

317406,Holiday Inn London Wembley,No Negative, So central to everything you need for an overnight stay in London close to tube outlet shopping centre Restaurants wembley Stadium and Wembley Arena 
317407,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Room price was ok but parking was a bit of a rip off don t most hotels include private parking in their rates these days too It wasn t a public car park so just an excuse to charge more , Excellent location clean nice place friendly staff perfect for our needs
317408,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The web site of the hotel could use better pictures of the rooms and clearer descriptions The definition of the word double typically means two therefore a Double Room does not mean one room with a Double Bed which I learned the hard way and a bit more expense , With respect to the location and Wembley Stadium Outstanding location Wembley Park undergound was close by 
317409,Holiday Inn London Wembley, It s a little confusing when you re told your prepaid price room hasn t actually taken the payment yet But all good otherwise , The room was beautiful and clean staff were friendly and helpful at all times 
317410,Holiday Inn London Wembley, meal in restaurant was disappointing meal should have had potatoes but we had to chase staff who were saying the turnips were potatoes Roast potatoes finally arrived at the end of that course, so close to Wembley stadium and shopping mall

317415,Holiday Inn London Wembley, We arrived at the hotel to check in and they had cancelled our booking as they were overbooked for the night and apparently the first ones they start cancelling are booking com ones After we had travelled for 5 hours it took an argument with 2 members of staff before asking to speak to the manager to confirm that we did infact have a booking Although the rooms were nice the shower hardly worked and only had a slight cold trickle Overall it was very overpriced for what it was I would expect to pay closer to 120 to stay somewhere like that not 200 , Good location Rooms were nice and clean 
317416,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Terrible mattress and pillows coffee sachets not replenished each day could not find my booking at check in then tried to charge more than my booked price , Proximity to Wembley Stadium
317417,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The cleaning staff were very poor We were woken up at a stupid time in the morning way before we were suppose to check out then they cleaning staff still knocked on the door and hassled us 5 more times before we left We ordered a room with a double bed What we got was two single beds pushed together We wasn t very happy as they kept rolling away from each other we had to constantly push them back together during the night We selected Wembley stadium view and you had to press your face up against the window just to see the corner of the stadium Finally the bar closed very early , We loved the greeting it made us feel very welcome The hotel is in a great location 
317418,Holiday Inn London Wembley, On checkout the Russian girl who was the staff member who served us tried to charge us 25 pounds for parking because it had been a game day when we arrived We had not however arrived till well after the game had finished and the car park was empty She was immovable on the charge until I spoke to her boss who reduced it to 10 pounds which was still too much , Proximity to the stadium That said directions to the hotel were poor and we could not find it with the GPS on the day 
317419,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The hotel doesn t provide conditioner That s it really and the steam room and sauna could be a bit bigger, Nice modern building nice staff and good size room
317420,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The early breakfast times The extra pay on room service for breakfast , Right around the corner from the outlet stores View from room Facilities in hotel were of great use 
317421,Holiday Inn London Wembley,No Negative, Fantastic location for the stadium and good parking when we were there for RWC2015 Ideal very short walk of 5mins and you are there But peaceful inside And underground car park made life so easy

317427,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The price of a room the night before an event was rather steep compared to same room the next weekend, The executive room on the 10th floor was lovely you could use the gym and swimming pool and was right near Wembley Stadium where we needed to be 
317428,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Leisure facilities were dirty and are in need of an upgrade Had to pay 25 parking one night as there was an event at Wenbkey that I wasn t attending and wasn t aware of , Breakfast Staff who helped my son who was on crutches Close to shopping outlet

317435,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Bar prices a little too high Put us off drinking in the bar after the meal The drinks we had with our meal came to more than what the food was then having to pay 10 service charge on top of that was a little up setting It took the pleasure out of leaving a tip to the person who looked after us all night , All the staff were fantastic and very friendly right from check in to the restaurant to the 2 ladies who clean the rooms on the 2nd floor 10 10 all round 
317436,Holiday Inn London Wembley, Had a poor experience with one member of staff in the restaurant However as stated all saved by the actions of another member of staff Overall the staff were exemplary with the one glaring exception guess we all have good days and bad days , Right alongside the stadium Holiday Inn always offer the same so you know what you are getting In truth I was going to slate one member of staff however one of the mangers stepped in and provided exceptional service and customer care so I will desist

317448,Holiday Inn London Wembley, The rooms are expensive especially for a family The price should include the breakfast and the car park You can get the same breakfast for half the price at local restaurants As for paying guests having to pay for car parking is just wrong when the rooms are so expensive Its just getting extra from people because of location , Location and friendliness off staff
