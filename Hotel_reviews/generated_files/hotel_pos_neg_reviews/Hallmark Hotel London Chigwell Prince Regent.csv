375959,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, In the room is a take away menu which states it can be ordered after 10pm After seeing central London and eating fairly late we decided we would grab something off that menu Unfortunately when we called through we were told nothing was available by the kitchen Called back to reception who informed me they must ve run out the night before Breakfast time the staff were a little offish and I overheard one say to another come on get the plates moved I m not having them sitting here just chatting I cannot understand why we experienced both of these situations as the hotel was actually very quiet with what seemed only a handful of guests , Good location we had a nearly refurbished room which was great The grounds are beautiful and we were able to spend a few hours enjoying them Local amenities on the door step and a fab local pub round the corner where we had dinner and a few drinks 
375960,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The room was very dated and shabby and dirty around Windows the floor in the bathroom was sticky and scruffy and short of towels We also had to pay for breakfast and parking which we thought was included , The staff in the breakfast area were extremely helpful 
375961,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, As above, Location was perfect food at dinner was poor quality as was breakfast I was very disappointed with the room who s was dark and unwelcoming plus it was quite a walk from the reception area taking 2 separate elivators On top of all these negative they charge 5 to park in the hotel grounds 
375962,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The window to my room could not be opened It was warm and stuffy throughout the night although the little fan in the room did lessen the suffering somewhat The walk to the room is very far and I cannot imagine using this hotel if I am any older or in the next couple of years when my legs and knees weaken with age It didn t help went the access card to the room didn t work twice as it is sensitive and could not be placed near mobile phones , We went for a reunion in chogwell school so the location was good for the occasion The staff were reasonable helpful and courteous
375963,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, I have stayed at this hotel before and normally everything is fine on this occasion the PC responsible for coding the key cards was not working so no access to your room without a member of staff accompanying you to unlock it the kitchen were unable to do any food due to a problem with the gas and presumably this is the reason why there was also no hot water I understand that things do go wrong but I don t accept that it couldn t have been fixed over the time period it happened Also the staff didn t seem to know what was going on communication could have been better ,No Positive
375964,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Very tacky dated hotel soiled carpets bathroom fittings that were damaged No free car park even at night Time for some investors to completely refurbish this hotlel, Location was good
375965,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Disgusting dirty poor quality fittings damaged sanity units and shower smells Mound in rooms including window bugs seriously overpriced 1 not 4 Customer service awful no air conditioning dirty bathrooms carpets skirting nothing positive to say oh and food don t go there I spend a lot of time in hotels and this has to be the worst , Nothing Awful from entering hotel to depart Disappointed
375966,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Dirty worn overpriced no air conditioning mound in room bugs damage sanity wear in bathroom horrendous seriously overpriced and poor customer service Not one to complain but awful , Awful from start to finish terrible hotel 
375967,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Paying for parking and not having an armchair in bedroom , Breakfast choices were excellent and waiting staff really welcoming and cheerful Hotel well looked after by their room valeting staff who were also friendly and helpful Would definitely return here 
375968,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The rate quoted over the phone was 134 for an Executive room The receptionist was not willing to honour the Booking com online price of 114 and was very confused about what type of rooms were available to the point of almost arguing with me So I left the call and booked online receiving an Executive room for 114 Strange process and not very customer friendly approach, The service levels at this hotel have hugely improved since late 2016 I stopped using this hotel because of the lack of cleanliness and the poor service Receptionists were always polite but had to follow many non customer friendly processes Someone has recognised this because it was like a different hotel experience this time after a 6 month break from the place 
375969,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The layout of the hotel means that you have to go in two lifts and walk loads to even get to your room carrying your bags Food for room service or in the restaurant was very poor choice and poor quality, Room was big and comfortable
375970,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The photos showed on booking com are the 33 refurbished rooms If you don t specifically ask for one you end up in a horribly dated room We ended up moving rooms as the dated room was hideous , Hotel was lovely The food and drinks were reasonably priced and good quality The staff are super friendly and helpful 
375971,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Nothing really to do with the Hotel infact it stands as an oasis within it s environment it s simply the extent and unrelenting density of traffic one has to endure in order to get there having said which I would guess that going further into London to find more central accomodation would be even more intolerable arriving at the Hotel by car any further travel is probably best undertaken by TfL , Don t have breakfast at this advanced age so can t comment on that but a snack bar meal on my arrival was excellent above all without exception I found the staff to be quite wonderful If I ever need to have to visit this part of the world again I would not hesitate to put this Hotel at the very top of where to stay 
375972,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Paying for parking even though we was guests The exterior is shabby we had a long walk and two lifts to our rooms our room was dark with very little lighting in the room no air con could not open the windows very shabby bathroom The light on the dressing table did not work so had to get ready with very dim light No beer in the bar and the wine was awful The garden was a mess with napkins on the floor tables not cleared no table service Guest asleep at one table Noise of refurb across the whole hotel alarms going off Very poor breakfast when we came down there was very little food on the counters once we had finished our breakfast they had restocked greasy cheap sausages cheap bread Just very poor quality all round from a 4 star Could not wait to leave 3 star at best , Parking was good bed was comfortable 
375973,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Suprised that there were no chairs in a superior room that we had to contribute towards parking , The staff were friendly helpful considerate 
375974,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, I understand that they are currently updating the hotel but Stains on carpet no aircon in rooms it gets very hot during the day even with the fan going constantly pillows were very hard breakfast on the second morning was ok but the sausages weren t cooked properly and still looked pink whereas the morning before they were all browned off nicely I think they were having issues with the chef as I could overhear conversations between staff Room was good for what I needed one thing that annoyed me was the toiletries shampoo shower wash and body lotion were all half empty and the dressing table was sticky with ring marks but I cleared That up myself Hotel does need to updated and so do carpets in rooms I m a hotelier so maybe I m being a bit more picky , Stayed bank holiday weekend Arrived early went to check in but my booking wasn t put on their system Receptionist who I dealt with sorted it out and all was fine Good shower comfy bed fan in room breakfast was good on the first morning quiet room at the back served its purpose Outside area by the bar restaurant was lovely to sit and relax in the sun Had a quick bite to eat after I arrived had the burger and chips and it was very good Great coffee too
375975,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, I stayed in a room which was in the church end of the building I know it is an old building so accept the windows were as old as the building but because of this there was mildew on the window concrete frames I expect this to look old but not with mildew This could definitely have been cleaned and was not due to the fact that it was old but due to the fact that needed cleaning better I am 65 and have been cleaning areas of houses for a number of years and know what I saw could be cleaned The room smelt constantly of mildew and the smell did make me heave after sleeping in their for the night if I was in another part of the building I am sure my stay would have been perfect Now I have mentioned this I am sure it will be cleaner in the future I have pictures but cannot work out how to download from my phone , The bed and facilities would have been excellent except for the thing I didn t like their response to my complaint has been acceptable been offered another nights stay and being put into another area of the building garden is beautiful especially as the weather was nice 
375976,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The layout of the hotel and the fact lifts were not centralised , The staff were very understanding to the fact I was there for a wedding and allocated my room as soon as it was available which I really appreciated 
375977,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, 3 fire alarms in same night function goers who hadn t paid for the use of a bar stood drinking and being rowdy in the car park late at night with their pre bought booze Decor badly needs updating, Nothing
375978,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The bar area lacked any atmosphere and is very basic, The staff were all excellent and couldn t hav done more to make our stay comfortable The gardens were lovely and really nice to sit out and enjoy a glass of something 
375979,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The decor of the room was dated from the 80 s 90 s the shower area had two different types of tiles on the walls There was unpainted repair work on the room walls I had always thought it was a highly maintained hotel but clearly not felt pretty disappointed to be honest There was a wedding the day we arrived at 5pm and we were lucky to get a parking space which then cost 5 because we had booked through Booking com The receptionist said if we d booked the room directly through the hotel the parking would of been free , The bed was comfortable
375980,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The size of the room was not a double the view was a car park and brick wall the shower was big enough to wash a child having to pay for car park a racial comment made by another guest and when informed manager she did nothing a phone call two hours before check in to tell me they are over booked basically because they had a wedding party, Nothing
375981,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Breakfast was vastly overpriced at 16 per person most expensive bowl of cereal my 12 year old has ever had I had bacon mushrooms egg and tomatoes for breakfast bacon VERY well cooked and egg rubbery Not enough milk on the table to have 2 x cups of coffee without asking for more We took the stairs to our room as the guy carrying a large parcel we had with us commandeered the lift Personally I prefer to use the stairs but would have been nice to be asked especially as I was carrying our case , Bedroom size was good bathroom could have had better quality toiletries towels 
375982,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Bar facilities poor and lacking in insuffient and experinced staff Bar closing at 11 00pm is a ridiculous time for a hotel of this kind Asked for vegetarian breakfast at point of booking and there wasn t any ,No Positive
375983,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, This hotel states they have plenty of free parking It s a lie To add insult when showing the reference to their quote on booking com l was told and l quote free parking is free subject to availability However as we ve sold the parking rights to an outside contractor there is no free parking available I am a frequent business traveller and never normally write reviews However l promised the receptionist l would make a point of leaving one for this stay so here you have it Oh whilst l m writing your internet is also about as good as your customer service skills ,No Positive
375984,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Your website states that there is ample free parking on site However this is not true if you book through booking com and not them they have the audacity to charge you 5 per night to park They do not charge guests for parking if they book through them directly When I challenged this and told them they could not charge me as the booking com website says parking is free they reluctantly refunded me and said they would contact booking com and get it changed One month later and the website still says parking is free This hotel has really gone downhill The property is tired and dated and needs a complete overhaul The furniture needs updating and they need to inject some ambience and personality into the place It could be a fantastic property if someone with a flair for interior design got their hands on it ,No Positive
375985,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The hotel was more than an hour out of London It was very convenient if you wanted to travel out of London to the North or east but getting to the other side was a nightmare and if going to the city the train trip was more than an hour ,No Positive
375986,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Receptionist was quite rood Room was mean t to be superior but was very basic and small We were only given one towel and it was a long walk down to the reception I ve stayed at nicer premier inns for less money , Was a good selection at breakfast
375987,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The rooms doors shower was old poor qulity and worn out which is not what you would expect looking at the pictures at Booking com It was also very hot inside A lot of noise outside and hot water in both water taps no cold water I would never expect poor qulity in a 4 star hotel , Staff was friendly and very helpfull
375988,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, I didn t like that my bed was on the wall next to the hallway so I can hear and feel doors closing and people walking My room was incredibly warm if you have the window close and fan off The light coming through my door from the hallway was really bright and had to use a pillow to hide the light The elevator was really old and felt unsafe using it , The hotel was nice and the cooked breakfast was good and the stuff were pleasant The double bed was comfortable and under 100 for a bed and breakfast can t be complained about especially for a 4 star hotel 
375989,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Our bedroom looked and felt tired it does need a face lift especially the bathroom The plates for breakfast where ice cold This made the excellent breakfast cold very quickley Your staff are polite and nothing was to much trouble for them ,No Positive
375990,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Hotel was very tired and desperately in need of some maintenance works Peeling paint worn carpets chipped furniture Beds brilliant size but headboards for much smaller ones which looked odd The Hallmark group should do the building and the staff a favour and revamp and refresh the whole place , Good size beds nice exterior surroundings the staff were all very warm and friendly 
375991,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, I was very disappointed with the bar which was so dis organised We attended a charity ball and stayed over The bar had no bottles of prosecco or champagne which seemed ridiculous as there was a hotel full and people willing to spend money as all dressed up attending an event The bar staff didn t know their drinks and ran out of glasses Also in some bars you couldn t use cards only cash I had registered as a coeliac for the meal I was offered no gluten free rolls had to ask twice to ensure my starter and mains were gluten free then I didn t get any pudding and after 5 times of asking they bought a bowl of chocolate ice cream which was awful I don t normally make a fuss but the tickets for this event were 100 each and the hotel should be able to cater for dietary requirements esp as they had prior warning , The hotel is nice but needs more efficient staff The reception staff were great as were the breakfast waiters The hotel needs an upgrade thread bare carpets I had booked a double room and it was so tiny and very hot managed to eventually get the window opened

375993,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Shower could be better overhead only so wet hair and a strange range of vectors for the jets lol but hey it s a tiny drop of a negative in a sea of positive, The space The size of the bedrooms well above average Size of bathroom ditto The gsrdens that were sunny and spacious Ease of access Ease of parking Cost of the room under price of Prem Inn or other economical rooms But mostly the staff Wonderful

375998,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Lack of attention to detail e g grubby curtains not hung properly in bedroom bathrooms needed a makeover paint flaking no bathmats taps lose too much light at night under the door only ONE chair to sit on and NO coffee table , Brilliantly friendly and helpful staff functions rooms away from the main sleeping areas so noise not so much of an issue

376006,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Yes the bathroom was a little tired but all the facilities worked well The layout of the hotel took a little getting used to with the hotel making good use of a sloped site For rooms 200 take the lift from Reception to the first floor walk along some long corridors until you get to a second lift and again take the lift to the first floor yes first , We booked a superior room for the king size bed It was a really good sized room and a really comfortable bed Shower was great I didn t recognise much of the other recent reviews Staff were courteous and polite breakfast was more than adequate Ideal location for our visit with a great curry house just 5 minutes walk away The Ghandi 
376007,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, There wasn t a late night bar so when returning with friends who are also staying at hotel it s nice for the bar to open I was personally with 14 other people who had also booked rooms and we just wanted a late night drink , Location
376008,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Staff are very rude Issued the wrong from firstly I had requested a superior double room and was issued a small twin room I contacted reception who was rude they then moved me to a double room Which again was not a superior size as I had previously stayed at this hotel 3 weeks prior and was given a SUPERIOR room This stay was for two nights and the room was extremely smaller The staff response was we are fully booked Which was not the correct response I was looking for as this added to my doubt that I was in a smaller room then I had paid booked After being told by the receptionist we could use a specific door to exit into the gardens to smoke we was rudely told by another member of staff that we could not That the receptionist was wrong or she had not told us that we could use such door and we need to go to the front of the building Considering we are on the 3rd floor this is an extremely long walk ,No Positive
376009,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, It was very dated The building itself is old I know but it needs up dating decor wise inside Reception area was dull and old fashioned pity as staff were great I also think it is way over priced Would definitely not say the hotel was 4 , Room was clean and spacious Breakfast was good Staff were polite and friendly

376046,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The staff said we couldn t have a drink brought to our room then changed their mind when we said it stated we could Room was only set out with one set of toiletries and towels not really 4 star in my opinion, Bed was very comfortable room was a good size
376047,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The restaurant Basically it was as if the hotel becomes overstretched when trying to manage functions and a restaurant Friday 14th oct saw us eating very late having booked for 8pm My rib main course was tough and inedible and the second attempt not much better The lamb course had run out but we were not advised until we had placed the orders and there seemed to be confusion over the orders in general Not inspiring for the groom who was entertaining his parents from jersey and his about to be in laws , The excellent way my sons wedding reception was managed how every request was fulfilled and the staff so very attentive 
376048,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, A walk of about 100 yards from the lift to bedroom Not suitable for disabled person About four fire doors need to be opened Bath chipped and needs attention No walk in shower Room cool on arrival Payment taken in July for October stay , Comfortable beds VG breakfast 
376049,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The noise from staff ALL morning and afternoon outside of my room room 102 was loud and frustrating as I just wanted to relax and sleep but couldn t because all I heard was the conversations and doors opening and closing Selection of TV channels was limited I asked for Sausages Baked Beans and Hash browns for breakfast and I got given Bacon instead of Hash Browns I was too hungry to have to request to swap for the right items I wanted to use the iron however after I had put water in it it began to leak so therefore I opted against it which left me looking scruffy as I couldn t iron my outfit as intended On our second night the bar staff made myself and my partner uncomfortable as I was told upon arrival at the hotel that my stay included a meal allowance but I could potentially use it towards drinks in the bar but mainly because I got there when dinner had finished as we had plans to have dinner at another venue on our 2nd night I thought that perhaps we may be able to use the allowance towards drinks instead However the lady behind the bar was very confused The query was resolved and we ended up just paying for our drinks I have to use a straw and there were only 5 available to use It sounds like a minor issue but as there was only 4 people in the bar area and 2 members of on duty bar staff you d think the small details would be manageable Also herself a chap also working behind the bar and another staff member who I think was off duty were chatting among themselves which was very awkward as customer service wasn t a priority Overall after paying 267 for 2 nights upon arrival at the hotel I just can t say it was worth such an amount , The reception staff were lovely The look of the room was nice and it was clean The bed was comfortable 
376050,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, I almost did not use your hotel as due to my travelling during the day I tried calling the hotel to book a room directly and was told the hotel was fully booked I then pulled into the next available services and went on Booking com and looked for a hotel in the area and guess what the hotel had a number of rooms available As I have used this chain before and my meeting the next day was close by I booked it but I was not happy but decided to talk to the reception about what had happened By booking through bookings com website the room ended up costing me more than advertised on your website I mentioned to the receptionist at the hotel and discovered she was the one who had taken my call She stated since calling a room had become available which was a lie as the hotel was no where near full which I had confirmed by the house keeping staff who were very helpful There was no apology from her no offer of a discount for the extra cost in fact nothing not even someone to take my case to my room Due to this lie unfortunately although I have regularly stayed in your hotels before as I travel around the UK and do find the standard of your hotels to be very good I will not be staying again Having discovered the hotel was not full I can only assume you earn more for customers to book through other websites and so do not wish customers to book directly either that or your staff do not want customers and are happy for customers to pay more Either way not great As a CEO of a company if my staff acted this way I would not be happy , The hotel is of a very good standard Large clean rooms good food from room service and a good choice for breakfast Staff were friendly and helpful once I had booked in 
376051,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Had to wait 45 minutes for Manager to get back on site to open our safe so we could leave Thought 140 was very expensive hotel is quite dated and tatty have stayed in much better hotel s that have been cheaper and much better value for money and breakfast wasn t even included in the price , Bed was comfortable room was good size 
376052,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The king size bed is basically 2 single beds pushed together and was uncomfortable to sleep on as you could feel where the mattress joins together I had asked for hand soap for the bathroom as there wasn t any but never got it, It s was very nice

376060,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The bathroom was a little tired with an unpleasant smell of damp and could benefit from a refit A surprise was the recent addition of a 5 overnight parking charge which was waived when I stated that free overnight parking was stated on the booking form however it would make me think twice about returning for more than a one night stay , Large comfortable room and very quiet The breakfast was excellent and staff very pleasant and helpful 
376061,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Pokey little single room more like a cupboard than a bedroom with a a very poor single bed My colleague paid the same price and had an adequate double room For just under 100 I would expect something better Tried to change room but was fobbed off saying that the hotel was full Breakfast was very poor so all in all not much going for it Have stayed this year in over couple of dozen hotels but this one is easily bottom of the list particularly as I booked it 6weeks in advance my colleague booked 1day in advance , Very little relative to price point 
376062,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Room was much smaller than pictured staff was rude when I asked about it No AC And I had 2 very large spiders in my room The night manager gave out my room number and let a person come to my room without my knowledge at 1am Could of been a murderer also the guy wasn t asked any kind of ID and was just pointed to my room Very very unprofessional and unsafe , Style of the restaurant but unfortunately not the food 
376063,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, There were no designated car parking spaces for the hotel guests so I was ask to park on the road and move the car at a later stage which was very inconvenient I was woken by the night staff at 1 15 am and asked to move my car even though nobody had complained as I was eventually in a car parking space The reason for this was that the night receptionist felt my car might be damaged by hotel staff as it was in a space near an exit that was being used to clear a room They thought it would be much better to wake a paying guest than keep an eye on the people they had either let in or employ They also had no idea why I would be upset about this as they thought they were doing me a favour unbelievable Also booking through Booking com I was led to believe that I was booking a room that would normally demand a rate of 200 per night and that I was lucky enough to get a discounted rate of 96 There is no way that room should be 200 per night ever I have tried phoning the hotel to talk to the manager but the line is always busy , It was within the area I needed to be
376064,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The room was not as expected in any way Very dated unclean and did not show any resemblance to the picture that you use to advertise the hotel Very disappointing , The location was good for where I wanted to be

376072,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The restaurant launched a new menu the night I stayed and the kitchen didn t have half the meals they didn t even have soup or pate I m a veggie so had a choice of one thing that came undercooked despite us waiting over an hour for the food i refused to pay for the meal or the wine consumed I realise the hotel is being re vamped and it really needs it as its a pretty tired place Looks like it needs a vacuum in places, The gardens and function room
376073,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Standard room wasn t what was advertised on the website being given another room to walk in on a naked man As you can appreciate neither of us were impressed I couldn t get out of the room fast enough The staff finding this funny when i told them no hairdryer in the room I couldn t get a hot shower as the water was lukewarm quite a distance to walk from the rooms to the bar new menu was implemented on the day I arrived however they hardly had any of the dishes they were advertising It got to the point when i asked the waitress to advise what they actually had to offer which wasn t much as this would be easier than me asking for things to be told they didn t have it I work away quite often and stay in hotels on a regular basis however I will not be returning to this particular hotel , In all honesty I am struggling to think of any positives for my stay at this hotel
376074,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The receptionist was very rude and unhelpful kept saying we had booked extra beds and dinner when we hadn t as we were going to my party in the evening she said we were wrong the bathroom in dire need of a good clean long hair on the toilet seat tiles dirty and damp smell bar food was dire food was sent back and we had to go across the road to the pub to eat Couldn t pay by card at the bar because someone had nicked the card machine And to top the lot our friends car was trashed by other guests at a wedding there so all in all not a good experience for mine and my fianc 50th birthday , The rooms have been done up which were better apart from bathroom Bed was quite comfy

376080,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The wifi was very poor also the check out time should be at 12 like most hotels because if you come to your room late from a party like we did with a 2 year old we couldn t have a lay in til 12 and felt we was rushed off our feet including my poor son who s only turned 2 that was still tired , The bedroom was very nice bed was comfortable
376081,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, We were disappointed to find out that if we had booked directly with the hotel it would have been considerably cheaper Also we didn t realize that the price did not include breakfast We have stayed at this hotel for quite a few years when it was part of the Menzies chain and the price was much cheaper last year at 80per night including breakfast ,No Positive

376092,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Hallmark Prince Regent hotel excels in setting poor standards I have never given negetive feedback about any hotel that I have book via Booking com but Hallmark Princes Regent is in a class of its own , We didn t like anything about our stay at the Hallmark Hotel Prince Regent the staff were completely unprofessional and the room that we were given didn t have a window or air conditioning meaning no natural light or ventilation

376103,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Room was very warm with nothing but a small desk fan for ventilation and small windows with limited opening Felt the room was overpriced with dated decor for something billed as a superior double room Not being told about the change in price of breakfast if not booked on arrival Areas that could easily be painted so don t look so grubby , Friendliness of some staff Large bathroom

376119,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Shabby walls windows needed cleaning and corridors refreshing pillows were flat and hard Request for soft fluffy ones ignored Was told they didn t have spares Don t think it deserves 4 star rating ,No Positive
376120,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The booklet said there was 24 hour room service but when I called at 10 30pm for a bottle of water they said they were closed and the next morning called for some lattes and was told they don t have room service at the weekend , Loved the tea coffee facilities
376121,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Breakfast morning one went cold very quickly plates were cold too tables weren t ready at breakfast and staff seriously overworked at breakfast too so had to wait for coffee tea along with bowls mild and even a spoon Room was a little too warm with no way of adjusting temperature as far as we could see Not sure this is a 4 star hotel in my opinion, Nice helpful staff although looked rather understaffed at breakfast second morning nice bed and room although bathroom a little small Good evening meal too
376122,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, the food was a little poor at times, The staff were very friendly esp the bar staff and the managment the accommodation was very relaxing and a great night s sleep will choose this hotel for more business trips to Essex in the future
376123,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Nothing it was all good, The hotel was really quiet and within walking distance of the tube If you like a hike however it s on 4 40 in a taxi The breakfast ladies are so nice they make you feel at home and nothing is too much trouble 
376124,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The rooms need updating the bathroom was dirty and there was dust and mould The bed was dipped in the middle of the mattress so was very uncomfortable The fire alarm went off at 1am for 30 seconds and there was no explanation in the morning It was very expensive for the standard of room Probably the most old fashions room I have ever stayed in The smell in the room was musky and you noticed it as soon as you open the door ,No Positive
376125,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Rooms need air conditioning or at the very least a more effective fan in the bathroom as the bathroom was very steamed up The food was not always hot and did not appear as described on the menu for dinner The communal areas of the hotel probably need a bit of a makeover A very minor point I thought the numbers on the doors didn t go with the floors like most other hotels , The staff were very helpful and accommodating Everyone we encountered was cheerful and friendly Lovely room decor big comfy bed with lots of pillows 
376126,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, I booked a superior room and got nothing more than a standard room Paid 124 room only value for money was poor Nothing was said or done when I complained would not stay in this hotel again ,No Positive
376127,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Bad service in the restaurant in the evening food took forever to arrive In the room there were what looked like red wine stains all down one wall The carpet was terrible covered with a Variety of different coloured stains all over it didn t want to walk on it without something on our feet In the morning when we were having our showers we had to endure builders in the room above us sawing hammering and making a lot of noise not what we expected especially when they knew our room was occupied Safety Chain on the door had a chain but not a catch on it to enable us to use it , Breakfast was good and so was the service but that is the only good thing we can say about this hotel 
376128,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Long way to room lucky I had nothing heavy Wasn t asked if I wanted tea coffee at breakfast in fact wasn t acknowledged at all I was asked for 106 for room at Reception when package was 71 , Room and facilities in room comfortable though I was given free upgrade room 
376129,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, As above all of it, Staff didn t know what they were doing tried to charge me twice after I prepaid also tried to charge me cash for the non 24 hour room service when I had left deposit I had to show them receipt
376130,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Always a long walk to the rooms The toilet seat did not match the pan size and thus reduced the aperture and the comfort of attending to business , The room was very nice and even had a stained glass window
376131,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The shower rail was broken hanging off then completely broke when was using the shower was given t win room when paid for a superior room waited 45 minutes for drinks order to be delivered to our room cost was 34 was charged 20 on my card for authorisation but then charged a further 36 two days later, Size of the room and the cost
376132,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Filthy common areas Blood stains on internal doors Cold and dirty corridors Faded carpets Chipped paint Stained fabrics in bedroom Outside littered with cigarette ends including undercover carpark used by staff to smoke Room service breakfast 40 mins late Boxing match in function room, Polite barman
376133,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent,No Negative, The room was nice but 2 lamps didn t work paint was pealing in the bathroom breakfast was dried up had to get my own cutlery staff were nice but over run no milk
376134,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Reception staff should not interrupt checking us in to answer the telephone without asking us Hotel is generally tired scruffy I got the impression it catered for single sex groups Guests were noisy when returning to their rooms in the early hours of the morning , Good location for where I wanted to be in Essex Good breakfast Staff friendly 
376135,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Breakfast finishes at 9am on a week day Too early and check out is an hour earlier than most places too We were leisure guests and think 10am is fair to finish breakfast and 12pm check out We had a knock on the door before 10am when chilling after breakfast saying must check out in an hour I think leisure stay clients need a bit more of a relaxed time for breakfast and Check out , Great service location and food and drinks all quality Friendly staff 
376136,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Long walk to the bedrooms and as they had external windows the corridors were very cold , Location to the M11 and opposite the restaurant La Sala I was attending 
376137,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, lONG LONG WALK UP THE RAMP TO THE ROOM WITH LUGGAGE HOLES IN WINDOW GLASS IT WAS COLD I COULD HEAR PERSON NEXT DOOR WHO WAS COUGHING ALL NIGHT, BED MATRESS
376138,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Room was miles away from the main entrance reception Decor was awful vet tired nothing like what advertised online at booking com Glass wad missing from the window We ordered a bottle of champagne the glasses were dusty and they put the bottle down on the table and just walked away for 30 I would have atleat expected them to open the dam bottle , Lady on reception was polite 
376139,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Rooms have a musty smell Rooms are a long way from reception Hard pillows Public areas a bit scruffy tired, Good bar area Lots of car parking space Good location
376140,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Service at breakfast was poor seem like there was a lack of staff to get items for breakfast however staff was very friendly run out of marmalade 2nd day , Location of hotel grounds and gardens very good ideal for dogs 
376141,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Disappointed with public toilet facilities lady s toilet is downstairs Disabled toilets in separate building , Staff very pleasant especially ladies serving at breakfast room 
376142,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, room not clean enough noisy plumbing breakfast staff very surely Tiny telly whole place in need of redecoration and new carpets , good car parking easy check in 
376143,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The bedrooms bathrooms could do with a refurbish they look quite dated and the shower was quite uneffective bed not the most comfortable , The main public areas were nice although surfaces in the bar lounge were quite dusty 
376144,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Wifi kept dropping out Not easy to get to by public transport , Great location for parts of London I enjoy Very comfortable hotel Excellent breakfast Friendly accommodating staff 
376145,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The signage to some of the bedrooms could be better placed as some can only be reached after a lengthy walk down a long annex corridor when poor signage means rooms were easily missed as the use of the lift was required at this point Another set of guests I bumped into wished me luck finding my room , The bedrooms were a good size although some of the carpeting was not in the best condition Room facilities were very good Staff were very nice and dining room was a decent size with good selection of breakfast items 
376146,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Staff were really young and lack experience in customer service rooms long way away from reception and very tired and dated needs revamp Poor communication was charged for things I had but morning reception was not aware of prepayment, The food was good and the communal areas looked bright n clean such as bar and restaurant 
376147,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Due to the functions going on at the hotel parking was rather manic but having got a space we left the car where it was and used public transport The nearest tube station is a good 20 minute walk and taxis not cheap , We had a very quiet room albeit a long way from reception This probably helped as there were a number of functions going on elsewhere in the hotel boxing evening xmas works dinners The building has good character Our room was comfortable clean and spacious 
376148,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, We booked 2 superior rooms and one double There were 4 adults and 3 teenagers Upon arrival we were told that the rooms were not made up for families and had to wait whilst they put extra beds in 2 of the rooms One room was large enough for this but the other was a standard double and the additional bed made it rather cramped We were informed that this always happens with bookings made on Booking com,No Positive
376149,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Staff unhelpful hotel more interested in the functions going on than people staying there No guarantee of a parking space as informed by staff it was on a first come first served basis even though requested on site parking on booking Booked superior room but sure was given ordinary double room where paint peeling off bathroom ceiling toilet bowl cracked and carpet stained Checked out a day early for these reasons and received no apology or regret from staff, Absolutely nothing
376150,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, No 24hr room service breakfast terrible everything swimming with grease no normal toast horrible saturated fried bread fatty bacon snotty eggs almost in edible and certainly not worth the money we tried to order the 24hr room service at about 2am and were told we couldn t have anything not even a sandwich I m afraid to say that this was false advertising and we booked so we could use this facility which was not available we did order room service for lunch which took an hour and a half for these reasons I wouldn t stay again , Room nice and clean
376151,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, There was no hot water in our wing of the hotel which also meant there was no heating The room was also very dated and worn There was a blue bottle in the room as well ,No Positive
376152,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, No heating in room very cold Water not very warm either Room in need of modernisation but set against price it was value for money for a London hotel in Chigwell, Location good close enough to London via road or tube and in a nice area Staff were friendly and bar area was nice
376153,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Unfortunately it was freezing cold in the restaurant We did ask for radiators to be put on and a portable heater was also brought to us Regrettably some of the evening staff serving dinner were not very experienced and one in particular was actually quite rude I just got told to bring it out when we asked for custard rather than ice cream with an apple pie which we ordered Ice cream was the last thing we wanted when we were still defrosting We understand mistakes are made but it was the attitude to the request more than anything else It was also cold on ground floor and another room twin 105 was cold no radiators working , Great location for Woodford Station travelling to London Only 5 min taxi 5 Room 310 Double lovely and modern Evening meal breakfast was good too Reception Breakfast staff and Manager in evening were very pleasant The manager brought us a bottle of wine on the house 
376154,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Public lounge a bit tired Understaffed at breakfast two ladies serving were doing their best it was very busy Had to ask for table to be laid then after 10 mins still waiting for tea coffee then cups and saucers were missing , Stayed in Hotel as wedding guests function held in Hotel Welcoming reception staff and early check in much appreciated Comfortable bed good sized room Good parking facilities some undercover Good choice of breakfast buffet foods although hot dishes were lukewarm 
376155,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The internet connection was extremely poor They allowed pets but would not allow the pet to be left in the room alone so you couldn t leave to eat at a restaurant or leave to eat even in the hotel as restaurants don t allow pets The bathroom taps didn t always work The power in the room kept turning off and we had to call reception to reset it every few hours When we complained they treated us like idiots Then after tried offering to book us into another hotel which we packed for and then they said they forgot about the request Horrible experience ,No Positive
376156,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The hotel is not located at 13 minutes walk from Blackhorse Underground station Doesn t have 4 stars The stairs stinks Horrible staff I vd asked for a cappucino and I was told that they are too busy for that at 7 30 am with 2 other table in the restaurant Non professional staff at all The walls at the room fave mould and I think they belong to an old church , Breakfast good value for money 
376157,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Dirty rooms in fact for Hallmark disgusting The service was shocking and as for breakfast nothing was filled up cutlery crockery filthy , Not a lot 
376158,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, The hotel in general was very tired and in much need of major decoration and carpeting Disapointed with breakfast options and the tables were cleared but not wiped between sittings Plates where not always clean when put out to use Toilet bowl was cracked reported Issues with door cards when returning after a long day in London only to find that the card had wiped clean and had to do the long walk back to reception to have it reset this happened every time we left the hotel One of the lifts had alinement issues and would drop an inch or so as you got in reported Hotel reception is like a tradesmans entrance not a good location , The room was nice and clean and the people were very friendly Ample car parking 
376159,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent,No Negative, Our room was not a family room when we arrived however they very quickly changed our room no fuss or arguement Staff very helpful booking taxis and recommending places to eat

376161,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Cleanliness wasn t the best and the night porters didn t do a very good job of removing other people s room service trays from the corridors which wasn t very nice to see first thing on a morning As a night supervisor in a 4 hotel myself I know what is expected of me The room wasn t ready for us when we arrived as I believe there was some mix up with our booking which wasn t the hotels fault but the reception staff sorted this out quite promptly for us which we thank you for The walk to the bedroom was a long one and the decor was very dated and shabby There was not a very fresh smell in the corridors which you might want housekeeping to take a look at Dusty would be the word I would use We wouldn t use you again but you did serve a purpose and didn t cause us too much problem Sorry for the rant Yours sincerely Dean McKechnie, Good location and easy commute to the centre of London big bed and nice and quiet room 
376162,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Key cards didn t work so had to go all the way back down to reception to get them sorted out The lift is very strange We were in room 216 so most normal hotels would have a lift to go to 2nd floor not this one To get to 216 from ground floor reception you have to take one lift to 1 then walk round to second lift and press 1 again to get to 216 so you can imagine when I got to my room and the key cards both didn t work I was fed up as it takes the most stupid of routes to get there in the first place If you can take the stairs much easier but not ideal if you have heavy luggage Also it would be nice when reception check you in to know what they are talking about We were told breakfast is extra and we had our booking with us to say breakfast included It also shouldn t take two staff to serve one couple we were left waiting when one of the staff could have helped us not a great first impression , Room nice and great breakfast
376163,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, We booked as a couple for the night of our wedding when we got in we found 3 single beds all divided with a chest of draws The shower basin were cracked and looked very dirty too Will not return ,No Positive
376164,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, Tea coffe etc supplied but no milk which was pressumably an oversite , The bottle of Pint Grigio at the bar along with the good service from the barmaid 
376165,Hallmark Hotel London Chigwell Prince Regent, We ordered food in the bar one meal was not cooked properly The staff returned the food to the kitchen and it was never seen again The staff apologised and didn t charge us for the meal and then provided some sandwiches free of charge Next morning at breakfast we ordered eggs these never came , Staff were friendly and prepared to put things right when they went wrong
