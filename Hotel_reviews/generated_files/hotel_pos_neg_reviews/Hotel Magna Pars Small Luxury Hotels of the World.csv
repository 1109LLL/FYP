475303,Hotel Magna Pars Small Luxury Hotels of the World, Temperature in the hotel cold floors in the room number for such price they could ve installed the floor heating at least in the bathroom also Da Noi restaurant had a special short menu during our stay so we couldn t try any tasting menu it offers, Breakfast design staff Parfum in the rooms
475304,Hotel Magna Pars Small Luxury Hotels of the World, Our stay was going well until Saturday night when very loud music was played at the bar I called to complain but the hotel did nothing The music was so loud that it prevented me from sleeping Really frustrating when you have an early morning flight and only get an hour of sleep the night before I would expect a 5 star hotel not to allow music but apparently not The low rating is because of the music ,No Positive

475307,Hotel Magna Pars Small Luxury Hotels of the World, the location is probably the only little push back it s at least 10min walk from nearest Metro station and neighborhood is just OK , The place was just amazing the staff is not just friendly they are taking such a good care of you that you are completely spoiled Breakfasts are at least exceeding expectations variety and quality of products is exceptional even as 5 hotel When I heard that the Restaurant s Chef was awarded Michelin Star I got skeptical expecting big show around and not so much food in it but it turned to be great experience Every dish was piece of art looking smelling and tasting The rooms are gorgeous the care of every detail cleanness and bathrooms with mirror walls are just few details which you will love about this place 
475308,Hotel Magna Pars Small Luxury Hotels of the World, Better access to the local Metro station would have made our stay more convenient The pedestrian bridge was under repair , The comfort staff assistance and ambience was excellent 
475309,Hotel Magna Pars Small Luxury Hotels of the World,No Negative, The quality of the service and food is simply exceptional With a Michelin Star chef in the kitchen every dish is mind blowing so much so that my kids are still talking about the 5 hour egg in a basket

475313,Hotel Magna Pars Small Luxury Hotels of the World, Service very average too expensive and too far to downtown From subway to hotel is too far too If you have largage baby or kids with you not recommend , Basement restaurant not many people but good food with a bit expensive price 
475314,Hotel Magna Pars Small Luxury Hotels of the World, that we could not control the air con Can be noisy, The location is about 20 min away from center I loved the fact that you can explore the real non touristy Milan Local shops and restaurants are great

475319,Hotel Magna Pars Small Luxury Hotels of the World, N A, Hotel is located in the creative heart of Milan surrounded by restaurants and small boutiques You won t see any selfie sticks or umbrella guided tours around you but you might bump into fashionistas or other creatives It is 20 25min walk from Duomo Hotel has an excellent in house restaurant DA NOI IN where we had a fabulous dinner in there Breakfast was excellent too I can t find any faults during my stay as it was truly fabulous From high quality furniture interior finishes Hi Tech room controls to olfactory experience that is deep routed in the history of the hotel ex perfume factory You must stop at LabSolue perfumery located on the G floor where you can learn about smells and buy perfumes too Oh and all rooms have different smells If you like lavender smell ask for room no15 Enjoy 
475320,Hotel Magna Pars Small Luxury Hotels of the World, The room was a bit hot air conditioning was not strong but staff brought us a nice DYSON fan, Chic neighborhood extremely clean and modern hotel fantastic breakfast friendly staff

475322,Hotel Magna Pars Small Luxury Hotels of the World, Very hard to say but if I have to squeeze my meanings I would say that our pet did not have a choice on the cushions , Hidden on the old heart of Milano an ancient factory of perfumes turned in a top 5 star hotel I like to remember a place not for what I saw or touched but for the way I felt and in this place i really felt good the suites were spacious and I can say that the 5 stars don t end at the half the hotel but you cans see it all around Details and new way of seying hospitality we could choose from different pillow a michelin starred room service and a seat in the shower just to mention few and off course all sort of essence around the hotel

475324,Hotel Magna Pars Small Luxury Hotels of the World, Understaffed reception 1 person waited 10 minutes while many staff hang around doing whatever I really wonder Asked for tap water 3 time in the gym before getting it 2 times before staff told me they would bring but nothing arrived Room service was really poor very disappointed by meals tried 3 over maybe 8 10 and they were all cold and sad glass of whine was just awful in quality and ridiculous in quantity I took a picture Breakfast is not great no made to minute food at all only cold things and on my 2nd day nobody offered me coffee Not significant issues but accumulation of small desapointments make the stay good but not great , Overall nice hotel with modern equipments but some details really miss to be a real valuable 5 star I appreciated some attentions small welcoming bottle of champaign good reactivity in room services Was a nice stay but service level could be improved to be a real good value for money 
475325,Hotel Magna Pars Small Luxury Hotels of the World, If you are travelling by bus tram or Metro with luggages its very very difficult as you have to climb the stairs to cross the bridge and also walking with your luggage for another 1 2 km If during rainy days its worst As we know taxi is very expensive in Milan Due to the luggages we have to carry and its rainy day going to airport we have to take taxi which cost us 150 compare to only 15 per person if we go by train n bus There is no signage to the hotel from the station , Hotel room and service is good Staff were excellent in all departments
