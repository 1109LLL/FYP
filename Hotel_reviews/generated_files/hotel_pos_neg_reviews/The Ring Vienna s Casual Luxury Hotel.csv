352814,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, The air conditioning had at times difficulties to keep up with the that should be said very hot and humid weather outside , Very nice room and good service Excellent bar and restaurant in the hotel The location next to the Opera on the grandiose Ring is second to none with the easy access to a number of major sights and public transport 
352815,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, Breakfast buffet could have included some avocado but other than that cannot fault this hotel I will definately be staying here again , Loved the bed huge comfortable best sleep I had my whole trip The morning staff at breakfast were lovely we were greeted by the GM on arrival which was a lovely touch Bathrooms were spotless carpet was clean sheets and towels were fluffy I stayed for 5 days and each was enjoyable and felt like home 
352816,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel,No Negative, Great location in the center of Vienna one walking minutes from Opera house or Carlsplatz metro station The room was large and very comfort was cleaned twice a day the reception persons were very nice and helpful 
352817,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, The front desk staff was often missing My room had very poor wifi connection For the first night stay I couldn t use it at all it keeps on getting disconnected The second night they fixed it and it was just a little better , Love the rooms it was huge Love the furnishing The bed was extremely comfortable and the blanket 
352818,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, There wasnt anything I could fault When I asked if I could get hot water from the coffee machine in my room a kettle was delivered , This was a beautiful Hotel with everything a traveller could want The staff from reception to cleaners to those in lobby and restaurant staff all were so friendly 
352819,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, You could not fault this hotel was abit more expensive but then we were so central, The Bed was fab the hotel was very central The staff were very helpful We had a fab stay breakfast was good would stay again
352820,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, Breakfast was ordinary and not a lot to choose from The lady in charge at breakfast some sort of restaurant manager or something was rude and unpleasant hope not to see her next time but the waitress was very nice and prompt , Great location close to main atractions and Ubahn station Karlplatz Helpfull staf with one exception A bonus point for the fact that they did not charged us for the extra bed for our 8 year old kid will come back for sure
352821,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, Our room did not have a window with a view Instead it was an attic like window that faced the sky The breakfast is too expensive but you can order a room service breakfast for a reasonable price , The staff here was great really helpful and friendly gave us good tips on how to get around and places to go We would stay here again just on the basis of the staff Our room an x ordinary was big and comfortable It is in a great location right next to the Opera and in walking distance to museums Trams and metro right across the street Good restaurants in walking distance 
352822,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel,No Negative, All room appointments and size excellent Staff warm and efficient Hotel well located Visited Vienna several times and this was the best hotel all around we have enjoyed 
352823,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, We got a room without curtains so the room was fully bright at 05 00 when the sun came up I really think curtains are an essential feature of any hotel let alone a 5 star luxury hotel We were really tired and had to change rooms Also the cleaners talked loudly to each other for about an hour at 08 00 which also woke us up on other days They also didn t replace the toiletries in the bathroom so we had to call reception and ask for them The tables at breakfast were jammed in really close and on the first morning a toddler who was 20cm from us threw his toy at my wife Then the eggs we ordered took forever to arrive and we had to sit and watch the couple next to us eat theirs and leave even though we ordered at the same time Also smoking was allowed in the bar which made it off limits to me I d be disappointed if this happened in a mediocre 4 star hotel for 100 per night but in a supposedly luxury hotel at this price it is ridiculous , The location was great
352824,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, While the room was well appointed the hotel would benefit by adding a bar by the shower to get in and out of the shower tub It is a bit dangerous without having the benefit of holding onto something when getting out of the shower , the property was very well located to view all the important sites in Vienna 
352825,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, Breakfast is expensive especially if you aren t going to eat a lot However it is optional and you can make tea or coffee in your room or visit a local cafe , The Ring Hotel is in an ideal location for visiting all the main attractions many of which are within walking distance Those which are a bit further out the Ferris wheel Schonbrunn Palace are only a few stops on the u bahn underground and there is a station Karlsplatz very close to the hotel The stop for the trams which circle the Ringstrasse routes 1 and 2 is close to the hotel too as is the starting point for the hop on hop off sightseeing tours The hotel staff were very helpful and kept us right Our room was quite large with a huge comfy bed and was visited by the housekeeping staff twice a day There is a coffee maker in each room but being Brits we like a cup of tea and the hotel were happy to provide a kettle etc All in all the Ring Hotel is a very good choice for a short visit to Vienna because it is so conveniently placed and the staff are really pleasant and helpful 
352826,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel,No Negative, The staff was very friendly and location super central We only stayed for a night and unfortunately didn t have the time to try the breakfast and other facilities But the room was so nice Specially the bed I ve never slept better it was so comfortable Otherwise the room was very nice very quiet It was also nice that we had bathrobes and soft towels in the bathroom 
352827,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, Nothing A swimming pool would have been nice but that is just being picky , Super friendly caring staff very helpful and efficient Excellent facilities clean and quiet I would definitely book to go there again which is rare for me 
352828,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, We had no issues with this Hotel, Excellent location in the heart of Vienna and close to excellent shopping great restaurants and the Vienna State Opera Our room was large and very comfortable with a very good view over the city The Hotel restaurant provided a high quality breakfast with a good range of hot and cold options Best of all the Hotel staff could not have been more helpful 
352829,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, The rooms at the 6th floor have upward facing windows the bed is not very comfortable for sleeping, Excellent location very helpful and efficient staff great breakfast if included spotless rooms
352830,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, at restaurant the food was excellent but realy not enough in the plate for the price, good service kindness of staff specialy at breakfast and desk room absolutely silent dispite on the ring
352831,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, Breakfast was a little disappointing for the price Eggs Benedict arrived lukewarm and on white toast I got down around 10 and many of the dishes only had remains of cheese or cold cuts on them i e were not being replenished But it s an option and there are plenty of coffee houses nearby , The staff all go out of their way to be helpful The bed was SO comfy and the room was comfortable and well appointed with good wifi service The location is the best possible very central within walking distance of many main attractions and with excellent public transport options almost on the doorstep Will never stay anywhere else when I go to Vienna 
352832,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, Nothing really But a fresh supply of bath foam would have been welcome , The room is comfortable and provides the luxury of a dressing space and a separate lavatory 
352833,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, Can honestly say that I couldn t find a negative one small issue with TV and aircon in the room swiftly efficiently and happily dealt with , Amazing service fantastic location brilliant team all very friendly helpful and knowledgable Great location for a visit to the Opera and exploring Vienna generally can t recommend highly enough made our trip truly memorable Good food especially breakfast great bar but it s the staff here that make the difference nothing is too much trouble truly service with a smile and any enquiry on places to go resulted in excellent directions al marked on a map The General Manager Eugenio Rigo was brilliant and this shows in his team
352834,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, Heating system in the room instructions on how to use would have been useful Also email address on website info theringhotel com got me no response though sent email twice Would like the option of a room with a view onto the street , Friendly and extremely helpful staff on reception Enjoyed the quality of the food at dinner in the restaurant The breakfasts too were very good again served by friendly helpful staff 
352835,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, Noisy room close to the U bahn Metro Hollow bedmattrass Breakfast 32 euro per person not worth the money , Nice hotel friendly staff Close to the city center 
352836,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, Breakfast was a bit hit and miss , Very comfortable bed and good size room Very quiet although right in the centre Easy to walk to attractions and restaurants 
352837,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, the breakfast was average It was nice to be able to choose one hot meal option but aside from that the buffet only had cheese meat and cereal no other hot food , The location was perfect The hotel was lovely including the rooms very spacious and nice touches such as bath robes and extra toiletries Bar was nice and the barman was knowledgeable and friendly 
352838,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, If there is something that i really need to pick that could be improved i would say the fact that the breakfast pastries were left in open air and they did not feel that fresh if you had breakfast around 10 But this was a very very small impediment , Everything was spot on but what i really loved is that it felt cosy for a 5 start hotel usually there is a stiffness that comes with the territory As far as relaxing goes even though our room was facing the front boulevard where a lot of cars and trams are passing by there was absolutely no noise whatsoever in the room We traveled with a new born baby and our stay couldn t have been more care free Also the fact that breakfast is served up to 11 or 12 on weekends was amazing 
352839,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, Bar area could not really relax and unwind after a few miles out and about Not a comfortable space to be in when you want to chill , Location is perfect Staff are excellent happy and very helpful Room was superb 
352840,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, hotel looked very different much nicer in the pictures terrible sound and vibration from the tram passing next to the hotel specially on the first floors bit of a disappointment really, staff location and breakfast
352841,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, The breakfast was very poor There were only croissants coffee cheese ham cornflakes bread and yogurt If you want to eat something hot it has scrupled or fried eggs and pancakes it was included in the breakfast but you had to order it and wait at list 10 15 min This waiting time was with no other people in the breakfast room imagine a busy day , The rooms were huge Very comfortable bed and excellent location 
352842,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, Room acceptable with the exception of mansard it as a 3 star and the meager breakfast, the hotel is very good in the center in front of the Opera personal very professional and friendly
352843,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, The hotel is boutique in terms of the foyer which is very small as are the lifts The corridors are quite narrow so it can feel a little claustrophobic My room was on the 4th floor and looked over the inner courtyard This meant it was dark enough to need the lights on all the time which I personally dislike having to do I was disappointed to be paying over 350 for a room with an internal view but I had asked for a quiet room and it was blissfully silent so perhaps this was the reason On their website it states that most X Ordinary rooms come with a walk in wardrobe which mine didn t have which again I was disappointed about as what girl doesn t want a walk in wardrobe Perhaps I was given this room as it was for single occupancy The gym is small but well equipped Located in the attic or top floor it has low ceilings so again is a little claustrophobic I loved this hotel but it was beyond my budget to stay for longer than one night so having booked for 3 nights the hotel kindly allowed me to change my booking at the last minute to one night only When I checked out I was aware they had smaller lower priced rooms available and was curious as to whether or not one of these might be offered They were not As I had not yet booked anywhere else but needed a room for another 2 nights this was a missed opportunity for them , The location is fantastic Could not be better The woman at the check in desk was supremely helpful and friendly They knew my preferences and she offered to take me up to my room The doorman also offered to help with my luggage as did the porter Everyone I encountered was helpful smiley and friendly I stayed in an X Ordinary room which was lovely Spacious with a gorgeous red velvet sofa a writing desk and a very comfortable king size bed with lovely feather pillows The TV swivelled around to face either bed or sofa which was very useful I felt very comfortable in this room could have certainly stayed for a long time A lot of care and attention has been taken to create a welcoming comfortable relaxing atmosphere and it works The bathroom had 2 sinks a separate loo and a rainforest shower with additional shower head Lovely luxurious soaps etc in the bathroom A vanity kit in the bathroom just when I needed a nail file Nespresso machine in the bedroom The Ring hotel has is all highly recommended

352847,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, Some construction taking place in front of the hotel We had some problem with the first room but hotel supervisor resolved the issue promptly , Location is absolutely city center The staff are professional helpful and warm The hotel made our trip to Vienna memorable and will sure to come back and stay here next time 
352848,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, The hotel is cleverly decorated and looks luxurious and comfortable at first glance However the amenities and furniture are a cheap imitation of a real 5 star hotel Friendly receptionists are dressed in ill fitting uniforms trying to make you feel welcome However they can not take the attention of the poorly decorated reception and cafeteria style breakfast room The hotel is situated right at the city center which is really great but arriving at the hotel is difficult because there is no possibility for taxis to park and the tramline runs right next to the hotel Lastly the complementary internet connection in the rooms is slow and disconnects so you barely can check and answer your emails Having said this the hotel is nice and very central but should not be graded a 5 star hotel , the location of the hotel is fantastic Right in the center of the city The suites are very spacious with barely outside noices bothering the guests The beds are really comfortable too

352873,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, I reserved the standard room and got a very small one with only a tiny window worn out decoration non functioning air conditioning and a strange smell in the room That type of a room one would expect in a grumpy three star hotel but not in a hotel that is marked as five stars in the Booking com After the first night I felt cheated and decided that I will check out next morning and change to a better hotel , When trying to cancel my reservation because of my bad first night experiences the hotel staff was very friendly and offered me a free upgrade to a more spacious confortable room with also a well functioning air conditioning Overlooking the challenges of regular room category in this hotel the X ordinary rooms are good the hotel location is great and the beds are quite soft and above average when compared across similar hotels The staff is also friendly and attentive to the customers needs

352875,The Ring Vienna s Casual Luxury Hotel, I specifically requested in advance a King Size bed which would not be made of 2 smaller beds joined together and when we got to the hotel the bed was made of two smaller ones I reserved the right to check out the next day if the bed wasn t comfortable and a somewhat rude Karoline front desk manager told me that the fair I paid USD 500 night was not reimbursable Breakfast is super expensive and far from what s available and better in the area, Room was great Free bottle of champagne Convenient location Great professional attitude from Petra at the front desk
