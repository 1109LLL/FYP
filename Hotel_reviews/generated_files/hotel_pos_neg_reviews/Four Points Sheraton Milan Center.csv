476640,Four Points Sheraton Milan Center, Minor issues only as 1 out of 5 rooms were not ready till after 5pm A bit longer than expected walk to train station A pool would make it perfect 10 for us as we had 7 kids in our party , Comfortable and clean rooms easy check in and out great breakfast spread courteous and friendly staff Additional bed at no cost for 1 child per room Great recommendation to a close by Italian restaurant that ended up being highlight of our entire trip 
476641,Four Points Sheraton Milan Center, In the first night and we came very late we got room 1025 in the first floor It was a bit stinky at the bathroom had no key but only the emergency card and was not so clean But we asked to change it and immediately it was change to room number 526 which was really excellent, The room was executive good room and the breakfast was excellent All was well and the hotel staff were very helpful understanding and cooperative 
476642,Four Points Sheraton Milan Center, Nothing, 1 It s near central station subway shuttle bus to airport and many good restaurant nearby good location 2 This is the second time I stayed in this hotel good service friendly staff and fast wifi 3 My friends found they forgot a bottle of Champagne in their room already 3 hours after checked out and they were in the airport to go back China so they asked me to check if possible to find it the hotel staff is very kind helped to find and give it to me very quickly 
476643,Four Points Sheraton Milan Center, No iron in the room I had to go to the pressing room on the first floor Room was upgraded to next level and I got old style room instead of mordern and renovated as a result Water regulation was very hard probably because room has whirlpool instead of regular shower , Hotel offers the cell phone with internet and phone calls You can use the phone while you stay 
476644,Four Points Sheraton Milan Center,No Negative, Very comfortable bed and pillows Great location close to train and Metro Lovely breakfast Excellent staff Loved the charging centre in the room to charge all devices at once 
476645,Four Points Sheraton Milan Center, Rooms are very cramped and air conditioning didn t work Breakfast was very average and its a long walk from any of the tourist attractions shopping and decent nightlife I wouldn t recommend for a city break , Clean and had all the basic amenities
476646,Four Points Sheraton Milan Center,No Negative, Staff were very helpful and welcoming The beds were super comfortable and bathrooms modern and really clean We loved the breakfast buffet that was included in the price and I usually hate buffets but the food selection was excellent staff so polite and helpful Four Points is an easy 5 minute walk to the beautiful Milan Centrale train station We used the metro to get into old Milan and the national trains for a day trip to Bergamo so easy 
476647,Four Points Sheraton Milan Center, the compelte infrastructure is realy old breakfast was to easy not enough choise I don t think it was dailly made on site or 1 2 days old , the staff was great the location is ok 2 min walk to the sub 15m walk to the center quite relax
476648,Four Points Sheraton Milan Center,No Negative, This hotel had the Handy device from Infocus which is a cellphone with free data and calls to use during your stay It works as an amazing city guide to help navigate and provide suggestions for restaurants and attractions
476649,Four Points Sheraton Milan Center, Some rooms are renovated but unfortunately ours wasn t , Excellent location for railway station About 20 minutes walking from Duomo square Very clean rooms comfortable bed Breakfast variety and good quality 
476650,Four Points Sheraton Milan Center,No Negative, Every room has a mobile phone with 4G connection which you can take around with you while travelling in the city or neighbouring areas which is extremely good when you do not want to turn on your roaming connection This was a big surprise for us as we didn t expect this 
476651,Four Points Sheraton Milan Center, Even though the time of my visit was during the most important exhibition for furniture in Milan the guest who pays Euros 2 120 plus city tax euros 20 for 5 days expect at least to receive the minimum service corresponding to that money On the contrary what I received was the following 1 Nobody cared if I am a Gold SPG member or not no discussion for upgrade of course 2 It was impossible to have a shower in the morning as you were either freezing or burning 3 The executive room which I booked is rather the smallest standard room of another hotel 4 If you want to have a fresh orange juice or an omelette in the breakfast you have to pay 5 and 8 euros accordingly Otherwise you get a cheap liquid which has the flavor and the color of the orange juice Don t forget that we are talking for a 4 star hotel 5 The sheets were changed in 5 days just once 6 Although they have complimentary coffee in the room they leave you only one small bottle of water free Then you have to be charged So you can have only one cup of coffee and few sips of water 7 The breakfast room is in the basement which have no windows 8 I made the mistake to arrive at 11 00 hrs and I had to wait 3 hours to get the room they respect what they inform you when booking and they keep repeating saying that when somebody complains 9 The rooms are very dark with very less sunlight and with very old furniture In general any traveler has to avoid staying in that hotel For the same money I have stayed in the past in much better hotels as for instance the LA GARE Hotel which is very close to the Four Points Sheraton I had stayed in the La Gare last year but I decided to stay in Four Points Sheraton given that I am a Gold SPG member A mistake which I will never repeat , Literally noting at all and I am not biased 
476652,Four Points Sheraton Milan Center, New style room don t have shelves or drawers where to put clothes What was the architect thinking That a business traveller will hang all his shirts and keep socks and underwear on the floor Crazy , Location price old style rooms staff parking nearby good breakfast good free internet with no limitations

476658,Four Points Sheraton Milan Center, The room decoration are a not out to date The bed was comfortable but because it was 2single bed put together feeling the gap in between was not nice Walls are a bit thin as I was hearing my neighbours from time to time , I liked the staff who was very pleasant and welcoming The room was OK but my double bed was actually 2 single bed so you felt the separation while sleeping Breakfast was nice and you had a lot of choice The foccacia when you come back from a long day of work are very a good idea And the water in the room was much more appreciated
