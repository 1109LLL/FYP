132479,Grand Pigalle Hotel, I cannot think of a single thing i didn t like , LOVE this little hotel It is stylish staff are so friendly and gave us an amazing room Could have spent the whole time in the room and bathroom it was that good Had the best sleep in 6 weeks down to comfort of the bed The pillows we lovely duvet soft and the best linen in have ever slept in so soft I would love to buy a set You can sit in the side of the bar at cute tables that overlook the street and people watch while drinking delicious wine perfect 
132480,Grand Pigalle Hotel, My time in Paris was too short, Location leaves you feeling like a local as well as a tourist Boulangerie bars restaurants at your footsteps A great hotel and Paris on your footsteps 
132481,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Surprisingly the bed was uncomfortable Although the airco was turned off there was a continuous noise from a heating or water system the whole night through on and off very disturbing , location design friendly staff 
132482,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Nothing really to share about that Maybe our experience looking for the bottle opener in the middle of the night in the room even I had an idea that we can ask it from the front desk just love the place , Basiligue was so close just visited top of the hill daylight Extremely friendly people around heavenly soft and comfortable bed after super tired days delicious breakfast all these small fancy little details that makes you feel happy and special 
132483,Grand Pigalle Hotel,No Negative, Very nice staff very trendy crowd the decoration is themed perfectly i became a big fan of this Hotel The bar offers professional mixology and fancy snacks 
132484,Grand Pigalle Hotel, The room was surprisingly small and I found the design notes to focus too much on flash and too little on well design e g the attractive bedside tables that were useless for holding common bedside items the shower doors that make grabbing a towel awkward the lever lock key attached to a bulky tassel that are not pocket friendly In the restaurant it s hard to escape the smoke from outside without sitting back in a dark cave and I did not find the bartenders welcoming at all , The location worked quite well with easy access to the 2 and 12 M tro lines and interesting restaurants bakeries and bars nearby south and east of the property The staff was helpful and patient they tolerated my deteriorated French and happily switched to English when I needed to communicate anything complicated The room was comfortable thanks to the bed balcony and climate control 
132485,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Breakfast didn t look tempting especially at that price Many better choices around , Location was excellent for exploring an area we were not very familiar with Having a drink at one of the little outside tables was a bonus on a very warm evening as was the excellent wine list Bed was very comfortable too and staff super helpful and friendly 
132486,Grand Pigalle Hotel, The shower bathroom was very small , Very friendly staff beautiful decor inside and super location for exploring Pigalle and Montmartre Also convenient for getting the Eurostar at the Gare du Nord Would definitely stay here again 
132487,Grand Pigalle Hotel, For the price this hotel was disappointing The closet door fell off when we arrived and our only view was of a dirty rooftop Despite having vacant rooms available the staff would not move our booking Also the bathroom walls had someone else s hair still on them At a hotel with this rating I expected better , Location was great 
132488,Grand Pigalle Hotel, It s a bit noisy at the night as you can hear the people talking through the window , The decoration inside the room is excellent The receptionist friendly and willing to offer good service 
132489,Grand Pigalle Hotel,No Negative, Area was great very close to good restaurants grocery shops and cafes Vibrant area but the room was quiet top floor Room had a balcony with table and chairs which was a nice bonus and actually made the room feel bigger I feel the price of the hotel considering the rest of Paris was very fair Restaurant in the hotel does amazing food but was a bit pricy enough Although all of paris is pricy so I m being over critical there It was all awesome 
132490,Grand Pigalle Hotel, I m not a big fan of the food from the room service, This is one of my favorite hotels It s trendy but not too trendy and the rooms are all great The beds are so comfy There s a nice bar downstairs which is great for a wine in the evening and meeting new people Always many interesting characters here from creative businesses The Pigalle area is super cool with nice cafes and lovely shops It s less crowded than the centre which is why I like it 
132491,Grand Pigalle Hotel, What makes the hotels location interesting lively and buzzing unfortunately also makes it not nice It s located 500 metres from the Moulin Rouge and a whole street of sex shops where we were propositioned to enter sex clubs and were offered drugs by dubious looking characters This area is easy to avoid but the overspill from that area does get to the hotel area Breakfast is EUR19 pp Not worth this price , This Hotel was fantastic A real little boutique hotel Great bar restaurant breakfast area Our room was very small but the d cor was really nice Bathroom fine The staff were all really helpful A young competent team Great bars and restaurants nearby A bit tricky to get to the River and the Tourist hotspots if you don t plan in advance 
132492,Grand Pigalle Hotel, The highest floor did not have elevator access so we had to take the elevator to the 5th floor and carry the luggage up It was not a huge deal and the staff offered to help if we needed but we decided to handle it ourselves , We arrived at this super cute boutique hotel in an area we did not explore the last time we were in Paris The location was great and the area generally felt like a locals area which was a nice change since we stayed in Le Marais last time The front desk staff was extremely helpful and our hotel room was ready HOURS EARLIER This was fantastic since we had an early flight from Barcelona and wanted to freshen up before we went out for the day They handed us a very cute key with a leather tassel and we headed for our room which the staff said was the best room We had the corner unit with a large bathroom on the top floor We had a cute little seating area pictures included The beds were comfortable and had a little sweet treat on each pillow The room was very clean and had a coffee machine and a very nice mini bar fridge The selection was superb all high end more rare type of stuff that you typically do not see in hotel mini fridges The room had so many windows and great views of Sacre Coure The location was really awesome the more we explored the neighborhood We Used Yelp to help us find some restaurants and chose one nearby that was perfect It was walking distance to the hotel and the bread came from the bakery right next door to our hotel Turns out our server at the restaurant recommended us to go to the bakery next to our hotel because it s his mom s bakery We went the next day and bought so much All of it was extremely delicious Get the waffle Anyway there are several restaurants and great shops in this area and on the same street as the hotel It is great to walk around an explore without the crowds of Le Marais The bar at the hotel is also fantastic They had a great selection the bartender was super nice and he made great cocktails based on a liquor we wanted They had mezcal there which surprised me as I haven t found much in Europe He made a great citrusy and spicy cocktail 
132493,Grand Pigalle Hotel,No Negative, the quaintness of the hotel and the staff were so helpfull after showering before going out at night we returned to find they had replaced our towels with fresh ones when they turned down our beds for the night even though they had already been replaced every morning which i thought was great 
132494,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Rumble at night turned out to be the Metro running underneath the hotel Fine for 1 night could become an issue if you stay longer , Location boutique style hotel cosy small but convenient rooms staff 
132495,Grand Pigalle Hotel, I don t recall any cons for this hotel as me and my partner were very happy on our stay We were lucky to get a room out the back of the building as we heard that some people complain about the noise outside and particularly down at the bar of the hotel , It is a lovely hotel Very comfortable with the room size according to Paris standard The bathroom and shower were great and very clean The staff were very nice and helpful Even when the front desk was busy they would always have time for any questions The location of the hotel is very good Only 15 min walk from the the train station to the airport and very close to the underground A lot of restaurants near by and very safe area 
132496,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Our room was extremely hot for some reason and for us the bed was a little soft but this is a very personal thing , We have stayed here before and will again we really like the South Pigalle location and the decor of the hotel and the rooms 
132497,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Wine and food very expensive Rooms very small but this wasn t an issue for me as it was nice to sit in the bar and read , The staff the bar the breakfast
132498,Grand Pigalle Hotel,No Negative, Loved the fact that there was salad available for breakfast as well as any kind of eggs hard to find proper breakfast in Paris when you re allergic to milk and gluten 
132499,Grand Pigalle Hotel, A nice breakfast but limited choice Mostly breads , The staff were very friendly and the beds were extremely comfy Small room but nicely decorated Good location near to Metro Very satisfied over all 
132500,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Room is small Bathroom and especially the shower is extremely tight Shower has old school curtain , Great value for money Very cozy feeling Nice design Nice people Cool bar Nice neighbourhood Clean 
132501,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Lower floors facing courtyard can be perceived as loud due to the ventilation systems Rooms are small old Paris is like that , Very friendly and helpful staff Good breakfast selection and service Decent wi fi connection Rooms had a contemporary design Very close to metro stations Pigalle and Saint Georges
132502,Grand Pigalle Hotel, That when we arrived there was a man in our room with no explanation We then realised that the air con was broken The house keeper lady seemed a bit rude when we asked if there was a problem I feel the room service menu was poor and wrongly priced It seemed too expensive for what was on offer and when we asked for something it wasn t available It was a little confusing having so many different checking in staff I think it s more personal with 1 Someone like Audrey , I manage a hotel so from my point of view It was nice that the hotel staff spoke English and were friendly on check in Audrey was very helpful and asked us questions about our stay The guys booked a taxi for us which was nice I like the uniform style and the presence of the staff 
132503,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Everything was brilliant, The decor and the restaurant bar in the lobby was amazing The breakfast was divine and the service and hotel staff were absolutely lovely
132504,Grand Pigalle Hotel,No Negative, This was my second stay at The Grande Pigalle for the second leg of my holiday I was a little worried because my first stay was in a superior room but all fears were laid to rest Smaller rooms are still beautiful and clean and I got a balcony as requested This hotel definitely helps to set a Parisian tone with it s decor and architecture 
132505,Grand Pigalle Hotel, loved everything, The most important thing to me was cleanliness and the place was impeccable from the rooms to the bathrooms and even the restaurant bar restrooms downstairs The fact that the staff was courteous and extremely helpful was an added bonus The rooms are beautiful and the views are dynamic at any angle 
132506,Grand Pigalle Hotel, struggled with the wifi but it eventually connected Room had a very small shower, yes yes has it all superb linens artisan cocktails in the minibar awesome breakfast fantastic staff Details in the rooms were super 
132507,Grand Pigalle Hotel, We had a room that looked out onto the street and when we opened the windows it was really noisy due to traffic and bin collection But this is only really a problem if you dont like air con like us and prefer to have the windows open for air , This was the nicest hotel The staff were extra helpful and kind They had a fab bar and was in the perfect location 
132508,Grand Pigalle Hotel,No Negative, The services and the people the whole hotel ambiance we specially liked the guy working at the bar he was a star and the girl on reception was very helpful she checked us in earlier than the standard time and made sure we had a nice room with view 
132509,Grand Pigalle Hotel,No Negative, Excellent staff and the cleanliness of the hotel was excellent Breakfast okay not much choice The bed was really comfy and the room was a little on the small side but adequate I would definitely stop again fantastic part of Paris 
132510,Grand Pigalle Hotel, None , The location SOPI is the upcoming chic neighbourhood in Paris A lot of bars bakery florists around the corner hence quite a lot beautiful people to watch Especially a restaurant named Buvette simply fabulous but unpretentious eatery The room itself is great too big bathroom nice sofa area and heavenly bedding 
132511,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Breakfast somewhat limited and slowly refilled for a high price high quality property , Great location wonderful staff nicely decorated clean rooms Cool bar 
132512,Grand Pigalle Hotel, They do not serve proper food on a Monday evening only cheese and desserts and there was no notice of this anywhere , Beautifully decorated throughout friendly and helpful staff good breakfast and close to metro
132513,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Nothing at all It was great , Can t rate this hotel highly enough Fantastic location beautiful rooms comfy beds and really friendly staff We loved it 
132514,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Very busy loud location Air conditioning not so good Was awakened at 4 30 by people partying on street Elevators were to small for two people and two suitcases, Very friendly staff Nice bar and breakfast
132515,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Saying goodbye the the reception staff, Placed perfect for everything location location great place to stay recommend to all that come to rome staff cannot do enough for you
132516,Grand Pigalle Hotel, No bottle opener in the room otherwise cannot fault it , An absolutely beautiful hotel in a very cool area Minutes from Rue des Martyr where there are lots of little patisseries cafes and shops to browse Very close to the Sacre Coeur and a really great local vibe with everyone eating and drinking outside until the early hours Lovely room with a huge bath amazing big windows and decorated immactulately with really cool Art Deco touches The hotel has a beautiful spiral staircase and a lovely bar area where we enjoyed drinks both evening Top notch and good value for money The bed was extremely comfy Would definitely recommend 
132517,Grand Pigalle Hotel, No car park But that just isn t possible, It was perfect Ideal location friendly helpful and professional staff and the most comfortable bed possible 
132518,Grand Pigalle Hotel,No Negative, We loved the location easy to walk to see the sites and also close to a Metro stop also lots of different bars and restaurants in walking distance the bed was very comfortable and I loved the decor very art deco The staff were nice and helpful and breakfast was pretty good We ll definitely stay here again on future trips to Paris lovely room and perfect location
132519,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Very noisy Breakfast expensive 19 euros each, Lovely hotel Nice room Good shower Excellent location Plenty of bars coffee shops nearby Metro nearby
132520,Grand Pigalle Hotel, There was literally not a single thing that I didn t love , The homemade pre bottled cocktails in the mini bar were an extra special treat Amazing negronis And all of the staff here went above and beyond for me so incredibly friendly and always super helpful I definitely hope to come back 
132521,Grand Pigalle Hotel, There was no place to put toiletries in the bathroom and the desk inside the room was too tiny Other than that room size was ok and there was good light The staff was nice just enough but not friendly except 2 girls in reception When you stay at a neighbourhood like Pigalle i guess the interaction i am looking for is friendly not polite There wasn t anything happening in the hotel regarding music as well If you are looking for that music art something creative you won t find it here I can say overall the hotel is convenient but nothing special Location is good as you are at the heart of Pigalle but if you want to sleep early don t get a room looking at the street , The bed was extra comfy good light in the room Breakfast was good nothing extraordinary but everything was fresh and tasty Nice granola Reception helpful 
132522,Grand Pigalle Hotel,No Negative, We loved our stay The hotel was perfect cool design clean with a really nice bar and friendly stay It was also really well located We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Paris 
132523,Grand Pigalle Hotel, I don t think the carpets and the bathrooms were that clean , Breakfast yummy staff super friendly and helpful The bed was SUPER comfortable Nothing was too much for the staff and they smiled even though the day was grim 
132524,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Paris is reaaaally expensive in general for a portuguese and you pay a lot if you want something nice not luxurious i mean just nice and attractive , Very friendly staff nice location with local life nice cafes and restaurants away from the usual tourist area a step from montmartre and pigalle metro station 
132525,Grand Pigalle Hotel, There should be a few English TV channels , Room was of good size especially for Paris Beds were great and the best was an adjoining terrace garden where we could sit out and have breakfast and dinner The staff is fantastic especially Jean The location is near the Pigalle centre and metro Shops and restaurants are nearby including and Indian one Kasturi 
132526,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Last time we paid for room level 3 and had a perfect little room with balcony on 5th floor This time we paid more level 4 but the room was on the first floor and without a balcony So I think you can have a better room by paying less if you take level 3 Anyways we paid still a little more and were upgraded to a perfect room on the 6th , Stylish new place We have stayed here already twice and want to come back I loved the interior with every detail as well as their cosy bar and restaurant downstairs The location in South Pigalle is perfect and it s only one minute walk to the metro station 
132527,Grand Pigalle Hotel,No Negative, When I arrived I checked in then asked the polite man at the reception if he could help me with a problem I had with a train booking to Amiens for a guided tour that had been cancelled due to rail workers strikes Not even not did he help to resolve the issue but he used his personal credit card to make an alternative train booking for me as they only accepted French credit cards What a champion great service lovely hotel recommend to anyone staying in Paris 
132528,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Closet space was a little small and the towels were disappointingly thin and small for a hotel that was well provisioned in every other way , Super comfortable bed lovely decor polite and helpful staff Location great for lots of trendy shops and eateries The Henry Monnier room was spacious enough for our needs Bar downstairs was excellent Can t comment on breakfast as this wasn t included in our stay and the hotel was a 5 minutes walk from a boulangerie 
132529,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Extremely small room we ve stayed in many paris hotels before the pics are slightly misleading though nicely decorated, Location was nice Clean room Nice decor 
132530,Grand Pigalle Hotel, The neighbour was really loud I guess it was a honeymoon night , I loved the style of the room the view the location the quality of everything in the room
132531,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Seating for breakfast is at low tables , Great Location comfortable beds good atmosphere in hotel and locally Really friendly and helpful staff Would recommend Ito Izakaya Japanese tapas round the corner and Tea Folies on Rue Henry Monnier Easy walk to Sacre Coeur and Dali Museum via Funicular and also Moulin Rouge and Metro for everywhere else Area around hotel is lovely but be aware that around Moulin Rouge has more adult themes My children 16 and 13 were unfazed by it all 
132532,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Everything was perfect nothing was too much trouble for the staff and our room meals and experience was excellent , Excellent location and beautiful area Hotel staff were very welcoming and helpful Our room was spacious and decorated to a very high standard We had a very enjoyable break and will definitely be returning 
132533,Grand Pigalle Hotel, nothing , Great location great room with very comfy bed great price Very friendly and helpful staff good coffee and cocktails at the bar nice croissants in the morning My 5th trip to Paris and by far the best hotel I have stayed in Lots of cool little bars and cafe s around the area super close to Metro and easy walk up to Montmatre and Sacre Couer 
132534,Grand Pigalle Hotel,No Negative, The Hotel was by far one of the most beautiful hotels i have ever stayed at Very parisien with an amazing view great cocktail bar awesome employees the minibar was super original and personal breakfast delicious The whole hotel was super detail oriented and I just completely loved it And the price quality is extremely high I am going to stay here way more often WOW 
132535,Grand Pigalle Hotel, The smallest elevator of all time Quite funny with just the two of you in it but with an extra person it s quite the task to get you all in and we both weigh about 10 and a bit stone soaking wet , Booked the Grand Pigalle room for my wife s birthday trip I would advise if you have the extra money to stretch to this pull the trigger It s a classy room not massive but big by Paris standards on the 5th floor Has a balcony and felt a little like Wes Anderson had a hand in the decor clearly a bonus particularly like the cocktail glass carpetted hallways and gold pineapples on the doors All in all a very nice boutique hotel in a good location not far from the Sacre Couer Staff were very warm and helpful and not at all judgemental of our frankly horrendous attempt at speaking french 
132536,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Nothing to report , We chose a larger room Nicely furnished Comfortable Bathroom was reasonably sized by Paris standards Nice breakfast Nice bar Close to metro 
132537,Grand Pigalle Hotel, With so many great hotels in Paris to stay in this one is truly disappointing The concept is nice the interior decor is visually appealing and the bathrooms are nice That s pretty much where the good stops The rooms are not insulated at all bring your ear plugs the staff are too cool to be pleasant to their own guests really unwelcoming and uninterested in serving their guests there is a weird hour between 11am and 12pm where they stop serving breakfast and don t serve brunch yet which is a total bummer when you arrive at 11 01am on Sunday morning and can t get anything to eat Bottom line don t waste your time on this hotel there are so many other Parisian hotels that actually like receiving guests , The hotel decor is great The concept is cool 
132538,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Nothing all good , Great location restaurants and bars on the doorstep and amazing village feel towards Sacre Ceour Staff friendly and rooms excellent 
132539,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Awful breakfast Got totally ignored had to clean our own table find our own cutlery and no breakfast was left on the self serve so we went out instead , Beautiful rooms and lovely staff we had a little terrace too and that was quaint 
132540,Grand Pigalle Hotel, The Pigalle neighborhood is noisy and ther is partying that goes on all night Sex clubs are all over and trash was piled high , The hotel is in a good location and close to a metro stop The rooms are tiny though comfortable and quiet The bar has excellent cocktails Staff well very helpful and spoke excellent English 
132541,Grand Pigalle Hotel, First impression wasn t great as did feel more like a bar than a hotel , Location lovely staff breakfast was fab in the morning not rushed to leave Great area of Paris to explore Hotel helped by booking a great restaurant close by Perfect 
132542,Grand Pigalle Hotel, There was nothing to dislike A couple of the streets around the hotel weren t exactly salubrious but that is about all I can think of that could be deemed negative , The hotel is in a convenient area with lots of bars and restaurants around and it s very close to the Metro The rooms were beautifully decorated and the bed was really comfortable All the staff we encountered were very helpful and friendly 
132543,Grand Pigalle Hotel, The rooms are small by other cities standards , Very friendly efficient service very comfortable beds and modern well appointed rooms Great location and atmosphere 
132544,Grand Pigalle Hotel, Only thing to mention is that when I arrived in the room the aircon was on and the room was a bit cold , I always have a nice stay at Grand Pigalle
