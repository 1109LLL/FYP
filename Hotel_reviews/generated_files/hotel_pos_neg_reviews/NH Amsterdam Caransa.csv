427001,NH Amsterdam Caransa, Lift still out of order after months They gave me a very small room and with a tiny window even if I regularly stay on this hotel and I have the NH membership card,No Positive
427002,NH Amsterdam Caransa, Too expensive The elevator wasn t working so we were using the service one , Location is good There is a tram station in front of the hotel The staff were helpful Free refreshing water and sweets Nesspreso machine in the room
427003,NH Amsterdam Caransa, For the price for the room and service of 4star hotel you ll get broken working elevator have to use unconvenient service elevator max 3 star room with 10 years old sanitary broken shower door nice view on the aircondition outlet from the neighbors with correnspondent noise Room needs to be cleaned daily not only emptying a waste baskets , Good location although not perfect Walking distance from real center and from museum quarter Breakfast on nice balcony Plenty of restraints nearby for beer or dinner 
427004,NH Amsterdam Caransa, Air conditioning in room didn t seem to work very well so was quite hot if you had been out all day The lift was out of order for the duration of our stay so we had to use the service elevator The coffee machine was full of flies however an engineer had taken it apart and was fixing it on the second day Noise was obviously an issue being on the square it was very noisy into the early hours of the morning however ear plugs were provided , Breakfast was of a high quality with a nice terrace if you wanted to eat outside Staff were always friendly and held our luggage for us as we arrived early Good location in the center of Rembrandt Square with lots of places to eat and drink Within a 5 minute walk of the Ice Bar and only a 20 minute walk to Vondelpark 
427005,NH Amsterdam Caransa, There is no parking in the property and the closest garage is too expensive 60 day However the hotel offers a third party valet service that costs 35 day Additionally the guest elevator was out of order and we had to use the service elevator during our stay Finally it was very difficult to reach the hotel by car as the roads in the area are either closed or one way direction , The location is great The breakfast buffet is Good The staff are friendly
427006,NH Amsterdam Caransa, There was dust all over bed framing and surfaces I know it s dust but I m allergic and my trip nearly went downhill as I was blocked up and sneezing all the time Also the lift needs to fixed aswell it s not really ideal using the service lift Very unprofessional , It was right in the middle of everything Loved how it wasn t far to walk anywhere Best location Also loved my room and breakfast 
427007,NH Amsterdam Caransa, The lift door did n t work had to go through the kitchen elevator Room windows could n t be opened because of the stench outside Breakfast meager Too expensive, The location
427008,NH Amsterdam Caransa,No Negative, Amazing people and amazing Amsterdam second time we went to Amsterdam this year We booked a few nights at the NH Caransa hotel Soelien gave us 3 beautiful rooms specially 608 With beautiful view specially around sunset We slept So Good Next morning we had breakfast good Collection The view from the balcony We could sit there in the morning Thank you Shirin for your hospitality We had a great time in Amsterdam Merci
427009,NH Amsterdam Caransa, A side effect to the location is the loudness from the night life during the night and trams construction work during the day Yes I guess I cannot have it all Also a few details that could easily be corrected And the price was a bit steep , The location is fantastic for restaurants and bars the service was excellent and room service perfect 
427010,NH Amsterdam Caransa, No working lift Had to use the staff lift The interiors of the room were worn out The hair dryer tripped after 10 seconds of use Not enough lights in the room However not an issue during the day The linen was from it s other hotel chain NH Schiller The carpets in the hotel and the rooms didnt stink but surely looked aged , The location is good But a little far from train station But beat for enjoying the real amsterdam Tram stop is right outside the hotel 
427011,NH Amsterdam Caransa, The wifi was painfully slow The regular elevator was out of order the whole time we were there requiring us to take a finicky service elevator , The staff was extremely friendly and the daily flavored waters were a nice touch 
427012,NH Amsterdam Caransa, Had to use the service elevator for entire stay Mattress was upside down Had to flip it over and remake the bed Continental breakfast too costly , Centrally located 
427013,NH Amsterdam Caransa, Very noisy outside and very thin windows it makes it impossible to sleep Elevator was not working It took one hour to get an iron board they had to bring it from another hotel since they don t have one in the hotel Kettle in the room was not working Slow wifi,No Positive
427014,NH Amsterdam Caransa,No Negative, The hotel was so central literally right in the city centre and close enough to all the attractions Almost all the attractions were either walkable or two stops away by tram or bus There s restaurants everywhere around the hotel it s just the perfect location
427015,NH Amsterdam Caransa, We arrived to the hotel on koningsdag The lift has been damaged and all guests had to take the service lift of course on the King s day We stayed three nights but the hotel management didn t bother finding someone to repair the lift until our departue All guest had to take the service lift to the breakfast and sending luggages etc It s okay but the lift should have been fixed , There is very young man worked as the main in charge at the breakfast I asked him to make a pot of tea with warm milk and sugar He listened very carefully without interrupting me until I finish my explanations and came with exactly what I have asked He was well dressed quite very young to have the responsibility I wish him all the best and he may even take over the hotel management one day I am sorry I couldn t remember his name The hotel service spoke fine English and there is no problem communicating with anyone 
427016,NH Amsterdam Caransa, The lift was out of order no sign of maintaince happening had to use staff lift which was not very nice to use or see esp when staying in a nice hotel at a expensive price , Lovely clean hotel and modern in the heart of Rembrandt Square and Tram line is opposite the main entrance All areas v v accessible 
427017,NH Amsterdam Caransa, Hotel facilities maintenance Main lift was not working My beds were not commutable you can feel mattress metal spring Informed the hotel management but no action was taken, The location is the best You can reach most of key spots by walking 
427018,NH Amsterdam Caransa, The elevator didn t work and we had to go up with the staff elevator at the back The room was very small and not comfortable The bathroom was small as well No a c and we were on a very hot day and night We asked to do late check out but refused from the staff not even for extra money , The location was very good The staff was kind 
427019,NH Amsterdam Caransa, It did not annoy me but for visitors who have problem with noise I would not recommend this hotel since it s in the middle of a very active square especially if you are staying at lower floors you will be feeling the beats as you sleep Maybe because I did not book in advance the room rate was extremely high when compared with other European Cities but when compared with Amsterdam where the room rates are always on the high side it was tolerable Wi Fi was slow with some interruptions from time to time but sufficient for downloading e mails social media , Especially if you book the room with the view the room is spacious and will have a great view of the square My friends stayed in the no view room as per their comments they were not much satisfied with the room Very nice breakfast Staff was very helpful like in most of the hotels in Amsterdam Amazing location You can find any type of restaurant and or shop within 5 minutes walking distance I would definitely consider booking this hotel again 
427020,NH Amsterdam Caransa, If your room is on front you ll need some ear plugs is pretty noise during the night but you are in Amsterdam and is a high populated area the mini bar was never refill during our trip they could have done that easily and if u need to do some laundry they charge u quiet a lot for my point of view in rest all good no complains, It s been a great trip very easy to reach from the airport to the hotel perfect location exactly in a high populated area where are all the restaurants and bars and coffee shops everything is walking distance I recommend the hotel because of the LOCATION CLEAN ROOMS and the rooms are really big
427021,NH Amsterdam Caransa, No air conditioning in room or way of controlling temperature other than leaving Windows open Square is very noisy bar open until early hours so this means noise can be an issue at night hotel provides earplugs at side of bed so clearly aware and pre empt this , Bed was comfy service was excellent position in city was great Local bars and restaurants give good choice of menu

427023,NH Amsterdam Caransa, the lift was broken and we had to use the service elevator , the superior room had a fantastic view over the square perfect for people watching while getting ready to go out Plenty of bars and restaurants nearby and two nightclubs within walking distance which was very safe for a group of girls not looking for taxi s late at night Overall it was a perfect base to see this wonderful city 
427024,NH Amsterdam Caransa, Room 405 cigarette butts left on the window seal althou room was non smoking told the staff and the problem solved Room 610 early morning of the first night stay next room had a domestic problem and we understand the police was involved A little noisy in the area but can understand as in the centre The elevator was not working so we had to use the staff elevator , Breakfast was very good variety of foods available Desk Staff very helpful 
427025,NH Amsterdam Caransa, The location was brilliant however the noise at night was too much It was very noisy which made sleeping very difficult We would not stay here again because of how loud it was at night , The location was brilliant Right outside was the tram stop Although we walked everywhere The staff were amazing very helpful friendly and couldn t do enough

427031,NH Amsterdam Caransa,No Negative, Fantastic location right on Rembrandtplein room overlooked the square Trams right outside the door Probably one of the best locations in Amsterdam in terms of things to see do food nightlife and branching out easily around the city Hotel was excellent This is our 3rd visit to this hotel the service is great the room immaculate and the location is second to none We ll keep coming back 
427032,NH Amsterdam Caransa, A little noisy But ear plugs are provided They have black out curtains but they let light in from the sides and bottom, Great location Great hotel stardard

427034,NH Amsterdam Caransa, The heating didn t work in the room but the room wasn t too cold so it was okay to go without the heating The beds are warm so there was no issue with the heating in the night , Very well positioned with friendly staff We were given an early check in and an upgrade giving us beautiful views of the canal Good coffee machine in the rooms 
427035,NH Amsterdam Caransa, Their was no shower curtain just a price of glass the didn t even cover a third of the shower Everything got wet and their was a large crack in the bathroom door and some peeling paint Very expensive but around what I would expect to pay in that city , The staff we re friendly and the room was decently large
427036,NH Amsterdam Caransa, My only real issue with the hotel is that the taps on the shower weren t cleaned I touched it and it was a bit sticky Nothing special about the hotel as in I would have liked more facilties for a 4 star hotel Lovely room But just felt like that s all there was , Perfect location Tram stop located right outside hotel with good restaurants around
427037,NH Amsterdam Caransa, We came around 3 o clock but the rooms were not ready We were told that all the double bed rooms are looking not to the Rembrandt square but the other side which has no view Some double bed rooms must also look to the Rembrandt square The double bed room We were offered was not 22 m2 After I did not accept this room the front office offered to turn 2 single bed room into one double bed It is not as comfortable as double bed room but we did not have better option , The location was very good Right on the spot 
427038,NH Amsterdam Caransa, One small observation Room 311 the bathroom lay out left a lot to be desired with the toilet right behind the door so the door would not open fully Smaller sink and toilet next to it a better idea This did not detract from the fact the hotel in general was brilliant this is only our personnel thoughts , Staff very helpful Location superb to sightsee Amsterdam Real fruit flavored water in reception was a nice added touch All in all a very pleasant short break 
427039,NH Amsterdam Caransa, at the first night we got the tween room which was spacey but the mattress was horrible and there was no heating on the second night we got transferred to a double room much smaller but with good mattress and view to sum no room was perfect the second was ok, nice breakfast good service
427040,NH Amsterdam Caransa, Slightly beaten up hotel at Rembrandtplein Small maintenance here and there needs to be done in the room as well as better cleaning Safety box didn t work at all Over prized hotel, The room was quiet and breakfast ok Great location 
427041,NH Amsterdam Caransa, The hotel is located on a square where there are a lot of bars and restaurants and it can noisy on a Friday and Saturday night The hotel does provide earplugs , The hotel is in a good location for exploring Amsterdam 
427042,NH Amsterdam Caransa, for 250 i expect the sheets changed each day unless i say not I expect tissues to be in the bathroom not empty I expect my room to be changed every day there was a 7 hr opening to do that The Room was very noisy , The maid took the trouble to apologise but her training must have been worse than terrible
427043,NH Amsterdam Caransa, There was a cigarette end under the bed from previous visitors which the cleaners had missed which caused a slight smell in the room Apart from that the cleanliness was great , Location and great and reception staff were very helpful and friendly 
427044,NH Amsterdam Caransa, Noththing, It was our honeymoon we got a beautiful quiet room A cake bloons and greeting card were waiting for us as a surprise when we arrived The location is great Great breakfast

427046,NH Amsterdam Caransa, Mark on bottom sheet single beds pushed together other wise very good thought it was over priced but the pound is not doing well against the euro great staff very helpful, Staff were excellent
427047,NH Amsterdam Caransa, We visited Amsterdam during the heat wave and the hotel doesn t have AC but the staff were nice enough to give us a fan to solve this issue then we switched to another hotel with AC, Location and the room balcony size is so big and nice
427048,NH Amsterdam Caransa, On arrival we were greeted with payment requirement although we thought we had pre paid so that meant trawling through a load of emails to check as hotel couldn t show us any confirmation either way Fair enough but I thought maybe the reception staff member could have been a little warmer welcoming Despite booking no smoking room and no smoking signs everywhere on arrival to room it smelt stuffy smelt of smoke We were rushing on business trip had no time to complain as only there for one evening Rest of room was clean however , Wifi was good Typical chain hotel not fancy not awful does the job Handy drinks snacks available in reception Taxis were called promptly came to greet you in hotel lobby Location is great for getting around if a little touristy in particular but our room was quiet not noisy Safe area just lacking in character compared to other places in Amsterdam I ve stayed Good toiletries 
427049,NH Amsterdam Caransa, The weekend can get very noisy from all the action outside so you do need ear plugs to sleep provided at the hotel , Room was clean Stuff was helpful The hotel is right in the center of rembrandt square On top of all the action bars clubs restaurants and coffee shops 
427050,NH Amsterdam Caransa,No Negative, Breakfast was excellent good quality food fresh fruit and delicious cheeses The girl in charge of breakfast Shirin was extremely nice and helpful 
427051,NH Amsterdam Caransa, Checkout needs to be streamlined from a business users point of view I need to be able to get out and to my meeting airport quickly , Quiet that was amazing You re right in the heart of Amsterdam the night life is all around you and there is a bar restaurant next door Didn t hear a peep Silence was golden 
427052,NH Amsterdam Caransa, That when we arrived with the taxi there was no parking to get our luggage to the hotel the taxi had to take us away from the hotel and i had to bring all my luggage to the room And there was no porter to help carrying our bags, The location is walking distance from dam square and the fact that there is plenty of resturants and bars around
427053,NH Amsterdam Caransa, Room 308 was a bit small I wouldn t advise it for a long stay It has a desk a chair nightstands but it doesn t have a table or nice armchairs for your to sip your coffee while reading a book , Be careful because of the cafes restaurants and tramways downstairs it might be quite noisy Fortunately I had room 308 with window on the back and view on the roofs of Amsterdam perfectly quiet I worried at the reception when I asked if the rooms had air conditioning and they answered no The fact is they do you just don t get to control it My room was at a perfectly comfortable temperature despite the damp dutch summer Oh and the cold air vent is silent and you can close it Lots of power sockets everywhere Free tea coffee and water boiler in the room Nice minibar Windows open entirely Breakfast on the first floor balcony with view on Rembrandtplein Grocery store drug store and cinema are only a couple hundred meters away literally in the same street 
427054,NH Amsterdam Caransa, I requested twin room but they gave me double room without any explanation and when I asked to change they just said they dont have room left And hotel was quite dirty Stairs to other floors were so dirty and unpleasant even room was double checked by worker if it is clean but still there were much dust on the furniture and still too expensive for that small and poor quality room, It was 0 1 minute away from tram stop Rembrant plein
427055,NH Amsterdam Caransa, There is NO AIRCON how is this possible I was sweltering in the heat So disappointing especially since corridors were as cool as a fridge Also the pillows were just waaaaaay tooo soft Couldn t sleep without my hand underneath my head , Perfect location right in the middle of everything Very nice n cool in the hallway entrance and floors leading to the bedroom Exceedingly spacious rooms with good amenities TV etc
427056,NH Amsterdam Caransa, We would have preferred air conditioning as it was very hot during our stay , The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and even arranged a special birthday treat for my fianc The location was excellent Although impossible to drive to it was in easy walking distance of a wide range of bars restaurants and cafes The hotel room had a stunning view also 
427057,NH Amsterdam Caransa, Water in shower was so warm had no cold we had to fill up bath then let it cool add cold water from tap also door got chapped twice to check if we had left this was at 9 and 10am, Great location perfect pubs nightclubs around reception staff were friendly nice overall hotel
427058,NH Amsterdam Caransa, Temperature on shower very hot and being english there was no tea only fruit teas, Room very spacious and you could store your luggage there after check out Tram stop right outside
427059,NH Amsterdam Caransa, The air conditioner in our room is really strange it works when you don t need it but it stops when you need it , The location is brilliant the hotel is located in the center of Amsterdam and it is closed to everything The room is in decent size and the facility is good and modern The staff and service are quite good and we also received a small gift to our young kid 
427060,NH Amsterdam Caransa, Couldn t fault the hotel at all only negative is there were a lot of Mosquitos in the room and we were both bitten quite badly while asleep of a night but nothing a bit of antiseptic can t fix , Perfect location lovely reception staff and spacious clean rooms free upgrade on arrival due to no standard rooms left and an iron was free to use after phoning reception 
427061,NH Amsterdam Caransa, unclean room very dusty handprints on furniture shower screen allowing water to leak and pool on entire floor MOSQUITO S nearly bit me to death first nigh No air con so left window open woken up about five times with insect bites all over my body lesson learned next day window closed no insects however was uncomfortable as it was 30 degrees plus every day of our stay Considering how much we paid very poor value for money , great staff good location the place is not bad staff are excellent and accommodating dont book if your bothered by noise its a very noisy area didn t bother me much and i knew before booking they do provide earplugs and have soundproof windows but personally didn t mind the lively atmosphere the real downer was the lack of air con and mosquitos 
427062,NH Amsterdam Caransa,No Negative, Still as I remembered it from a visit many years before the location is fantastic and the accommodation clean and comfortable though perhaps not as lavish as it once was 
427063,NH Amsterdam Caransa, 1 Have stayed at the Krasnopolsky before and expected the same hospitality and warmth however we are sorry to say that the reception could handle matters much better with a smile and warmth Was not feeling very welcoming especially from Sameira who kept us waiting for a long time and was found to be quite rude during checkout to another guest 2 Housekeeping did up our beds very well however forgot to empty the trash for 2 days and the bathrooms were not cleaned despite the amenities being stocked up , 1 We stayed at the Superior Double Room The room was very nice with a very beautiful view of Rembrandtplein Loved it 2 The elderly gentleman who was the host at the breakfast buffet hall was so nice to converse with Very friendly and accommodating A true gentlemen sir 3 Loved the balcony at the breakfast buffet hall where we could sit out and have a coffee watching the activities in the square 
427064,NH Amsterdam Caransa, Rooms extremely small for two people barely any space to move around including the toilets And no view Internet was terrible and was not fixed even though we asked for a faster alternative multiple times Only 0 5 MB download speed , Staff were very friendly Helped us print our boarding passes and offered to send out our pending mail Location is excellent as well right in the heart of rembrandtplien Close to both the center Liedsplien and other locations

427066,NH Amsterdam Caransa, The wifi was terrible Maxed 1 5 MBps on the better connection which is not enough to stream a movie in proper quality I would recommend boosting to a 5MB connection , Great location friendly staff quick and good room service 
427067,NH Amsterdam Caransa, Better option of food for bed breakfast breakfast in the dining hall has a much better selection wifi is a bit sporadic, Visited for my partners birthday were seen to by a lady at the reception desk called Zo she exceeded all of our needs Lovely spacious room hotel very close to the city attractions
427068,NH Amsterdam Caransa, Very small room the bathroom looked orrible very noisy as well, I have not enjoyed the stay there Very poor quality service and the hotel looks like 2 stars hotel Extremely noisy as well 
427069,NH Amsterdam Caransa, Light switch in a bathroom not functioned properly Room telephone was broken and was making a constant buzz It was replaced only after 2 reminds to the reception on the next day Sa me with iron board it was brought to my room only after 2 reminds , Big room with a nice view more or less silent although the Rembrandtplijn is full of tourists almost till morning Breakfast room with a nice view and friendly staff Food in NH is always very good Location allows a busy business traveller after a long working day still to enjoy some tourist attractions basically at the hotel door

427087,NH Amsterdam Caransa, The front rooms have some street noise from the tram and the square but the hotel supplies ear plugs Take the room with the view and use the ear plugs it s worth it , Great location Wonderful breakfast Clean comfortable and spacious room for the price point 
427088,NH Amsterdam Caransa, The only downside is it can be quite noisy at night early morning when trying to sleep but expected with the location of the hotel I didn t find it a problem but one of our friends struggled a little , perfect location in the centre of Rembrandt square great spacious clean and tidy rooms easy check in and out friendly staff and somewhere to keep luggage after we checked out

427091,NH Amsterdam Caransa, First of all when we got there they asked for a credit card in order to take out 50 euros as a guarantee we are students so we only had a debit card they told us that they can take 50 euros out of the debit card and give it back in cash when we checked out but they conveniently forgot to mention that there is a city tax and instead of 50 euros they would give us 30 Which was a problem cause we had calculated those 50 euros for food before we left so we spent 5 hours at the airport not having money to eat Second our room faced a wall Third the second day we were there we left the room to get some breakfast at about 11 30 we came back at 11 55 and there was a paper in front of the door saying that there would be no water from 12 to 3 due to maintenance reasons Two persons had to shower in 5 minutes because they couldn t take the time to notify us earlier or from the night before Third probably due to those maintenance reasons that we were never notified about in the first place when we checked in every morning at about 10 o clock there was terrible noise from drills and I don t know what else I wouldn t go back to that hotel on my next visit at Amsterdam , The stuff was friendly the room was very clean and the location was just perfect

427097,NH Amsterdam Caransa, the only bad things about this hotel were quite trivial the price of the hotel isnt exactly cheap at average of 150eur per night but Amsterdam is a horrible place if you get the hotel wrong which is VERY easy to do so it s worth paying a little extra to guarantee a luxury stay The only other complaint I had was that it is very dimly lit in the rooms and you might be waiting a while for the lift as there seemed to be only one , The hotel was located in the best square in Amsterdam on the Rembdrandtplein it is full of cool bars coffeeshops restaurants and casinos cinemas etc anything you d need in a short trip to the city it was very clean throughout the staff were incredibly friendly and the room was quiet day or night as it was located at the back of the hotel it was the location that sold me on this hotel as i wanted to be able to pop back up to the room whenever i wanted without having to battle through the extremely busy amsterdam streets for too long so overall it was a nearly perfect hotel
