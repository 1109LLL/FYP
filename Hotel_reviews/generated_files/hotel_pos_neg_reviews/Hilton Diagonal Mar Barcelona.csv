401709,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Be aware that they ask for 50 E per day on a block booking credit card system to cover any costs thankfully they let is off this as I had no idea that was the case and it didn t say that on booking com , The pool was lovely and great restaurants and shopping just across the road so you can eat out at different places or breakfast over there if you don t want to pay 25 a day The pool is owned by a different company but f you are a hotel guest you can have one of the 10 E beds but remember you can swim and sit on the sofas if you don t want to pay that each day 
401710,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, A hotel shuttle from the airport would have been great as I was travelling with a 1 year old plus it was the day of national strike on taxi in Barcelona n got totally ripped of by an opportunist taxi driver for 90 for something that I should have paid 25 for , The hotel was exemplary and fantastic
401711,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Prices could be reviewed as my opinion access to the pool and refreshments were a little expensive , Amazing views comfy bed and purobeach was amazing 
401712,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, 1 Rooms were outdated furniture was old carpet in the room was smelly mold around the shower beds were uncomfortable 2 Elevators were very slow 3 Dirty hallways leading to the rooms 4 21 Euro was a bit much for the breakfast It was not worth that much 5 PuroBeach is over rated and expensive 15 Euro for a cocktail 50 euro for a sun bed and that s just the basic Hotel guests have to pay and don t get pool amenities included 6 Front desk area was very unorganized No where to stand to wait for the receptionist Everyone was standing all over the place , The hotel was across from the mall and a block away from the beach Location was the only good thing about this hotel 
401713,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Some staff in the pool area seemed very standoffish and stared at you asif you didn t belong there When we checked out at 12 the shower facilities in the gym were unfortuately unavailable due to rennovations which obviously can t be helped Although the food and drinks were very nice 14 euros for a plate of nachos was hard to justify Also abit ridiculous that you have to pay to reserve a bed when there were clearly empty beds around the pool the day after we tried to get a bed we were told on our first day we had to reserve so we reserved for our second day , Rooms were gorgeous very spacious big bathroom lovely decor rooftop pool amazing very chilled out and clean with nice food and drinks lovely pool opposite a large shopping centre good for food and shopping Also location is brilliant right on the beach and 10 min drive from la ramblas easy access to the tourist bus lines Also late check out was good
401714,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, HUGE EXTRA ROOM SERVICE DELIVERY CHARGE n, I ordered 2 yogurts and 2 pineapple juices from room service They charged me 33 EUROS The hotel already charges a high price for the room They should NOT CHARGE A HUGE EXTRA CHARGE JUST TO DELIVER A MEAL They should only charge for the food 
401715,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Too far Did not use the pool due to ongoing techno parties filled with drunk kids I felt like I was back to college I primarily picked the hotel for its pool and ended up not using it , The sea view and the neighborhood 
401716,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, No satellite TV which was s shame for a big name hotel Breakfast was shambolic The pool area was not conducive to families too many sun worshippers getting drunk and posing with loud music and was expensive , Rooms were comfortable and well looked after 
401717,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, I should say that the staff could improve customer service Both on reception desk and at the pool bar we came across with fantastic attitude as well as with awful attitude Let s say that you could feel who cared Oxana and Elisa just GREAT and who did not Ettore at the front desk and some pool waiters , Room and breakfast just awesome 
401718,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, The room was basic the bedding had to be replaced as it was awful the noise from music from other properties was loud until 3am It isnt really made clear that you have to pay for a bed by the pool some are 80 per day and it is also not clear that the DJ music is all day if you want a quiet relaxing stay this is not for you , Lovely staff
401719,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,No Negative, Excellent Lication Beautiful facilities very kind staff The hotel is right on the beach and wiithin a 10 minute walk we found plenty of bars and paella restaurants on the beach 
401720,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, This hotel was very busy with lines and waits at every turn The executive lounge was full at each meal with lines for every item The staff worked hard but waits and lines were the norm despite that The pool is not run by the Hilton but by a third party and is much more of a nightclub than a family setting Everyone was friendly and efficient but the hotel felt too impersonal with such large groups and delays , The rooms are spacious and comfortable with plenty of closet space and good lighting Adjoining rooms are possible It is conveniently located near public transportation which is easy and efficient 
401721,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Made feel lesser than the obvious big rollers Looked down upon at times When check in I stated we had booked with booking com and had paid for a king size room They tried to push us out two single beds When we stated that s not what we had paid for they wer less then impressed with us Guest s should be greated with the same standard and not because how you may look Made feel uncomfortable by that Like we had no right being there We are paying customers to , The hotel in general was beautiful 
401722,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Stayed at executive rooms on 21 F water pressure weak so weak that we were reluctant to wash hair So we went to Diagonal Mar mall opposite in search of hair salon had a hair shampoo blow dry ,No Positive
401723,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,No Negative, The room was spacious clean and well designed View to the city and sea was great The staff was pleasant and extremely helpful we had a small issue with our shower that was fixed immediately Wi Fi access was also great stays online whenever in hotel vicinity unlike many hotels which require you to login again and again Bonus points for EXTREMELY close location to Parc Del Forum If you re coming to enjoy a festival there this is a perfect hotel for you 
401724,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, The Hiltons pricing is about 25 more expensive than the adjacent hotels which offer very similar deals We justify this delta because of the large pool surrounding pool area The Hilton have rented this area out to a separate company Purobeach who are trying to capture passing trade to the pool facilities for 40 per head Hilton guests can use the facilities for 20 or if you complain its quiet 10 I object to having to pay again for what I consider to be the reason that they are already more expensive than the other hotels The executive floor is open all day but only serves alcoholic beverages between 18h 20h consequently the lounge fills up at this period The other hotels offer this facility all day so don t get the rush , The location is great friendly helpful staff good rooms The proximity to the beach tourist bus also very convenient Breakfast is excellent 
401725,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,No Negative, The hotel staff was excellent in accommodating our needs The hotel was clean and located across a gigantic mall The restaurant offered four star service The Executive floor was clean quiet and graceful 
401726,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Nothing to dislike, Everything about this hotel is really classy first rate luxury Not the cheapest of hotels but the luxury is worth the price The pool area is out of this world 
401727,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, The room we had was a disabled room and totally unsuitable for older couples as only a silly shower over bath and this sprayed everywhere making the floor wet and VERY SLIPPERY we were very disappointed that with such a large bathroom there was no walk in shower to make life easier At the price of the hotel we felt it very inadequate as no where to put toothbrushes soap etc near the basin Not cleaned very well and the hot drink top ups of milk were not done light in wadrobe would not turn off Altogether sadly lacking , Bed very comfortable breakfast outstanding selection and very good and fresh Lifts were quick and staff extremely helpful 
401728,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Charging 20 per person for 2h pool area use on top of a 250 room rate is outrageous and never seen Spending around 100 nights yr in hotels this was a first for me ,No Positive
401729,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Far from city center but easy access by bus or metro to city center , The location is very near to the beach It was cold though at the time of year But if you like to run by the beach this is perfect 
401730,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,No Negative, I loved this hotel Best location right next to the mall very modern and convenient in short the perfect choice for shopping or dining Awesome sea and city views my room was on the 18th floor offering beautiful sea panorama Staff was very helpful and kind from the receptionist to the concierge Will definitely recommend 
401731,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Need at least one English TV channel that is entertainment not news , Breakfast was excellent Nice location Mall across the street with restaurants was nice Hop on hop off tour bus stop right down the street 
401732,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, It s great for congresses and nice to be at the beach but not that easy to get into the town centre on public transport But for business this was not a problem, The room was quiet and just the right temperature to sleep This is the most important feature of the hotel for me The room was a good size too and not cramped
401733,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Pool bar was shut which was a shame but can t be helped, Perfect hotel staff were extremely helpful and all lovely room service was excellent there isn t many hotels where decent food is available at 5am in room service perfect room lovely bathroom very clean highly recommended
401734,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Indifferent restaurant unsympathetic staff and not especially helpful New Year s Eve had no celebration restaurant had very limited menu breakfast was in a ballroom with cold coffee and cold food no recreational activities pool closed saunas and exercise room dark and unmanaged We moved out after 1 night to a better place , not much to rave about here 
401735,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Breakfast buffet eggs poor needs a careful supervion to ensure food is pkentiful and not cold burnt, Reception staff v good on arrival and departure
401736,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, The incident with my card However happy that the staff were pleasant about it , Had issues with my card as it was swiped several times by the receptionist and blocked I was then locked out of my room when the card blocking prohibited payment Staff were however very professional even though I was not happy this happened 
401737,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Very far from tourist and evening activities If I could do it again I would stay in barceloneta Gotic or eixample and take metro or taxi to conference center, Staff very nice and helpful
401738,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Breakfast way too pricey, Spacious rooms lovely pool area helpful staff good location for beach and plenty of taxis around for trip into city for a few euros 
401739,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Uninspiring interiors and rather tired rooms , Typical Hilton Hotel business oriented with good service and good choices for breakfast Very convenient location if you want to use the excellent sandy beach which is within walking distance There is a huge shopping centre bang opposite the hotel and a metro station on the other side of the shopping centre with fast connections into the centre There is a taxi stand just outside the hotel and a trip to the centre is about 10 euros Both Hop On Hop Off tours have stops outside the hotel 
401740,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, The essential problem is that the hotel is incredibly overcrowded To check in it took almost 1h Room was not ready and again 30 minutes to get the key at the agreed time Breakfast need to queue almost 30 min Staff looks to be not very well organized The bill was wrong I had to check item by item and amend it , Room is good in the hilton standard The great point of the hotel is the pool the PuroBeach and the Gym open24hrs The staff to the PuroBeach is far better than in the other area of the hotel 
401741,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Have been here several times now What a shame to see how this hotel has lost it s charme especially with he puro beach THE hotel guests do not have priority still bad WiFi connection THE rooms need refreshment hotel personel was not friendly at all used to be our favourite hotel in Barcelona but Will never return again, Schitterend ontbijt
401742,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Internet wifi was always an issue in the rooms , Very good hotel with large swimming pool in a good location with proximity to the beach the mall at same time 
401743,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Takes too long to get the rooms clean some times I went out for 3 to 5 hours and find the room still dirt I would suggest them to increase the cleaning staff, The swimming pool is great
401744,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, late check in I had to check in at 16 00 un beliavable I wait at the reception from 9 00 to 16 00 and they didn t want to give me a room Incredible swiming pool best seats in the pool are for the clients that comes from out of the hotel so if you spend 1 500 in the hotel you will have an uncomfortable plastic hamncok far away from the swimming pool if you are an out side client you juust need to make a reservation and will have an amaizing hamncok in front of the swimming pool So its first hotel in the room that they priorize the clients from outside that the clients that stay in the hotel very far away from the center the beach near the hotel has special place for dogs so the beach is really dirty and smelly, Aire acondicionado
401745,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, the spa is terrible it doesnt even count as a spa more like massage beds next to the pool, great to be close to beach and a shopping mall and an indoor padel court
401746,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, The hotel is by the beach but not very central for sightseeing and going out in the evenings Taxi is cheap and there is underground very close to the hotel so wasn t a big issue , Extra friendly staff always ready to assist in an efficient way Very pleased with the service 
401747,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Missing slippers and bathrobe in the room No drinking water in the room Dirty carpets Swimming pool is reserved for the pool parties not possible to get the place close to swimming pool people from outside are coming for these parties I was expecting to get the best service not to be send far away from the pool because hotel is having some extra parties not for hotel guests,No Positive
401748,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, There were workmen outside my door for a day They stayed much longer than they said they would and started early in the morning So I had two days of disturbed sleep and smell in the corridor The management were difficult to get hold of to resolve the issue It was only when I rang Hilton to complain from inside the hotel that anything happened They have just charged my card in error two weeks after I left the hotel and Hilton customer services first put the phone down and second insist that I phone the hotel internationally to resolve it directly with the them Guests don t get full access to the swimming pool without paying extra and the whole place is fairly tired dated and noisy They didn t give me the room I had booked The one I was given initially didn t have the amenities on it as described I ve travelled a lot and this is as bad as it gets , Some of the staff tried to help 
401749,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, we don t like carpet in the bedroom but prefer a hard floor like stone or wood which is more hygienic we also didn t like the breakfast buffet area which was dark and not very cosey the beach club is very exclusive hence expensive and hotel guests are banned to the back seats and cannot use the premium seats , very friendly personnel and the location is wonderful because we attended the Primavera festival we could even see one of the main stages from our window the beach club is a great place to hang out but rather expensive 
401750,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Wi fi very expensive Approx 13 EUR per day for the standard slow ish connection Even more for faster version Lobby has a free wi fi but the rooms don t , Excellent location for Primavera festival Beach within 5 mins walk Supermarket and restaurants across the road 
401751,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Expensive according to the services they provide , We traveled to Barcelona for Primavera Sound Festival Hotel is very close to the festival site That s why the location is great for us Very helpfull and polite staff 
401752,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, The pool site is actually a Puro Beach urban resort where they let non hotel guests in Puro Beach staff treat hotel guests like dirt I have been repeatedly harassed by the telling me that I need to make a reservation and pay 25 for a sun bed Which I refused and they managed to find me a free sun bed On Sunday the pool area was completely unavailable to the hotel guests as there was an external party going on Definitely not the right place if you are looking for a relaxing experience Any of the other 3 hotels nearby would make a much better choice Would never stay again Also worth mentioning that the Internet charges were atrocious to the point that it was actually much cheaper to run 4G in roaming on my phone , I have stayed here for primavera sound festival so the hotel was conveniently located close to the festival site Staff in the hotel itself was friendly Food was good too 
401753,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, We had a very bad small room with no shower only a very small bath Last year we had a much better room for lesser price Price quality not good VERY anoying staff that stops you at pool terras I guess this have something to do with different managers of Hilton and Puro Beach but it makes you feel like you re an intrudor in your hotel , Good location for Primavera Sound Festival Nice pool on terras Good food in Puro Beauch Club Very friendly staff at the reception 
401754,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Although the pool area is great hotel clients are not allowed to reserve sun beds during puro beach pool parties, The hotel in general is superb with the beach nearby and a shopping center just across the road
401755,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, I paid a lot for the room last minute Non uber taxi rides required to go pretty much everywhere and paying for wifi in the room equals a bit overpriced , Loved the room Very comfortable Staff super nice 
401756,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, rude staff they didnt have our room ready for us when we checked in refused to pick us up from the airport Worst hotel experience I ve ever had I ll never stay here again,No Positive
401757,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, I liked it all , Very clean Staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the area The room and facility was wonderful The mall is to your right as you exit the hotel and the beach is to your left What more could a girl ask for 
401758,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, A pretty standard experience for the price Other hotels offer more modern updated and stylish rooms and services at better prices I had 2 pre approvals go off my account One when I checked in amount expected and the next morning for double the amount so in total 3 times what I was due to pay My credit card was frozen due to this and as I am travelling on business and use my personal credit card this caused inconvenience The hotel also didn t offer much of an explanation and the amounts have not been cleared off my account yet keeping my available credit hostage , Clean rooms Aircon worked and wasn t noisy 
401759,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, I would have liked to get at least one single music channel on the TV 99 of them are in spanish and to be honest I m kind of tired of watching CNN in the morning when I am in vacation , Wow great breakfast and awesome staff Always smiling and helping out Great position near the sea side and also close to the metro station Big rooms and nice furniture 
401760,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, They do not provide drinking water yet they have tea bags and coffee provided When asked I was told I either use tap water or buy from the items provided in a fridge at 5 50euros Parking is charged 30euros per day yet you pay For a room I feel it is a rip off , Good location
401761,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, The coffee tea facilities ran out on the first day and were not replaced slow service in the cafe 1 hour for a sandwich but the staff are engaged and very friendly , Excellent Hotel great space clean bright rooms with best best furniture close to good restaurants and beach 
401762,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, I liked everything , The staff was excellent From check in to check out The room was very comfortable and clean The restaurant for breakfast was very nice The buffet was a bargain and the staff attentive The espresso was great 
401763,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Reception did not communicate to me my room rate change well causing me to stay in smaller room with higher rate because I had two different reservations, Near beach and shopping mall Near metro station Adjacent to conference center
401764,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Ask for room service One glass of milk I was told that there was a service charge of 6 a charge of 4 for the glass of milk 4 is high way robbery but 6 service charge is down right disgraceful ,No Positive
401765,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona,No Negative, The staff is extremely friendly We would like to mention specially Marlene from the front dest and Bruno from the restaurant who are extremely nice and helpful
401766,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Cannot think of anything, The location is fabulous offering both beach and city access The staff go above and beyond their daily duties to ensure you are enjoying your stay 
401767,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, The wifi is appalling and only available in the lobby area , The bar staff are great after a long and busy day the lobby bar was a great place to relax
401768,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, A little out of the way for a long visit but no problem for a short stay Free Wi Fi in room would be useful, Good room great bathroom fantastic breakfast
401769,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Housekeeping service we not consistent Room wasn t vacuumed until we requested it We checked in late evening the male staff wasn t friendly and acted like they were doing you a favor to stay at their hotel and not a paying customer Not having free wifi in the room is a big disadvantage , Great location close to the beach walking distance right across from shopping mall away from crowded Barcelona streets Short taxi or metro ride to most tourist attractions 
401770,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, No Wi Fi in rooms we have been travelling in all levels of accom and every place has had free wi fi in rooms Only offered in public areas but lots of issues connecting staying connected In today age free Wi Fi is generally available shopping centres Mc Donald s etc Cleaners knocking on door at 8 30 am Even after placing note on our door the next day they were quite noisey cleaning the corridors and adjoining rooms Quite some distance from the centre but close to the beach About 40 Euro to airport , Fairly new premises caters more for business Good pool lounge bar huge on level 2 
401771,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Just an observation i think the hotel should have its own pool area as weekends are taken over by puro beach so no space for us hotel clients, Location staff clean nearly all was good
401772,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, I wanted to extend my stay for 2 more days and both booking and Hilton staff were unable to accommodate me i wasn t even quoted a rate for last 2 nights i was disappointed about this ,No Positive
401773,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Very expensive sunbeds internet and parking small swimmingpool and big hotel slowly free internet, Breakfast big room and bathroom nice staff near beach 
401774,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, Service is very bad No one answers phone calls Had to reactivate key every time used Nasty breakfast Very low quality food and coffee Unfriendly staff at club level Noisy Not Hilton standards definitely , Location
401775,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, I had no inclination to use the hotel pool due to it being a purabeach resort and there was a noisy party being held there by non hotel guests The arrangement is most likely profitable for Hilton but I will stay at another hotel next time where hotel guests only have access to the pool , Hotel was clean and tidy and staff were friendly
401776,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, lacks spirit and magic something that touches you to remember The concept of reserving sunbeds at the pool area PUROBEACH where you have to pay for the good beds with a forced consumption p package is totally unacceptable the long ques, it s an efficient rational what you see is what you get a well ruin machine 
401777,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, The wifi would not work It would not let me login throughout my 2 day stay despite complaints However on my earlier stay it was perfect Technical fault , Great Location for shopping and the beach 
401778,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, No communication between hotel and the booking com non of our requests were taken into account and eventhough we booked a room for 2 adults and one child we were provided with room with only one bed Reception staff was highly unprofessional all trainees who provided us at first a matreess to put on the floor for our 8 year old daughter When we finally got to a proper reception staff who was very professional we finally got the room we were supposed to get However this has spoiled our experience completely Parking is outrageously expensive 36 eur day , Location is good off centre but near the waterfront and next to the shopping centre We had our car so it was convenient for us 
401779,Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona, The check in process was much too long At 4 PM there was a line that took well over 20 minutes to check in ,No Positive
