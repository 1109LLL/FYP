54954,Bassano, You can hear people outside the room Stander rooms are small I recommend to take the next category , Great location friendly reception staff clean rooms
54955,Bassano, The worst thing after a long trip is to come to a hotel check in the room and find out that you have a room with no view I mean a view inside a narrow service void filled with pipes The receptionist reacted with a common answer that they are fully booked and have no other room available After insisting a bit the new answer was that they would change the room the next day One last try after 15 minutes with a little more threating attitute we were offered 2 options with floor to ceiling windows looking to the street So the question arises Why didn t they offer this room in the first place That I still dont know but I can assure you that I was not happy with the whole situation I also had to carry all the luggages by my self from the car to the room and from the old room to the new room which was not pleasent ,No Positive
54956,Bassano, Breakfast is a bit overpriced and taken in the basement which is a bit gloomy, Great small boutique hotel with friendly staff room nicely decorated and very comfortable large bathroom good value for money 
54957,Bassano, the family room in the top of the hotel has no view and very limited natural light during our second night the noise of constant water down the tubes was a bit disturbing, The staff was very friendly and helpful we booked in total 4 rooms from which 3 had a lot of natural light and a nice view of the street The bathrooms are nice and spacious 
54958,Bassano, There wasn t enough room in the toilet my grandson is very tall and he could just about close the door , There was a good variety of everything it was excellent 
54959,Bassano, I left early in the morning 630 and they didnt arrange a croissant or anything as the kictchen opens at 7 even iof people was ther for the check out ,No Positive
54960,Bassano, The WiFi was awful We needed to do some work while on holiday and using the WiFi was imposible Had to resort to tether through my phone at roaming charges Not happy I was on floor 3 Could only use Wifi just about very slow from the ground floor , The Hotel location is excellent There is even a little bakery next door where you can have nice crepes Bed was hard so great for my liking but the pillows too cushiony lumpy so my head was too bent Resorted to sleep with no pillow Have to say the cleaning was fantastic I felt I was in a new room every time I came to my room Reception was always very helpful Breakfast was nice 
54961,Bassano, No power points to charge electronics poor Wifi poor shower curtains didn t fit the windows slow elevator expensive breakfast , Stylish hotel in a good location and good value Staff were very helpful in dealing with the hotel s poor services and facilities 
54962,Bassano,No Negative, The bed was good size bathroom was spacious room was clean and nicely decor Staffs were extremely helpful and friendly Location was excellent 3 minutes walk to Champ Elysses Good value 
54963,Bassano, The hotel room was far too hot Couldn t control the temperature and was noisy too with fast cars driving by all through the night , Staff were very friendly and helpful lending me a European adapter when I didn t have one 
54964,Bassano, Curtain in the room let a little light in so didn t sleep a lot otherwise perfect , Great location very friendly staff didn t have breakfast at hotel so can t say The room was comfortable and clean Enjoyed staying 
54965,Bassano, Wi fi sometimes wasn t working but stuff always were ready to help and also There are no wardrobe in room so be ready to keep your clothes in your bags If you would like to have a slippers ask for it on the reseption, Staff is really friendly and helpful Locations is very good if you prefer to be closely to Champ Elysee Supermarket is in 200 meters 2 metrostation is in 5 min walk avenue Marceu Georg V A lot of shops and restaurents Rooms seems to be small but it s regular situation for Paris 
54966,Bassano, Maybe to make TV screens bigger , The location is very convenient and can provide both closeness to Champs Elysee and quiet atmosphere of the 16 th arrondissement Even the hotel a little bit small rooms are comfortable and well equipped 
54967,Bassano, Breakfast seemed expensive so we went out They had turned off the heating air conditioning so you needed to ask reception if you wanted those , The reception staff all knew who we were and chatted with us The room felt spacious due to the separate bathroom and toilet along a short hallway The bed was very comfortable 
54968,Bassano, the hotel after my reservation with Kids wanted to charge me 20 Euros for the Crib The family room was actually 2 rooms which wasnt clear as i showed that i have a baby 4 months old i was put on a floor that has only stairs access the elevator is small and very slow they keys system is not reliable i had to return the keys every time i leave the hotel the extra bed brought in was broken and no back charge was done after paying the full amount i was asked to pay during check out and if i didnt insist that i did i would of been charged again the cleaning materials were on every floor and they didnt have a place to store them , finding the room with the hotel
54969,Bassano,No Negative, Staff was amazing They were friendly and helpful We enjoyed staying at Bassano and would definitely advise everyone to stay there when you re in Paris
54970,Bassano, There is nothing particularly special about this hotel and if you are looking for any kind of charm then this is not the one to choose If we had paid the full price which is in excess of 400 then we would have been very disappointed The breakfast is rather poor I think the coffee was instant and is served in a very dark basement room We would have been better off going to one of the nearby lively and bright caf s , All of that being said it is friendly comfortable very well located and quiet despite being in the centre of a bustling city 
54971,Bassano, Slight wait for room upon arrival but staff were apologetic about that , Great location close to many transport links Good sized room and large bathroom for central Paris 
54972,Bassano, really old small and slow elevator faster to walk down five flights of stairs very small outdated flat screen television with low volume despite sound proof room weak air conditioner weak toilet room could have been cleaner many surfaces with dust build up , staff was very professional friendly and helpful great location in quiet area room had a nice bathroom with a separate toilet comfortable bed hotel provides its own travel guide 
54973,Bassano, The curtains didn t quite meet to block out all light and the no air conditioning The fan was ok but needed to produce more cool air, Great location The room size was fantastic Brilliant bed large and comfortable Lovely bathroom and a separate toilet Friendly staff Great communication skills and extremely helpful Would definitely stay again 
54974,Bassano, They rate the accommodation 4 It is not The internet was very poor and I had work to do The TV was worse with virtually no sports channels to cover the great sport on in Europe Poor value for money , The staff were very good The room was OK Quiet enough 
54975,Bassano, The restaurant is so depressing for breakfast it s on 1 floor with no windows and nothing indicates it s day time it felt like an underground after hour club The shower is so small , The location The staff The rooms The bed
54976,Bassano, The hotel is old and barely 3 stars range if not 2 stars it is old small rusty and ordinary the first night I couldn t sleep as the A C wasn t working it was only giving sound but no air and the night shift came to check it and said this it the best we have The other disturbing thing is I had to spend the night killing insects inside the room , I guess the only good thing I experienced in this hotel was the morning shift receptionist Jasmina she was very friendly helpful actually the only helpful staff in the whole place She upgraded me to a larger room and was ready to do whatever it takes to solve the problems I faced
54977,Bassano, We have late flight 17 30 taxi from hotel and it was not possible to stay in the room without to pay extra 150euro for 5h is to much for my opinion , We got upgraded room Very nice from hotel Also hotel have its own web portal with a lot useful data local weather city map WiFi is excellent Staff is polite 
54978,Bassano, We were surprised at the level of noise we could hear from neighboring rooms as well as the street , The staff was very helpful and courteous We loved the location and the ambiance 
54979,Bassano,No Negative, Check in lady was lovely so helpful sweet location is fab 5 mins walk from flag ship Louis Vuitton store Room was ok Beds comfy Maid service good Check out guy was horrid very patronising watched him with another guest after he checked us out and he was full of attitude with them too he could do with not being front of house or maybe taking a leaf from the lady receptionists book 
54980,Bassano, Everything was wonderful , Their staff was very kind They helped us a lot Everything was wonderful Otel s location is very good Thank you for their interesting 
54981,Bassano, Not a thing , The room was wonderfully appointed clean cozy and comfortable with tons of sunlight The entire staff was extremely friendly polite and professional The common areas were nicely designed and attractive 
54982,Bassano, Only cold water in the shower Free breakfast was the only compensation they gave us Last year we were moved to a different hotel also because of some issues with the water , Location Staff
54983,Bassano, Room small but adequate Noisy fixed hangers no wardrobe Agree that location is why it is 4 star all else is 3 star , Great location helpful staff comfortable bed 
54984,Bassano, We are a non smokers so it was very easy for us to smell cigarettes We had a non smoking room but the smell was unbearable Every second spend in the room we though someone is smoking inside it very expensive breakfast price per person and there is not much served there, amazing very friendly staff great localisation comfortable bed 
54985,Bassano, No air conditioning operating due to technically winter although 20 degrees outside in November The staff brought a fan which was adequate but I would have preferred air con to keep the room as cold as I like it No bar although the literature said there was one, The staff were amazing Very helpful and went out of their way to assist Rooms really clean and bathroom had a bath and robes with slippers Nice touch
54986,Bassano, One staff member Johann is young and needs to learn more about serving customers Twice he kept us waiting while he did other things If the policy is for clients to turn their key in at the front desk when going out the staff needs to give us our key as quickly as possible when we return Johann was on the phone when we returned He remained on the phone without trying to get us our key Then he out the phone down on the desk to do something else He then resumed his conversation on the phoen all this time while we waited He finally gave us our key about 7 5 minutes later We feel this was an inconvenience that should have been avoided Also our room was very hot despite our turning the heater off I called the front desk and was told to open the window It was okay for a while but the temperature was cold outside so we had to close the window then suffer from the heat , The room was neat clean and comfortable Most of the staff was professional and accommodating 
54987,Bassano, Terrible unusable wifi Rooms not very nice Hotel not well kept run down cleaning staff left carts and equipment in hallways Required guests to leave room keys w front desk , Location was fine Close to Champs Elys es and transit Cute neighbourhood 
54988,Bassano, The only negative thing is the elevator Extremely bad Very very slow not working properly wanted to go from second floor to Ground floor i press the GF button them i find myself going up to the fifth floor stopping by each floor going up and down and this happened every time i wanted to use the elevator The hotel needs to fix this, Location staff cleanliness almost everything
54989,Bassano, The Paris ethics mandatory key drop of at the reception Overly involved staff Over the day I was called three times for an ironing set I didn t have staff entering the room while occupied in the bathroom, Location of the hotel The room was nice and spacious
54990,Bassano, The one negative thing was that the television stopped working late at night on day 2 of our vacation this was reported but was not fixed during our stay , The staff were very friendly and welcoming the wifi was excellent would definitely stay here again if we came back to Paris
