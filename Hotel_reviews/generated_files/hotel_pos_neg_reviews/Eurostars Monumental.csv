300194,Eurostars Monumental, there was nothing we could complain , the Hotel is very clean and staff was very friendly they were booking the tickets for sagrada familia for us due to un availability in Internet Location very good only 5min walk to hop on hop off at sagrada familia awesome view from our room see attached Picture 
300195,Eurostars Monumental,No Negative, The location was great walking distance to some attractions and a few minutes walk to the nearest metro Staff were really helpful too Nice views from room 
300196,Eurostars Monumental, They could leave facilities to make coffee or tea in the room as these were absent , The room was comfortable and had a nice balcony which you could see the city on 
300197,Eurostars Monumental, Poor breakfast with no option for vegetarian The salad has old and with mold We have asked for a non smoking room however if you turn the ac off you can smell cigarette Lots of things to be improve to deserve a 4 stars For me the hotel is more like 2 stars There is a positive thing about the property the people who works there , The hotel room is clean and bed is very comfortable 
300198,Eurostars Monumental, There s not much choice nearby for food drinks You re looking at a 10 minute taxi or a 30 minute walk to Catalonia Sq the room they serve breakfast in is deathly silent Could do with some background music , Nice room if a little small but I guess that s the trade off for the large terrace Bed was very comfortable and the complimentary fruit platter was a nice touch 
300199,Eurostars Monumental, The room furniture was a little dated and scraped A bit cramped for three people and the beds were horribly hard and difficult to sleep in , Breakfast had an amazing Nespresso Machine A real plus Breakfast was good variety and lovely staff Our view was really nice and the window was well sized Close to metro but really only close to the Safrada Familia otherwise away from most attractions 
300200,Eurostars Monumental, There was a problem with my breakfast reservation I reserved it after the hotel so that might have been a problem to their system Before I went to the hotel I called to make sure it was added to my reservation I was told it is sorted it wasn t At check in i was told it is sorted it wasn t In the morning when i showed up for breakfast i was told that my name isn t on the list and i have no breakfast reservation Obviously it wasn t sorted But I have the feeling this is booking s mistake not the hotel s, Perfectly placed in the heart of Barcelona May look poor at first because the reception is somehow cornered and very dull but overall the hotel is clean comfortable and the corridors smelled nice which is important for me 
300201,Eurostars Monumental, The Eggs at breakfast were cold Even asking every day it didn t make any difference and they had no English Breakfast tea for 4 days in a row The quilt cover was ripped and frayed and there were no drawers to put clothes in , The staff were friendly but spoke little English Location was great The room was made up very well and very clean
300202,Eurostars Monumental, Very poor breakfast Definitely it does not worth the price , Great Location very close to the metro station The staff was very helpfull and kind always ready to assist you The room was specious and clean 
300203,Eurostars Monumental,No Negative, Fabulous location great view of the Sagrada Familia from our room Bed was very comfy and the shower was excellent Lovely buffet breakfast with good choice of food Staff were friendly and helpful 
300204,Eurostars Monumental, Multiple problems We received a call at 3AM in the morning while we were sleeping Wrong room ups No toilet papers when we came Very noisy rooms you can hear everything people talking in the rooms nearby cars from the boulevard elevator opening etc Do not came here it s a mistake Horrible ratio quality money , Nothing 
300205,Eurostars Monumental, Cleaning not really done or half done I had a room for smokers with no ashtray to be found in the whole hotel plus even a person who smokes does not appreciate sleeping in a room where they previously smoked Gavin these rooms with the smallest balcony would have made them smokers friendly in deed I booked mainly because they have the option of booking a transfer and I wasn t feeling adventurous in finding a taxi in the middle of the night but no one showed up to pick me up so much later I had to taxi eventually a taxi So for me that service is non existent in the array of services provided For the price paired there were plenty of other cheaper options ,No Positive
300206,Eurostars Monumental, Almost got charged again for the city tax on check out due to a mistake in the system Wouldn t spend money on the expensive breakfast there s plenty of cafes surrounding the area which are much cheaper and better quality , Beds were comfortable and overall finish was to a really high standard location is really good being on the higher floors means an amazing view of sagrada familia 
300207,Eurostars Monumental, The mattress was very firm Slept ok despite this though No tea coffee facilities in the room which may bother some but not an issue for us , Ideally situated next to a metro stop so easy to get around the city Good spread at breakfast Rooms are large and clean Got glazing so unable to hear traffic outside Has air con 
300208,Eurostars Monumental, Finding no air circulation possible after a 15 hour flight making it necessary to sleep with the window open on the intersection of two significant roads Monumental failure for amenities and comfort , The location 
300209,Eurostars Monumental,No Negative, very friendly helpful front desk staff always going the extra mile is assisting us where they could views from the 6th floor was lovely as La Sagrada in site and room clean comfy too with great views to the city vibes easy access to tourist attractions and local facilities safe environment great for families 
300210,Eurostars Monumental, room could have been a little bigger and would have been nice to have an in hotel restaurant but not really an issue as there are good restaurants a short walk away, Excellent breakfast room a little small but quite satisfactory convenient location very close to a Metro station
300211,Eurostars Monumental, Leaky sink drain in bathroom on the last day , Newly renovated hotel very nicely designed Lost a passport and staff went way beyond to help us Buffet breakfast had many offerings and was well prepared and nicely presented Location is steps from subway ad a very short walk to Sagada Familia three stops from La Rambla 
300212,Eurostars Monumental, There was no air con because as the receptionist explained it was Spring time and air con was too expensive to run However the temperatures were in the early 20C and it was muggy I only slept for a couple of hours each night because the room was like a sweat box Opening the window was as bad as it opened the room up to the traffic sounds from two of Barcelona s main dual carriageways traffic did not lessen during the night The bed was uncomfortable When one considers the point of a hotel is achieve a good nights sleep whilst travelling this was something of a disastrous stay from our perspective , The room was clean We did not avail of breakfast 
300213,Eurostars Monumental, Tea coffee making facilities would be good in the room , Good location close to metros and the Sagrada Familia Lovely staff Very helpful Good breakfast Clean room
300214,Eurostars Monumental, everything good but would have liked if there was a coffee shop or lunch menu we did go across the road, staff very friendly could not do enough for us gave us an umbrella as it was raining on our first day staff booked some tours for us room clean and comfortable and nice view from window good selection for breakfast and price very reasonable hotel near everything first few times kept getting lost and when staff marked it out on the map we did not get lost staff spoke good English will be back highly recommend this hotel
300215,Eurostars Monumental, There was no kettle in the room which meant that you were unable to make yourself a hot drink Also no iron and ironing board in the room although they did offer an ironing service but of course this is all extra money , The rooms albeit small were modern clean and nicely decorated 
300216,Eurostars Monumental, In the 1st night it was too hot in the room the A C wasn t working on cool air , The room had a really nice view of Sagrada Familia Clean room Good breakfast Professional front desk employees 
300217,Eurostars Monumental, Not really having a restaurant Or food available accessible so easily in the hotel , Huge bathtub 2 blocks from La Sagrada Familia Pizza place across the hotel And they set up a shuttle for me great place 
300218,Eurostars Monumental, The bathroom showers need updating and my AC didn t work in the room Continental breakfast was 12 and there are so many local restaurants to choose from this should be avoided , Great location close to Monumental Metro station and easy for transportation into Barcelona This hotel is ideally situated and a basic 4 city hotel 
300219,Eurostars Monumental, They do not turn on the air conditioning until the end of March If the room is hot you have to open a window and hear the sounds of heavy city traffic One day they forgot to make up the room we had to ask them to do so The breakfast room is in the basement with no windows However the buffet breakfast was decent but the same every day There is no restaurant and no bar to purchase a glass of wine or a mixed drink Call your own taxi to and from the airport if the hotel does it for you it will cost you much more We left early for the airport and seeing we had pre purchased breakfasts we asked for a breakfast pack It was a single cold cut sandwich without any condiment and an apple No water beverage or anything else That was really bad By the way they charge your credit card for your full stay immediately upon booking If you are unhappy and want to leave for any reason you will be stuck with paying the full amount of your stay Overall I would not rate the Barcelona Eurostars Monumental as a hotel worthy of its 4 Star rating It is expensive for what it is I would not stay there again Unfortunately it was not a positive experience , Location close to Sagrada Familia and Metro Station Staff were friendly and informative 
300220,Eurostars Monumental, A few more English channels apart from the news because when we got home from walking around all day it would have been nice to watch a film in English Also it was my birthday a little bottle of wine would have been nice and a few more chocolate s , Lovely room really comfy bed Paula Andrea and the guy at reception were really helpful 
300221,Eurostars Monumental,No Negative, the breakfast buffet was not impressing the scrambled eggs were old and had a crust on them When i asked for new eggs the waiter said that they take it out of a bottle and that they dont have a kitchen No wonder it has crust on it after being in a bottle and thereafter under a heating lamp Not my favourite choice for breakfast Other than that it was nice and what could be a expected for a 4star hotel 
300222,Eurostars Monumental, Tea coffee making in bedroom would be nice, Wonderful location Safe neighbourhood Steps away from Metro Easy walk to Sagrada Familia Lovely friendly staff 
300223,Eurostars Monumental, The English TVselection could be better, The room with balcony was great My son has been studying Gaudi so the view of the sangradia famila was awesome
300224,Eurostars Monumental, The temperature of the Hotel was a bit warm but it was quickly solved , The room was very very good A lot of space a good view La sagrada fam lia and the location was really good Near the Monumental underground station and also near to some bus stops that can take you to a lot of turistic places One of the main qualities of the hotel is the staff Very helpful and pro active You can also buy tickets for some atractions in the city Definitely a place to come back We had a great experience 
300225,Eurostars Monumental,No Negative, Staff were exceptional so helpful from bars to drink to sightseeing areas Rooms and hotel overall was so modern and gorgeous Will definitely be back to my favourite city and to my favourite hotel 
300226,Eurostars Monumental,No Negative, The staff was friendly and helpful and location was great just a few blocks from Sagrada Familia or a bus trip from the city centre The rooms were clean the amenities were just round the corner all in all we would visit this hotel again 
300227,Eurostars Monumental, Reception area is a bit dry , Staffs are accommodating helpful Breakfast are fresh full satisfying The location is in a part of Barcelona where there are not much foot traffic except those going to LA Sagrada so it was very nice to just walk around and enjoy the view there is no need to hurry because of crowds walking with you 
300228,Eurostars Monumental,No Negative, Perfect location very comfortable bed amazing view from the room and it is very convenient to go anywhere because the metro station is only one minute from the hotel 
300229,Eurostars Monumental, We booked a room 5 months earlier but we didnt get the room we wanted Hotel sent us an email just a night before with that info but it was pretty late regarding the fact that we was on our way to barcelona and we couldnt check that mail and reply It is not really 4 hotel room was pretty old and we didnt get the same room we saw on pictures while making a reservation Rooms need to be renovated as soon as possible, Location near metro stations and near sagrada familia
300230,Eurostars Monumental, We asked for a double bed but got twin beds instead The bathtub needs more maintenance , The hotel is just next to the metro station which was really convenient Hotel staff are very helpful and very conversant in English Not far from Sagrada Familia we had less than 10 minutes walk 
300231,Eurostars Monumental, The pastries served at breakfast were abit stale Only viewing option in English language was news would be nice to have an addition variety channel, The wifi was super fast Hotel was closely located to the metro which connected you to major attractions in no time In addition it is a walking distance to Sagrada Familia approximately 10 minutes walk when strolling Clean rooms and staff were helpful 
300232,Eurostars Monumental, The bed was incredibly uncomfortable we basically didn t sleep for three nights, The location of the hotel was great close proximity to the Sagrada Familia and the metro station 
300233,Eurostars Monumental, I didn t mind at all but if you wanted to do lots of shopping there are other areas to accommodate better , I liked that there seemed to be lots of locals around I caught some basketball games in a community area right behind the hotel Lots of mini markets with fresh fruit and wine etc A safe area children down to the market on their bikes Lots of people out walking with their dogs 
300234,Eurostars Monumental, The room itself didn t have electrical kettle We asked for that and they brought it but it was a very old one It would be much better if every room had electrical kettle and a few tea bags for free that wouldn t cost too much Their blanket didn t seem very good It was thin and not so clean , The staff were helpful and quick The hotel was clean 
300235,Eurostars Monumental, Entrance and lobby seems to be a 1 star Our room was very noisy We booked a 25 sq2 double room but it wasn t more than 15 , Breakfast was good The location is 5 min walk from Sagrada Familia Staff were very nice and helpful 
300236,Eurostars Monumental, No English breakfast tea bags were available at breakfast but the coffee was good , We had a problem with our first room and as it couldn t be fixed the receptionist arranged for us to switch rooms We ended up in a suite on the top floor as everything else was full 
300237,Eurostars Monumental, The room had a weird odor to it The kind of smell from an air conditioner that has accumulated mildew or mold It was noticeable only when we walked into the room after being outside for a while The shower door was a bit impractical I noticed the new design in Europe is to install a glass shower door that only shields half the length of the bathtub If the shower head is in a different position it is very easy for water to spray out and all over the floor We had water puddles every day which was annoying since we had three people in my group , The rooms were clean beds comfortable and location amazing I made a request a few weeks before arrival to see if my family could be placed in a room with a view of Sagrada Famailia The hotel kindly accommodated and we were placed in a room on the 6th floor with a direct view of the church It was amazing Staff was very friendly and helpful I was traveling as part of a trio and requested that a roll away bed be added to our room A bed was provided but the mattress was limp and squeaky You could feel each spring in the mattress We asked the staff to replace the mattress and they quickly complied with a much nicer and newer bed 
300238,Eurostars Monumental, can t make that comment we love everything, the suite was very spacey comfortable bed huge bath room with bidet train station just across the street close to Sagrada Family very central convenience Train station just across the street
300239,Eurostars Monumental, 1 The weather wasn t kind for walking into around returning from the old city , 1 The locality was fantastic for our primary tourist destination Sagrada Familia see photo below taken from our balcony on arrival 2 The streets around the hotel were wonderful for walking around in the evening and sampling local cafes 3 The breakfast menu was terrific and the staff overall were very helpful and made a big effort to help us 
300240,Eurostars Monumental, Lift was bit small The hotel does not have a restaurant but do have a breakfast area It is a bit far from the center where all the shops and nice restaurants are , Staff were very friendly helpful and accommodating The room was neatly made and clean Bed was very comfortable Huge lobby Nice view of Sagrada Familia from the balcony 
300241,Eurostars Monumental, The double bed was actually just two beds together which wasn t really comfortable , The view was really great the room was nice and clean the staff was friendly It s perfect for staying just for one night or a couple of days Location is amazing the nearest metro is 2 minutes walking and so is Sagrada Famiglia 
300242,Eurostars Monumental, 1 Reception person later in evening quite rude in manner 2 No free coffee in room Cannot remember last time stayed in hotel esp 4 which did not provide free coffee , Check in staff friendly and welcoming good location for my needs and great view of La Sagrada Familia from my 8th floor balcony 
300243,Eurostars Monumental,No Negative, Staff very friendly and always on hand to assist View of the sagrada familia was exceptional as stated when we booked the 8th floor superior room Did not disappoint Very private terrace 
300244,Eurostars Monumental, If they had half board facilities Kettle or coffee tea making facilities in the room , Breakfast was good for veg and non veg Rooms were clean and tidy Hot water system really good Staff were extremely helpful Our son enjoyed nespresso coffee every morning 
300245,Eurostars Monumental, Lights on the floor from the terrace are really really dangerous I burned my feet very bad while stepping on one of them, We booked a standard room and we got the smallest corner room from the hotel that we couldn t even move I told them that it s not the room that I saw in the picture when I book it The receptionist informed me that the hotel is fully booked so we cannot make any change Next day we got a big room on the top of the building with a huge terrace with an amazing view above Barcelona Great staff friendly guys 
300246,Eurostars Monumental,No Negative, Great location walking distance to most sights and famous choc churro restaurant Staff friendly english speaking and helpful quiet and huge rooms Extras in bathroom very useful 
300247,Eurostars Monumental, My husband missed having a coffee maker in the room as that is the 1st thing he does when he gets up , The front desk attendants were exceptionally helpful In all we have seen 2 girls Mila and sorry forgot the other one s name They were both very professional and always ready to assist Luis is the one we met the very 1st day and liked him right away Spoke very good English and was very helpful He was able to give us to our surprise a lovely suite with a beautiful terrace and a fantastic view Even though we arrived a little earlier he was able to accommodate us right away Also the fact that our flight was not until late in the evening on check out day the girl at the desk took our luggage in storage and booked us a taxi while we did some more sight seeing that day I would gladly recommend this hotel to our family and friends Thank you for your hospitality 
300248,Eurostars Monumental, Wished they provided bottled water in room The water pressure of the shower could have been better , Bed was nice and firm Comforter was good Sheets were clean Room is cosy and ambience is just right 
300249,Eurostars Monumental, nothing, modern great neighborhood walk to everything staff friendly and very helpful great restaurant a staff suggestion just a short walk around the corner very comfortable bed
300250,Eurostars Monumental, nothing if I m being truly honest , the location was excellent From our hotel room we could see the top of sagrada familia and quick hop onto the metro and we were at the city centre Couldn t rate it more
300251,Eurostars Monumental, More variety in the buffet breakfast would be good, The staff are very friendly they explained how to get around the city helped us book tickets to the major attractions and recommended places to eat The hotel is very close to the Sagrada Familia although far from the city centre Cataluyna Square However transport is excellent in Barcelona so not too bad Go to Restaurant Nogal near by and try the seafood paella grilled seafood platter and seafood soup it is an excellent traditional Spanish restaurant 
300252,Eurostars Monumental, Nothing , I have been staying at this hotel over the last 10 years Great value Location is excellent next to Sagrada Familia next to a Metro but far from the tourist crowds on Rambla and the Old City The personnel is exceptional in doing all they can to help and accommodate Special thanks to Ms Ana Pol a great manager who did all she could to make my stay easier despite my special needs on crutches due to a fall 
300253,Eurostars Monumental, Very NOISY AMBULANCE MOTOR bikes screeming in the middle of the NIGHT TOWELS OLD BEDS not CORMFY MY hubby I did not enjoyed the staycations this HOTEL ONLY the breakfast is GOOD not worth the MONEY , Only the breakfast was GOOD 
300254,Eurostars Monumental, the hotel rooms are in such a bad condition Especially the bathroom had fungus because the water was constantly leaking yellow stains on the tub etc There is no double bed and the single beds don t remain together at night The room is quite small compared to the pictures shown , The location is great breakfast personal and the view were pretty good as well We complained about our room and they changed us to a better one 
300255,Eurostars Monumental, Air condition didn t work 3 out of 4 nights they said there was a problem with the system Room service is not on site but the other side of Barcelona and it took 1 20 minutes to arrive the bedroom needs refurbishment water leaking in the toilet the whole time , the breakfast was good but the orange juice was undrinkable the location is not bad
300256,Eurostars Monumental, Pretty standard breakfast not a lot of choos from A little far from the center , Really close to a metro station and to the sagrada familia Great staff 
300257,Eurostars Monumental, Hotel needs renovation this is no way a 4 star hotel It s massively overpriced Located next to major main roads and an elementary school be prepared for noisy nights and mornings Walls are also very thin and there is no real door isolation so whenever someone leaves or arrives at their room you notice it quite well Neighbourhood is not a particulary nice or lively one , Very friendly reception staff
300258,Eurostars Monumental, Air conditioning did not work ants in the bathroom and terrible extra bed needed to ask for blankets to stuff it , Fantastic location Sagrada metro monumental Great staff very helpful Best breakfast ever 
300259,Eurostars Monumental, Probably needs some renovation breakfast offering goes for 3 star hotel as that is a central location streets are always loaded so ti s quite noisy if windows are opened , Normal size room and bathroom Close to metro central location free wifi with normal speed friendly atmosphere
300260,Eurostars Monumental, Most importantly the air conditioning did not work and we had a sleepless night Then the noise was quite disturbing since it was on the corner of a busy intersection Needless to say I spent a uncomfortable night with the heat and noise What a shame because otherwise the hotel is quite nice , Excellent location and breakfast 
300261,Eurostars Monumental, The over all cosmetics of the hotel needs updating There s RED WINE stains on the wall where we stayed , The location is great very close to Sagrada Familia and the hotel Staffs are very good 
300262,Eurostars Monumental, Bed hard and room very noisy probably due to being close to lift Water could be heard going through drains when toilets flushed in other rooms above us , Location and staff were excellent and price good A couple of blocks from the Sagrada familia and metro just by the hotel 
300263,Eurostars Monumental, The aircon was not working in my room so I switched rooms Unfortunately the other room was still hot with the aircon not working properly , Friendly staff good location 
300264,Eurostars Monumental, Be easier to have tea coffee making facilities in the room but only because I felt cheeky to keep requesting it , We had a suite and the room and balcony were amazing worth the upgrade Staff friendly and welcoming Clean hotel good location 
300265,Eurostars Monumental, I wish we had more time in Barcelona We had missed our ship and that cut two days out , the staff were fabulous the breakfast was very good Felt very safe walking around in that neighbourhood Convenience stores were at every block I would go back 
300266,Eurostars Monumental, The shower bath was blocked and when I was having a shower I was floting in my dirty water, The staff was really helpful and friendly The hotel is very close to the Metro and 10 mins walking from the Sagrada Familia The view on the 7th floor was amazing I could actually see the Sagrada familia very well from the window Bed was comfortable and also the pillow 
300267,Eurostars Monumental, No coffee facilities in the room , The staff were very friendly and very helpful We could buy tickets for venues and the tour bus in advance from the hotel so we did not have to queue for ages The rooms were very clean had fresh towels every day and we could see a little bit of the Sagrada Familia spires from our window The hotel is located at the corner of diagonal and marina so it is very busy and you can hear a bit of the traffic it does however feel very open and not cramped like in the old city There are a few souvenir shops and restaurants near the Sagrada as well as a stop for the tour bus If you are after a lot of shops and restaurants on your doorstep this is not the place for you We were very happy with the location and did a lot of walking 11 miles in one day alone which is the best way to explore take pictures 
300268,Eurostars Monumental, Air conditioning didn t work and the room was very hot Room service menu was mostly Japanese food No other facilities , Staff were very friendly and helpful 
300269,Eurostars Monumental, The AC was not working during all my stay the room was very hot and humid i had to open the window all night which brought a lot of street noise It was very unacceptable as i paid a big amount of money to end up in a hotel that provides air conditioning Also their profile on booking con says property is air conditioned very misleading and annoying Also i was provided 2 twin beds stuck together rather than the queen bed i requested Which was very uncomfortable , Location was fine 15 meter away from monumental metro station and 5 minutes walk from Sagrada Familia Staff were very helpful and nice 
300270,Eurostars Monumental,No Negative, Maps given to us on arrival along with recommendations of things to do and the ability to get tickets booked via reception Nothing was too much trouble for staff Lovely view from hotel window Metro station very close to hotel 
300271,Eurostars Monumental, Hotel manager was rude in how he questioned my complaint No atmosphere or a bar that is open late at night No facilities to sit out and sunbathe or a pool City Tax should be added to the final price and taken off before hand Over priced , Rooms were excellent very comfortable and extremely clean 
300272,Eurostars Monumental, The bed was the hardest thing I have ever slept on not firm just hard and the pillows were dreadful No tea or coffee making facilities and if you wanted a cuppa you had to run down to reception and wait for someone to be free to make a cup at 3 a pop With price paid I would have expected better Room service menu was of a particular genre and couldn t really disguise itself as a meal you would have been hungry 2 hours later Room was beside the lift and therefore we had noise everytime someone used the lift on the upper floors Balcony was nice to have paid for that but could have had cushion available for chair or lounger Location was ok only 5 min walk to Segrada Familia but for most other things you had to travel , The staff were friendly and room was clean 
300273,Eurostars Monumental, 11 for a pretty poor breakfast Missing the toilet brush Bidet blocked I had to signal it to the reception, Location close to Sagrada Familia and to metro station Comfortable bed Very polite staff
300274,Eurostars Monumental, Not sure how Spanish hotel ratings are provided but this hotel should be more of 3 stars at the very best the furnishings are worn out There are no carpets in the room the wooden floor are well worn and requires polarising to bring it up to a decent standard Toilet seat is broken and the shower drainage is blocked had to shover in the poodle of dirty water Reported to staff who got a plumber in but problem persisted throughout my stay I was very glad to leave after my 2 days stay AC centrally controlled which means presently only option in rooms are heating which you could turn off it can get pretty warm at night and your only option is to open your windows Another thing to beWare of is that this hotel will charge your card for full amount on booking com You cannot modify or cancel booking as you lose full amount paid for practically you are locked down to this booking so although it might say reserve there is a tiny blueprint where it clearly states this in this case it was an oversight on my part as my other bookings on booking com which states reserve only will allow free cancellation up until 24th ours before your booked date , Location very close to Sagrada Familia as well as one bus ride away to Barceloneta beach The staff were helpful 
300275,Eurostars Monumental, Wifi connection is not good inside the room Breakfast is not good too with too few choices , very friendly staff and the location is good next to metro room is large and facility is clean There are two small supermarkets nearby to get what we need 
300276,Eurostars Monumental,No Negative, Was upgraded to the suite which was a fantastic treat The view from the balcony was exceptional overlooking the Sagrada de Familia Staff were so helpful giving us directions and tips whenever we needed them The location of the hotel was ideal Located just outside the monumental metro stop and 3 blocks from the Sagrada Would definitely return to this hotel and would highly recommend it 
300277,Eurostars Monumental, old and not clean at the washing room no coffee and tea bags Too noisy if you open window, bed is clean view of city is excellent but noisy window is facing at the main road staff is very nice 
300278,Eurostars Monumental, Shower needs to be serviced Unreliable and very noisy considering other residents nearby Breakfast was an extra charge on top of an already very expensive room No bar area atmosphere in the lobby so do not choose for this type of evening drink etc , Comfortable beds varied breakfast 
300279,Eurostars Monumental, The bed was a bit hard for our comfort , The view of la sagrada famila from our room could not have been better the room decoration was nice and service at the bar was great got ice bucket when ordering prosecco great stay would come again 
300280,Eurostars Monumental, We stayed on the 6th floor and the internet was not very good It was pretty slow and we experienced frequent issues of disconnections , The Location was good Very close to Sagrada Familia and the City Centre The metro station was just 100 metres walk and it took approximately 10 mins by train to the city centre The staff was friendly room service was good There are some supermarkets close by as well 
300281,Eurostars Monumental, Very old almost thorn towels No Wifi in the room on the evenings I could not even check my email Room temperature could not be adjusted The room was a bit too warm , The staff was nice polite and helpful Location is alright next to the Monumental Metro station Nice view of Sagrada Familia The room was quiet large and clean I paid 50 Euros night which was a good bargain 
300282,Eurostars Monumental, Only 2 English speaking channels and both of them were news channels , Staff was very nice and helpful The room was very nice clean and the bed was over comfy I couldn t even get up in the morning And we could smoke in the room as well Very good location just 5 mins from Sagrada Familia 
300283,Eurostars Monumental, amenities were poor hot water in the bath was unstable seems hot then suddenly change to cold , The location is excellent close to sagrada familia with metro station just beside the hotel which make transportation very easy 
300284,Eurostars Monumental, Worst thing was the water temperature that was unstable and the shower is so old Wi fi in the rooms so so slow , Excellent helpful staff Beside the metro station 5 min from Segrada and 10 min from Gloria shopping center Near supermarkets 
300285,Eurostars Monumental, Wifi DID NOT work at all I emphasise again no wifi in the room You must go down stairs to the lobby to have Wifi access The room was extremely hot and was impossible to adjust the air condition Even when we turned the air condition completely off it was still the same Coffee was not good at all but otherwise the breakfast was ok , Nice view Large size of the room and its cleanness Friendly staff Its proximity to the metro station 
300286,Eurostars Monumental, The water temperature from the shower is not stable sometimes can be really hot The bathroom towels just seems being worn out The air con can t be adjusted it was too hot in room so we have to open window during the night but it s just too noisy from the stree The wifi is just not working and super slow , Good location and friendly staffs
300287,Eurostars Monumental, No complimentary mineral water provided in the room and the wifi wasn t working sometimes especially on Sunday, The location is very strategic and close to metro
300288,Eurostars Monumental, Hotel where air conditioning is not working I tried to turn on the cold blowing percent of the room was too warm Cleanliness is catastrophic and only superficially clean Towels in the bathroom seemed to have been used for ten years ,No Positive
300289,Eurostars Monumental, Scrambled eggs for breakfast not like home Breakfast was good otherwise , The welcome from Lauri we got when we arrived and the helpful way all reception staff were through the week Also bedroom staff did great work It s location is excellent for visiting all major sights especially close to Sagrada Familia which was seen from our top bedroom floor We asked for quiet room and got it in 606 eventhough the Hotel is close to a main square the noise was not bad at night The hotel was nice and calm
