259281,Villa Alessandra, The staff werent helpfull except one There wasnt ant security The staff didnt know the job They always give us the wrong room keys We hope that they didnt gave our rooms key to someone else One night the electricity of the otel gone and the staff didnt know what to do One person left in the elevator and the firemen saved him We have to made an really argument with one off the staff The wireless didnt worked for 2 days the staff just tell me that if I want I can leave whenever we want and if I want I can use the wireless in the lobby But as they promise there wasnt any wireless at the rooms for 2 days , The location is perfect So close to Champs Elysees The furnitures are slightly outdated but so clean ve smells fine Only one receptionist The girl staying in the mornings was helpfull kind and well donated 
259282,Villa Alessandra, To be honest I have never rated any hotel before because I trust booking s reviewers However this hotel got me to rate For me it is the worst hotel I have ever been to It should be rated one star hotel It is very old and every thing seems like in the 1920s not in 2017 Just stay away from this one , Only location and WiFi
259283,Villa Alessandra, The elevator wasn t very smooth Not sure that it fits the 4 star description but we got it on sale in the off season so that made it good , The location was excellent right near the arc de triomphe in a quiet cul de sac 
259284,Villa Alessandra, Towel was so thin blanket was also really thin Most sockets were hidden behind the table or bed tables which was very difficult to move so I had difficulty having access to electricity for my phone and laptop No air conditioning , Good wifi good laundry service packed in a neat box 
259285,Villa Alessandra, Thinnest towels in the universe tiles coming off side of bath air con didn t should have guessed they left a fan in the room for some reason but at least could open window but in turn that meant being woken up at 4am WiFi patchy One socket didn t work at all and light bulb had blown Don t seem to care in this hotel Obviously not owned by people operating it , Location off a main street bed was ok breakfast was modest but fine Check in out was efficient and fast 
259286,Villa Alessandra, There are just French TV channels In room there is a hanging wardrobe but no shelves , The hotel is very close to Arc de Triomphe 10 minutes by walk There is a market nearby and Ternes metro station is 5 minutes far from the hotel Although the hotel is in city centre this is located in a little yard so we could enjoy silence too The staff was helpful and cleaning ladies came everyday The WiFi connection was good but is needed to spell out in all rooms
