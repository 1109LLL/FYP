278418,Catalonia Atenas, After going to the rooftop pool it doesn t look like the photos online anymore these must have been taken a few years ago Not much room around the poolside but there are other sun loungers on a lower level of the roof meaning you could still sunbathe and enjoy the view , The staff at the hotel were amazing from the moment we got there to the moment we left Very helpful and spoke English very well As it was our first time in Barcelona the man behind the reception gave us helpful information on which Metro s to get where and a map of Barcelona We got a smaller room than we were supposed to because we wanted to check in early but this was still a great size and was immaculate Air conditioning in the room was great and so was the free wifi which was available anywhere in the hotel There is a Metro stop right outside the hotel which was great when travelling to the Gothic Quarter and a lovely bakery right next door I would definitely recommend this hotel 
278419,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, The staff is so friendly and they are very well dressed and clean Me and my mom stayed one night then went somewhere else for the week and the entire time wished we stayed at this place 
278420,Catalonia Atenas, Bar food was very good but very expensive breakfast ludicrous price two bakeries cafes within walking distance serve excellent patisserie coffee sandwiches etc for quarter of the price and you can sit outside Would have liked a couple of extras like a pool table or table tennis table to make it a little more family friendly some of the hostels at similar prices with those were full at the time we booked Similarly lounge bar area a bit impersonal so we didn t tend to use it or be tempted to dine in apart from expense but then there is so much to see we were out for 10 12 hours of the day Pool in stunning spot but so very small it s really a plunge pool and too busy to use in high summer unless you wait for a long time for a turn Best to go out of town to the sea , Great location right near metro train station plus well placed for travel on foot to Sagrada Famiglia and some other sights plus a modern shopping mall Spotless modern rooms and communal areas and amazing view from our room from roof top area Lovely spa Excellent staff 
278421,Catalonia Atenas, Pool was tiny, Spacious rooms big beds good air conditioning very nice staff Very clean Taxi to gothic area was 8 euros Highly recommend the gothic area for amazing atmosphere and restaurants 
278422,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Santiago the night time receptionist was absolutely amazing There was a problem with the air conditioner in our room and he immediately gave us a room upgrade and free breakfast He was very friendly and gave helpful advise All the staff was very helpful with the questions we asked about how to get around and about the public transport system 
278423,Catalonia Atenas, Only wish is for there to be more sockets in the bedroom There were 2 of us in our room and only one socket by the door to charge devices , Fantastic location with Clot Metro station just around the corner Room was clean cool and comfortable Fantastic shower bathroom facilities and a comfy bed at night Unfortunately we were next to a room of younger visitors who were happy to make as much noise as possible during all hours of the night However we can not praise the hotel staff enough for dealing with this issue promptly and professionally 
278424,Catalonia Atenas, If I was to find any fault it would be that our room was situated near the glass lift shaft so we could hear the lift when being used Nothing a heavy sleeper would notice and for me nothing my ear plugs couldn t block out , As you enter reception you are struck by the cool spa like aroma and tranquility of the spacious area Staff were fab Breakfast choices the biggest I ve ever seen hot cold cereals meats cheeses eggs fruit breads and more catering also for special diets The room was spacious and bed very comfortable The spa was indulgent 
278425,Catalonia Atenas, Aircon didn t work properly fridge only worked sometimes TV only worked sometimes Room didn t have a jug and we were told we weren t allowed to have one The spa facilities cost and you have to book ahead EVERYTHING except sleeping came at an extra cost They tried to over charge me then made me wait half an hour while they asked around to find out I was right Some staff were nice so were rude We tried to speak Spanish but their English was limited , Nothing
278426,Catalonia Atenas, Only two slight complaints we had in our stay was the air conditioning wasn t working properly for the first couple days but the hotel staff were very helpful in trying to sort this for us It was made better but still not working properly And the other was the tv had very few channels with English and even fewer that worked in English trivial I know but it s nice to be able to relax in the room for a couple hours after a long day of sight seeing and understanding what s being said , The hotel was very good the neighbourhood that it is in is not a very touristy area But there is plenty of nice places to eat The links to the centre are brilliant with clot metro station less than a minutes walk 
278427,Catalonia Atenas, The website did not state how small the size of the rooms were and the first room I checked in the ceiling was leaking and had to wait 24 hours before they gave me another room also the snack bar which offered finger food did not deliver what they offered on the menu didn t look anything like the picture i am aware that it s not always what you see as the picture is what you get but honestly I ordered fish and chips and it should have been called fish and chip literally 4 5 chips in the basket, The concierge very helpful always giving advise where to go and how to get around the city
278428,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, The rooms were modern clean and comfortable with two double beds The rooftop pool is small but the terrace area is large enough to sunbathe with fantastix views of the city The Hotel is close to the metro train links and only a few stops to the main attractions and the beach The staff are very friendly and helpful overall great stay would definitely stop again 
278429,Catalonia Atenas, The car park was full and although the hotel had organised a discounted rate with a nearby carpark it was very difficult to get to due to the one way road system and an incorrectly named street map I mentioned this error to the reception I hope they amend it for future guests , Newly refurbished premium rooms were extremely good boutique style and very comfortable The front desk staff could not have been more helpful or welcoming excellent staff 
278430,Catalonia Atenas, The was no tea coffee facilities in the room there was a fridge which contained 3 bottles of water when we arrived and was not refilled Be warned if you want a holiday relaxing by the pool this hotel is not for you The pool area was a roof top pool max capacity to be comfortable about 6 8 people But don t expect to swim its more hot tub size There was no waiter service at the pool side so had to go down 10 floors for a decent drink or food There was a maximum of 8 chairs on the pool area with only a foot to walk past and no room for children to play There were no parasols Decking was shabby and the chairs were deck chairs not sun loungers so not really a relaxing time The ladies toilet door did not close properly , Room size good excellent breakfast beautiful spa staff accommodating Hotel interior good standard and clean The hotel lobby was welcoming and a good atmosphere There were drinks machines and comfortable seating 
278431,Catalonia Atenas, Nothing, Thank you for asking a survey I do not think its a 4 star hotel regarding its services I already made complaints about room 210 for air conditioning fault and room no 206 for the room fridge which remained out of order and no body came to fix it For room no 210 when we made complaint of AC fault and foul smell first the staff gave us a n air freshner Strangely and then they changed our room to sixth floor 602 where internet signals were very poor 
278432,Catalonia Atenas, nothing , Good location Its not in the thick of it but within walking distance of Sagada Familia Lots of local bars cafes within walking distance Very friendly and helpful staff Metro is close by although we didn t use it We either walked or got a cab E10 from La Rambla 
278433,Catalonia Atenas, There is no enought parking place in hotel The hotel room was very small The roof pool is also very very small max for 10 12 peoples The same jacuzzi max capacity 10 ppl , The breakfast was delitious 
278434,Catalonia Atenas, The pool is more for relaxing and selfies rather than for swimming , The best hotel of our trip It was a quality hotel well presented and with very helpful staff We had a free welcome drink which was a nice touch and our room was lovely We made use of the roof top pool which had a great view of the city at sunset It was very close to the metro station which was useful Worth paying a bit extra for 
278435,Catalonia Atenas, There didn t seem to be very much to do in the immediate area for example the restaurants across the road were awful However there were shops around and a metro very nearby , The rooftop pool is lovely and the rooms were comfortable The staff were very attentive and helpful 
278436,Catalonia Atenas, The pool was out of order for 2 days during our stay and it was one of the reasons we booked tis hotel , Rooms were very clean and the rooftop view was very nice 
278437,Catalonia Atenas, The area was a bit ghetto but that really didn t affect the amazing service within the hotel, The beds were comfy and housekeeping did an amazing job
278438,Catalonia Atenas, Pool is deceptively small Expensive for what you get Spa and downstairs pool is extra money Restaurant is very expensive Check if breakfast is included If not it s 10 per person per day Not much around Clot , Staff very helpful Much nicer on the inside than on the outside Room was nice Right next to metro station 
278439,Catalonia Atenas, The rooftop pool was a bit dirty by the evening Additionally while the spa facilities were alright paying 10 for a small whirlpool and a steam room no sanuna felt like a bit of a rip off Less cheap orange juiced made to look infused and no more cardboard flip flops and maybe the price could be reduced Also the food on the onsite restaurant was poor at best , The hotel was lovely the room was exactly what we were looking for The views from the rooftop were stunning
278440,Catalonia Atenas, Pool is too small Never got a chance to go in because it was always full An extension should definitely be considered , Great breakfast and beautiful balcony view We enjoyed our stay 
278441,Catalonia Atenas, Being told I had to pay 60 00 for breakfast I didn t see a price list anywhere in the breakfast room my wife only had a coisant and tea this was 10 00 I expected this to be in with the room price which was 100 00 a night , The hotel was very close to the metro with easy access to most parts of the city there were also plenty of small bars and cafes within walking distance 
278442,Catalonia Atenas, during booking the customer gets informed about a parking at the hotel while checkin in we were informed that the parking was full we could use another parking 2 streets further this parking costs 19 euros a day , friendly employees an apple in the hall when leaving the hotel nice room 
278443,Catalonia Atenas, Pool decking was slippery when wet and due to it being such a small area with people sat around on chairs it made it difficult and unsafe to walk around My partner slipped and fell down the stairs because of this , The bed was large and the room was lovely Swimming pool had a wonderful view on the roof and had a good seating area Staff were helpful and the snack bar was nice and reasonably priced Hotel was clean and everything needed was available Travelling to the hotel was easy with a metro station Clot just across the road 
278444,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, The breakfast at the hotel was superb Excellent choice and quality Just around the corner from the hotel were very nice neighborhood walking streets I would definitely recommend a stroll down one of these while you enjoy your stay at Catalonia Atenas 
278445,Catalonia Atenas, Room service should be changed to serve yourself we needed a bottle opener so we called room service who brought a broken bottle opener and then asked us to go to the nearby store and open our bottle there at 2 am We asked for towels and blankets and the room service guy chose to kick the door with his legs like police breaking into a home Shocking and totally unacceptable Real rooms are nothing like the room pics you see in the website 4 stars is too much for this hotel 3 or 2 would be more appropriate Pay a 100 euros more for real value trust me Total waste of money , I liked that we are close to metro station
278446,Catalonia Atenas, Noisy guests in the room above but that can apply to every hotel Would have liked to be able to make a cup of coffee in the room , Decent accommodation very clean good location for getting about by foot metro bus Very easy to get to Clot from the airport by train or Metro 
278447,Catalonia Atenas, The only thing that was really strange was the fact that there wasn t an electrical outlet near the bed I needed to charge my phone near the desk and I couldn t just relax in bed with it , The room was very clean each day 
278448,Catalonia Atenas, Bar area could have been a little more relaxing in terms of seating and layout , Room was comfortable and clean Breakfast was real good value for the money 
278449,Catalonia Atenas, Bathroom very small and badly laid out towels had to hang over toilet Tap temperature in shower either boiling hot or freezing cold To turn tap change temperature had to reach through boiling freezing water Shower leaked on floor No drinking water provided in bedroom Very slow lift had to wait for ages or climb stairs I was on 8th floor Few staff on reception so often long queues, Good choice at breakfast convenient location 
278450,Catalonia Atenas, Noise from other guests late at night from cleaning staff early in the morning some signs asking people to keep the noise down while people are sleeping might help, All staff were very helpful and cheerful
278451,Catalonia Atenas, The size of the swimming pool it was more of a plunge pool , The breakfast was excellent superb choices The bed was very comfortable and we had a choice of pillows 
278452,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Great hotel Very nice room for family Good location Staff were possibly the nicest I ve dealt with in a hotel Very nice and helpful Would definitely stay here again
278453,Catalonia Atenas, Their customer service and crises management procedures They should be revised criteriusly , When we got there everything looked and seemed great We arrived early and they gladly took in our luggage while we returned our rental car and came back Later in the afternoon we checked in and went to the room It was the nicest room ever The kids were super happy instaled in their bunker beds And then things went wrong The air conditioning stopped working and we went to complain in the front desk so they told us that they would send somebody to look it up Over than half an hour later someone came to our room spent 5 minutes with the air conditioning and told us to wait some 20 minutes to see if it would start to cool down the room if not we should call back the front desk for the maintenance person to come It didn t get better obviously They had a answer ready all the times we went down to complain and to try to get it fixed but actually we came to realize they were doing nothing only waiting for the night come and there would have not another solutions and the maneger would not be in So it happened we ended up with a incredibly hot and moist room after the showers we took to cool down We went to talk in the front desk again the night shift guy couldn t help us at all the best he could do was offer us a fan a single fan to cool down a large room that a broken air conditioning couldn t We spent a night in hell and with a fan to remedy the problem Next morning at nine o clock when the manager came in and we thought we would change rooms immediately they didn t have one ready for us They were waiting for us to tell them if we wanted it or not When we said that we wanted it right away they were not sure if the air conditioning was working properly in the new room and they need time to make sure or so they told us that So we packed our bags and got everything ready for when the new room would be ready so then the staff would make the switch and later when we came back to the hotel it would be all perfect 
278454,Catalonia Atenas, No Kettle was provided in the room Entry in SPA was chargeable which should be free of charge Bed Cover not being changed on a daily basis , Comfortable Bed Good location Nearby metro close to city centre Staffs were supportive 
278455,Catalonia Atenas, Couldn t fault my experience Not a negative as such it s not possible to reserve parking but I was able to check before via email , Lovely facilities great location stunning views from rooftop terrace Great value 
278456,Catalonia Atenas, Overall we were delighted with the hotel and don t have any negative comments Only thing I would point out is that the pool is small just in case you have aspirations of swimming lengths every day Didn t bother me at all as what do you expect for a rooftop pool but I d guesstimate that it s maybe only 5x5m Didn t eat in the hotel at all so cannot comment on quality of catering nor did we have time for the spa , Rooms are compact but modern and very clean just what you want for a city break We had a room with a balcony on the tenth floor which was fantastic to sit out on in the evenings with a cold beer AC in the room worked very well which I appreciated as the weather was blisteringly hot Hotel staff were pleasant and helpful everyone bar the cleaners seemed to have excellent English Although we were out and about too much to really use any of the communal facilities the rooftop pool and lounge area was very clean and tidy The views from the rooftop area are stunning The location isn t overly central but there is a metro station less than 50m from the front door and with trains every 5 minutes you can be at Las Ramblas in 15 minutes Bonus there is a 24 7 bakery right next to the hotel with fresh baguettes pastries cold drinks etc perfect for throwing in your bag on the way to the Metro 
278457,Catalonia Atenas, The hotel is located a bit off city centre It claims to be a 4 star hotel and maybe it once was but it definitely needs a makeover Especially the rooms and the corridors Service was good but housekeeping was poor The room we got wasn t clean when we arrived and wasn n properly cleaned during our stay either Smoking is probably allowed in some rooms because the corridors reeks with stale tobacco , The hotel serves a very good breakfast the and the rooftop pool was very nice Service was good l d like to give the hotel credit for having 4 bed family rooms This is very hard to find 
278458,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, The staff were always helpful We liked the fact it was slightly outside the main tourist area in a more residential part of town The public transport was cheap easy and reliable 
278459,Catalonia Atenas, Quite expensive so a better nightly rate would be appreciated , Fantastic double beds in the room very comfortable Staff were all lovely and extremely helpful at offering directions and recommending restaurants A super location easy to get to from the airport and easy to get to all areas from there 
278460,Catalonia Atenas, The door the bathroom was just wrong glass door with gaps there was no privacy We had a twin room with the 3rd bed added on a side which was only appriopriate for a child to sleep on No kettle tea coffee facilities in the room altough we asked for it The pool was very small and not cleaned for some time there was a sign advising not to go in , The location of the hotel was great very close to the underground Reception staff nice and helpfull Breakfast and staff at the restaurant was very good 
278461,Catalonia Atenas, The A C did not adequately cool the room It became uncomfortable especially at nights, The hotel was not great but neither was it bad The Catalonia Ramblas was a lot better with regards to room location and comfort
278462,Catalonia Atenas, Triple rooms had minimal living space They were actually small doubles with extra bed Not very clean Definitely not value for money, Staff was helfull
278463,Catalonia Atenas, We stayed in a room just across the elevator you could here the talking and laughing in the night, The reception at arrival was very welcoming and available for any kind of question Breakfast TOP 
278464,Catalonia Atenas, Accessing the parking is crazy very small difficult to drive go down and up and park Water in the bathroom is poor in pressure , Breakfast is good even if it s very expensive
278465,Catalonia Atenas, Reception staff should not work in this area with all the irregularities invoking the politics of the hotel which you do not know There is something dubious here because even though the payment was made as early as April 2017 you are also required the card and you are copied after this card Such requests have not met anywhere in this world at any reasonable hotel Otherwise the hotel is great fantastic breakfast good restaurant and rooms are very comfortable , The hotel is very good but reception services are embarrassing arrival June 22 2017 about 09 00 PM 
278466,Catalonia Atenas, Could of had more perks with the room for the price , The free apples every morning the complimentary items in the bathroom and the food from room service 
278467,Catalonia Atenas, In need of some tlc A bit shabby in parts and not the same quality in the room as other 4 hotels in Spain Very clean throughout though Pool area very small and no sunbeds just deckchairs A decent overall base though to explore as right across from a metro , Good breakfasts Clean and staff were very friendly and helpful 
278468,Catalonia Atenas, Except for Sagrada Familia which is a 15 minute walk you need transportation for everything else Metro is 30 meters away from the entrance but it was quite warm and humid in the stations so we ended up spending a lot of money in taxis , The establishment is great great value for money and the optional breakfast was amazing with an endless variety Very clean and organised definitely will stay there again in our next visit 
278469,Catalonia Atenas, I found that the room was too small , I loved the spa downstairs I also liked that fact you can only have 10 people at a time in there as it s a small space 
278470,Catalonia Atenas, No tea coffee making facilities in room, Good location for metro and easy to get around the city from there Not a lot local to hotel but not a major problem as we spent our time sightseeing all day
278471,Catalonia Atenas, No irons in the room Bed sheets not changed everyday even though it is very hot Bed mites in the over cover Air conditioning is terrible and barely works Breakfast is not worth 10 Lifts are terrible, Very good location walking distance from the metro Staff are very friendly and helpful Very good room service Rooftop pool and spa available
278472,Catalonia Atenas, Our AC was broken on the first night so it was very cold throughout the night Also the rooftop pool is a bit small , Very clean very helpful staff easy to get to main attractions from the area
278473,Catalonia Atenas, Smell in the hallway of garbage Also probably just unlucky but I think we had the smallest room on the entire floor plan no room in hallway between bedroom and bathroom , Pool deck was great and staff were very friendly and helpful 
278474,Catalonia Atenas, Couldn t get served in snack area to eat bartender washed glasses while we sat we ate all meals next door in the street bakery as did a number of guest A lot of glitz but not comfortable No lobby coffee only get coffee if you buy continental breakfast for 14 euros No extras in this place no free cookies Uptown location would be better only 1 decent restaurant close , Would not choose again Was clean good shower but no safety handle in shower to get in and out potential injury hazard room clean but no seating chair except desk Beds hard but good 
278475,Catalonia Atenas, Swimming pool very small, Very comfortable beds clean hotel with helpful staff and excellent breakfast Good location made it easy to walk to Sagrada Familia and Design Museum with lots of bars and cafes close to hand 
278476,Catalonia Atenas, The staff are abbot rude when we arrived didn t want to let us in After we had paid 1400 for too rooms because me friend booked with a bank card and lost it she had all her I d passport licence and I d card BUT they was soooo rude and soooo difficult about it I would even say a little racist BUT over all he hotel was lovely just some staff members who bring it down , The roof top pool was lovely
278477,Catalonia Atenas, I have no complaints about this lovely hotel, Beautiful big balcony with stunning views of the city Our room was spacious clean and fully stocked with toiletries Enjoyed the convenience of a great air conditioner mini fridge kettle and room safe Really close to the metro station Clot for ease of travel around the city Great spa facilities Rooftop pool although small was perfectly adequate with stunning views Staff were amazing We thoroughly enjoyed our stay
278478,Catalonia Atenas, beer not so good , A very nice large corner room with balcony friendly staff Was able to have a shower in the gym area in the evening after checking out that morning 
278479,Catalonia Atenas, Not worth the price Should mention in the description that the spa access is not free Room too small and bathroom not practical , Near train station Helpful staff Rooftop view 
278480,Catalonia Atenas, nothing, 1 Excellent location just to metro station 2 Very good breakfast 3 Friendly staff 4 Comfortable room 5 Swimming pool on the top 6 Good SPA 7 Fast WIFI internet
278481,Catalonia Atenas, My patio door was left open daily after the cleaner had left No information on local tours or sightseeing available , The bar food was excellent and the SPA was lovely Very close to the Metro station 
278482,Catalonia Atenas, The reception staff were reasonably friendly but unreliable Upon booking the hotel we paid for breakfast for every morning However our flight was rescheduled for a morning departure and thus we would have missed the final breakfast We informed reception who unequivocally stated that no refund was possible but they would provide a substantial picnic to take with us The receptionist gave every assurance that this would be provided However upon leaving reception at 5am we were extremely disappointed to find out that no picnic had been prepared for us and no refund was possible We left the hotel hungry and angry , On the whole a decent experience The food quality was excellent and the hotel is in a prime location Transport was simple and convenient from the airport using the T2 northern line straight to Clot The room was clean and spacious 
278483,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Every day bed was nicely made We were getting fresh towels every day Isolation of the room was very good since you couldn t hear any noise from the street 
278484,Catalonia Atenas, In a local area out of the way which is good for a quiet stay The rooftop pool is very small and not much lounging space on the terrace The aircon was really not great never got my room below 26c even at night or day The rooms are not soundproof so noisy neighbours coming home at midnight were a problem for sleep No main restaurant for 4 hotel for evening meals instead snack menu which is limited Not many places to eat near so is best to eat before coming back to the hotel , The staff were really helpful at the desk and the station for the metro to the city is just 5 mins round the corner The buffet breakfast is really good and wide range of food choices Snack bar was reasonably priced 
278485,Catalonia Atenas, I really cannot think of anything at the moment, The whole experience of our trip to Barcelona and the hotel was perfect I can not speak highly enough of everyone who made our stay so special Our room was lovely and clean with a fantastic shower and huge comfy bed We spent time in the spa and on the roof terrace which has spectacular views over the city very close to the metro so getting about was easy I will return here I hope sometime in the future
278486,Catalonia Atenas, Location from the information given I believed it was closer to the city center than it was it is a fair distance but metro was great and taxi from hotel to city centre was only around 9, Breakfast was great 
278487,Catalonia Atenas, Rooms were a touch small , The staff was excellent Very concerned that you were satisfied It is a great hotel except it is a touch too far from city center 
278488,Catalonia Atenas, The pool area was very small and made a no go area for us a middle age couple as it was taken over every afternoon evening that we were there by a group of youngsters and their loud music swearing drinking smoking weed etc Last night we were there it was closed off so a group of people could make some sort of music video no notice from staff no management of what was going on up there I did mention it once to staff but was told yes they are having some sort of party Food was good but the hot stuff at the breakfast buffet was always cold , coffee snack bar views from roof top Room was adequate Spa was nice but had to be booked in advance 
278489,Catalonia Atenas, Only two wall plugs in the room Could do with more as I had a twin room and not enough plugs to charge all appliances, Easy to get to beach and the centre Great local restaurants near by at amazingly cheap prices Tapas and seafood was awesome
278490,Catalonia Atenas, If breakfast was included I d give this hotel 10 10 , The beds were really comfy nice quiet hotel but perfect location for getting around right across the road from Metro Staff were lovely and the massages I had in the spa were some of the best I ve ever had 
278491,Catalonia Atenas, needed to change rooms the airco of the 1st room was malfunctioning made a lot of noise and did not cool Rooms are small in my opinion but you do not tend to stay in the room that long as you want to see the city, Great Breakfast Staff was very friendly and helpful Enjoyed the free apples available at the reception A metro station which was 100m away Nice spa and fitness facilities Could Change rooms in middle of night
278492,Catalonia Atenas, There sems an attittude amoung some of emplyee at the hotell with expectation of consuming more drinks at their snack bar Unfortunatelly we are couple who doesn t enjoy drinking and spending time at hotells snack bar , We never used fitness center at the hotell Instead we did walking daily discovering the city Hotell has excellent location with access to nearby shoping Also public transport such as Metro goes around the corner of hotell It takes some 15 20 minutes of walking to get to the old town to Ramble street Catedral or to the sea beach We highly recommend the Hotell 
278493,Catalonia Atenas, Air con not great not sure how it would cope when its hotter Windows open but was a bit noisy , Breakfast had a great selection with lots of healthy options and made to order food station Staff were very friendly and helpful Room was standard size if a bit dated High level of cleanliness with new towels and sheets every day Great location
278494,Catalonia Atenas, It s quite a walk to get to the centre of Barcelona however there is a metro across the road which is easy to use, Room was lovely roof top pool was amazing staff very happy to help
278495,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, I stayied once at Catalonia Atenas and the second time I went they had a small problem with some rooms and they moved me to another hotel of the chain very close to Planza Catalunya They provided a taxi transfer for me and were super quick and super nice Also gave me a welcome flute while I was waiting Both hotels are extra comforable staff super nice and the food excellent Love the huge breakfast buffet and the spa 
278496,Catalonia Atenas, The waitress for breakfast was very unfriendly and not very accommodating The receptionist on the other hand was friendly and assisted us with our questions and even made recommendations that was very helpful ,No Positive
278497,Catalonia Atenas, A little overpriced for a 4 star but that s actually a problem with all equivalent Barcelona accomodations I think Or the whole city for that matter Oddly Madrid capital was cheaper , Within walking distance to Sagrada although far from rest of main attractions metro station just outside so not really a problem Working class neighbourhood but mainly quiet 
278498,Catalonia Atenas, bed wasn t a kings size but just two beds pushed together Rooms seem to come in different sizes and ours was very small the roof top pool could have been heated as was very cold , Great clean hotel location Helpful staff Everything we needed Breakfast was great with lots of cold and hot options which changed daily 
278499,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Close to metro excellent staff wonderful breakfast and snack bar cool rooftop pool deck Staff were very willing to provide directons via metro Easy to take metro to hotel 
278500,Catalonia Atenas, Pool was smaller than expected as pictures make it look bigger , View from the rooftop pool is spectacular You can see the sagrada Familia from the here Staff were also very polite and helpful when offering directions and also supplied us with a map and were happy to help and answer any questions regarding transport 
278501,Catalonia Atenas, We were booking hotel with breakfast and in hotel they told us breakfast is not included We rented the car and hotel parking cost 20 per night Spa sauna jacuzzi is on extra charge too You only can use swimming pool when it s on opening hours and there is enough people to disturb you if you want to spend time relaxing Too many drunk people shouting around And room service is knocking one time while already coming inside room ,No Positive
278502,Catalonia Atenas, Next time i would maybe pick a room with tea coffee facilities beds were a little bit too hard for my liking but others might prefer that, Staff were beyond helpful could not do enough for you Spa was excellent Breakfast buffet was delicious had everything that anyone would want Hotel is also close to the beach la rambla camp nou
278503,Catalonia Atenas, Our room was to be premium room with spa access and breakfast included Room was clean and fresh No bath no view and actually very small with no windows to open nor a balcony Also reception wanted me to pay a further 10 each to access the spa for 2 hours I just think for 680 for four nights was very expensive considering the room facilities , Breakfast was delicious every morning but would advise to book bed and breakfast as it only cost 1 10 other wise will be at least 14 per person per day
278504,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Easy to use the metro line 1 stop Clot to get around town Staff was very helpful with calling taxis giving recommendations for dinner and so on The roof has a great view and a nice place to play cards or relax before going to dinner We had breakfast at the cafe next door or down the road so no comment on how the food was at the hotel Lobby bar was nice 
278505,Catalonia Atenas, Nothing at all, Location is close to metro train and bus stop Sagrada familia is just 15 min by walk Many restaurants and cafe s near hotel Room service was done everyday and staff very friendly 
278506,Catalonia Atenas, The property was in a great location There is a bakery next door with cheap breakfast I would go there before I paid for breakfast at the hotel though The hotel was clean looked very classy and the rooms were super spacious for being in Europe I was impressed when we walked in the room They also had larger tubs which was nice for a bubble bath after a long day They also gave us 2 free drinks at the bar upon check in The safe in my room didn t work I called to have it fixed No one came to fix it The walls were kind of thin Finally the water temperature was either super hot or super cold Kind of uncomfortable but I appreciated it to soak my feet after a long walking day The WIFI wasn t to great in my room We did stay in the top level so I just chalked it up to distance as I was connected to the same network in the lobby and it worked great and fast I would recommend staying on one of the lower levels There wasn t much of a view anyway All in all I would definitely stay here again when visiting Barcelona , The property was in a great location There is a bakery next door with cheap breakfast I would go there before I paid for breakfast at the hotel though The hotel was clean looked very classy and the rooms were super spacious for being in Europe I was impressed when we walked in the room They also had larger tubs which was nice for a bubble bath after a long day They also gave us 2 free drinks at the bar upon check in 
278507,Catalonia Atenas, Bed was pretty hard and the sheets where very thin personally myself and my partner got pretty cold throughout the night surprisingly possible in Barcelona Breakfast was a lil expensive so we didn t opt for it instead we went to the bakery next door , Staff were really helpful downstairs spa was very nice however the roof top pool was very small probably wouldn t have used it if others were there Roof top lounge area had amazing views as it was a ten story building you could see all of Barcelona including the Segrade Familia probably a mile or two away Metro station right on your door step Clot and a very nice bakery right next door
278508,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Really good and fresh breakfast with good variety of products Friendly staff superb view from the rooftop terrace had a short stay so we didn t have a chanche to try the pool or the spa 
278509,Catalonia Atenas, Absolutely nothing , Nothing was too much trouble We had booked a double room and on arrival was told we had twin beds This was sorted out the next day and we were put in a double room with a balcony Staff were so helpful Would definitely stay again 
278510,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Amazing shower Walking distance to Sagrada Familia Use of computer and printer to print boarding passes was helpful Bakery next door Over the road from El Clot train station 
278511,Catalonia Atenas, Beds are a bit small and hard but that s me been picky , It s on par with equivalent hotels at that price point Location is seconds walk from both metro amd train station for easy access to the city centre 
278512,Catalonia Atenas, Not in the prettiest part of town but had nice things close by , Definitely add the breakfast Desayuno it was totally worth it Also there is an nice bakery right next door that is open 24 hrs and the people working speak english very well 
278513,Catalonia Atenas, I liked it all , Loved the rooftop view from my room staff friendliness attention Just did not like the temperature of the pool Brrr Kudos to the desk personnel Even charged my phone when my charger did not work 
278514,Catalonia Atenas, The bathroom above had an issue and didn t get fixed probably because it was Easter and busy , The bar is good to relax before heading out for dinner Friendly bar staff Computer available with printer 
278515,Catalonia Atenas, The walls appeared to be quite thin could hear next room tv quite easily , The Staff were very helpful and it was located close to Metro station Nice atmospehere in general 
278516,Catalonia Atenas, The room was long felt and big however the fact of being placed on the first floor which is the same floor as the restaurant and we didn t have breakfast included it was a bit loud , Staff were friendly room was comfortable and the spa is amazing 
278517,Catalonia Atenas, So very noisy Wooden floors in the bedrooms was heard above and below also room by the lifts and guests had no thought or respect to other guests sleeping , Hotel in general great
278518,Catalonia Atenas, We arrived and parking was booked fully There are 5 parking places for the whole hotel Reception recommend us the public parking for 35 euro We stayed there half of the day after which we asked reception parking place in the hotel It was free We replaced our car However they withdrew from us money for full parking day It s sad to pay for nothing ,No Positive
278519,Catalonia Atenas, The pool was a little small for my liking But the views exceptional , All The staff where very helpful and pleasant at all times nothing was to much The breakfast was amazing 
278520,Catalonia Atenas, I was waiting to get checked in for 15 minutes because there was only one guy at the counter so people were lining up The bed didn t sleep well and I ordered a double bed but got twin beds The chicken wings in the restaurant were dry The street is very noisy and keeps you awake and wakes you up again The fridge in the room only has 2 bottles of water The elevator takes ages when you call it The lobby is always boiling even when outside is cooler , Breakfast is nice and staff are friendly 
278521,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, The hotel staff were fantastic friendly and helpful I left a sunglasses case containing euros in the hotel bar and it was handed in with all the money still inside it The staff kept it safe until I enquired the next morning We also experienced a leak in our shower the staff immediately provided us with another room so very happy with how they dealt with the situation Couldn t have been more helpful Great location right by the clot metro and lovely bakery right next door 
278522,Catalonia Atenas, We supposed to have SPA included in the price Thats why we have choosen that offer with terrace so we can have SPA access When we arrived to the hotel we have been told that the offer have changed so we need to pay each time when we want to enter spa for the price which we have payed for our stay conditions were not to good , Last floor with amazing views
278523,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Breakfast was great choice tasty but expensive Sad not to have kettle and cups with tea for morning We were given a kettle when asked for hot water but no cups or free tea Staff very friendly Small restaurant very small but cosy and good experience food good 
278524,Catalonia Atenas, There was a slight issue with the AC the room remained never went below 26 degrees which at night was slightly uncomfortable not enough to complain , The staff were very friendly the spoke English well so no issue communicating with them They also have a baggage hold service for free which allowed us greater freedom to explore Barcelona on arrival and departure days 
278525,Catalonia Atenas, Room was a bit on the small side, I would definitely recommend this hotel as the staff were friendly and professional Also the hotel interior was beautiful and place was immaculate 
278526,Catalonia Atenas, Room was small and narrow so the bed was taking all the space between one wall to the other making it difficult to pass floor and wall was a bit damaged Maybe we were unlucky with this room because based on the booking pics the hotel was looking much better The bathroom door was not a real door My room was towards the main street ask if possible to get a quiet room to avoid the traffic noise, Friendly front desk clean room and easy access to city center Quick checkin out process 
278527,Catalonia Atenas, Everything was fine , The experience here was great Very easy access the metro is across the street The rooms are confortable Breakfast is great both in diversity and taste price was 10 Eur if you buy it at reception For me the most important thing was the staff we meet a lady there Geanina she sent choclate to our room the first night We got not only maps but a book with details about what to visit in Barcelona Umbrellas as our first day was rainy and raincoats We got great support on all our questions We even got free complimentary breakfst It sounds to nice I know it does but that was the truth It was really a nice place to stay bar was cool the overall feeling from other guests was nice I will use it again and recommand it to everybody traveling to Barcelona 
278528,Catalonia Atenas, The spa is 10 for 2 hours which offers gym steam room and jacuzzi pool No pool for swimming which would have been nice The rooftop pool was ice cold due to time of year and not large enough to swim in But lots of chairs to hang and soak up the view , The location is next to Clot metro which is perfect access to inner city The view from rooftop pool is beautiful Clean and welcoming The breakfast is 10 when booked at reception and offers a good buffet 
278529,Catalonia Atenas, The room was a little noisy at times we could hear the people in the next room using the bathroom , The breakfast was excellent and great value for money Huge choice Lovely view from the roof terrace The spa was very relaxing 
278530,Catalonia Atenas, Charge for breakfast was 14 which is quite expensive when there is a lovely bakery next door that is much cheaper , Location is excellent Room was nice and clean
278531,Catalonia Atenas, The shower window could do with being able to come out more But overall still excellent , The receptionist Adrian was excellent with us Thank you for the birthday muffin it was a very special touch 
278532,Catalonia Atenas, The hotel had a weird smell and the floors where marked where they hadn t been cleaned properly Room was small Expensive for what you are getting , Clean bedding
278533,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, The location of the property is really nice especially if you tend to visit Torre Agbar neighborhood or Sagrada Familia Staff is really friendly and tend to help you in case you need it The breakfast is decent but if you are not used to diversity of tastes and types of food for the breakfast then you can have it in some other place for half of the price or even cheaper Really enjoyed that hotel read my booking remark and gave a room with a nice view as I asked 
278534,Catalonia Atenas, the rooms were spotless but a bit dated and could do with an update it wasnt within walking distance of much that we could find but easy access to taxis and metro was easy enough to get round, the hotel was very clean and close to the metro and the staff were nice
278535,Catalonia Atenas, No tea and coffee facilities in room although there was a fridge , Pictures don t even do this hotel justice rooftop ids 360 degrees views of City staff were so helpful spa was lovely and the rooftop 
278536,Catalonia Atenas, Tried to visit the Fitness centre Spa at 5 00 in the evening but it was closed Didn t get to see it so I can t comment , Excellent breakfast and friendly helpful staff Good location close to the Metro station and walking distance to Sagrada Familia Nice snack bar area to grab a light meal We would stay there again 
278537,Catalonia Atenas, Sat waiting for breakfast service for so long ended up getting a coffee in the main bar and breakfast outside of the hotel Unfortunately although the spa is pictured and for the money you would expect it as part of the package we needed to pay Euros20 to use it each day so a five day stay would have incurred Euros100 extra The room was small but had a comfortable bed but lots of bits left on the floor and hairs in the bathroom and one dirty towel No tea coffee making facilities in the room which was disappointing Whilst the hotel can t be responsible for their guests behaviour a lot of noise heard late at night and banging and glasses and crockery etc early in the morning , Comfortable bed
278538,Catalonia Atenas, As most of the 4 stars hotels they are fitting normal size room 20 square mtrs room with 4 beds Our room was actually big bed with bathroom , Breakfast was good food served was fresh and various 
278539,Catalonia Atenas, It was small compared to what I am used to However this is no fault of the company or the employees Europe is just a different culture , The bathroom was good The thing is that compared to USA it was small but small bathrooms seems to be the norm here in Europe 
278540,Catalonia Atenas, The overall state of the hotel was a big disappointment Not what I would rate with four stars The hotel rooms were really wore down and in need of refurbishment The Air quality poor probably as a result of some water damage to the ceiling grey dots in the ceiling Also when entering the reception area there was a very strong stench of chlorine Rooftop pool area not very inviting and very small very low budget feel to it , Breakfast was quite plentiful and a positive surprise Also reception staff friendly and helpful
278541,Catalonia Atenas, As the hotel was on one of the main roads it was quite noisy at times at night time when sleeping think this was because we were at the front of the hotel , Hotel cleanliness was excellent housekeeping did a great job great breakfast lots of choice prices in the bar for food and drinks were really reasonable staff were very friendly and helpful lovely views from the roof top pool nice spa gym Good location
278542,Catalonia Atenas, More pillows in the room , The buffet breakfast was really good The staff were very friendly and helpful The beds were very comfortable The Spa was lovely The roof terrace and pool were great The Club Sandwich at the restaurant was delicious 
278543,Catalonia Atenas, Quite a walk to old town and attractions so needed to use Metro A little expensive for location Room got a bit stuffy due to double windows keeping out traffic noise even with air con , Very comfortable beds and nice bathroom helpful staff and lovely rooftop terrace and pool Good bakery next door if you don t want hotel breakfast and for drinks snacks Opposite Metro station 
278544,Catalonia Atenas, Pillows were really uncomfortable The staff were not as friendly as when I stayed in travel lodge poblenou I felt that for the price the spa should have been included There was not a kettle for making hot drinks The room was a bit dark All the tv channels were in Spanish except 1 , Air con and fridge were good Complimentary water was nice View from the roof terrace was fab
278545,Catalonia Atenas, A closed in wardrobe would have been appreciated in room 416 Perhaps a few more pot plants on the roof terrace , Very comfortable beds Excellent breakfast with so many choices Very helpful staff Amazing views from the roof terrace Spa looked great but disn t have time to visit on this trip 
278546,Catalonia Atenas, The swimming pool was very cold and the rooms were not at all soundproof It wasn t a problem for me as I had small kids but they can be noisy so felt a bit sorry for our neighbours , Buffet breakfast was excellent Family room was perfect size and good bunk beds Staff were friendly and helpful Lovely terrace on the roof to have a beer in the sunshine at the end of the day 
278547,Catalonia Atenas, Cost could be a little lower especially as when we first arrived after the flight and taxi the water was off for a few hours when we needed a shower Only found out there was no water by a small note in the elevator , Great breakfast 
278548,Catalonia Atenas, It was a shame that you had to pay extra to use indoor pool 10 per person although that did include use of gym and other facilities it was no use for us as children just wanted a quick swim , Very handy for metro Clot station is just across the road Great roof top pool relaxation area although the pool is small and it was freezing in April The views of city up there are amazing We found good local restaurants well priced and tasty tapas Free wi fi was a bonus 
278549,Catalonia Atenas, definetly not worth the money or what I paid for Paid for a premium room with terrace got the smallest room possible Spa is limited access and getting in impossible as its fully booked ,No Positive
278550,Catalonia Atenas, Only one mirror which was in the bathroom and the bathroom didn t have a fan Steamed up very quickly which was annoying when you were trying to do hair and make up , Staff very helpful clean and modern hotel 
278551,Catalonia Atenas, The room was so small The bed is even smaller We stayed in double rooms of 2 other hotels in Barcelona and the double bed was never this small The bathroom is tiny If you are a tall person you will hit your head on the towel rack when you try to use the toilet The hotel lobby is very spacious but the perfume is so powerful to the point of creating a nauseous feeling It was very uncomfortable going through the lobby because of the scent , It s nice to be so close to the metro station 
278552,Catalonia Atenas, Good hotel overall however for a 4 star the room and the bathroom was a bit small The swimming pool on the roof is very small but great view of the city from there, Courtesy of the staff
278553,Catalonia Atenas, If you get the wrong personal the reception you wont get a smile and hello and thank you They also took money from my credit card and put it back took it again without explaining why Instead of telling us to come to the reception to talk about it they just deactivated the key cards so we couldnt enter anymore More than a few free apples and showergwel you dont get much Also we stayed 6 nights after 3 days we didnt get the free water anymore without explanation The cleaning ladies enter the room when you are still sleeping They forgot to mention that for the spa you have to pay 10 eur each time and you need to book a time, Ok hotel nothing special They give free apples and some staff is nice
278554,Catalonia Atenas, Cold water in the pool , The view in top of the roof was amazing A pity that the water in the pool was cold The metro is across the hotel No noice in the night 
278555,Catalonia Atenas, Room service could have been a little broader as it was only set meals and you couldn t order just fries for example but other than that it was great , Was a really nice location friendly staff who always tried to help Would definitely go back
278556,Catalonia Atenas, My room was not ready untill 1 hour after check in time which was bad as we had been travelling all morning The pool was not available to use on some of the days of stay which is the reason we booked the hotel , Excellent staff Good rooms good location to public transport the hotel kindly kept our luggage while we were waiting to travel
278557,Catalonia Atenas, There was some dust on the sofa in our room however we thought that no one has stayed there in a while Also the restaurant s portions are relatively small as we ordered some sausages with mashed potatoes and received a spoon of mash and thought we were being mocked at taking into account it costed us 13 Euros for such a small portion decided to eat elsewhere after that, Amazing views from the terrace in our room on the 9th Floor Nice spa facilities with pleny of massages to choose from if you are willing to pay for them and trust me they are worth it 
278558,Catalonia Atenas, I like everything at this hotel , Stay here so often that my favourite receptionist Carmen remembers me All the staff are great the hotel itself is clean and the rooms and beds are huge Can see everything including my favourite building in the world the Sagrada Familia from the roof terrace terrace shuts at 9pm There s a 24 hour bakers just outside the hotel the train to the airport and metro is just a few minutes away and even the coffee machine in the lobby does tasty Lavazzo s for around a euro all good 
278559,Catalonia Atenas, We didn t love the first room we got but it was quiet the second was a bit better I think the rooms need a little makeover or maintenance to match up to the rest of the areas, I liked the common areas like the rooftop the fitness center breakfast place bar and the lobby The look modern and clean The scent when you enter the hotel is wonderful The staff is lovely We didn t find anyone rude 
278560,Catalonia Atenas, Booked premium Room which was on the ground floor slightly strange I thought when entered the room literally the edge of building so was on a diagonal and felt cramped considering Premium room also a bit bizarre as not much natural light due to 1 small window which looked out at street level so people passing by and main road traffic windows are tinted on the positive Being on the ground floor also felt the vibrations noise of passing trains underneath from local station room had some minor water damage on the walls which should of been dealt with prior to letting people stay in the room as did not give a good impression of the hotel and also the room was pretty cold and had no option for heating To be honest to call the room premium is a bit of a joke as if I had known this is what I would have got probably would have gone for the standard rooms which were above the first floor , Hotel overall was very pleasant and staff very accommodating facilities were great Great base to travel around Barcelona either by foot or public transport Breakfast choices great and staff at breakfast very polite and helpful 
278561,Catalonia Atenas, The hotel is extremely noisy It sounded like I was next to a construction site because there were drilling sounds both day time and night time I don t know if that was from inside the hotel or the building next to it Avoid this hotel if you are a light sleeper or at least ask for a quiet room , The staff was very nice and friendly The room was very clean Good location too very easy to get around using the Metro 
278562,Catalonia Atenas, We were robbed someone walked into our room and stole mobile phones And the hotel was rather non plussed about it In fact it seemed like they were not surprised but were trying to act as if they were They were not terribly helpful after the robbery aside from informing us where the nearest police station is And that there is nothing they can do They also insisted that it could not be an inside job and that many people had good equipment to break in , noting much besides the train station was right opposite
278563,Catalonia Atenas, Booked a room for three was advertised as three beds in the room the third was not a real bed at all Just a couple of power points in most inconvenient places , Not too fa from Sagrada Familia Close to subway station
278564,Catalonia Atenas, There was absolutely nothing about this hotel we didn t love , The members of staff here were amazing They made the room up especially for my boyfriends birthday Made us feel special it was great 
278565,Catalonia Atenas, We had issues with all 3 rooms booked One of which was glass on the floor in bathroom and main area which was not resolved as well as it could have been And all the other problems were not fixed during our stay , Large choice of options at breakfast
278566,Catalonia Atenas, Not quite as central as expected but this was due to our lack research The hotel lobby was also the local drug dealers hangout , Clean modern and comfortable
278567,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Great location for metro and railine to and from the airport El Prat Plenty of places to eat and a lovely park nearby La Sagrada Familia only two metro stops away Get the T10 to get about on public transport great value for money 
278568,Catalonia Atenas, This might be an American thing but I wanted a face cloth At every American hotel or motel you are supplied with body towel hand towel and face cloth Just saying , Everything was first class Glad staff spoke English but those that did not were very helpful still Let all 585 FaceBook family and friends know my stay was great 
278569,Catalonia Atenas, we had to ask for a kettle and we bought are own coffees for the room Floor 8 was a little noisey but no big deal, 2nd stay here we will be back great value for money great locatiin 5 stops from catalunya square feels really authentic lovely bakery next door roof terrace is fab rooms so comfy
278570,Catalonia Atenas, no tea and coffee making facilities in the room the area is a little quiet but the metro is right opposite and does not take long to get to different places , Me and My partner stayed here for our anniversary and the hotel added a special little touch with a cake and two welcome drink tickets which was a lovely little touch The staff were very helpful check in was fast and easy had a lovely room on level 7 The breakfast was very nice a lot of choice from hot and cold The spa was very relaxing and the staff in the spa made it even better overall i would definitely recommend this hotel 
278571,Catalonia Atenas, Only English speaking tv channel was BBC World which is boring at the best of times An English variety channel would have been much appreciated , Excellent breakfast We particularly like it when you have a chef cooking eggs omelettes etc to your personal order 
278572,Catalonia Atenas, See above, We liked the front counter staff The maids though not so much They didn t leave soaps or toilet paper some days and they were rude when we asked for them and asked they come back later to clean They also slammed doors in the mornings and interrupted our rest 
278573,Catalonia Atenas, We were not so keen on the location More residential Having said that it was easy to get a taxi for 6 euros in to the main drag It was also right opposite a metro , Great hotel Fabulous large comfy bed We were upgraded on check in Lovely terrace Friendly helpful staff 
278574,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Absolutely amazing stay Lovely hotel with an amazing views and wonderful breakfast Wasn t even able to try everything because of tremendous variety of foods Loved the swimming pool on the roof Location is great Nearest underground station is just across the road Train from the airport also stops at this station which is really handy 
278575,Catalonia Atenas, The pool was tiny and not heated It was a struggle asking the staff for things They looked at you as if you had 2 heads over minor things , The croissants were nice The spa was nice though the bath could be warmer 
278576,Catalonia Atenas, Charged my card for all the booking without my permission Payment was going to be made at the hotel rather than in advance according to booking com description I found out that transaction was done without myself being present by text messages from my bank warning me I now see in my bank statement that they have charged me over 400 It was just over 200 for myself Not happy I will call the customer service and my bank tomorrow , Breakfast
278577,Catalonia Atenas, I was disappointed to find there was no tea or coffee making facilities in the room Also when I booked this hotel one of the pluses was the use of a spa However when we arrived we found out there was a charge of 10 euros per person to use it each session , Although the room was small it was spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable I also enjoyed using the gym which was free 
278578,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Whilst the hotel is lovely and conveniently located next to the Clot metro station which is on the main line we booked the hotel as it was advertised as a spa hotel When we checked in we weren t told to book into the spa and just to pop down When we did we found that there is only space for 6 people in the spa as there are only 6 loungers So we didn t get a chance to use it which was disappointing as was one of the main reasons for booking The room was also very small and you couldn t walk around the bed 
278579,Catalonia Atenas, The room smelt quite strong of stale smoke , Very good hotel nice staff and good facilities Everything is within a short metro journey from Clot station right accross the road 
278580,Catalonia Atenas, The Spa is advertised to close at 10pm yet me and my boyfriend went down at half 9 and they wouldn t let us in even though we were willing to pay the fee and just wanted to use the pool etc This is the only fault that I have with this hotel , Staff were extremely helpful had no problem showing us where to go and what to see and even simple things such as telling us which metro tickets to buy
278581,Catalonia Atenas, Aircon is not working we have to open the window to cool us during sleeping time the noise of the traffic make sleeping hard , Large cozy room Friendly staff Easy access to Metro station 
278582,Catalonia Atenas, Air conditioner didn t work and this meant the room was very warm The road was also very noisy so windows couldn t be kept open , Breakfast was lovely and rooms cleaned to a good standard every day Spa was very good I had a massage which was lovely 
278583,Catalonia Atenas, Wasn t as pictured felt kind of drab , I felt like the hotel was okay but didn t seem to be as nice as pictured It seems to need some updating and improvements The staff were all helpful and welcoming The location was great and near public transportation 
278584,Catalonia Atenas, No pool even they are advertising pool but it s so tiny that you get shocked Expensive and not God breakfeast They have 1 restaurant the food is awful and expensive and you have to wait long time too get the food No facilities in the room such tea cookers or irony But nice stuff , Workers
278585,Catalonia Atenas, they had smokers too close too the doors, Great staff Mostly because l spoke the language A beautiful restaurant called El clot just few meters away However to also experience the local people a lovely small Cerveceria Muntanya just a cross the road 
278586,Catalonia Atenas, No tea facilities in rooms, Spacious rooms friendly helpful staff across the road from metro station next door to a 24 hour patisserie very clean Overall great hotel 
278587,Catalonia Atenas, Lack of information about the excellent and affordable restaurant prior to and on arrival, Breakfast items served was more than enough Jacuzzi and gym available Hotel restaurant was affordable and staff also listen and deal with all concerns promptly 
278588,Catalonia Atenas, Responsiveness of staff not so good and not that friendly Our room was like 28 degree and very hot and even though we complained nothing was done Also it was quite noisy from traffic and also you could here others in the hotel I think this is a 3 star hotel , the location it was easy to get on the Metro
278589,Catalonia Atenas, Not very close to city centre however only 5 metro stops away Requested a double bed and wasn t available to us for the first night however received free drink vouchers , Staff were lovely and location was close to public transportation Lovely 24 hour bakery next door which was perfect for breakfast and nighttime munchies Very clean rooms with excellent service 
278590,Catalonia Atenas, Air con didnt work, Location right next to Metro so 15mins from beach rooms were nice and clean Roof top pool and decking was nice and so was the indoor pool and spa 
278591,Catalonia Atenas, No quilts on the bed Just a bed sheet so not very warm if you re always cold like me there were blankets but was just a bit strange there was no quilts , The location and cleanliness were excellent Staff were excellent and very helpful 
278592,Catalonia Atenas, The Access To The Roof Top Was Closed Hence Could Not See The Pool Area Hotel Had Some Floors Under Construction , The Staff Were Amazing Especially SANTIAGO He was a great help The Other Staff At The Property Helped Me Alot Also To book meals as i didnt understand spanish It is a very nice place and good value The rooms were very spacious and the facilities are good The house keeping were very prompt and did thier jobs well too will recommend to anyone going 
278593,Catalonia Atenas, We considered the cost of the breakfast expensive so we had breakfast out every morning , The staff at reception were very welcoming and helpful The bedroom and ensuite areas were cleaned to a very high standard every day 
278594,Catalonia Atenas, Room smelt of smoke despite asking for no smoking room Room quite small staff in breakfast room rude, Spa and spa staff lovely Choice of breakfast good Close to metro
278595,Catalonia Atenas, The weather could have been better but that is something we have no control over It did not affect our holiday Still enjoyed Barcelona , very good value for money Metro station close by plus local shops bars and restaurants 
278596,Catalonia Atenas, no complaints, Friendliness and helpfulness of staff Modern furnishings and style both tasteful and functional Good maintenance and cleanliness 24 7 gym Good location in close proximity to train Clot station from to airport 
278597,Catalonia Atenas, The walking distance to the beach was over an hour Didn t like the cleaners coming in every morning even tho we put the sign up saying don t come in, Loved the spa in the hotel loved our balcony loved the comfy beds showers were lovely the complementary bits and bobs were so nice the room was massive there was a tea making area was a great hotel
278598,Catalonia Atenas, The hotel is pretty far out from central Barcelona and was a bit of a trek to get to no real facilities surrounding it either Not a great location , The staff were helpful friendly
278599,Catalonia Atenas, No heating system in bathroom felt very cold Shower not working had to use bathtub Meals expensive , Its located next to Metro subway staff helpful and friendly can speak English safe and private area with lots of restaurants cafes supermarkets 
278600,Catalonia Atenas, We found nothing we didn t like during our stay, The snack bar food was excellent I had a steak and it was cooked perfectly We used the steam room and jacuzzi which were also extremely good 
278601,Catalonia Atenas, Cant comment as we did not stay long enough, even though we only stayed one night and did not use any facilities the bedroom was big enough for three of us and was very reasonably priced and the check in staff were very friendly and spoke english which was very useful
278602,Catalonia Atenas, There was a little building work going on in the hotel but to be honest it didn t affect us as we were out all day The lifts were a little slow , Bed was really comfy and breakfast was great staff were great and the room and balcony were lovely
278603,Catalonia Atenas, The room is soulless with no pictures or seating area No coffee or tea facilities in the room The location of the hotel isn t great for bars restaurants so at night you are a bit stuck Toiletries are very basic one bottle does all bath gell body wash and hair The roof pool is more for a dip rather then a swim because of it s size Our room wasn t serviced one day and reception did not seemed that bothered The hotel is currently receiving a much needed makeover and you can hear the work taken place Also major metro and train station is beneath the hotel and you will hear and feel the trains from early till late , The hotel is easy to reach from airport If you like hard mattresses which I do then the beds are comfortable You can t hear the traffic thank to the triple glazed windows The sauna area is small but if you are lucky and get to use it at quite time then it is nice The view on the roof top is nice 
278604,Catalonia Atenas, The bed was 2 beds pushed together and I would have preferred a quilt not just a sheet water changed temperature and air on didn t work but heating did , Very nice quiet m modern room staff were very nice and helpful lots of shops restrung and pahrmcys close by and very close to the train station 
278605,Catalonia Atenas, The room was incredibly small and the hotel was very very noisy in the evening and at night And then building work started at the hotel in the morning I m not sure I would stay here again , Staff very good and hotel easy to find d
278606,Catalonia Atenas, The Jacuzzi in the spa was a little bit cold and the walls between the rooms are a little bit thin But for the price I think this is okay, The beds were comfy the staff were really nice and helpful The spa was nice to visit too Its close to the metro
278607,Catalonia Atenas, We booked 3 rooms for a family of 5 persons 2 rooms were good average but the aircon in one room didnt work and was too loud we were offered a gas heating unit to be put in our room which we declined We asked for a new room Unfortunately the aircon in the next room was too loud as well The next room stank of tabacco and was very small Finally they found a room where the aircon was still loud but nut unbearable Unfortunately that room was in a different w ing to the rooms of the rest of the family and in a different floor Very disappointing ,No Positive
278608,Catalonia Atenas, Floor was cold in December No cups or bottle openers in the room Pool in the spa zone is small , Staff is very friendly food is fresh and various It was a great pleasure to sit at the bar in evenings enjoying good wine and delicious shellfish Free apples at the reception and spa zone 
278609,Catalonia Atenas, We liked everything , I was very impressed with everything especially a young lady called carmen who Assisted us with everything she was like magic when we approach carmen it s was as if she read our mind we would definitely come back thanks
278610,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, The size of the room was really good and I enjoyed that there were double doors opening out to a seating area which added more space The sushi was great It was easy to commute as the metro station is across the street Taxi from the marina around 3 am was around 10 euro La Sagrada Familia is close by The view from roof by the pool is excellent of the city There s a computer with printer free for guests to use in the lobby which came in handy 
278611,Catalonia Atenas, hotel was too laud in the morning and over the night bars were shut at 11pm there was no mini bar and you had to pay extra for the pool and prices were rip of will never use it again and i wouldn t recommend it to anyone avoid it , close to the metro station
278612,Catalonia Atenas, The maid came to knock at our door at 12 15 pm to tell us to get out No robes provided for spa unless you have a PREMIUM Room even though they charge 10 eu extras per person , Nothing
278613,Catalonia Atenas, the room and the bathroom are small even 1 person Near metrostation that s fine but not very located in the center and the area is not so interesting not much restaurants near, nice staff breakfast for 14 is correct
278614,Catalonia Atenas, I had to pay for the garage and nobody informed me before checking out The SPA was always busy I had to skip one day and plan the exact time for the next day in order to reserve it for half an hour I asked for an electric adapter of let s say 5 euro and was charged 20 euro un till the day I would give it back I couldn t order a dinner because the receptionist was busy This is not the service I d expect for 518 euro per three nights,No Positive
278615,Catalonia Atenas, The walls are thin and you can hear your neighbours I carry the earplugs with me so I recommend the same to other quests , It is clean bathrooms are very comfortable it is very well located very close to the matro station and bus stop shops restaurants
278616,Catalonia Atenas, Booking com site said you could park in hotel car park Not so Parking only available if there are spaces Can t be booked in advance Parking available nearby but location not explained clearly enough by staff Took one hour to find it , Everything apart from parking 
278617,Catalonia Atenas, Customer service, No tea coffee facilities Dirty beds Dirty bathrooms Very rude staff Very bad customer service Not happy at all Only bonus was location to metro
278618,Catalonia Atenas, Elevator was a bit noisy but luckily it was possible to change room after the first night , Extremely helpful and friendly staff Everyone really Some of them seem to be mind readers Highly appreciated Close to centre metro stop in front of the hotel Looking forward to my next stay 
278619,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, The buffet breakfast was gorgeous And the staff were very friendly my partner is fluent Spanish but I m not and they recognised and remembered this detail for our long weekend and also remembered how we preferred to pay for things The atmosphere in the bar was chilled and the wine went down too easily The view from the roof by the pool is very pretty and it s opposite the metro and also very near the station that goes straight to the airport Will definitely recommend and stay again if we visit Barcelona again
278620,Catalonia Atenas, The cost of drinks at the bar I little excessive 7 for a small amaretto ice could get a good bottle of wine for 9 near by bar, Good clean hotel good size rooms very happy
278621,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Perfect and beautiful location 30seconds to the sea for a swim overlooking the piazza from the balcony and watching the locals play out their lives in the small shops restaurant bars and church is something to behold in this surprisingly authentic village with short and interesting pathways and warren like tunnels to Almalfi Laura is a wonderful host we loved spending some of our stay with her thanks Laura x
278622,Catalonia Atenas, I don t know how this hotel got such a big score We were expecting more for the price Really a 3 not a 4 hotel As you enter the odd smelling room you notice that although it s not very small the lack of ergonomics given by the old 70s furniture quickly transforms the slightest movement through the room into a nightmare The interior is dominated by white brownish marble that stretches from the bathroom throughout the room The result is really old looking and the bathtub with rust stains and the complete absence of ventilation in the bathroom confirms your bad choice impression Going to bed you start feeling the cheap overused mattress and try to work with enormous pillows just praying that you don t get back pains You will And if you manage to go to sleep you have a wide array of noises that will most certainly wake you up at some point traffic just by a big Blvd and the old 70s windows that augment sound more that block it the room ventilation system if you dare turn it on the room maids or people in other rooms of course the walls are pretty much transparent to noise etc Breakfast costs 13 euros pp which is just obscene as you can eat a full gourmet breakfast at the nearby Diego s restaurant for 7 5 euros I highly recommend it , Excellent location for visiting Barcelona and you have a Renfe train station next to the hotel for airport travel Kind staff Pretty good spa though it cost an extra 10 euro pp and that detail is kept out of the hotel description 
278623,Catalonia Atenas, The room was extremely small you could not even proper pass by the bed Absolutely not like in the pictures and promised Furthermore there was loads of work going on bar closed elevator under construction Not worth the money ,No Positive
278624,Catalonia Atenas, No door to the bathroom not nice for a fresh couple Booked a double bed and only got two single beds You really have to pay for the inside pool , The bed was good to sleep The location is not super central but in a nice area with lots of shops and good public transport connection
278625,Catalonia Atenas, Pool was dirty staff were not as helpful as they could have been food was disgraceful found a string baked into my pizza room service is useless as you would have to go and collect your items yourself from the lobby, Location was ideal as I had a car and was able to drive into town Room was spacious 
278626,Catalonia Atenas, Maybe I can complain about 2 things that I didn t like First of all about the wall sockets not many there were just 2 on the desk and none free near the bed The second one concern the breakfast for very early check out I made I worked in a 4 stars hotel and when our guests made check out before the breakfast service begun we prepared a bag with something to eat and drink I know that in the hotel there are vending machines but I paid for breakfast included But these are just two complains that didn t influence in my positive stay in this hotel and also I sure choose this hotel for my next stay in Barcelona Maybe there will be just some suggestions to feel better at home away from home , I really loved the whole stay in this hotel Reception desk staff was affable and helpful for each request I made also for my unexpected early check out 3 days before of the reservations I made The room was clean and followed my expections except for the wall sockets t hat there were not many No compliain also for the very rich breakfast No complain about the position really central and 4 metro stops from Placa Catalunia and reachable from the most important turistic destinations in the city 
278627,Catalonia Atenas, Having planned 4 days and stayed 15 days some staff at desk don t understand customer services even though they say they have been there for over 10 years Best service and manners were from Ms Carmen they should all learn something from her ,No Positive
278628,Catalonia Atenas, The spa changing rooms very small only 1 shower would be very difficult with potentially 10 people in there We would have loved to use the rooftop pool but it was too cold for us to use I guess keeping it heated would put all our room costs up Solar power would eventually pay for itself , The friendly helpful staff at reception particularly Carmen whom we saw a lot when we checked in out and needed assistance with getting to places Nothing was too much trouble and always with a smile We loved our premier room with balcony two double French doors out to a huge balcony overlooking the city and ample space in the room with massive comfy bed 2 singles put together very well and a table 2 chairs We were right opposite a lift but that never bothered us once over the 3 nights Never heard anyone in any other rooms Restaurant staff always friendly at breakfast and huge choice of food The young girl in the spa always friendly and helpful and the Turkish bath lovely the fountain was great for massaging achy muscles from so much walking We couldn t fault the customer service here which always makes a stay more pleasant We had a problem with a safe and an maintenance man was there within 10 minutes as promised The metro station was a very short walk across the road and the main train line only a few minutes further 15 minutes walk up the road to Sagrada Familia Had a thoroughly enjoyable stay 
278629,Catalonia Atenas, Our 20 minute spa treatment was 25 minutes late Reception staff more concerned we had paid for it than to apologise for its lateness Lateness due to accommodating another guest who arrived late for his appointment You will need to use Metro to access all tourist attractions as it is too far to walk On the plus side you can buy one ticket 9 95 for 10 trips and can use between you Lovely hotel but we prefer to be nearer the centre Estimated walking times incorrect Hotel restaurant not open for evening meals in the winter , Clean in all areas staff polite courteous and in the main respectful Comfortable room very warm due to air con not being switched on in winter Buffet breakfast really good Comfortable hotel Roof top deck stunning views Nearby El Clot Restaurant serves genuine Spanish Tapas at extremely good prices lovely staff 
278630,Catalonia Atenas, It s not we didn t like it and it would have been easily fixed but was fine we had 2 single beds but asked for a double on the form when booking but that s fine as mentioned it s easily fixed Little noisy on the 1st floor as was near the breakfast room , Staff were lovely and all spoke great English and extremely helpful Had a lovely massage also and ordered sushi to the room was lovely 
278631,Catalonia Atenas, Nothing , This is a great value comfortable hotel in a location near to metro and station On arrival we were greeted by a young man at reception who could not of been more helpful He made us feel very welcome and gave us lots of information about seeing Barcelona which helped us so much Well done on a great job Janice Bristow
278632,Catalonia Atenas, Following up on guest requests would be great, After checking in me and my boyfriend found out that we were in double room with 2 single bed even after requesting a double bed Asked to be moved to another room and was told this is not possible without a reason being explained Asked for extension for my charger that wasn t provided either 
278633,Catalonia Atenas, Cleaning staff left our ground floor window open after cleaning one afternoon This was a security concern Ground floor room had a bit of noise with water flowing in adjoining rooms pipes , Location was great Room service very accommodating Flexibility to meet our needs Spa facilities very relaxing
278634,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, The location was just a walking distance to Sagrada Familia Cathedral The porter Jake that attended the luggage holding room was great The breakfast was fantastic 
278635,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, We very much appreciated being upgraded as a result of a delayed check in The room we were given was excellent with amazing views Great location for visiting La Sagrada Familia and good local bus service to other central locations 
278636,Catalonia Atenas, Too noisy during the night and especially early morning Constant banging of doors was very disturbing , The staff were very helpful Spa was nice but a bit limited in its variety E g no sauna Handy for the underground but we found it less stressful and almost as cheap to use taxis 
278637,Catalonia Atenas, Food and drink very expensive location of hotel was on a very busy avenue hotel was about 5 Metro stops from the centre of the city in a run down area,No Positive
278638,Catalonia Atenas, Our room was opposite the breakfast room which made a leisurely get up impossible due to the noise and volume of people going into breakfast We would definitely stay here again although request a room away from the first floor breakfast area , We loved the location of this hotel 15 min walk from Sagrada Familia and very close to a metro station so ideal location Perfect size room for 2 adults and two teenagers beautiful bathroom and really well decorated Excellent views from the roof top pool which was a hit with our teenagers Spa was excellent and the gym was well kitted out We would definitely stay here again 
278639,Catalonia Atenas, The parking was 20 euros per day , The staff were very friendly and helpful We were upgraded to a premium room which was a nice surprise and this also included free use of the spa which normally costs 10 euros The location was very good just across the road from the metro station 
278640,Catalonia Atenas, We didn t receive enough toiletries IE the shower gel wasn t refreshed on day 3 I would have liked more than one pillow , The breakfast was very nice with a lot of choice The beds were very comfy 
278641,Catalonia Atenas, The hotel is aged The standard rooms are very small and you can see wood chipping off the doors If they could do this minor maintenance that would be fantastic , The location was perfect It is right next to the Metro so you can virtually go anywhere Plus lots of eateries around the block The staff is very friendly and helpful and the facilities are adequate
278642,Catalonia Atenas, The neighbouring rooms were a bit noisy Quite thin walls however equally not the hotels fault who stays at the hotel , Friendly staff and a fantastic location for explore the city 
278643,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Excellent WiFi if your room is located close to a router the little white box on the ceiling with the green lights It took a few minutes to convince them but the front desk staff did finally agree to change my room to one near a router 
278644,Catalonia Atenas, Breakfast in the hotel costs like a dinner on La Rambla No electric sockets next to the bed Quite loud on the corridor walls doors don t really isolate it Old furniture, Amazing location Just outside the hotel there is a metro station so You can go to any place in the city within 30 minutes Nice bathroom Even have amazing 24 7 bakery just next door If You don t want to pay ridiculously high price for breakfast amazing solution Didn t try breakfast in the hotel costs more then a dinner in the center but with quality of the bakery I bet it would be worse anyway 
278645,Catalonia Atenas, The hotel looks a lot worse than what you see in pictures Very basic and outdated Small crowded room with nothing beyond a bed TV and towels Remote location about an hour walk from the center In short not recommended, Nothing
278646,Catalonia Atenas, Tea and coffee making facilities would have made it more appealing , We were delighted with the Hotel first class double glazing gave us peace and quiet it would have been better if we had been nearer the port but as we were only there for 3 nights that was fine The breakfast choice was very good and we would stay there again
278647,Catalonia Atenas, Strange choice of covering for the pillow Shiny and not very comfortable Could do with a normal pillow case, Good location combined with good facilities 
278648,Catalonia Atenas, Breakfast was very very bad Never ever had such a bad Breakfast RoomS furniture was really bad Not clean and not this high Price worth it , Nothing
278649,Catalonia Atenas, The room is very small and the hotel is quite dark It s expensive for the space and facilities that you get , The hotel has a great location right next to the Clot metro station and close to the Sagrada Fam lia It s a nice area to walk around and there are many local restaurants and bars The staff are very friendly and helpful The breakfast is excellent 
278650,Catalonia Atenas, It was fairly noisy and the pool was actually a lot smaller than the photos would have you believe , The room was comfortable although a little beige The staff were lovely even arranging a surprise champagne treat for my husbands birthday 
278651,Catalonia Atenas, We wanted to have an evening meal in the restaurant which they didn t have This was no major problem but the only thing I could fault , We had a wonderful stay room was lovely and clean Staff very friendly and helpful The spa was wonderful and the treatments were reasonably priced Would defintley stay again Location good as close to the underground 
278652,Catalonia Atenas, Price cheap laminate floors Breakfast food always cold even when first in Room too hot air conditioning worked but weak , Location close to Metro bar prices 
278653,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, My favourite hotel in Barcelona Always friendly staff massive rooms everything clean metro train close by plus a 24 hour snack bar outside Views from roof stunning 
278654,Catalonia Atenas, Local employees impolite and no smiling when attend the client Dirty room and positioned under pipes discharges continue bad smell rotten Very superficial daily cleaning and bedsheets changes each 4 days no wood blanket available we slept the first 2 days in cold and dressed Restaurant Grilled vegetables almost swimming into cold oil no healthy vegetables all cooked with too much oil The chef felt offended when I suggested it was too much oil and answer this is the way that people likes This was the Worst Booking trough BOOKING COM , The foreign employees polite and kind Searching for help the client 
278655,Catalonia Atenas, Breakfast was too pricey so we didn t bother with that and found local places instead You have to pay 10 to use the gym indoor pool and steam room per day per person The outdoor pool is free and was ok but very salty water which isn t right for a isolated pool Possibly water in pool not maintained correctly , Nice hotel Staff were polite and helpful Had everything we needed and enjoyed the stay there Metro station outside hotel which is very easy and cheap to use to get around 
278656,Catalonia Atenas, No English channels on the TV which is annoying because most of Barcelona restaurants don t open until 1pm and then they close at 4pm and don t re open until 8pm so you have no choice but to be in the room for long periods of times About an hr walk from centre city so not in the best location Pillows were very uncomfortable Bath showers really dislike them and the shower curtain made the floor get drenched Ordered room service and food was cold as they wouldn t deliver until the rain stopped but seems like the pizza was cooked and left for a while , Well presented hotel Clean Rooftop deck 
278657,Catalonia Atenas, I saw nothing wrong with this hotel , Perfect location Stylish design and a cozy bar and SPA with a nice atmosphere friendly staff and great service The breakfast was good and fresh Despite its location it is quiet and peaceful inside the hotel 
278658,Catalonia Atenas, The room was very small It was difficult to move around the bed with our cases on the floor , Very friendly and helpful staff The bathroom was spacious and modern 
278659,Catalonia Atenas, Nothing , Located close to a choice of metro stations 15 minutes from the centre of Barcelona Small but comfortable room Fab rooftop deck and pool area Great snack bar 
278660,Catalonia Atenas, The pool is just sad Sunbeds don t open flat Room is small No towel provided at the pool, Close to the metro Renfe Good breakfast Bathroom is big Snack bar is alright
278661,Catalonia Atenas, Further from town center than I would have liked but very close to metro swimming pool small and cold, Staff extremely helpful and friendly Beautiful city view from top deck where swimming pool located 
278662,Catalonia Atenas, The room was quite small and we were able to hear the conversations of those in the rooms adjoining ours annoying early in the morning But the pluses helped to counteract these issues , The staff were very friendly the rooms very clean and the proximity to the metro and railway station was great Having the use of the roof top pool and terrace was also great after a day of sightseeing 
278663,Catalonia Atenas, We had free access to the spa but had to wait a while to get into it because the only staff there were doing massages , We had a premier room so i liked having a balcony Also enjoyed the spa the location of the hotel was good because it was not in the city centre but not far by metro There was resturants close by the hotel to walk to and a bakery next door 
278664,Catalonia Atenas, The pillows need to be changed I need soft pillows and more lighting would be helpful That s what I would suggest to improve the hotel Also I didn t like how I could not stay a little longer as my flight was later in the evening and I wanted a late checkout without having to pay extra Anyways that s what I can say about the things I didn t like Also the tv is positioned in a very strange way , To begin with I will say that the hotel is average but when I use the term average its because there were a couple of things that need to be considered if someone would like to stay It doesn t mean that its bad The staff were helpful and nice The room I got was bigger than the one my father stayed in so that was a concern Its good for me but not good for my father Also my father received a tea set and I didn t I pay attention to detail a lot The people I didn t use but it was really small nothing too exciting The elevators were slow and need some updating I liked how there were free apples that s a very healthy initiatives There is one bakery down the hotel There are a few random restaurants by the hotel Nothing can be found within walking distance You could reach avenue diagonal I would say it would be a 20min walk not too bad But to the hotel nothing is really close by The bed was comfortable It would have been better if I got a queen size instead of a double bed If its a last resort option and if the prices suit you its an okay hotel Nothing to impressive Its clean hotel the noise level is not bad Very quiet and very well kept 
278665,Catalonia Atenas, our room was on the 2nd floor with a balcony only thing wrong was the fact a big tree blocked the windows, generally a good hotel staff very helpful close to the metro 
278666,Catalonia Atenas, The location wasn t fantastic and the hotel is a little further out than stated in the advertisement It took us about 40 50mins to get to La Ramblas However we knew it was further away than we would have liked having originally booked our holiday with low cost holidays and a hotel that was right next to the beach They went bust then of course so in fairness we were lucky to get something for the same price even if it was a little way out My advice would be to figure out the metro we did this and by the end of day 2 we had it sussed and this made our journey to and from the hotel so much easier Forget taxis there are so many traffic lights in barcelona that it takes ages A ten trip ticket for the metro is only 10e and worth every penny Also figuring out the metro makes it easier when visiting some sites that are a little further out like Nou Camp and Sagrada Familia , The hotel was comfortable and the staff were very friendly The food in the restaurant was also lovely as was the sangria The service was great and the rooms were very clean We even received a complimentary drink on arrival because I d stated in our booking that we were a newly engaged couple We also got a double bed and a high floor room which was what I requested Our room had a fridge which was great and the bakery next door was open 24 hours so we were able to buy water and breakfast things to have in the room There weren t any tea or coffee making facilities unfortunately and as coffee lovers we would have appreciated that little extra 
278667,Catalonia Atenas, Disappointed in the size of the swimming pool From the information on the web site it appeared to be much larger , The food at the snack bar was good value for money It was nice to be able to leave the cases safely on the day of departure and return for them later Very good choice of food at breakfast and plenty of it 
278668,Catalonia Atenas, no tea and coffee facilities in the room, The room was big and comfortable nice view Room cleaning was excellent The breakfast was fabulous great choice The staff were all extremely attentive and helpful
278669,Catalonia Atenas, We booked a double bed but were given 2 singles but they gave us free breakfast as compensation so it wasnt to bad, The staff where very helpfulland friendly
278670,Catalonia Atenas, stayed in a newly refurbished family room which was excellent apart from the air con not cooling the room sufficiently, good variety of food at breakfast outdoor swimming pool small but good with great views of the city staff friendly professional and helpful and child friendly room large and well equipped across the road from metro station
278671,Catalonia Atenas, Was slightly disappointed with the size of the swimming pool on roof the pictures we slightly misleading, Great location with easy access to anywhere and everywhere Always clean staff extremely helpful The views and sun set on the top of building were amazing 
278672,Catalonia Atenas, I would have liked to have seen coffee making facilities in the room and also more sockets for phone chargers etc but this seems to be a modern and universal problem , The staff were excellent helpful courteous and well trained The location next to the metro was convenient with plenty of local catering etc The garage parking was a necessity for us but if you miss the turn into the garage you are in difficulties owing to the traffic density 
278673,Catalonia Atenas, Would have liked a room with a double bed and not two singles but it did say when i booked it may or may not be a double or two singles Walls are thin so you can hear the guests in the room next to you, Very close to the metro station and so quick to get to the centre Warm welcome by the receptionists at all times and I got a quick brief with map on how to get to everything too In the evening the balcony at the top with the swimming pool is a must Although the pool was small it was quiet up there and I watched the sunset from my lounger Could see an incredible 360 view of the city from there 
278674,Catalonia Atenas, I didn t like that we weren t provided with a blanket and when i tried the air conditioner for some warn air it didn t work , Most of it i liked the location The hotel is very close to Sagrada Familia Bur also the hotel looks nice tidy and the staff is friendly 
278675,Catalonia Atenas, AC was not working and we re forced to open the windows and sleep on the first day, It was a cheating Whatever shown as 3 person family room was not provided even with insistence Instead a cramped room of two was made as three Never we will book in Catolina group and through Booking com hence forth
278676,Catalonia Atenas, Later and earlier opening hours of the pool and wellness area would be nice Earlier breakfast possibilities as well As business traveler you need earlier breakfast than 7 00 and relaxing possibilities after 22 00 would be a good idea But for leisure I m sure it s pretty good here , The lady at the reception was very friendly and helpful Nice breakfast friendly personnel and clean rooms The food in the bar is of good quality 
278677,Catalonia Atenas, Noisy lift sometimes made it hard to sleep The air conditioning was not strong enough Even on the coldest setting I was too hot using a hairdryer , Comfy bed Friendly staff Very clean 
278678,Catalonia Atenas, The pool was tiny to a disappointing degree splashing about is all that can be done no proper swimming , There was a good selection at the buffet breakfast rooms were clean and everything else was fine Nice view of Barcelona and Sagrada Familia from roof top where swimming pool is Excellent location near metro stations Free apples were good quality 
278679,Catalonia Atenas, The photos of the roof top pool have been masterfully taken as it s actually only big enough to fit about 3 people in it Breakfast was fair but a pity it cost me 30 euros every morning The area the hotel sits in is a bit seedy but can t be helped but I wouldn t advise walking the back streets alone in the area , Beds were comfy
278680,Catalonia Atenas, Nothing , I and my family felt the property was everything we hoped for and the staff were brilliant Location was brilliant especially for ease of the metro Thankyou very much 
278681,Catalonia Atenas, The roof top pool is on the tiny side but the view makes up for it, The breakfast selection was fantastic Location is great can get to the city center and beach in less than 20 minutes by metro Staff was great and accommodating
278682,Catalonia Atenas, The rooftop swimming pool was slightly smaller than expected Getting there was a bit confusing too The elevators were wrecking our heads as they take forever to deliver guests up and down the floors The room keycard was not working for a few times due to battery issues of the electric door handle , Loved the buffet breakfast in the morning Plenty of choices The rooms were very tidied and modern looking The reception and the snack bar on ground floor appeared fancied and welcoming The location although 20 minutes from city centre is excellent as a metro station is right outside the hotel and the train station being only 5 minutes away 
278683,Catalonia Atenas, Rooftop pool is very tiny OK for a plunge but not swimming , Three good comfy beds in a triple room Great air con friendly helpful staff very close to Clot station for metro and train to airport 
278684,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, this hotel had a good location close to the metro and train links There was a good little bakery next to the hotel which we visited for coffee and croissants each morning Check in was quick and Santiago was great giving us some tips on where to go with the kids We had a family room which was very spacious and had proper beds for the kids The decent sized fridge was an added bonus The pool was small but clean and big enough for the kids to have a quick swim each morning We didn t use the restaurant or spa so can t comment on those Overall we were impressed with this hotel and had no concerns or complaints 
278685,Catalonia Atenas, The sockets weren t working we had to use the bathroom ones The pool wasn t what we saw online , The service was amazing from the cleaners to the reception The staff were amazing The fact we were warned about pick pockets immediately we got there shows how much they care for their customers The massage at the spa was amazing aswell as the gym and the sauna This hotel is amazing Keep it up
278686,Catalonia Atenas, The check in took around 45 minutes Then they gave us a room that had a strong smell of cigar They took another 45 minutes to finally give us another room The pool area is not very clean and well entertained The pool itself is very small taking into account the amount of rooms and people in the hotel Location Is not that close to Sagrada Family nor Barcelona city center , We liked the waiters in the snack bar They were very nice and quick and another staff member who helped us for the room change We also liked the small kids play area even though simple our kids loved it 
278687,Catalonia Atenas, The swimming pool on the roof should not be called a swimming pool It s more like a BIG bath tub that cannot accommodate 2 families , The hotel s location is great and it s very close to a metro 
278688,Catalonia Atenas, Last year the American guy on the front desk was amazing in so many ways this year his replacement was terrible barely spoke English but I should say I had a great holiday a bit more maintenance around the hotel wouldn t go amiss , I liked the location the rooms are ok the view on the roof is great near to the underground metro I only had the breakfast once but like last year it was first rate if only a bit expensive 
278689,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, What a fabulous trip From the minute we walked in the desk staff could not have been more helpful and welcoming The car park was fully booked when we arrived but we were provided clear simply direction to a near by alternative and upon our return to the Catalonia Atenas were given vouchers for a free drink each to make up for this 5 minute inconvenience It was entirely unexpected and immediately made us feel like valued guests The room was excellent too immaculate and comfortable The free Wi Fi was easy to access and worked perfectly for both of us the whole time though our usage was not extensive Not to be out done by reception the Bar staff were friendly and could not do enough to help extremely attentive but not intrusive As a side note the tapas served in the bar was very tasty indeed check out the asparagus The rooftop pool is small but nice we enjoyed our brief splish The real bonus here though is that the seating lounging area around it gives fantastic views over this part of the city With Sagrada Familia so close this is a great spot for photo ops Overall we were bowled over by our stay in the Catalonia Atenas it ticked very single box Good food great atmosphere a metro station directly adjacent and only 5 stops to La Rambla courteous and helpful staff and very comfortable clean rooms Not only would i recommend to others it will be my first port of call next time I m in Barcelona 
278690,Catalonia Atenas, Room very very small no wardrobe just a small cupboard this is not acceptable in a four star hotel tiny bathroom too , The bed was really comfortable and big
278691,Catalonia Atenas, Not much choice of local restaurants to eat at night Restricted to what children could use e g inside pool children hours were incompatible with sight seeing etc Roof terrace quite small and could get crowded Felt quite costly for a basic family room , The staff were all friendly and very accommodating Breakfast was superb Location had good access to city centre and coast 
278692,Catalonia Atenas, The photos of the rooftop pool are very flattering it s a paddling pool , Close proximity to the metro and R2 direct to and from airport Views from the roof Just buy T10 tickets they get you almost everywhere 
278693,Catalonia Atenas, Rooftop pool very small unable to use as too busy Not a lot to do in the surrounding area, Free upgrade to top room with large balcony Good location opposite metro Nice room kept clean Good value for room
278694,Catalonia Atenas, I have ordered from the reception the taxi for 8 pm and they ordered it for 8 am the next day Their english is not good enough e, Nice hotel Nearby metro station
278695,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Our stay at Catalonia was perfect The staff are really efficient and kind The location is great near at El Clot metro station and there is a bakery just beside that s open until 3am 
278696,Catalonia Atenas, Terrace had no sun all day no room service small room not well insulated couldnt sleep from the noise safe didnt work only one plug socket in the room have stayed at other catalonia chain of hotels and this is the worst of them ended up checking out early , Nice staff
278697,Catalonia Atenas, 608 euro all of the money from my wallet even coins went missing from by room presumably by someone with access to the rooms as I was staying by myself When I confronted staff about it they said they would investigate and never got back to me I recommend not staying here if you have anything of value From what I read after in previous reviews I m not the first person this had happened to , Nothing
278698,Catalonia Atenas, Not having enough time to use the spa , The hotel always smelt lovely when ever you walked into reception The bar staff were lovely and really helpful The hotel was a all round lovely place to stay 
278699,Catalonia Atenas, The front desk staff acted as though they didn t care if we were there or not The A C in the room was weak , The room was nice modern and clean The rooftop pool was nice but small with great views 
278700,Catalonia Atenas, Booking coms involvement as they didn t send me a confirmation email and then changed my rooms to standard but still charged me for the extras I originally booked, Hotel was nice staff was helpful
278701,Catalonia Atenas, The hotel is in urgent need of renovation everything seems quite dated The breakfast is very limited not great choice Everywhere in the hotel there is a strange smell of detergents perhaps to mask worse smells Not too great though , The location is good very near the metro only 2 stops from the Sagrada familia The pool on the roof is very small but still a nice occasion to cool off after a hot day in the city 
278702,Catalonia Atenas, Nothing in the local area to visit but hotel was very close to metro and train stations so able to get to tourists spots easily from there, Breakfast buffet included a gluten free section All staff were very helpful Location was very handy for metro and train station 
278703,Catalonia Atenas, We arrived late in the evening and they told us the hotel was overbooked After 1 hour they eventually found a room for us very annoying and unfriendly,No Positive
278704,Catalonia Atenas, Would have liked a kettle and coffee making facility in room , Very nice rooftop deck and pool area for relaxing with citywide views Metro to city and train station with direct link to airport just across the road Large comfortable reception area with very friendly and welcoming staff 
278705,Catalonia Atenas, No sound proofing so you could clearly hear people walking around slamming doors and taking in the room above and next to our room This was especially bad late at night, Location and friendly staff
278706,Catalonia Atenas, I ordered non smoking room and the first thing i felt when i entered our room it was the strong smell of smoke Television was not working and the fridge as well I had to wait 2 days to change my room Even with a note Do not disturb staff is still unlocking the door and enetering the room Staff doesnt speak eanglish at all Pool was extreamly small no space at all for the peaple that wants to use it , breakfast was good 
278707,Catalonia Atenas, There was a constant smell of dampness and sewage seeping out if the airconditioning units which made staying in the room very unpleasant , The staff was very attentive and helpful 
278708,Catalonia Atenas, One of the reception staff a male was always very short and impatient i called reception and he put the phone down on me when i had not finished my conversation and it was about the blocked toilet The bell boy who came up to look was very helpful and friendly even though nothing was sorted as all that was needed was a plunger and cant believe the whole hotel did not have one In the end i used a coat hanger to plunged it and it was done The pool was a joke so small and over crowded the pictures was deceiving very intimidating especially when you bring young children to swim and it is full of adults Checking out was unfriendly too , the room was comfy enough space for a small family room was cleaned and always clean towels
278709,Catalonia Atenas, No tea coffee making facilities in the room but we knew that when we booked I m a typical Brit who likes her Tea Breakfast was slightly overpriced but you did have a fantastic selection , Pool was great with amazing views cocktails on the roof at night were perfect Good wifi location to the metro was excellent not so many bars restaurants nearby but easy to travel into central Barcelona Room was spacious Staff helpful and barman was fab made us cocktails not on the menu Very clean everywhere Will definitely be back to Barcelona and would stay here again 
278710,Catalonia Atenas, Breakfast is not very good not options , Loved the veiw of rooftop Very clean staff are very welcoming and friendly Rooms are lovely I didn t want to come home 
278711,Catalonia Atenas, The AC in our room did not work so it was very hot Our room was on the ground floor facing a busy walk way so we had to keep the curtains closed to avoid people watching us Two major annoyances The rest was good , The room was spacious and clean The bed was comfy I loved the shower really great The view from the pool was beautiful Breakfast was ok 
278712,Catalonia Atenas, I reserved one large bed but when checking in the hotel was unable to provide me with this Additionally aircondition was not working and the room temperature was 30 degrees No compensation explanation apologies etc were offered Was asked to come back to the reception the day after and then a room would be ready However a room was NOT ready and I was forced to leave the hotel After being re located to their partner hotel I was provided with a room where smoking was allowed Unacceptable Unfriendly and incompetent personell who continued discussing and making up excuses along the way When asking for a manager this request was ignored ,No Positive
278713,Catalonia Atenas, Unfortunately our room was right by the elevator which made for lots of noise at all hours especially without any carpet in the hallways , Enjoyed our stay here all of the staff were super Location was close to metro for city access 
278714,Catalonia Atenas, It was handy to the metro station but it was a bit of a grotty area to stay in The pool deck was well designed but the pool was pretty crowded and small What else can you expect for the inner city , Loved the pool deck would have been great if there had been a serviced bar up there The snack bar was handy and tasty the staff were great and friendly 
278715,Catalonia Atenas, The cleanliness throughout the hotel Staff were not happy The terrace with great views not at all The terrace was littered with crisp packets and food scraps Lovely view of roof tops tv ariels as far as your eye can see Not a fantastic view as advertised Poor noise insulation Room service menus in the room however room service is not a service within this hotel , The spa was great With reasonably priced treatments 
278716,Catalonia Atenas, A lot of very noisy building work being done starting very early in the morning Pool is tiny Staff not particularly helpful polite but didn t seem very interested in offering guidance with directions etc, The room was nicely decorated The hotel well kept Spa and staff at the spa really lovely 
278717,Catalonia Atenas, Bathroom could do with a little cosmetic work such as the shower area The fridge doesn t make things very cold you have to leave a key in the slot so the fridge stays on whilst your out Very minor things considering , The location was excellent Right across the road from clot metro line easy to get to the airport and catalunya It took us 15minutes in the taxi to the beach where there are lots of nice restaurants bars and shisha the spa was lovely used the hot tub and staff were very friendly 
278718,Catalonia Atenas, Breakfast menu wasn t changing at least over our short visit and air conditioning in rooms could be more efective Else a great hotel , Rooftop pool and terace was great Wonderfull place to chill after exploring Barcelona all day 
278719,Catalonia Atenas, Some strange smell in the hotel room There is no blackout curtains in the room to keep privacy from the opposite residential building , Breakfast is very good Just few steps to the subway station Staff is helpful 
278720,Catalonia Atenas, A bit outdated small rooms and kind of all furniture The parking was full so we had to park 500 meters away No street parking in front of the hotel, Good windows no noise from the outside 
278721,Catalonia Atenas, Room 513 was a bit shabby in need of some maintenance , Breakfast amazing Staff very friendly and helpful brilliant location for bus metro and train stops 
278722,Catalonia Atenas, Room windows curtains and walls were not completely clean like fingerprints First days room smelt like longtime closed room third floor TV signal was horrible in our room it worked 3 out of 20 channels The view towards entrance side is not awesome , Staff Breakfast great choice and good products Spa very calm and nice not included at the limit of nice locations with a very close metro stop 
278723,Catalonia Atenas, Rude staff breakfast was supposed to be included but it wasn t Really rude and nasty enployee working at desk, Nothing Incredibly rude staff charged me twice for my stay Wouldn t give me my money back I m at the loss of 140 and we only stayed in the hotel for no more than 8 hours 
278724,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Good location right beside a subway station Clot making it easy to get anywhere in the city The room is as good as the standard of a hotel of 4 stars Will choose this hotel again if I visit Barcelona next time 
278725,Catalonia Atenas, Rooms service provided, The shower wasn t working eventhough we told the reception about it more than 5times but nothing happened the manager wasnt there when we asked for and the person in charge was very rude uncomfortable rooms
278726,Catalonia Atenas, The staff at the hotel are not hepful with the exception of Dani He is wonderful The rroms are very small Bed was very hard The worst of all was the cleaning staff coming into our room while she knew we were in the room I was not fully dressed when she barged right in She told me that her shift was endiing soon so we had to get out Very disappointing stay The staff never assisted us with directions a map etc except for Dani The other staff members could not be bothered in assisting Would not stay there again ,No Positive
278727,Catalonia Atenas, I missed somewhere to dry towels and bathing clothes inte the room The bathroom was very damp after shower and that didnt go away for several hours , Great location and great breakfast buffe Extra plus with the roof top pool and terrace Thank you 
278728,Catalonia Atenas, The pool, The pool on the roof is very small and not good for kids who can t swim It s not very clean either Otherwise a good stay large comfortable room and just across the metrostop clot 
278729,Catalonia Atenas, Missing aircondition But even after repair was performed The room was either very loud or very warm Also no way to sit and type anything in room Just no table, Breakfast location
278730,Catalonia Atenas, A C was not working for the 3 nights we stayed there The night staff were apathetic to our situation and the only solace was free breakfast offered by the day manager on hearing our plight However the AC was not fixed even after complaining the first day Also with a lack of parking facilities nearby the rate charged by the hotel for parking was extremely high , Location is central
278731,Catalonia Atenas, Hard to say much here because our experience was so good , This hotel would be the ideal choice for a great stay for anyone visiting Barcelona Location next to Clot metro station and airport train was fantastic Spacious well appointed rooms very friendly and attentive staff who did their utmost to ensure a good stay spa and relaxation facilities were excellent and the roof top pool was wonderful The buffet breakfast was truly the most extraordinary varied and wonderful breakfast I have seen on this trip 
278732,Catalonia Atenas, Our room was next to the ladies toilets on the 1st floor also where the restaurant is located and the cleaners started at 6am waking us all up , Very helpful staff good location reasonable price
278733,Catalonia Atenas, No complaints , Large room with plenty of storage space Large convenient bathroom Helpful staff Nice pastry and tapa shops nearby Metro and ATM close Quick elevator Fair price Enjoyed
278734,Catalonia Atenas, We ordered a Pizza to the room which was forgotten about outside vendors but when we mentioned it we were offered free drinks vouchers Not too much of a problem , Really nice staff all spoke really good English and all were very helpful
278735,Catalonia Atenas, Up until the last night we had a really pleasant stay However upon returning to the hotel from a night out neither of our room keys worked Went we went to get this sorted at reception the night receptionist was rude and extremely unhelpful After several attempts to reset the key it became clear that the electronic lock was broken The receptionist said that there was nothing he could do for us and couldn t leave the desk unattended After asking where we were supposed to sleep we were told that there were no spare rooms available and he didn t know After an hour and a half and several phone calls plus by friend manning the reception desk the receptionist managed to get us in to the room We couldn t risk the lock breaking again so had to sleep with the door propped open While I understand and appreciate that things like this happen I was not impressed with how this was dealt with The receptionist huffed and puffed and cursed us under his breath before hitting a wall when one of his attempts failed When we checked out the next morning we told the morning shift what had happened one lady laughed and a gentleman just shrugged Not once did someone apologise to us , The hotel was in a convenient location that made travelling around the city easy Our room was clean a decent size and comfortable
278736,Catalonia Atenas, The only thing wrong the rooms air conditioner was not working that great We stayed 6 29 7 9 Other than that everything was great Thank you , Overall service was great employees were accommodating and knowledgeable of the area and very helpful Thank you 
278737,Catalonia Atenas, Only negatives are pool could be better and air conditioning needs to be cooler , Staff are very helpful Location is decent near stations and walking distance to sights Bedroom is well designed very spacious and comfortable Spa facilities are lovely 
278738,Catalonia Atenas, Said on website indoor pool this was in spa which you had to pay into Breakfast could have been included in the price , Beautiful clean hotel view from roof breath taking Lovely spa 
278739,Catalonia Atenas, The pool was too small And hotel was slighty off from the main area catalunya las ramblas and port, Nice friendly staff Spacious clean room Amazing City view Walking distance to Sagrada Familia
278740,Catalonia Atenas, I could hear closing of the doors with a bang Was awaken dozen times during the night , Terace at the roof and nice bar by the reception Nice smell when you enter the hotel Great location 
278741,Catalonia Atenas, I think having another restaurant for the evening is what this hotel needs as its not near another restaurants locally , Food was so tastey love how relaxed the hotel made you feel I loved all the toiletries you got in your rooms too 
278742,Catalonia Atenas, It was quite difficult to find when driving The car park is under the hotel and is very tight getting in and out, The room was a good size for a single room Staff were very helpful
278743,Catalonia Atenas, They let you select smoking non smoking but they dont promise that you get what you select We chose non smoking and then they said that there were none available for either day we were there even though we had asked in advance and were told that we would have it using the excuse that our choice was a preference not a promise Everything else was fine otherwise nothing special but not bad ,No Positive
278744,Catalonia Atenas, not the best location of you visit the city on foot, Enormous room very clean and comfortable The biggest bed I ve ever seen Pool on the roof with amazing view
278745,Catalonia Atenas, Staff entered our room whilst we were in the spa and stole all of our cash Hotel staff weren t helpful at all nwe ha dto WALK to the police station to report it and when we got back to the hotel we had to force them to give our money back , Location and facilities
278746,Catalonia Atenas, Bar facilities in the roof would be amazing , Excellent proximity to metro station rooftop pool and sun terrace perfect very helpful staff Comfortable room 
278747,Catalonia Atenas, No flexbility with late check out only 1 extra hour was requested, Bed was very comfortable I loved the balcony the staff at the rooftop pool was very atentious
278748,Catalonia Atenas, Parking under ground it s really tight and only about 12 space for huge hotel It took me a few days to understand the train system since it s in Spanish which I don t speak or read Or else I would have not rented a car plus they charge 20 euros per night which sucked also if you were not bracket at the hotel by 5 6 pm you d have to go and parked at a public parking garage which are a few blocks away The street parking you can forget about it those cars are Plymouth rocks Rent a bike or a scooter right across the street also down the street on same side as hotel to the right of the entrance a few blocks Also Yelp app work well finding everything around the hotel , Cool hotel helpful staff and hotel is Close to train stations the bus is right out th front door the hotel rooms are a bit small but I m a solo traveler so it was fine My room was on the second floor street side I could barely hear the traffic Windows are double pained your given two card keys to get in I suggest you leave one in the power switch which turns on the refrigerator and keeps the AC going if you remove it everything will turn off especially when your trying to keep cold drinks in the fridge and the AC going all night The staff is very friendly and most speak English and everybody that works there are very helpful and nice There s a hotel restaurant which a good place to eat a little pricey depending on what your hungry for open late and opens early there are plenty of places to eat near by if your willing to walk around and explore 
278749,Catalonia Atenas, The location of this hotel is great if you are willing to ride the metro It is very close to a metro stop and the metro in Barcelona is efficient and clean But the hotel is not within walking distance to any of the major sites in Barcelona , The rooms and property were very nice The staff was very freindly
278750,Catalonia Atenas, Unfriendly staff We were put in a very small smoking room why We dont smoke after complaint were put in a slighty larger but still very small non smoking room The swimming pool on the roof is a more like a large tub with dirty water The hotel seems to be very popular by loud noisy sweet sixteen and hen party girls from Britain The badly isolated room doors that close with a loud bang dont help much , Location near Metro and train station to from airport Very nice still traditional Barcelonese neighbourhood with lots of tapas bodegas and bakeries where locals hang out Hotels roof terras is superb 
278751,Catalonia Atenas, I imagined the pool to be bigger not a huge issue , Great stay for Primavera Sound festival Safe and extremely clean Staff were helpful and friendly and the food was excellent 
278752,Catalonia Atenas, No complaints , Excellent breakfast buffet helpful staff beautiful view from the rooftop Room was adequate for our needs since we only slept and showered there and it was clean 
278753,Catalonia Atenas, The rooms are more consistent to a 3 star hotel than to a four stars one , I loved the reception the spa and the terrasse The spa is small but nice clean and has all you need to relax The terrasse has an excellent view with all you need to sunbath have a drink and relax 
278754,Catalonia Atenas, Cleaners forgot to leave new towels spa needs booking and costs extra key cards kept stopping working, Comfortable big rooms good location close to metro and train station going straight to the airport excellent breakfast
278755,Catalonia Atenas, The twin room we got was very small although still comfortable Noise from the busy road outside so ask for a room at the back of the building Some noise also from the neighbouring rooms No wonder with rooms that small , Great location right opposite the metro station and only three stops away from Pla a Catalunya and La Rambla Very nice staff Great breakfast Loved the views of the city from the terrace 
278756,Catalonia Atenas, This may sound silly but the lift took so long to come so I had to always take stairs from the 10th floor however that is good as it was a mini workout lol , The spa and the massage was amazing
278757,Catalonia Atenas, No fresh air in the room Coudn t open window as it faced the street with a high traffic The air conditioner is loud couldn t sleep No mains sockets at the bed Only one free plug above the table I can t describe breakfast as it was not included Definetly not a 4 star rank as described 3 is the fair one , Good location very close to metro and a train to the airport My room was ready earlier the regular check in 
278758,Catalonia Atenas, I would not recommend a spa as its too small just one sauna room and a tiny pool with few jets some of them you don t even feel also there no good place to ear close by so recommend eat at the hotel or go to the city , Very nice hotel with great staff Rooms are just like on the photos spacious and newly decorated Hotel has a restaurant and bar with quality food Room has everything you may need including tea and coffee small fridge with water 15 minutes walk to Sagrada familia and tourist bus stop 
278759,Catalonia Atenas, N A, Lovely hotel in an ideal location for both the metro and train station Some nice bars and restaurants nearby so you don t have to travel if you don t want the hassle Very friendly and accommodating staff The rooftop pool was a bonus for relaxing and getting a good tan A good tip for both the metro and train is to buy a T10 ticket which gets you 10 journeys on both of these and can be used for more than one person costs approx 9 10 euros so excellent value 
278760,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, We stayed in a doubled terraced room which was very clean spacious and had great views from the terrace Very accessible from the airport and city centre via train metro The spa facilities were fab Relaxing pool and steam room with complimentary juice and fruit 
278761,Catalonia Atenas, Didn t get to use the spa as when we did try on the last day the therapist was giving a massage and there was no one else to provide us access 2 members of staff would be good Very few plug sockets in apartment Aircon not the best either room was very warm at times , Balcony and rooftop pool views were excellent A good base very cheap for food and beers around the area Some may find it a little out of the way we were there for Sonar so it was perfect 
278762,Catalonia Atenas, small swimming pool size like a bathtub , clean nice hotel very nice smell in the entire hotel all the time delicious breakfasts fresh apples 24h for free location 15 min from all key places by metro metro station next to the hotel helpful staff
278763,Catalonia Atenas, The snack bar There wasn t much choice , I liked the luxury of the hotel especially for the price It was very comfortable It was close to about 3 metro entrances so it was easy to get around I liked that they had a few television stations in English There were restaurants and places to buy snacks nearby The breakfast was decent 
278764,Catalonia Atenas, Could have had tea and coffee in the rooms free , The roof top view is unbelievable Really wonderful I would come back here for this view Breakfast was good also and the location was great Right next to a metro station Everything was clean and the beds were comfortable 
278765,Catalonia Atenas, Highly priced, Terrace pool and its view is the best Room that we got is very ok Front desk staff and overall staff is very good co operative and warm 
278766,Catalonia Atenas, Cafe bar area quite small limited, Staff were excellent on the desk extremely helpful and I needed their help as I lost my phone during the trip
278767,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Fab room location great next to clot served our purpose while we travelled Barcelona for the weekend will recommend and use Catalonia hotel group again 
278768,Catalonia Atenas, We tried the room service and it did not work at all We waited for one hour until we called and asked where our burgers are They blamed on the place delivering the burgers that they didn t respond It would be nice by the hotel reception telling the status while you re waiting Also the opening hours would be nice to have All this started off by us wanting to have a sushi menu but that wasn t available it turned out after we ve been waiting for 15 minutes Also the first impression when we checked in wasn t very good when we were asked to give a copy of our credit card It also turned out that the credit card number was showed in clear text on the receipt This is information that should be protected by having your credit card number not readable for example 4920 12XX XXXX XXXX 1234 As an additonal smaller thing a glass was missing after we arrived in the evening When we called reception we got the glass in 15 minutes so that was quick delivery ,No Positive
278769,Catalonia Atenas, For a 4 star hotel and the price we paid the rooms are pretty small, Staff very helpful and nice and the room was always impeccably clean Location was decent as well good thing the metro was just opposite the road 
278770,Catalonia Atenas, 4 no way doors to bathroom were broken bathtub was broken room was small and not really clean too bad I paid for 4 and got max 2 5 , Service is really helpful That s a big advantage Pool on the roof is small but hey there is a pool on the roof 
278771,Catalonia Atenas, Some staff didn t explain important aspects however may have been due to language barrier, Staff were flexible in dealing with requests The rooftop pool was amazing The hotel was nice and clean and had a nice smell 
278772,Catalonia Atenas, Really expensive way too expensive for what you get Not worth the money Lack of power outlets beds weren t so great and the bathroom door didn t have a lock I was there 3 days and paid about 509 ,No Positive
278773,Catalonia Atenas, First night next door were a bit too noisy n couln not sleep too well On Sat there was a group of guys who took over the entire pool n being very inconsiderate and childish with behaviour and drinking so I left earlier than I d like , The Spa was just perfect But it should be kept as a silent place to relax not for people to run around n scream Maybe receptionist should invite guests to be more considerate 
278774,Catalonia Atenas, The television had no English channels The pool area was rather small The jacuzzi was freezing staff understood little to no English So they wouldn t adjust the tempeture Our bedroom lights had a serious malfunction on our last day had an engineer come out to fix it , Wifi everywhere Maids and reception staff were very friendly and welcoming 
278775,Catalonia Atenas, The rooms are not sound isolated so if you are very sensitive I wouldnt recommend it I m usually sensitive but didn t have so much problem with the sound so it depends , Really nice rooms very comfortable and it s only 10 15 min by metro to plaza catalunya 
278776,Catalonia Atenas, We had a 3 person room and the third bed was poor mattress was bad Pool was a disappointment as it is quite small and very cold , Excellent location to the Metro Spa and snacks bar were nice 
278777,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Extremely clean hotel very friendly and helpful staff Rooftop terrace and pool was an added bonus Our room was cleaned everyday to a high standard and the hotel always smelt clean and fresh Great location next to the metro 
278778,Catalonia Atenas, Booked the room over a month before our arrival to find our double bed was actually replaced by 2 single beds Ask reception but said the hotel was fully booked when we did ask online before Awkward trying to sleep when the bed separates Single glass of whisky cost 15 bottle in shop costs 20 really overpriced , Great location Train from airport straight to the closest stop 3 minutes walk El Clot Metro direct to central Barcelona from the same train station Great pool with amazing views Relaxing Spa facilities 
278779,Catalonia Atenas, The room was very small We were only there for one night and didn t get to use the spa facilities which we paid extra for on booking com We asked for a refund for the spa charge and were told that the spa doesn t cost extra So we could have paid less for the room with the same access to the spa , The staff was very friendly When the hair dryer in the room didn t work they sent someone up with a replacement right away The room was clean and I love that they checked on us after we were settled 
278780,Catalonia Atenas, I asked for a double bed as I was on my own I booked the hotel in February When i arrived they had given me a twin bedded room opposite the lift I asked to move rooms but they said they were fully booked I got very little sleep the walls aren t sound proof and by the lift I could all the comings and goings Plus the pillows were long and thin so not easy to sleep The bathroom was modern but the room could do with a touch up , It is a good location overall and lovely to have a rooftop pool to make the most of the weather It was clean and bathrooms are modern 
278781,Catalonia Atenas, Very small and hot room Everything is paid extra breakfast spa parking Really not worth the money for a 4 hotel , The spa when not too crowded Position close to metro station 
278782,Catalonia Atenas, Soundproof is rather poor We could hear the people talking on the street with the window closed as well as the trains passing by underground , Excellent staff and convenient location Spar is nice and with good service Room is spacious and the bed is pretty comfortable Breakfast has a rich variety 
278783,Catalonia Atenas, The swimming pool on the roof is quite small Not the best isolated rooms depending on your neighbors you can hear all their conversations , The hotel is very close to public transports bus metro and train the room was very clean and the staff is very very friendly The food you get in the hotel snack bar is good 
278784,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Right in the centre of town so close to most of the attractions Very close to the metro too which was very helpful Staff were friendly and very helpful
278785,Catalonia Atenas, Everything was perfect , Beautiful hotel Excellent location Fantastic food and drink facilities Nothing was too much trouble Will deffo be coming back next year Even had afternoon chocolates brought up to our room 
278786,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, The hotel was right next to the metro station Clot line L1 which has connection to line L9sud from El prat airport Terminal 1 The breakfast was rich it had everything that anyone cold ask for The room was very clean and the size of it was actually big I stayed with my husband and my 3 year old baby girl who slept in a baby cot and the room that gave us had a small balcony with a really nice view The staff was really friendly The bed and the pillows were soft and very comfortable I would recommend this hotel to everyone and would choose it again if I ever visit Barcelona again There is also a space in the lobby which is equipped with kids toys Very friendly and safe neighborhood for kids right next to the hotel there is playground 
278787,Catalonia Atenas, No major issues Only a strange room smell at start but wasnt due to cleaningess Issue only the heat as it Is from top floor and sun can be easily solved with ventilation , Bed Location
278788,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, The breakfast was superb with great selection Omelettes eggs and bacon cooked freshly Rooftop pool small but the area great for relaxing and outstanding views Minutes from the metro and Renfe airport 30 mins away 20 min walk to beach 10 min walk to cathedral I would highly recommend this hotel 
278789,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, The stuff is welcoming I stayed in premium family room which is very specious with comfortable bed the bath room is clean and beautiful over all excellent hotel for value
278790,Catalonia Atenas, We were given a tiny room with two single beds pushed together with each bed made individually when we had booked a double When we arrived at 8 50pm there was a queue at the reception desk with six individuals or couples waiting to be checked in and only one receptionist After waiting half an hour it was disappointing to be given a lousy room When my husband went to complain the receptionist said sorry sir but we can t move you we are full and my husband said but you weren t full when we booked and paid a month ago Basically we were bumped off because we had prepaid To give them their due the hotel did move us to a much better room the following day but only because my husband was very angry The snack bar was also understaffed , The staff were trying their best under difficult circumstances
278791,Catalonia Atenas, We were very disappointed with the room True we booked a double bed but this was the smallest room on the floor plan with very poor ventilation and no ventilation whatsoever in the bathroom To sit at my laptop on the desk one would have to keep the window closed since if opened it obstructed the desk When we complained about the room the receptionist said that if we had booked 2 singlr beds the room would have been larger We asked to change rooms but were told by the receptionist that none were available and that we were only staying for 3 nights Otherwise we couldn t complain about anything else , Very good and varied buffet breakfast the lobby was always sparkling clean with a nice fragrant air freshner 
278792,Catalonia Atenas, The bed had no stop so it made it hard to sit up and lean back in the bed We had to push the bed back a number of times , The hotel is in the perfect location with the metro station across the road and only 4 stops away from Barcelona s City Centre The hotel was clean the spa was beautiful and the breakfast spread was amazing There are also a number of 24hour snack shops only a few shops away from the hotel making little nibbles easily accessible for during the day and late in the evening 
278793,Catalonia Atenas, Staff charging money from my card even though I paid in full before and then this older receptionist convincing me that they refunded me even though they did not Still waiting for the refund , The rooms were really clean and the breakfest was excellent 
278794,Catalonia Atenas, No spare pillows in the room When we asked for extra water from reception got told to go buy some I can understand this but feel they should provide this if requested just to go the extra distance Better signage to the pool as so clear sign before you go outside , Nice location with easy access to the metro clean and well presented Also good value Spa was nice and relaxing
278795,Catalonia Atenas, Don t expect to be amazed The 4 stars were probably given about 20 years ago But they have re done the interior so it s clean But a glass door on the toilet that dosent close means bathroom smells and noise are unavoidable ,No Positive
278796,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Very good hotel Plenty of facilities available Nice staff Very clean Location was good 7 minute metro ride from Catalunya the main hub 10 rides 9 90euro Will stay here again on future trip to Barcelona 
278797,Catalonia Atenas, The air con didn t work and it was so hot in the night we couldn t sleep The location left some to be desired It didn t feel safe after dark and it was too far from Central Barcelona to enjoy the nightlife, Rooftop pool was amazing as was the Spa Panoramic views and close to Sagrada Familia Could see it from The hotel rooftop and walk in just 15 20 mins Rooms with terrace had amazing views too and a good size space
278798,Catalonia Atenas, Closer to the centre although right next to the Metro, Lovely room with balcony and loved the spa Staff were so helpful and friendly Overall stay was brilliant 
278799,Catalonia Atenas, The beds were too short I am 1m84 and my husband 1m90 and both our feet were hanging out There were not enough plugs in the room so we had to take turns charging our phones and camera The hotel does not deserve 4 stars maybe 2 or 3 stars tops , It was quite unexpensive and the staff was friendly 
278800,Catalonia Atenas, The swimming pool on the roof is very small but nice to sit around , The location is great without being in the expensive centre of the city The MTR is right outside the door and then 3 stops to town 5 stops to the Beach The spa pool and steam room is excellent Has a nice rooftop area with amazing views The premier room was great Must be very newly refurbed 
278801,Catalonia Atenas, The rate of some rooms dont cover breakfast SPA and some room service like hot boiler Just check all details The rooms can be really small , Good breakfast 
278802,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Directly opposite the metro station and central Barcelona was about a 5 minute way away on train 10 minute walk also from Sagrada Familia perfect location 
278803,Catalonia Atenas, The airconditioning wasn t working because it was not high season The room was quite hot at night so it would have been better if it was at least working for a few hours to cool the room down in the evening , The staff at this hotel were all friendly welcoming and knowledgable The location is a little out of the centre but it is easy to travel in by metro or taxi and it is quiet at night so it s easy to sleep The spa and the roof top pool are fantastic and there are lots of areas to chill out in and get a snack or drink I d recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a quality hotel that isn t directly in the busy tourist area 
278804,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, was a really nice hotel and we stayed in the premium room with spa access which was Fabulous would surely book the same hotel again and the location is good with easy access both to the center of Barcelona and to the airport 
278805,Catalonia Atenas, Our room wasn t quite ready at check in but staff was apologetic and offered us complimentary drinks while we waited less than five minutes , The staff was phenomenal From the receptionist at the front desk to the staff at the spa to the night manager who helped us print our boarding pass everyone was friendly and helpful Our room 1001 was roomy spotless and had a great view of the city The rooftop pool would be perfect for summer The spa while small was perfect and the staff limits the number of people by reservation so it s not overcrowded Massage services are fantastic and very reasonably priced Great location near the Clot metro stop and there is a little bakery convenience store open 24 7 next door to the hotel if you cant find what you need in the lobby vending machines Flawless WiFi as well 
278806,Catalonia Atenas, Room small opened door and walked into bed Shame as beautiful room perfect otherwise Pillows those tubular shape No leaflets in reception re local attractions on display Though available from staff on request , Staff exceptional friendly helpful and informative Breakfast huge choice and tasty Very clean throughout all areas Spa and pools relaxing ideal for reviving break Great view of city from rooftop pool area Fresh fruit available in reception Free snacks served with drinks Proper cocktails All toiletries needed for trip supplied in rooms and spa Ideal when taking hand luggage only Even wet razor pack for hubby Plenty small local shops cafes and restaurants Walking distance to some sights 2mins walk to metros and trains with cheap regular transport to all city inc airport 
278807,Catalonia Atenas, As stated above we chose a premium room but were initially given a tiny room you could barely walk around the bed We complained immediately and were told that there were no significantly bigger rooms available However they did provide us with a much larger room the next day which was good other than the sound of rushing water mentioned above The lady on reception was not very helpful and ignored us when we were talking to her about it , We chose a premium room which was nicely presented The bed was very comfortable However our room seemed to be near a water outlet for the hotel and from 5 6 am each day there was a regular sound of rushing water I assume people having showers etc which was disturbing On the plus side the spa is very good and for the most part the staff are very nice The breakfast is excellent 
278808,Catalonia Atenas, We asked for a double bed and we received 2 single beds united but during the night the gap between them would increase since the beds are on wheels so we couldn t sleep together The heating makes noise so we had to close it during the night and towards morning it was cold in the room , I loved the location very close to subway market nearby and a very good pizzeria and staff at the reception I liked the room modern furniture and the bathroom was cleaned on a daily basis I can t rate the other facilities breakfast pool because we didn t use them Overall it was a very nice experience for the price we paid 
278809,Catalonia Atenas, The lifts are sooooo slow that almost everyone had to walk stairway The air conditioning didn t work well so our room was steaming hot even it was 10 degrees outside , Location is excellent Less than 5 mins walk to Metro station which connects to everywhere including airport and trains to other European countries Staff are helpful snd friendly 
278810,Catalonia Atenas, Bathroom door rotten at the bottom Safe didn t work so eventually they replaced it but the new one wasn t anchored in No air con and when asked they said at reception they don t put either the heating or air con on at this time of year In the end we opened the window and coped with the traffic noise , Bar staff and reception staff friendly and helpful V close to R2 line clot arago so easy for the airport Also for the metro clot so great for getting around Breakfast good selection even had soya milk 
278811,Catalonia Atenas, The swimming pool was close and iy was not said anywhere The cleaning staff knock the door and clean noisily the next room on a Sunday quite early so I could not use my relax day to sleep longer One of the towels was dirty, It was clean The staff was super nice The location was good well communicated by public transport Worth the price
278812,Catalonia Atenas, No tea facilities in room Confronted by blunt staff member No hand washing soap Room was mopped with a bad smelling mop, Well made mojitos Friendly staff members Easy access to city centre and tourist attractions
278813,Catalonia Atenas, If you re on the ground floor with the exec room you hear the underground train go past every 30 minutes although it stops at 11, The spa was excellent Breakfast was great too
278814,Catalonia Atenas, Window is stiff No air conditioning at the beginning of April Waldrobe door needs repair , Comfortable bed big bathroom variety of choices at breakfast buffet speedy wifi Restaurant serves delicious tapas View from the roof top is magnificent especially at night 
278815,Catalonia Atenas, Poor air conditioning Despite it being on constantly the room was like an oven We had to open the window at night which disturbed our sleep due to traffic noise The windows open fully which is rather scary with young children on the 6th floor , Impressive buffet breakfast excellent location clean spacious rooms with comfortable beds 
278816,Catalonia Atenas, The hotel d cor is old and tired and could do with refurbishing The place is not the cleanest The price seems a little steep for what is on offer Would not recommend if you are looking for a quiet place as many of the guests seem oblivious of others and go about noisily in the corridors late at night or slam doors ,No Positive
278817,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, The hotel is in an excellent location 15 minute walk from Sagrada Familia or 2 stops on the metro which is behind the hotel There is a bakery just next door which seems to be open literally all the time We had our breakfast here as it wasn t included with our room We only used the spa once but it was beautifulmy relaxing after all long day sightseeing 
278818,Catalonia Atenas, Room walls a bit thin could hear people from next room speaking loudly at 2 am in the morning I suppose depends on the people you get in the next room Also hotel breakfast a bit expensive at 13 , Nice clean room and bath room helpfull staff and good reasonably priced spa services Only a mins walk from metro station and 5mins from train station from which you can get a train direct to the airport Nice view of the la Sagrada Familia and the hills in the background from the roof And free wifi 
278819,Catalonia Atenas, I paid for everything using the spa pool or steam room breakfast etc, The location is good I was able to walk to the city centre though it takes about 45 mintyes I don t mind I love walking It s about 10 to 15 minutes if you drive The rooftop pool was good you get to see a lovely view of the city 
278820,Catalonia Atenas, Location could have been better but was near a metro and only a 30 minute walk to the beach , Very good value for money great breakfast and lovely spa 
278821,Catalonia Atenas, Like almost all continental h tels tea making facilities would be ideal, Quiet room Nice decor Access to the m tro was excellent very quick to all tourist destinations Very clean Large comfy bed Tv had lots of channels to suit all nationalities staff speak good english
278822,Catalonia Atenas, There is construction going on in the hotel for the next 4 WEEKS until 30th APRIL 2016 DO NOT STAY UNLESS YOU LIKE BANGING AN DRILLING AT FROM 7 30am till 18 00, Spa
278823,Catalonia Atenas, There wasn t an easily accessible plug for the kettle in this room but still managed and its only a minor moan , Everything location views staff facilities my favourite hotel in Barcelona Metro outside and just as good is the train from the airport stops here 
278824,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, I love everything about this hotel and stay here regularly The staff are great and the rooms are huge and the views from the roof outstanding you can see the sagrada familia and its really close by plus metro is right outside There is nothing bad about this hotel I have thoroughly enjoyed it every time 
278825,Catalonia Atenas, Parking in the basement for small cars only Difficult or impossible to find parking on the street Rather expencive place to stay is it that level in Barcelona Noisy some times cause thin wall to the next room , Breakfast good Good place to start for visiting La Sagrada Familia 10 15min walk 15 20 min more to visit the Gaudi house Nice small snackbars and pubs in the area I will probably use this hotel next time too 
278826,Catalonia Atenas, i think the spa jaccuzi should be bigger , the guys in the reception was very helpful the clot metro station beside is really close and gives access to 2 metro lines 
278827,Catalonia Atenas, breakfast could have been cheaper or included in price balcony could have faced the sun more, Special little touches very tidy and clean very helpful lovely people 
278828,Catalonia Atenas, The rooms were not well insulated against internal noise , The location was very good for bus train and metro services Staff were very friendly and helpful Very good breakfast 
278829,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, The staff were absolutely fantastic espxially david on reception there was nothing they wouldnt do to help Very nice atmosphere clean and friendly place the pictures on the internet do not do this place justice 5 stars brilliant time
278830,Catalonia Atenas, There was a continuous stream of young people schoolchildren staying This resulted in the noise of kids at all hours of evening and night as late as 3am So beware if you are a light sleeper , Staff extremely friendly and helpful 
278831,Catalonia Atenas, Pool advertised upstairs was out of use Sauna Spa 5 I was staying on the 6th floor and awoke most mornings to the sound of hammering and drilling due to maintanance work going on in a room close by in the hotel Poor room view , Nice friendly staff Very clean Good location room cleaner spotless 
278832,Catalonia Atenas, Tea coffee making facilities would have been nice but I guess not having this is the norm in a 4 start Spanish property , Great location for the activities we had planned also great access for public transport into the city centre 
278833,Catalonia Atenas, Obviously not a new hotel as some of the fittings in the bathrooms are a bit tired but still great value for money with spacious rooms for European standards, Great staff great value for money excellent location Would stay there again
278834,Catalonia Atenas, rooms are really tiny , very good location although not in the city center but few meters away from metro line walking distance to Sagrada Familia 10 minutes total journey to center overall quality for the price paid is very good bathroom is large and has good facilities 
278835,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Location is very good There are more than one metro stations that you can easily reach to the touristic places Behind the hotel there are many cafes and stores Hotel price is very acceptable

278838,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, At the first time we were not satisfied with our first room but afterwards we ve got another room which was better than the first room bigger and the bed was more comfortable than before The location is good because there is a direct connection with a train to airport 
278839,Catalonia Atenas, Chocolate sauce machine but no churros , Very friendly helpful staff especially David who telephoned a pizza delivery for us Excellent location for metro Managed to see the tip of sagrada from my window on the 7th floor 
278840,Catalonia Atenas, very small room old hotel and bathroom very old the cleaning service was very poor The 13 euros for breakfast was a big amount for this hotel , very close to the metro station clot
278841,Catalonia Atenas, I was there for two nights the second night was cold and the air conditioner wasn t working I asked the staff to do something and told me that it s hot and they turned off air conditioner and I can t turn it on , location
278842,Catalonia Atenas, Room could have been cleaner and was a bit noisy too building pretty old, Close to metro station staff is friendly spa is nice and came with additional cost

278844,Catalonia Atenas, room are a little bit noisy you can hear other people laughing in other rooms bathroom has no window and no ventilation so if you take a shower then it becomes difficult to breathe , room was nice and big enough spacious bathroom position in not exactly in the city center but it s 1 min away from metro station and in 7 min you can reach placa Catalunya so it s not a problem the position 
278845,Catalonia Atenas, the staff at the front desk is not that helpful as I expect there s no English movie channel and the place needs a little more brighter the breakfast are too expensive , the place is very accessible to subway 
278846,Catalonia Atenas, No bad experiences Location was distant from many points of interest and city centre , Staff friendly and helpful Excellent breakfast Clean and comfortable 
278847,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, The genuine friendly staff and excellent level of service In particular Victor Alfonso and Julia However everyone provided us with an excellent service from the receptionists to the cleaners 
278848,Catalonia Atenas, We didn t get the room that we booked online but then we were moved to a different room also carmen the receptionist wasn t very nice even a bit rude sometimes , Housekeeping service was good 
278849,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, All in all a fantastic hotel we would happily recommend to anyone Great location metro station just in front which also takes u directly to the airport close to most tourist attractions Sagrada familia is just a walk away really friendly staff breakfast was perfect but most importantly the SPA you can not miss this 
278850,Catalonia Atenas, Maybe should have been a little cleaner The rooms are also quite a bit older , Perfect for someone who needs a bed and appreciates being back around 9 to 10 for bed as quite quiet Has beautiful views from a small roof top deck overlooking everything the city has to offer Relaxing after exams 
278851,Catalonia Atenas, Only the room temperature was very hot could not regulate it had the windows open was then quiet noisy , Easy reach to where we wanted too visit Staff very helpful even booked a nice restaurant for us 
278852,Catalonia Atenas, The SPA access was limited time limit which is not mentioned in the Hotel s information and also not mentioned when realizing the check in , Staff was friendly and willing to help regarding room change requested 
278853,Catalonia Atenas, The room had a stale smell on arrival but opening the window got rid of that , Comfortable bed good breakfast well appointed bathroom Bit out of the centre but that suited me fine Good train link to airport that spa and pool could be useful but I only slept and had breakfast 
278854,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, ALL the staff are excellent my boyfriend had been the victim of theft on the train and the staff at the hotel really showed concern and assisted in directing us through the procedure to file reports etc The whole staff a real merrit to the reputation of this hotel 
278855,Catalonia Atenas, set up of bathroom made it VERY difficult to get in and out of the bath shower no accessible plugs near bed for telephone computer, location to metro train station made getting around the city very easy staff very friendly helpful wifi fast and always working value for perfect
278856,Catalonia Atenas, My room was a corner room and it felt a bit awkward and small , The staff was very friendly and very helpful with a great attitude The hotel lobby smelt very nice I had a great view of the city The hotel was very affordable 
278857,Catalonia Atenas, room was basic could ve been a bit cleaner no kettle which was a bit of a nuisance, excellent location 2 metro stations within 1 minute walk 2 metro stops from city centre
278858,Catalonia Atenas, Bed two beds together doesnt mean its double bed and its extremly uncomfortable And they said its premium but the room was really small And i think the second night was 87euros which is not the price i booked online , spa is nice
278859,Catalonia Atenas, Rooms rather small and bathroom even too small , Great facilities Excellent breakfast Super friendly staff Good pricing Metro station across the street
278860,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Close to the metro very nice view from my rein on the 10th floor It was very relaxing the pool at the spa after a whole day walking around the city Staff very gentle Breakfast was good
278861,Catalonia Atenas, We got a room with a bidet and the toilet too close to each other Not so much trouble just a little bit tight for comfortable as i am a big person , The location is really close to metro station with a very good connection to city center Just 2 stop from Sagrada familia There are lot of supermarket and good bakery around And there is playground for childern next to the hotel The rooftop view is amazing

278864,Catalonia Atenas, I would not say it was a bad experience as very thing was good the outside pool a bit to small plus the water was cold could have heated the water Not much to do in the hotel if you did not want to go out , The room was clean and the staff smile all the David was very good he always smile
278865,Catalonia Atenas, The room given to me was not the correct one booked on booking com The staff manager said the pics are not uploaded correctly and it s misleading After insisting and advising them that my colleague booked the same room and he received a room more than double the size of mine they offered to refund me which was ridiculous since I needed to be there for work Eventually I was given something that was a bit bigger Housekeeping does not refill toiletries and when I asked reception they said that they do not have extra You have to pay to use a scale to weight your luggage and reception does not give you change nor can they add it to your room , It was a nice walk to the Sagrada Familiar and city and close to the bus and train routes 
278866,Catalonia Atenas, Room size was really small Felt like even it should be a called a room or not Was difficult to adjust , Staff is nice and helpful Hotel is located at good location Can be accessed from airport easily La Ramble is also easy to access Most of the attractions were also visible from the top floor
278867,Catalonia Atenas, Staff is not that helpful we wanted change of some Euro they refuse and gave excuse that they don t have change of 300 also so poor hotel doesn t have 300 sad Hotel is ok inside safe area seems just ok but too many drama people around as one lady was cycling and fall down dramatically on street and looking at me and my husband that either are we looking at her or not next morning same front area of the hotel there is internet caf we faced two ladies with one kid tried to say something in her own language which I told her I don t understand sorry English she tried to push and snatch my bag I ran and went in caf so the caf owner said these ladies with kid they are baggers and thief so plz stay here for while let them go I think hotel should work on the surrounding security which effect their guest so in night we stayed in hotel and even in day time we were careful so be careful I guess in Barcelona you have to be careful extra , Near metro station nice neat hotel Supermarket next door inside hotel locker available Good value of money 
278868,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Carmen who was on the front desk was so helpful and friendly to us she went out of her way to help We d bought tickets for a football match on which the date changed so we couldn t go she helped us get new ones and tried to get the old ones refunded among other things She made us feel very warmly welcome Thank you Carmen 
278869,Catalonia Atenas, Room was a bit small for the price no power sockets at the desk the desk was too small location wasnt that great Room located next to a noisy street Construction work started early Not really a deal breaker though Just inconvenient , Staff was fantastic breakfast was amazing
278870,Catalonia Atenas, Too poor breakfast For max 2 Very small room for such a price Only because of the 10th floor and the balcony very narrow space between walls bed door everything in the room , Location and cleaning 
278871,Catalonia Atenas, 4 hotel stars must offer at least sleepers for customers The safe box was broken You can listen water fall in walls from the other floor, Breakfast 
278872,Catalonia Atenas, We were on the ground floor and the aircon wasn t great but if we had the window open you could hear all the traffic which wasn t great , Absolutely fabulous hotel loved our stay and didn t want to leave Oriel on reception was so helpful in helping us get around Barcelona and recommending places to eat Our room was lovely really decent sized and very clean Breakfast was well worth the money 
278873,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Good location near metro station and close to sagrada familia Good breakfast and nice and helpfull staf especially Gianina who respond promptly to our needs and requests i recomend her i would definetely come back to barcelona and to this hotel
278874,Catalonia Atenas, The elevators I lost almost an hour in the morning to go from Breakfast to the 7th floor afterwards to the Reception and in the end to the underground garage , Honestly nothing particularly Location OK but not our of the ordinary 
278875,Catalonia Atenas, I booked a room with a double bed which turned out to be two singles pushed together so in the night we were constantly falling down the crack there were no refreshments in the room such as water bottles or a little kettle and cups to make tea etc so the first night we found ourselves very thirsty until we found somewhere to get water Breakfast was okay wasnt anything special and wasnt the worst they had an omlette station which was probably the best bit but there was only somebody making them on our last day so only got to have that once The room was dated and needed refreshing the website definitely made it look better than it is and in terms of value for money i think once you realise that barcelona is a very expensive place to visit then yes you are getting good value for money here but it does seem expensive for what you get , The lovation of the hotel was quite good it was right next to clot station and was very easy to access the meain locations of barcelona without being too close to everything Staff were very friendly and helpful and the soa was absolutely lovely it really didnt seam to fit the rest of the hotel in terms of design would definitely reccomend a visit to the spa The aircon also worked very well The view from the top of the hotel was lovely you could see the whole of barcelona beauiful 
278876,Catalonia Atenas, No Tea Coffee making falcility in the room outside of meal time only a very poor coffee available from a vending machine Beds were very old and mattresses gave little or no support On all three nights we reported loud noises from the a joining room with no effort by staff to address this mater so three very poor nights sleep , Close to local Metro line so easy to get into and out of the city
278877,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Hotel is really nice and staff are equally as nice Location is slightly outside the city but metros on nearly every corner outside the hotel which are then 8 10 mins into the centre 
278878,Catalonia Atenas, Scratched furniture and bathroom , Near city center location only guests hotel parking good wifi two glass elevators pc with printer for guests Sagrada de Familia in 15 minutes walk central flea market in a 5 minutes walk 
278879,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Rooms re very small not possible to breath in far from everything but good is metro station situate in front of hotel swimming pool on the roof is a big bath just I don t think someone is swimming there just very nice personal in there and not bad breakfasts 
278880,Catalonia Atenas, our room absolutely doesn t look like those rooms on pictures was very very small and old and used during the night was quite cold in the room also the neighborhood is noisy even during the night, the view from the roof is very nice metro station is just across the street Sagrada Familia is few minutes of walking 
278881,Catalonia Atenas, The room was small and overpriced The hotel seemed to be in a rough part of town I struggle to believe that this is a four star hotel , The bathroom was very nice with a powerful shower Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly
278882,Catalonia Atenas, the bed pillows are a bit tough , The hotel staff I interacted with showed me highest degree of professionalism and experience Iryna Oriol and a manager Carmen always smiling they leave in the guest the right impression I even asked the manager Carmen where can I park my car on my way to the stadium to watch football game she advised me to park in a mall park nearby that was the best thing Rooms are furnished nicely bathroom very moderns
278883,Catalonia Atenas, room keys used to automatically deactivate roof pool is very small , The location is near to everything hotel price is so much reasonable to the service they offer food quality is amazing staff are friendly and helpful place is clean no interruptions so issues everything went easy and seamless 
278884,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Receptionists are very nice and helpful Hotel is very near the Clot Metro station I loved the spa and the pool area has a great view will definitely stay there again 
278885,Catalonia Atenas, The view We were on the ground floor , Beautiful and very clean and comfortable room The staff and the spa were wonderful Would definitely recommend this hotel 
278886,Catalonia Atenas, It would have been better if the facilities were open for longer hours as the opening hours are usually times while we were site seeing We had a room for 3 and requested a double bed and a single bed specifically and to be informed if this was not possible We were not informed and were given 3 single beds with no compensation , Its location was ideal since it is just opposite the underground station The staff was very helpful and informative regarding sites and getting to different places 
278887,Catalonia Atenas, The room layout old bath with cracks empty fridge small table on the balcony there was no parking space for our Maserati and it took us 90 minutes at 1 am after a 10 hour drive from Malaga to find the parking space which was not as safe as we would like So the hotel could not comply with our prebooked requests , The view the breakfast 
278888,Catalonia Atenas, We stayed on the day of the Catalonian Independence March which meant it it took us one hour to cross the road from the metro It would have been useful if the hotel staff had warned us of this event as we could have made alternative plans for that day , A comfortable hotel in a good location across the road from a metro which was five stops to the centre of Barcelona We didn t use the spa or the rooftop pool so cannot comment on those Not many places to eat nearby 
278889,Catalonia Atenas, The pool was too small and this was the main reason that I would like to go So it was quite frustating And it was really cold , Room really comfortable and really good staff Easy access to the metro Nice spa 
278890,Catalonia Atenas, My only fault was that the room furniture was past its best Thus not worth the price, Hotel was clean and tidy staff very helpful and friendly Nothing was too much trouble Beds very comfortable Ideally located for metro plus train from airport Both where underground which made the city easy to explore 
278891,Catalonia Atenas, A little noisey if you have the room on the first floor You can hear everything in the corridor, Friwndly staff good selection at breakfast nice room
278892,Catalonia Atenas, swimming pool needs a urgent refurbishment was given a room with two single beds when i booked a double room apparently was fully booked it was my wedding anniversary not happy , breakfast only 
278893,Catalonia Atenas, Walls are thin so if your neighbors are loud you will not get good night sleep , Location is great metro station on L1 is just across the street Housekeeper Rosa does her job very good Good hotel overall 
278894,Catalonia Atenas, little bit far from city center and cannot enjoy the la sagrada familia from the window, few minutes work to the metro quite close to burberry factory outlet 
278895,Catalonia Atenas, The staff wasn t friendly at all Tried to charge us more than the Price given on Booking com The premium rooms are the size of a shoe box The toilet Kept running after flushing We left after just one Night ,No Positive
278896,Catalonia Atenas, The swimming pool on the top of the roof is very small In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor s corridor The paint smell really awful Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn t very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer , The location is awesome You can go across the street and grab a subway The Sagrada Familia is about 15 20 minutes by foot 
278897,Catalonia Atenas, Not really bad experience but the toilet had no brush and it had a glass door second hotel with glass doors on the toilet The double bed was in fact two separate beds and they moved easily We had no glasses in the room That s pretty it nothing really important but still worth mentioning , Breakfast was rich staff was friendly and helpful Location was near the Metro Station The small pool on the roof was a bit cold but we enjoyed it nonetheless 
278898,Catalonia Atenas, The room was really small considering what we had paid and there was a corner that still had bare concrete it hadn t actually been decorated The worst thing about the room was the water pipe running past it it was ridiculously loud to the point where we thought the bathroom was flooding It banged loudly on a regular basis and woke us up a couple of times a night There was one lady who worked in the restaurant bar who seemed rude She did not smile once and gave one word answers She didn t say a word when she brought our food and just slammed it onto the table This member of staff was definitely the exception though The area the hotel isn t the best and not very pleasant to walk through alone at night if you re female The swimming pool was absolutely tiny and there wasn t enough room for everyone who wanted to use it , There was a spa ran by exceptionally friendly staff we had an incredible massage The staff at reception were really friendly and helpful The hotel was clean and the beds were comfy Food at the bar was really good Hotel was near a train station and near La Sagrada Familia 
278899,Catalonia Atenas, The room was too loud Sewer pipes seemed to be in the room Housekeeping staff worked and talked very loud directly in front of the door which had a big gap So we were not able to sleep off , Nice view from the roof top 
278900,Catalonia Atenas, Nothing except 1 minor thing that they never gave us any more milk for me cup a tea hahahaha petty but I likes a tea in the morning , Staff were excellent Santiago at reception at nights was quality guy Perfect location Breakfast was lovely an the spa is so relaxing I fell asleep every day in there 
278901,Catalonia Atenas, Not enough plug sockets Those that were in room were in poor locations One was in the bathroom didn t work and one was right next to door so to charge anything meant placing item on floor in doorway therefore not possible to leave things charging when leaving the room or if one of us was at pool etc as time would get stepped on This left 1 plug socket across the room from the bed to charge everything , Pool and roof terrace Free wifi a must and signal was great Also great left luggage service which is free and we used both before check in and after check out
278902,Catalonia Atenas,No Negative, Stayed for 2 nights for our anniversary we had a brilliant time the staff were great especially the American guy on reception he was so helpful The hotel is about 4 stops from las ramblas on the metro so great location we would defo return Room was spotless didn t sample any food Would recommend for a reasonable price hotel don t panic when u see the outside the inside is much better
278903,Catalonia Atenas, The king size bed Is actually two single beds put beside each other Terrrrible we suffered everyday out of the six Asked for smaller pillows that are less then a metsr plus long they don t use that here was the answer Rooms are super tinny So didn t expect that either , The front desk speaks great English Very helpful Location is nice and close to Metro station and great attractions such as sagrada familia Also many restaurants near by Also THE SPA Amazing Great relaxing spot And very clean

278914,Catalonia Atenas, Well this is not a hotel or there is no star I was very disappointed when I arrived in the hotel it was like hospital but with hostel beds I am very surprised when I read others comments on the above hotel and booked very disappointing One and half meter swimming pool smell like anything all the hospital is difficult to leave I went there for two weeks after 5 days moved another hotel not hostel or hospital , Nothing to say good about the hospital 
278915,Catalonia Atenas, Problems getting the correct room that we had paid for then lifts were the slowest I have ever come across There were bits of the hotel that were a bit shabby like the pool with the photo being taken a few years ago , The hotel was three metro stops from the Center of barcelona and the metro entrance was only seconds away the breakfast was a must and rates as one of the best I have had The wifi worked very well staff polite

278919,Catalonia Atenas, Elevator was broke Just one working the full 3 days np for me to go 7 stories up with luggage because it take forever to get the one working at your floor but then to see that the staff occupied the one left to go up every floor to hang a paper that it was broke was not nice At noon I wanted to eat at the bar I was told the kitchen opend at 12 it was 11 50 she diddent want to take my order shame on you Rooms where noisey you could hear everything I think it was a good 3 star hotel nothing more, Breakfast close to metro station
