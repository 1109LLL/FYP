120883,Hotel Elys es Bassano, Ensuite bathrooms are a little on the small side toilet is hard up against the bath and we could hear every conversation our neighbours were having but overall the hotel is excellent , Location is excellent Only 10 minute walk to Champs Elysees the Arc de triomphe and only 25 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower Staff on reception are extremely helpful and speak excellent English too Room cleaned every morning and fresh towels were always provided 
120884,Hotel Elys es Bassano, Rooms on the small side , The hotel was perfectly located for us to access Paris Metro and champs Elysees only 10 mins walk The staff were knowledgeable and very friendly Our hotel room was small but clean and comfortable 
120885,Hotel Elys es Bassano, The property was perfect the problem is just if you have to park your car only that , Nice hotel at 100 ft near arc de triomphe The hotel is based modern and chic the rooms were very good CLEAN it s good to come for leisure or work really it s a good deal if you want to stay like a week end or a week 
120886,Hotel Elys es Bassano, The absolute worst check in PROCESS ever I mean why would any hotel request to write down my credit card number on paper and claim that they ll use it in case I use anything from the mini bar They then said it is a standard procedure around the place which I ve never seen anywhere around the place If you don t want to give up your card number then be prepared for a long conversation at check in , Very good location Spacious room 
120887,Hotel Elys es Bassano, The service was bad aircondition was not working in the hotel and room was slightly small and hot and nobody could do anything about it no complimentary water in the room And you re only allowed to get one key only for the room , The location was good
120888,Hotel Elys es Bassano,No Negative, Staff on arrival were extremely helpful and welcoming giving great tips on local restaurants and accommodating us for the tiny 5 minute wait we had for our room by offering us refreshments and giving us a map and information regarding the local area 
120889,Hotel Elys es Bassano, We asked and paid for a triple room as we were traveling with our baby girl when we arrived we received a double room and when we asked why the front desk person became a little anoyed with my question , Very close to Champs Ellyses 
120890,Hotel Elys es Bassano, VERY VERY narrow room There is even no space to accommodate out luggages No bellboy service you have to take your luggages in the smallest elevator ever to the your room The room is not a 4 star room by any means though the hotel is not bad Beside being in the Elysees district I think the hotel is over priced and doesn t worth its price , The hotel is two blocks from Champs Elysees A lot of restaurants and coffeeshops nearby When I reached the hotel few hours before the check in time my room was ready and they let me in immediately The room was clean with the basic facilities 
120891,Hotel Elys es Bassano, Sometimes I had to take the stairs because the cleaning ladies were using the elevator and unfortunately there is only one elevator , Great location Very close do champs elysees avenue and lots of restaurants close by 
120892,Hotel Elys es Bassano, There is a women whose names Maya in reception She is very slowly and agressive but the other personals are very sympatic , This hotel is near of the champ elleyes street So its in very centeral area
120893,Hotel Elys es Bassano, Carpet in the room should be progressively replaced smudge mattress too , Staff is great and breakfast fantastic from 6 30 which allows an early start 
120894,Hotel Elys es Bassano, Nothing , Food was excellent Staff were brilliant especially the young man who works on the reception in a morning Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to get away to Paris for a break Fantastic location and brilliant price to match it 10 10 
120895,Hotel Elys es Bassano, Room have charms and decent view but may be a bit small compared to US hotel chain standard I was in standard queen bed room , Great location near Champs Elys es subways train alma charming room bathroom just renovated great staff greet you by your name after just 1 day make you feel at home book a doctor appointment for me nice breakfast

120899,Hotel Elys es Bassano, Very Poor check in was horrible checking out was also horrible Person who checked us out tried to charge us extras for things we did not get The rooms were barely cleaned Just the bed and bathrooms , The property was in an alright location Quite the uphill walk from the Champs Elysees 
120900,Hotel Elys es Bassano, Phonic insulation of the rooms is very poor you can hear the water pouring in the other rooms bathrooms or the doors closing very disturbing early morning ,No Positive
120901,Hotel Elys es Bassano, Rooms are too crammed and it is overrated for a 4 hotel We could also hear conversations and other sounds emitting from the neighbouring rooms which was a nuisance Rooms also are in need of a maintenance brush up , Very friendly staff and centrally located hotel
120902,Hotel Elys es Bassano, Couldn t think of anything, Wonderful hotel near the Arc de Triomphe rather large room with a very comfortable bed bathroom with full amenities and great breakfast selection
120903,Hotel Elys es Bassano, Very noisy fire doors They slam at all hours The property charges 35 if you do not return the plastic room card The cleaning staff uses the main elevator so you need to use the stairs even with suitcases in the morning Suprising details in a 4 property, The bed is very comfortable Sheets blankets very clean Loved being able to open the Windows to look out on the street
120904,Hotel Elys es Bassano, 1 The cleaning activity washing the glasses and withing the first two days done by the tall black woman 2 Not being installed the office software Excel Word on the laptop existing in the lobby 3 Not working of some electric power sockets in my staying room No 404 , 1 No smoking strategy 2 Highly politeness and hospitality of the personnel working in reception and restaurant 3 Applicable and accessible laptop and printer connected to internet network in the lobby 4 Locating near to Champs Elysees Avenue Eiffel tower and Etoile
120905,Hotel Elys es Bassano, The noise was awful especially the people above whose sexual activities kept us awake on 2 nights The single room 107 was a dark small creepy place with no proper window and certainly not worth the price paid , The staff were pleasant and helpful 
120906,Hotel Elys es Bassano, Small and dangerous stairs one could trip Not a large enough elevator to carry luggage if more than one luggage bag Small breakfast area , Cute hotel cleanliness was good Shower area was in the bath tub the washroom would get all wet due to that Ample sized room and good service otherwise Friendly staff 
120907,Hotel Elys es Bassano, It s easy that you could listen to your neighbor moves , Amazing location few steps aways from the champs elysee Nearby metro and bus stations The staff is friendly and cheerful The hotel is cozy and rooms are not that big The elevator is very small but fits the theme
120908,Hotel Elys es Bassano, It would have been ideal if they d had a bar , Location was good just minutes away from Arc de Triomphe Champs Elysees many shops and restaurants Room was well designed clean and comfortable Staff were very helpful and courteous We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel would stay there again 
120909,Hotel Elys es Bassano, The room was quite small and the view from the window was a shaft with another room on the other side It was also quite noisy with whiring air conditioning all night and the sounds of the showers and toilet above quite audible The was also loads of hammering and drilling in the morning which wasn t good , The location was excellent just a 5 minute walk from the Arc Du Triumph The staff were friendly enough and the room was nice enough 
120910,Hotel Elys es Bassano, I was charged 9 Euros for the minibar charges incurred on the 1st night of our 5 night stay at this hotel We were charged for a bottle water chocolate Now onto the best part we did not even know that a minibar exists within the room Apparently it is hidden under the work table which we rarely use I was told of this minibar charge while checking out on our last day and 5 minutes away frm our ride to the airport I told our receptionist that we did not consume anything within the minibar especially since we did not even know that it exists The receptionist opened the log and insists that we must have taken the items from the minibar In order to save time and effort I slept for 3 hous the night before we had a morning flight I paid the 9 Euro for something we did not consume At the end of the day it is not the amount that counts but the way we were charged for something we did not consume Be it 9 90 or 900 Euro this most certainly left a bad taste in my mouth for the hotel I have asked the receptionist to re confirm with his staff about the minibar and hope that the management can respond here about this matter , Location is close to Champs Elys es staff were friendly and rating did not fully reflect staff friendliness but is due to a separate incident 
120911,Hotel Elys es Bassano, Room very small Elevator extremely small Claustrophic No security There were rowdy guests in the hotek making lots of niose in the early hours of the morning and there was no security to stop them , Front desk Alleson was good friendly and very helpful Other staff were so so

120919,Hotel Elys es Bassano, We were made to wait for 6 30 hours because they have a policy for check in at 3 pm so even though we arrived at the hotel at 8 am they did not give the room despite it being ready vacant After 5 hours the person at the reception told us that he can give a room earlier If we pay half price of 90 Euro I was with my old parents we were made to wait from 8 am to 3 pm before he gave us the rooms This was despite me booking the higher category of Deluxe class rooms The gentleman at the reception was most curt with a care a damn attitude The afternoon shift lady was very sweet helpful when it came to giving local tips on sightseeing etc The Normal rooms are very dark n dingy and tiny but do have the basic amenities in the room bathrooms Overall if you can walk a bit 10 mins or so everything is within reach for comfort sightseeing etc If you re looking for a comfortable luxurious place for the kind of money that you pay then this place is definitely not for you Overall, Location was good Eating places bakeries grocery store at stones throw
