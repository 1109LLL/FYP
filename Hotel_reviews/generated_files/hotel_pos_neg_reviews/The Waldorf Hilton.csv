266314,The Waldorf Hilton, Room not ready on arrival at 3pm which inconvenienced our plans that afternoon we were given a free breakfast as compensation With regard to breakfast service was poor eg tables were not cleared and we had to move plates etc so that we could finish the meal, For the money it was average
266315,The Waldorf Hilton, Our room on 7th floor was Small with only porthole window Only 3 lifts with only two working throughout our stay and the other two very slow and could only hold 8 and that s without luggage Not good , Location great Staff friendly 
266316,The Waldorf Hilton, despite having sent details weeks before arrival it took far too long to get us the sort of room we asked for so we had a very long wait after all our travel before we could actually settle in , very helpful and friendly staff lovely food good location 
266317,The Waldorf Hilton, The fire alarm went off at 3 30 in the morning and we had to evacuate the building The staff input during this time was non existent However I have complained about this to the hotel and feel like they have taken onboard the problems and plan to ensure future evacuations run more smoothly , Fantastic location for Covent Garden The staff are courteous and helpful The facilities are what you would expect and the bedrooms are comfortable with everything you need 
266318,The Waldorf Hilton, management not helpful with our problem breakfast far too expensive when all trays were empty no bread to toast had to wait for hot drinks, staff on front desk was the only good thing regarding this hotel
266319,The Waldorf Hilton, Quite disappointed in the staff Breakfast not all The breakfast set up was poor and cold Had better at less reputable venues didn t inspire us to eat there for evening meal , The Location 
266320,The Waldorf Hilton, service in the restaurant not as expected been offered upgrade on next stay , the location to the theatre was excellent the room was very comfortable and spacious the staff were helpful and friendly
266321,The Waldorf Hilton, Very minor the bin in our bathroom contained the previous guest s rubbish Quickly rectified , Full marks for the doormen and the staff in the exec lounge for their treatment of our seven year old grand daughter Swimming pool a bonus 
266322,The Waldorf Hilton, The pool closes at 5pm on a Saturday and doesn t open till 10am on Sundays As I arrived at 6pm and left at 9 30am the next day I was unable to use it when I made the booking I wasn t aware of this and it certainly wasn t clear Most disappointed as this is one of the main reasons why I chose this hotel , The room was comfortable the staff amazingly friendly and helpful fantastic location 
266323,The Waldorf Hilton, Bed was on small size Understaffed in breakfast Sunday AM , Room was comfortable although on the small side and air conditioning good Bathroom good cleanliness good and staff friendly 
266324,The Waldorf Hilton, The only thing that might have been better was that the room was not ready when we got there However this was totally understandable since they had a huge wedding going on and we suspect a lot of the guests didn t leave their rooms on time They offered us a complimentary drink whilst we waited The wait was not too long , We didn t avail ourselves too much for breakfast as we were having an early lunch However the display was excellent and pretty much anything was available We were particularly impressed with the overt friendliness of all of the staff who couldn t do enough for us Really makes the cost of such an hotel worthwhile 
266325,The Waldorf Hilton, This is a basic Hilton disguised as a 5 star hotel behind a prestigious name Inside the hotel is very average and facilities pretty basic One or two staff had a very good attitude and this was mostly in Reception door staff and porters Breakfast is a disaster and not worth paying for , The entranceway before the lobby
266326,The Waldorf Hilton, A waiter shouting at us Saying we didn t pay a drinks bill It was very embarrassing Because we had payed Told one of the staff but heard no more about it and not even a complementary drink , Rooms where nice and clean 
266327,The Waldorf Hilton, Nothing other than an air con failure meant that we had to take a different room , Location being close to theatreland and restaurants Breakfast and executive lounge stood out 
266328,The Waldorf Hilton, The only negative was the bathroom did not have any cold water both the hot and cold tap had hot water coming out of them Very strange , Location was fantastic Hotel staff were wonderful and room was great We will be back for out next theatre break 
266329,The Waldorf Hilton, Had to wait an hour after the advertised check in time for our room even though we paid an additional 100 to upgrade when we arrived , Very friendly staff and extremely comfortable bed 
266330,The Waldorf Hilton, Air con wasn t quite powerful enough for the unusual London heat, Perfect location especially for Covent Garden shops and theatres Luxury hotel with great staff helpful friendly and remember your name 
266331,The Waldorf Hilton, The central air conditioning of the hotel is ridiculous The only cool place of the entire hotel is the breakfast room The lounge is more or less However corridors and rooms are above the acceptable temperature And there is no way to correct that We even changed rooms because the first one was so hot we were sweating by just standing inside the room It seemed like a dry sauna The other one was a little better but still way to hot above 25 degree Celsius with the AC set to maximum , The best thing about this hotel is it s location It s close in the middle of London s life day or night Breakfast is good gym and pool are awesome The staff is very friendly and room amenities above average The room is cleaned once a day and checked at least twice for anything that might be missing 
266332,The Waldorf Hilton, I had requested a bowl of fruit in the room and some pink roses for which we expected too pay It was my husband 70th birthday and our 30th wedding anniversary Disappointed that they were not there Did not bother too say anything ,No Positive
266333,The Waldorf Hilton, Felt there could have been a little more hot food choice for breakfast kids especially wanted hash browns or saut potatoes , Booking an Executive room was genius as room wasn t quite ready and they made us very comfortable in the lounge while we waited Staff were brilliant Great room fab view over Aldwych Superb location for theatres and Covent Garden 
266334,The Waldorf Hilton, The whole experience was top notch The staff were particularly friendly and helpful The hotel is beautiful and clean it formed part of a very special 18th birthday present for my niece and I ,No Positive
266335,The Waldorf Hilton, The room was very hot air con was useless which considering I d paid for a junior suite was very poor Also we ordered room service the burger I had was very bland no taste the bun was stale and the chips soggy My daughter had the children s burger and was equally as poor Really very poor for a hotel supposedly of this class , Hotel was very close to the theatre so was ideal for my daughter and myself Reception and staff very friendly 
266336,The Waldorf Hilton, Wasn t aware I had only paid a deposit and when I checked out I got asked to pay an extra 50 for the room that I wasn t particularly happy about and when I checked my emails from you there was nothing in them that the money I had paid was only a deposit and I d be charged more for it ,No Positive
266337,The Waldorf Hilton, Breakfast was awful they had run out of toast orange juice and half of the dishes were empty Room was tiny and classed as an executive room very small window looking onto kitchen vents, Location was good
266338,The Waldorf Hilton,No Negative, To be fair we didn t have a lot of time at the hotel I liked the bedroom 1930 s style it was large and comfortable It is in a great location and suited our needs perfectly We went to the bar after the theatre it had a smooth ambience but the drinks were expensive compared to Babylon Kensington Roof Gardens In order to make use of some of the facilities I to planned to go for a swim before breakfast but found the pool wasn t open until 10 00 am disappointing We didn t have the executive lounge explained to us so have no idea what that was all about but can be found on floor E via the lift A pleasant enough stay but will probably try another hotel in the vicinity next time 
266339,The Waldorf Hilton, Curtains let in too much light Breakfast was good but took time to replenish items so didn t always have choices available Not told about omelette station chef operating it was not personable , Location for theatre was great room was comfortable 
266340,The Waldorf Hilton, What s not to like , All of the comforts which came with the room helped make the stay so enjoyable Staff were very attentive pleasant and helpful at all times The bed was extra inviting with a topper mattress 
266341,The Waldorf Hilton, The so called free Wi Fi It was free if you were a member of HHonors which I am not or if you paid 13 pounds day I stayed in many other locations in London and in Hilton hotels in other countries This is the first time I heard of free Wi Fi with a daily payment There was supposed to be a newspaper delivered to my room but only in the morning of my departure did I observed the said papers in the hallway next to the elevator free for anyone to take one The minibar could not be opened but there was also a note of warning that if anything is moved from the minibar I ll have to pay for it so I left it well alone , Very good breakfast The location was also very good for me as I had a hearing term at the nearby High Court 
266342,The Waldorf Hilton, Breakfast on the Saturday morning was a shambles We were in the dining room at 7 05am not many people in at that time we did not get a drink until 7 35am and my order for Smoked Haddock and Poached Egg did not arrive until 8 15am that was after chasing up the staff about it In fairness the manager appeared to have no staff and when some did come on duty they did not know what they were doing The second day of our stay for breakfast was great and we were looked after very well We were however overcharged for the Fish Meal on both days when we came to pay our bill in that the Extra Charge for the fish was stated on the menu as being 9 00 but only 6 00 if you were on a Breakfast Inclusive Rate which we were The overcharge was adjusted and taken off out bill , As this was a Special Occasion for my wife and I the hotel Management very kindly left a gift and a cake in our room which we both very much appreciated
266343,The Waldorf Hilton, Bathroom less dusty and a bit cleaner would be good air conditioning not working although changed to another room with good air conditioning but a constant machinery drone In the second room shower leaked water over the side of bath On the whole not that great I suspect living on past history of the name , The staff were very nice everything else was very average
266344,The Waldorf Hilton, The seating area at the front of the hotel could do with brightening up Looks a bit jaded, Friendly staff Art Deco dining room Spacious bedroom Close proximity to theatres Lovely beds and pillows Quiet room Doormen in pinstripes and bowler hats We re very nice
266345,The Waldorf Hilton, I was initially put in room 412 which stank of cigarette smoke and had no mattress topper so the bed was extremely hard It also had an odd layout Staff quickly moved me to 325 which was much better but unfortunately the bath wasn t clean with a layer of black mould all the way around the edge under the marble clearly hadn t been thoroughly cleaned in a while Also no free water in the rooms it s only available to certain Hilton Honors guests which is a shame as a lot of hotels I stay at do offer this , Wifi was very good a good strong signal with no drop outs the breakfast was excellent as were the staff who were very attentive The night light in the rooms is a nice feature too so if you have to get up in the night you don t get blinded by the main lights 
266346,The Waldorf Hilton, Room was very warm and air conditioning did not work, The staff were attentive fantastic pool and gym in heart of city Excellent food and comfortable bed
266347,The Waldorf Hilton, Breakfast finishing at 10am seems early Complementary water in room would have been appreciated Tea coffee in room were too basic Nespresso machine , Lovely staff Very attentive and friendly Beds were comfortable and good linen 
266348,The Waldorf Hilton, They put us in the wrong room not what we had reserved They did make it right but we were tired from travelling and it was inconvenient having to advocate to get moved to the correct room , The doormen the concierge and the front desk personnel were wonderful 
266349,The Waldorf Hilton, no cold water from either tap in bathroom sink toilet bowl was all cracked Biggest issue however was being down double the cost when I got home No explanation that when checking in pending debit was placed on my card which isn t immediately cancelled when checking out and paying in full Means you are in effect without twice the cost for 3 5 days until Hilton cancel the original debit , comfortable bed room well presented friendly staff
266350,The Waldorf Hilton, Bathroom was large but despite paying for an upgrade the shower was in the bath This would not have been too bad but the bath was so high I was unable to get in and out of it without Partner s assistance Asked for candle wax to be removed from bedside chest on the first day it was still there when we left a week later There did not appear to have been any dusting done on the days we had room service The furniture was shabby We must have had the best outlook in London over nothing but service ducting high walls and the smell of bacon pervading our room Maybe use another booking agent next time , The fabrics in the room were quality and the room was quietly located as per our request The public areas were spotless Most staff were excellent but Zuzanna in the Bar was exceptional she was so professional and charming We would return if only for a drink just to see her The gentleman pianist was a joy to listen to Food was 50 50 in the bar but room service food was excellent although an extra 5 on an already 12 5 service charge was unnecessary 
266351,The Waldorf Hilton,No Negative, We were treated like princesses and all our advance requests had been meet on our arrival Having worked there 30 years ago it was super to take my daughters there to celebrate the youngest 18th Thank you
266352,The Waldorf Hilton, Accessibility for wheelchair users in the public areas was very limited the Executive Lounge was extremely difficult to traverse with tightly packed tables and chairs it would be impossible for a wheelchair user alone to make use of the buffet style layout in the Executive Lounge and the mini lift in the lobby was temperamental at best , The Executive package was very good value for money The King Executive room and bathroom in particular was very well appointed with sufficient space to access most of the room while in a wheelchair 
266353,The Waldorf Hilton, But embarrassing as we were given keys to an executive room and in entering there was obvious signs that someone was already using the room Of course we quickly exited and informed reception we were given a free drink for the mistake , Room was lovely as was the staff they were very helpful Hotel was right where we wanted to be 
266354,The Waldorf Hilton, The wellness centre area is in a poor state of repair with bits of card board taped to the walls to cover up some problems The area around the pool needs repainted as there is a lot of rusty bits The changing rooms did not have nice toiletry dispensers or products which I would normally expect from this sort of hotel they were clean though , The hotel was lovely and quiet we were on the seventh floor so potentially a long way from any of the general hotel noises 
266355,The Waldorf Hilton, Check in was supposed to be 3pm but we were kept waiting until 3 40pm until our room was ready Unimpressed about that but we were given complimentary drinks so Redeemed , Lovely room comfortable beds clean bathroom with luscious towels Lovely breakfast pleasant staff throughout the hotel Overall very pleased with out stay x
266356,The Waldorf Hilton, We only had breakfast but the food was a bit mass produced i e Just average What was poor was the staff were not very helpful and you had to chase them down if you wanted tea or coffee , The check in staff were very friendly and welcoming 
266357,The Waldorf Hilton, My mothers only quarrell was that she couldn t live there for the rest of her days , I booked this for my mother s 60th birthday as it has been a dream for her to stay here Absolutely fantastic staff The bar staff were lovely enough to prepare a birthday cake AND the hotel reception staff did aswell as a a surprise for her in the room I cannot thank the staff enough and although I was unable to stay myself my mother was looked after impeccably and the breakfast did the trick after her lively night at kinkyboots followed by prossecco at the hotel bar again absolutely thrilled with the whole evening 
266358,The Waldorf Hilton, For us everything was good as we were only at the hotel for one night No issues , We wanted to stay close to Covent Garden as we were only staying one night and the location was excellent Staff were really friendly and nothing was too much trouble Great selection at Breakfast Did not use the hotel restaurant for dinner as we had reservations at a Restaurant in Covent Garden 
266359,The Waldorf Hilton, I arrived early around 11AM but the staff didn t give me a room till 3 4PM They were willing to upgrade me for an extra fee per day and give me a room early , The hotel s location is great Walking distance to underground 
266360,The Waldorf Hilton, Spent some time in the bar fairly small but comfortable disappointed in the slow response by bar staff more interested in chatting to themselves had to walk up to ask if they were serving , very helpful staff at arrival early check in very helpful staff throughout the stay 
266361,The Waldorf Hilton, We had breakfast booked but they charged us as it was only booked in executive lounge Not informed we couldn t use normal dining area Very disappointing considering the price wont stop there again as they didn t want to know , Location
266362,The Waldorf Hilton, Mini bar prices but I suppose this is a given , Evening meal in homage restaurant was perfect delicious Waitress in restaurant really attentive polite couldn t wish for better service Staff in general friendly helpful Good selection of food for breakfast Perfect location for theatres etc Lovely little touch on Good Friday and finding some lovely little exquisite cakes waiting for us on return to room 
266363,The Waldorf Hilton, No comment as couldn t find anything we didn t like about the hotel, Waldorf is central to everything Always clean and rooms given are excellent 3 of us in one room and still space left to manoeuvre Breakfasts are excellent Didn t have an evening meal there 
266364,The Waldorf Hilton, Nothing to complain about, Accomadation fab as had a junior suite Location is wonderful and near for everything Amazing food and executive room for afternoon rea was lovely Staff around the hotel kind and courteous
266365,The Waldorf Hilton, Internet slow in the room but excellent in the bar lobby, Location is fantastic close to Covent Garden and Soho with all the nice shops and restaurants The gym has everything and works excellent The bar and the lobby is enjoyable In the general the staff was very helpful and service minded 
266366,The Waldorf Hilton, The first room we were allocated 611 had a dreadful smell as soon as we entered When we requested to move it became obvious that staff were aware that this is an issue with this room so why allocate it The second room we were given had a problem with the air conditioning hottest weekend of the year so far so finally we were given a room that we would expect from the Waldorf by this time it was after 4 30pm so the start of our weekend was spoiled , The main areas of the hotel were lovely and breakfast was very good 
266367,The Waldorf Hilton, Too expensive for what you get Room was very old fashioned Pool and gym area were dirty looking and a bit disgusting Very strange route through public gym to get to swimming pool which was not as nice as the photos Gym and pool area smelled like sweat and pool was over chlorinated , Fantastic location but ridiculously expensive for what you get Standard enough 4 star hotel for the price of a top 5 star hotel 
266368,The Waldorf Hilton, The phone in the room switched on about 7 am and was very very bright Had to put a towel over it to cut out the light, Location of hotel Bathroom
266369,The Waldorf Hilton, Couldnt check into until quarter to 5 We were going out at 5 and had no chance to shower and change Not good enough for nearly 800 for 1 night No room in bar at end of evening to have a drink ,No Positive
266370,The Waldorf Hilton, Broken loo seat in room, Monty on reception was fabulous Helpful efficient friendly and made us laugh Great personality and a real asset to the hotel 
266371,The Waldorf Hilton, Some of the furniture in the lounge and cocktail bar has seen better days For a 5 star hotel my daughter was disappointed how tatty some of the chairs were , Excellent breakfast and very friendly staff 
266372,The Waldorf Hilton, Room was not made up one day We had to request this late in the afternoon Room was very warm Difficult to get a comfortable temperature Shower screen door leaked badly , Location Door staff most helpful 
266373,The Waldorf Hilton, Bed was hard Paint on the ceiling in the shower peeling off Pubic hair found on shower floor Toilet roll ran out as there was no spare Only one flannel supplied for two people Room safe worked intermittently Couldn t open mini bar at first Duvet was inside out Bedding was supposed to be changed every third day but it wasn t Charged 50 per night extra just in case which we weren t informed about until we found money debited from account took 3 days to refund us Thought bedroom was going to be more plush than it was Premier Inns are much better value for money to be honest , Staff were great Very friendly and helpful Good location for eating out local Tesco Express and public transport Afternoon Tea was a lovely experience 
266374,The Waldorf Hilton, The room wasn t ready when we arrived as they weren t expecting 3 guests despite the confirmation detailing this The extra bed was uncomfortable The room was small not as adverised picture for executive room The bathroom had the most terrible odour We had to ask for extra cup saucer towel etc for third guest Some food items at breakfast were cold and the fried eggs like rubber On the whole very disappointed considering the price won t stay here again , Location was great Breakfast choice was good Staff were helpful very pleasant
266375,The Waldorf Hilton, I guess I could have asked for a change but the pillows were too soft and there weren t any others in the room Very minor dislike , Room was spacious and had excellent facilities Gym was a pleasant surprise Late check out was great too All staff I spoke to were extremely helpful and often very friendly 
266376,The Waldorf Hilton, Rooms were small and decor dated Smelled musty shower stall dirty fingerprints on white doors dirty marks on upholstery Very poor housekeeping bin in room not emptied a poor display for quite an expensive hotel , Great location close to theatres bars restaurants and shops Comfy bed good shower 
266377,The Waldorf Hilton, The breakfast buffet was barely above average Food poorly cooked and presented Expected more quality Only two lifts working all weekend and the sauna and steam room were out of order , We liked the friendliness of the staff 
266378,The Waldorf Hilton, The lifts seemed to be a problem with a lot of guests moaning about them being used by staff and having to wait , Friendly and helpful staff especially the front desk 
266379,The Waldorf Hilton, Only two of the three lifts were working meaning delay The breakfast choice in their executive lounge was limited to scrambled eggs only Disappointing , Excellent and great staff
266380,The Waldorf Hilton, Breakfast both days in executive lounge cold left the table to obtain more food table cleared No facility for residence to sit and relax as bar area very busy at all times Executive lounge closing at 8 30 Facilities in room not replenished so no tea , Location With junior suite access to a executive lounge Room size 
266381,The Waldorf Hilton,No Negative, The bed and pillows were the most comfortable I ve ever had in a hotel We wish we d had time to use the swimming pool The staff were superb and very helpful friendly We loved our stay and will hopefully stay there in the future 
266382,The Waldorf Hilton, The temperature of the room was on the cool side of comfortable and we were unable to figure out how the controller worked We also didn t like the window in the ceiling which didn t appear to have a blind , Bed linen towels bathrobes and toiletries were all excellent quality Also the mobile phone in the room for our personal use was an unexpected bonus 
266383,The Waldorf Hilton, Our room was near the lifts but i didn t complain I thought about it but There was no noise so all was good I think if I have requested another room one would have been made available, The location was perfect for the things we planned to do and an open top tour bus stopped right outside All the hotel staff we spoke with were friendly and helpful this made us enjoy our stay more
266384,The Waldorf Hilton, A little over priced in my opinion although it is the west end so maybe I m just nit picking The view from the room was poor as we were off the road but who wants to look out of the window all day , Does exactly what it says on the tin friendly staff brilliant location for theatres restaurants etc room was clean and well decorated and the breakfast was very good for a buffet 
266385,The Waldorf Hilton, Breakfast was disappointing for the price First breakfast the eggs were too over cooked to eat Second day i ordered poached eggs which were amazing but had to wait ages for sausages bacon beans In fact waited doling that the food on our plates was cold by the time we sat down Nobody offered us a hot drink on three seperate occasions either myself or my partner had to find staff to ask for a hot drink disappointing when you think how much it costs Lifts were incredibly slow too , Staff made us feel very welcome were excellent with customer service Beautiful hotel lovely location Bathroom was beautiful Bed was sooo comfy 
266386,The Waldorf Hilton, rooms were poor lifts were a nightmare couldn t get a seat in the bar most of the time as it was generally full and the reception was poor , location
266387,The Waldorf Hilton, Perhaps we should have asked for a walk in shower as my sister has difficulty getting in and out of a bath , The breakfast was excellent The whole experience of our stay was excellent 
266388,The Waldorf Hilton, Room was a little tired in places e g flaked chipped paint broken handle on safe Same with the indoor pool , The bed was super comfy Staff all really friendly warm and professional Incredible location Fantastic building and looks spectacular at night The d cor is sumptuous Good quality champagne and tea 
266389,The Waldorf Hilton, The pool closes at 7 30pm I don t understand this Most people would not be able to reach the hotel by that time whether from work or sightseeing Seems like a waist The locker rooms and pool facilites are in desperate need of refurbishment Another thing I was in a business meeting the last day and had to check out a few hours later than usual Well the hotel staff kept calling the room non stop where my adolescent kids were waiting for me to come back I am sorry I call this harrassment Meanwhile there are literally hundreds of rooms in this hotel At the end they did not hesitate to charge me the late check out fee despite the fact that they made those 2 extra hours absolutely unbearable for my children The general manager of this hotel has not heard the last of me Finally I booked partly because there is an executive lounge where you could get breakfast afternoon tea and snacks Well the staff in the lounge is really unhelpful You have to get your own everything There is very little food All in all it s a good idea that is poorly executed , The location of this hotel is really excellent for Soho and Covent gardens It s a very impressive building The hotel in enormous 
266390,The Waldorf Hilton, I would have liked a better view we looked out to a brick wall and big air conditioning units The room was lovely so we just drew the curtains , The hotel was very relaxing the staff were very polite an friendly and we were always greeted with a smile 
266391,The Waldorf Hilton,No Negative, The staff were all very welcoming efficient the room was spotless had a good selection of toiletries The bed was very comfortable the breakfast was plentiful had a very good selection 
266392,The Waldorf Hilton, I booked a Junior suite at the highest level The sofa in the room was disgusting It looked like they picked it up off the street on junk night and put is in a room It was badly stained and torn Service was poor We put out our breakfast card and called room service the evening before and they never sent breakfast so we had to call it in the next morning Then they left breakfast trays with food on it outside of our door until very late at night We actually had to step over it to get into our room There was a musty smell in the room After I complained about all of these things they sent me a bottle of wine I did not drink it instead I left it there I rather not post this instead I want an accommodation on my bill , The location was fine and the concierge staff was accommodating The gym connected to the hotel was quite nice 
266393,The Waldorf Hilton, room service took45 minutes than promised I had to call twice to remind them when finally it arrived they spilled the wine over the food left the food dripping in the red wine in the room without a fork or a knife and promised to be back with another glass of wine which took another 45 minutes food got cold they took it with them they would not charge me but in the morning I got to pay the bill anyway I paid the bill anyway after a discussion with the manager who asked me if he needed to take it off the bill never again Poor service and bad management ,No Positive
266394,The Waldorf Hilton, Breakfast was appalling Queue to get in We were seated at a dirty table with last guests dishes I had to ask for the food on the floor to be cleared AFTER our table had been tended to The food was poor cold stale and greasy Bacon was all fat Many of the items were not in the Marie bains so not available after queuing , Location Doormen There was a lovely smell in the general areas too
266395,The Waldorf Hilton, Being sat by the wine cellar at dinner We were having an intimate anniversary dinner Every time the door was opened in felt the cold Being so close to it the staff disturbed us each time they bustled past ,No Positive
266396,The Waldorf Hilton, N A, Beautiful hotel right in the heart of theatre land perfect place to stay for a weekend in town Staff very professional excellent customer service 
266397,The Waldorf Hilton, Having to ask several times for tea at breakfast and on one morning were almost finished breakfast when our tea arrived followed by a second serving, The hotel was excellent very comfortable and the staff were very friendly and helpful
266398,The Waldorf Hilton, we had a room for 3 adults and we had a kingsize bed and a bed a for a child so it was uncomfortable and we spoke to the reception staff and they could only offer that next time we book we ask for a sofa bed so we were very disappointed on the sleeping accommodation and thought we should have had a reduction in the rate of the room, the location
266399,The Waldorf Hilton, Bed was too hard We were upgraded to a queen deluxe room but it was what we had expected from the queen superior we had booked according to the photos , Excellent location We were able to check in earlier Staff friendly and helpful
266400,The Waldorf Hilton, Awful bed very poor quality for this standard hotel Had several room changes before we were upgraded Awful rooms prior to that This will have been 5th visit and never experienced such low rate rooms and 3 4 beds Also definate dererioration on prior visits Absent when we arrived they were inside no one rushed to grab our bags when we arrived And same on exit although did olidge when asked Perhaps thet were bust, Friendly reception staff Building is beautiful
266401,The Waldorf Hilton, the hotel was perfect but our stay was ruined by very loud parties in the function room below our hotel room on the two nights we stayed there would have moved hotels if we could afford to ,No Positive
266402,The Waldorf Hilton, I liked everything about the hotel It was a little on the pricey side but this is to be expected in the centre of London , The location of this hotel should you visit for a theatre break or to visit the different landmarks is great 
266403,The Waldorf Hilton, I didn t like the fact someone at reception blamed me for my room key card not working and received no apology I found this member of staff very Rude I also didn t think some of the dining room staff very nice Rude and no smile However alot of the staff were very nice and helpful with smiles on their faces , I liked the welcome at reception and it was a quick check in with a free upgrade of our room The room was very clean and the bed was very comfy 
266404,The Waldorf Hilton, We had to vacate our room at around 4am due to their being an infestation of mice We had a mouse helping itself to the contents of our waste paper basket Staff were very unhelpful although they moved us to a new room sadly the new room was not up to the standard we were expecting Breakfast was a disaster cold food dirty glassware and we did not even receive a cup of tea On leaving staff were rude and unhelpful they saw us struggling down the steps with our bags and simply walked straight past , The welcome from the staff was lovely couldn t fault our room at the beginning it was very clean and was as the pictures showed 
266405,The Waldorf Hilton, Service was variable especially in the Homage restraunt The lobby bar area leading to Good Godfrey s bar was cold and therefore not compfortble It s not the Waldorf I remember , Location excellent for theatres Well furnished room although the heated towel rail did not work The meeting and greeting was good and the recption staff were very willing to offer help 
266406,The Waldorf Hilton,No Negative, The PERFECT breakfast could not wish for anything more Superfriendly staff with an amazing eye for detail Delightfull throughout in what has been for over a decade my favourite neighbourhood in London PS I ld booked a short trip to celibrate my 30th birthday and was surprised and touched to find a complimentary piece of chocolate birthdaycake in my room upon returning from a shoppingspree 
266407,The Waldorf Hilton, Air con A vacuum caused a loud noise in my room 603 when someone in the next room closed a door the issue remained unresolved , Friendly helpful staff 
266408,The Waldorf Hilton, Breakfast in executive lounge would have been perfect if table orders fresh cooked from kitchen rather than buffet Paid for upgrade so little disappointed not to have that service , Location and friendly staff lifted this hotel above the norm 
266409,The Waldorf Hilton, Arrived around 10pm was unable to check in straight away as the line of people was too long and we had to be somewhere else so was able to leave bags and came back about 5 30 however still very large line of people checking in not sure what the problem was Found the same thing checking out , Good location the staff was very friendly and helpful 
266410,The Waldorf Hilton,No Negative, Everything great weekend at this hotel from the minute the doorman opened the taxi door great location staff more than helpful facilities excellent 
266411,The Waldorf Hilton, The check in Room was not ready at check in time , Upgraded to a superior room Great location to see the shows i e Beautiful Mamamia The Lion King and plenty of restaurants to choose from One of the best breakfasts my husband and I have had in a long time 
266412,The Waldorf Hilton, Hotel s lack of customer focus Wi fi was not free the only hotel I have have stayed where this is the case Had to queue for everything including check in also for breakfast nearly 10 mins then had to queue to check out , Excellent location for theatres around Strand and Drury Lane 
266413,The Waldorf Hilton, I booked an executive room it was disappointingly small did not have a window and felt like a cell , Valet parking Great welcome and friendly staff 
266414,The Waldorf Hilton, The breakfast was poor Scrambled eggs past their best bacon cold No semi skimmed milk Being charged for wifi was poor on top of paying over 300 for B B, The suite was lovely very comfortable and private 
266415,The Waldorf Hilton, the hotel is in poor shape We dont expect to have to pay for wifi when paying so much for a club room The club facilities are dreadful and unusable for business as so many children running around we wont be back, the location
266416,The Waldorf Hilton,No Negative, The large comfortable bed gave us an excellent night s sleep and the air con was a boon even on a winter s day Great bathroom with very useful magnified make up mirror although the loo seat was loose Wonderful breakfast with lots of options 
266417,The Waldorf Hilton, Scones at the afternoon tea were just a little dry Still very tasty but could have been fresher , We took the upgrade for larger suite and to use the business lounge for breakfast afternoon tea evening canopes and drinks which we enjoyed and is great value for money I liked that there was TV in the bathroom in our suite Plenty of space clean and comfy beds Great stay in a convenient location for the theatre 
266418,The Waldorf Hilton, We found rubbish from mini bar in our wardrobe it was hidden but still needed reporting Once we did report it the staff were immediately responsive and apologetic and it was immediately rectified We were compensated with 2 vouchers for complimentary drinks at the bar which we were happy with , Appreciated being able to access room early as requested on arrival Reception staff were very polite helpful and friendly as well as concierge porters 
266419,The Waldorf Hilton, Service in the bar was a little slow and the piano was covered in dust , Good size room and freshly cooked food Beautiful building with a lovely atmosphere Reception staff very helpful and friendly 
266420,The Waldorf Hilton, We were disturbed three times by housekeeping knocking on our door in the morning which was very annoying as we were trying to have a lie in , i liked everything about this hotel and will definitely book it again The staff were welcoming helpful the room although a little smaller than I expected was very comfortable with a lovely bathroom The location was excellent being very close to Covent Garden which was perfect for our trip 
266421,The Waldorf Hilton, Room had not been properly cleaned Padded headboard was ripped Decor a little tired in dining room, The location of the hotel was perfect for the theatres Rooms were comfortable and bed was comfortable 
266422,The Waldorf Hilton, Our room was not ready so we paid a lot of money for an upgrade The staff member was so keen to sell us the upgrade he forgot to take responsibility for delivering our luggage which took 3 hours to reach our room having chased it Because we booked through you we didn t get our Hilton Honours points , Some staff were outstanding especially Sonny 
266423,The Waldorf Hilton, When we arrived there was no electric so we could not get to our rooms until after 6pm My husband had flown in from Hong Kong and just wanted a shower and to relax We were going out in the evening with friends and we had a table booked in London for 7 15pm so this gave us very little time to get ready Also the next day we had friends who met us downstairs where We all ordered lunch from the menu Our friends food arrived but ours never did We were told the cheese we had ordered was still frozen so we ordered again We waited 20 minutes and in fact had to leave as we had theatre tickets and would be late if we waited any longer The room was disappointing as it was very small , All the staff were very friendly and accommodating
266424,The Waldorf Hilton, Breakfast was disappointing had to queue for a table waiting approximately ten minutes and food was lukewarm We expected waiter service with a choice of hot breakfast menu but it was all self service , Fab location for the West end shopping and theatre just around the corner Beds are very comfy and rooms are excellent 
266425,The Waldorf Hilton, No way to fill the iron for steam press except using the teapot Gym well fitted lovely pool but connecting tunnels need renovating and showers need overhaul Breakfast OK but nothing special Overall not worth the price , Bedroom was well fitted with desk chair armchair as well as iron board along with usual tea tray hair dryer 
266426,The Waldorf Hilton, Over priced At night e were disturbed by a rat in our room on 5th floor it made a hole on our back pack bag We were moved to another smaller deluxe room due to high occupancy during our year end stay although we were asked to pay at the room rate of that smaller deluxe room Breakfast is expensive at 22 , Location is good walking distance to London theaters Very helpful concierge 
266427,The Waldorf Hilton, Poor executive room service and toiletries No fruit in rooms inadequate supplies of basics such as water executive lounge servings appalling for the Waldorf so the afternoon tea was of substandard to that offered elsewhere in hotel the executive lounge too small for the numbers so barely used it Evening canap s were a joke and furniture was dirty Hotel looked tired overall with unkempt torn and broken furniture Executive junior suite booked as supposed to have separate sitting area and broken sofa stuck at end of bed in one large room Room service was diabolical uncooked fish of which my son ate some before asking me and uncooked partially frozen fries five fat ones served 1 5 hours after order and once kitchen was closed so could not rectify and children and I went bed hungry as it was 11 45 pm when this happened Sent all back The response of hotel was flippant with we won t charge you for it Having asked defeather room found that hadn t been done so my son woke up face swollen either feather and or fish Overall disappointing stay for the cost especially since it was a treat for my son recovering from an accident Asked for late checkout as he not feeling well and told can have hour and extra as VIP wants our room This is immediately following them telling me they wouldn t charge for the room service that has poisoned my son who has diarrhoea and vomiting , Bed was comfortable staff friendly Christmas decorations great breakfast in restaurant was good 
266428,The Waldorf Hilton, Blood stained pillow Spare sofa bed had no sheets clean pillows or cases or cover Not well thought out at all The sofa bed Was dirty looking when opened out By the time we arrived back to our room 503 anfter the theatre and a drink st the bar It was so disappointing to see all of the above It was too late and we were too tired to sort it out So one of us kept on the floor Only two bath sheets when there was three of us staying Very disappointed Reception gave us a small 27 discount But we felt this was disrespectful having to Mae one of us sleep on the floor When in fact none of us had a comfortable night We ended up all trying to sleep in the same bed But as there were blood stained pillows found in the sofa bed we did not even have enough pillows, Location and atmosphere Helpful staff Especially reception and concierge Breakfast female was slightly miserable and not friendly
266429,The Waldorf Hilton, Queuing for Breakfast Buffet very disappointing not worth it after waiting 25 mins Do not expect such an experience from an iconic hotel like The Waldorf, If you want breakfast have room service
266430,The Waldorf Hilton, We booked an executive room with a turn down service which didn t happen on our first night It was sorted by reception on the second night We used the executive breakfast room for our first breakfast but it was short on choices We used the Homage breakfast room on the second day and it is far superior in every way If you have a choice DO NOT use the executive breakfast , The evening meal in the Homage Restaurant was absolutely excellent 
266431,The Waldorf Hilton, Bar overcrowded left as waited too long to be served rooms not ready until after 3pm, Room upgrade excellent large airy rooms with very comfortable beds
266432,The Waldorf Hilton, Only one lift working which impacted on length of time waiting for lift, Staff very helpful and friendly Staff delivered a surprise birthday cake to the room for member of our partybath robes in the room good quality bathing products in bathroom
266433,The Waldorf Hilton, When arriving I was told that I was upgraded to a bigger room It turned out the bigger room was a disabled one with a basin at the height of my knees and a shower which had a very uncomfortable flooring Also I was told credit card details are just taken for booking purposes but when I wanted to change the card to another one it turned out it was already charged to the first one and changing resulted in additional fees , The room was quite cold when I arrived obviously not used before but it heated up quite quickly and the bed was big and comfortable Also the room was quite big compared to other London hotel rooms with the downsize that it was a disability friendly one The location is nice just in the middle of the theater district 
266434,The Waldorf Hilton, Exec lounge could have been cleaner in the food and drinks area , Friendly over delivering staff Very helpful doormen Useful to have continental plug sockets in the room 
266435,The Waldorf Hilton, inroom tv to have better channels with update programe listings, the location of hotel perfect the room was new not tired as some hotels staff polite and professional
266436,The Waldorf Hilton,No Negative, The staff were friendly and helpful and even arranged a birthday surprise for my husband The room was small but elegant and had everything we needed and was plenty big enough for us The bathroom was lovely and really big We didn t eat at the hotel or use any other facilities so can t comment on these The location of the hotel was fantastic as we were easily able to explore both sides of the river We we would definitely stay here again 
266437,The Waldorf Hilton, The cleaning staff knocked on our door twice in the morning after we told them we were still sleeping , The room was great bathroom was the highlight for me I so looked forward to my bath in the morning rightly so It was very comfortable And reception staff were very polite 
266438,The Waldorf Hilton, No hot water to the bath in the morning though the shower water was still hot Evening meal was delicious but portions were very small , Lovely airy room comfy bed excellent staff proximity to the theatres excellent breakfast
266439,The Waldorf Hilton, On arrival I was given two vouchers for an evening meal as we were a running a little late in the day I thought this would be a good option to catch up on some time I called and booked a table for 18 00 thinking that 1 hr was ample time for dinner on entering the restaurant I made it clear that we had a show to attend and needed to be out of the restaurant by 19 00hrs and could we be quite hasty with the order We waited 10 minutes before our order was taken and the a further 25 minutes for our starter to arrive By the time the mains arrived we had no option but to rush our main course and skip having the dessert that we had paid for in the meal deal Breakfast was pretty poor for the standard of the hotel and the price we paid We waited 15 minutes for an offer of any hot drinks I approached a member of staff and requested a pot of tea for 2 and pointed out to where we were sitting I also asked if there was any salt and pepper as there was none on our table The lady was very pleasant and explained should deal with my request straight away We proceeded with collection of the breakfast items on show After a further 10 minutes with a cold breakfast in front ourselves A table of 4 was shown to their table not far from us and within a few seconds were propositioned as to what beverages they would like in the mean time we were still left with no tea or salt and pepper By the time I had got the jist of what was going on The gentleman supplying the beverages had turned around and walked off At this point I decided to hunt down the salt and pepper and my wife tracked down the person responsible to supply us with the drinks some 10 minutes later with my last fork full of breakfast in walks the lady with the items that I had originally requested The next morning at breakfast we were left hunting for cutlery and clean glasses for orange juice ,No Positive
266440,The Waldorf Hilton, Could not log onto the wi fi which we were led to believe would be free Very quick immediately to take 100 from credit card but will take 5 days to get back How does that work , The location was perfect the staff were polite and helpful although we did not require there assistance as were in the hotel very little 
266441,The Waldorf Hilton, Tired decor of room No lift to the floor I was on and this was not made clear at booking Room was pretty small overall square footage may be alright but it made poor use of the space Not sure had pure cold water as it was luke warm and may of been cause of mild stomach upset on two days , Good breakfast Friendly staff Good location 
266442,The Waldorf Hilton, Iron wasn t working in the room no umbrella in room as stated in guest book air con didn t really work only warm air and we wanted cold no reservation for dinner available even though we were residents and tried to book in advance lifts were very slow, Lovely comfortable room helpful staff lovely cocktails in bar decent breakfast
266443,The Waldorf Hilton, While it has one of the most beautiful ballroom restaurants in London the casual meeting areas on the ground floor are slightly disappointing , wonderful location lots of character 
266444,The Waldorf Hilton, Television was not good quality and remote didn t work though a replacement was sent to our room very quickly The bed was small and the pillows were lumpy and under filled We did not sleep well and this was a superior room One of the security personnel was extreme offensive stating that it was inappropriate for my partner to be in a particular room and even threatening to check out his identity Really out of order Breakfast not included despite high price , Mostly friendly staff but see minuses 
266445,The Waldorf Hilton, Breakfast was poor for 16 per head you had to do your own toast and get your own breakfast which was only luke warm also we had to park our own car although they told us they would park it,No Positive
266446,The Waldorf Hilton, The pool in the fitness suite is a bit small , Asked for something special as we were celebrating my mum s 60th birthday and they made sure that we had extra special treatment The staff are wonderful the room was really comfy and had the BEST tomato soup I ve ever had freshly made it was really comforting in my room after a long day 
266447,The Waldorf Hilton, Mattress Bed was not very comfortable view into centre courtyard was quite ugly drain pipes heat AC units but could have been improved with a higher rate room although we did have a nice room , Nicely updated decor clean room nice lounge excellent location close to theatre great restaurants and central for walking to many sightseeing attractions Friendly helpful professional staff 
266448,The Waldorf Hilton, No complaints Poached eggs were not soft enough but other than that thank you , Receptionist exceptional She felt the room we were to be offered was not a nice one so arranged for us to have a better room if we could come back in an hour We did It was lovely Very comfortable and quiet 
266449,The Waldorf Hilton, Nothing, Our room was lovely and the staff were efficient and very helpful our cases were placed in store and taken to our room when it was ready which was great as we didn t have long to get ready before we went to a show it doesn t feel like a Hilton the building is gorgeous I can t wait to visit again
266450,The Waldorf Hilton, Our room was next to the elevator and was quite noisy at times especially when large groups of people where waiting to use the elevator However this did not bother us to much and we were outside most of the time enjoying London , The location of the hotel was ideal for sightseeing shopping theatres etc around the west end of London all within walking distance Breakfast was very good with a large selection of fruit cakes croissants breads cooked meats salmon cereal cooked eggs sausages bacon etc The room was more than adequate for a couple large bathroom large comfortable bed mini bar etc My room included free Wi Fi however this was only free because I am a Hilton Honour s member Very helpful staff at the reception area helping with luggage arranging taxis etc 
266451,The Waldorf Hilton, the reception area is very unimpressive the staff are very slow at check in and there wasnt enough of them the hard upsell at check in the poor quality tea coffee in the room the speed of the lifts, The location as we were going to the theatre royal drury lane
266452,The Waldorf Hilton, Cold breakfast on our second day The main restaurant was full so we were put in an area ahead of where you queue , The staff were brilliant as was the position
266453,The Waldorf Hilton, Economics shouts loudly as usual The room was small smaller than say a Premier Inn so was the bed Breakfast should have been so much better There was a queue of 10 12 to be shown to a table The food in the hot dishes was not at all hot No point complaining the staff were rushed and we probably won t be returning Yes food and drink is expensive but we expected that so no complaints there , It s one of the best hotels in the UK Staff were very attentive and extremely smart 
266454,The Waldorf Hilton, Having booked and paid in advance I didn t like being charged 100 on my credit card for extras not incurring any cost and having to wait upto 5 days for the money to be refunded onto my credit card A bit harsh I think , The location of the hotel and the service provided 
266455,The Waldorf Hilton, The room had a 3rd put up bed which made it difficult to get to the wardrobes The handle on the window in the bathroom was broken and the shower head needed descaling the water was going all over the place Took too long to check in , Very comfortable bed great location great breakfast 
266456,The Waldorf Hilton, Nothing really , Staff were all very helpful and friendly I was there with my sister in law for a birthday treat and when the hotel found out they upgraded our room and even produced a birthday cake Fantastic
266457,The Waldorf Hilton, The entire pool was taken up by 2 people swimming lengths Not really the hotels fault but perhaps a rope lane could be put in to ensure there is a leisure area as well as an area for length swimmers , Hotel had a fantastic location and represented good value for money The staff were lovely and tried really hard to accommodate an early check in for my disabled father in law They also gave us a complimentary upgrade Great choice of breakfast at the buffet We were able to leave our cases once we checked out and come back for them later on the day 
266458,The Waldorf Hilton,No Negative, I was really looking forward to staying here as its a mythical name in hotels and the beautiful facade clearly demonstrates its period splendour First impression when you walk in it s a bit ordinary and sort of like almost any Hilton anywhere There are many gorgeous period details like the palm court the iron work the wonderful old doors and old the marble staircase But you don t notice those straight away it felt a little soulless and ordinary and I think the entrance and initial public rooms could have been made to be much more elegant and in period That said I found our room very comfortable all the corridors are well decorated and clean not exactly my taste but overall very comfortable and the bathroom was lovely even if the bath tub was a little small and no overly comfortable to shower in No wifi in rooms you have to pay which is just plain mean for a hotel of this cost The health centre was a disappointment It s actually a gym open to membership to anyone and that wasn t clear to me Consequently it felt like any gym anywhere else Facilities were fine and the pool room was nice One of the reasons I chose the Waldorf was for the pool as I wanted a relaxing afternoon by the pool reading Sadly that was not possible given how extremely noisy it was with children and families playing The management need to police how the pool functions for everyone s benefit It also closes at 5 on a Sunday and given check in is at 3 I was very disappointed the concierge hadn t mentioned this when we booked Breakfast we had to wait in a short queue to be seated Overall the breakfast was good and plentiful but I don t think the cooked breakfast was excellent When we left at 8 45 the queue was very long so make sure you go early This dining room is not rally big enough for the number of rooms in the hotel and if a lot of people turn up the queue is long 
266459,The Waldorf Hilton, Check in was a bit slow only two people on service at 6pm peak time but really a minor issue , We stayed in an Executive room and it was stylish and very comfortable Great space Fabulous bathroom Couldn t fault the standard 
266460,The Waldorf Hilton, Room was not ready for over an hour Was not as booked twin Housekeeping had to remake the beds Not a good start to weekend but eventually sorted to our satisfaction , Convenient Generally good service 
266461,The Waldorf Hilton, The air conditioning was not working so far too hot at night even with window open Did not realise the fault was a c until visited another room the day we were leaving , The staff were good They picked up it was my daughter s 18th birthday and placed a Happy Birthday plate with a piece of cake in her room also a bottle of wine A very nice touch 
266462,The Waldorf Hilton, London prices The room was clean comfortable and easily adequate but I was expecting a bit more for the price and a Waldorf We would stay there again but probably only when a discount was available , Great location for theatres Covent Garden restaurants shops trains and lots more 
266463,The Waldorf Hilton,No Negative, The room was very comfortable immaculate and quiet The decor in the bathroom outstanding and the gentleman who assisted us to our room helpful and very pleasant The hotel is situated near Drury Lane great for the theatre and close to Soho where you can get a meal late at night as we did as we arrived late When it poured with rain the next day they loaned us a union jack umbrella which was a lovely touch Highly recommended 
266464,The Waldorf Hilton, A c and room temperature awful very small poor selection of tv channels very little thought to extras that when traveling across the world make you remember the hotel , Bed was very good as were the sheets 
266465,The Waldorf Hilton, Shwimming pool is open for kids for a very limited time The explanation from management was very weak They just said that is a different company for the pool ,No Positive
266466,The Waldorf Hilton, Nothing can think of My views from experienced career worldwide business traveller working in 37 countries incl resident Director Multi National Corporations and working on Foreign Office Committees Yep Global traveller so know something about Hotels , Like Exec room Love entrance area keeping room separate Excellent bed comfy and big big plenty of room We also love bar and coffee area Staff are polite well presented friendly and no language problems I would say carefully selected and well trained Imbecable manners quality people I am a Hilton user recent returned from Beijing staying at City Centre Hilton Returning shortly We prefer Waldorf to Park Lane Hilton as Waldorf more homely and personal and terrific location the best for Theatre land Embankment etc etc Waldorf for sure stylish property We ll be back 
266467,The Waldorf Hilton, My stay was too short , The room was very comfortable the breakfast was delicious and the staff were friendly courteous and very helpful The cocktails are truly amazing 
266468,The Waldorf Hilton, No free Wi Fi Bed too hard for me , Excellent location for West End shows Staff very helpful and friendly Good breakfast Large rooms executive rooms 
266469,The Waldorf Hilton, Maid knocked on door came in despite it saying do not disturb room service for breakfast did take some time , The welcome we received and the great service The rooms were wonderful and very luxurious
266470,The Waldorf Hilton, The room was opposite the cleaners store cupboard and they were noisy and several of the items in the cooked breakfast were cold eggs and bacon , Location was excellent and the cleanliness of the room was spot on We had a queen guest room and the size of the room and en suite were brilliant 
266471,The Waldorf Hilton, The bacon wasn t nice There was a long queue for breakfast , They upgraded us as it was a special occasion The sheets were lovely and the room was really quiet 
266472,The Waldorf Hilton, The temperature of the pool was a little chilly The rain water shower though looked nice did not give off much water , Extremely comfy bed lovely bathroom great central location and very helpful staff Fabulous to be in central London and have the use of a swimming pool too Best hotel breakfast I ve had in a long time 
266473,The Waldorf Hilton, broken plastic toilet seat in the otherwise beautiful marble bathrooms Why , The staff were very friendly Benjamin on reception and Joseph in the bar made my wife s birthday very special
266474,The Waldorf Hilton, Nothing, Evening meal was cooked to perfection side orders were large we overordered could have shared one portion excellant breakfast staff very polite and attentive would highly recommend bar staff well trained very professional
266475,The Waldorf Hilton, Housekeeping knocked on our room door on 3 separate occasions in the morning we were only staying one night and had been hoping to take advantage of the 12 o clock check out by sleeping in The prices in the hotel for food and drinks are extremely high Considering how much the rooms are anyway you would think the hotel would offer guests a more justified price structure for such things , Location is perfect
266476,The Waldorf Hilton, Pricy We reserved a room with a sofa bet for us three adults They could not make one available because the air conditioner broke down The worst is that the receptionist tried to sell me a larger suite room by offering a discount without saying the originally reserved room was not available Just be honest Don t play a game , Excellent location at Aldwych 
266477,The Waldorf Hilton, we had a suite on the 8th floor which was superb however the noise from the air conditioning units on the roof were very noisy but nothing the hotel could do to reduce the noise , the location was excellent and the staff very helpful the executive lounge was a real bonus 
266478,The Waldorf Hilton, Called reception 3 times and each time left phone ringing for over two minute which is a hell of a lot or fringes and no one ever answered , Breakfast was superb
266479,The Waldorf Hilton, Breakfast wasn t anything different to any other hotel Was expecting service rather than a buffet , Hotel was beautiful staff were extremely friendly and helpful going the extra mile 
266480,The Waldorf Hilton, 9 o clock knock at the door on a Sunday morning to see if we wanted our room serviced Issue with sink in the bathroom not fixed at the first attempt, Lovely facilities and very friendly helpful staff Wonderfully stylish hotel
266481,The Waldorf Hilton, Nothing , This was a anniversary treat upon arrival we receive a complimentary upgrade for our room and later on had a delicious complimentary cake delivered to our room wishing us a happy anniversary Fantastic stay 
266482,The Waldorf Hilton, thought breakfast should have been included in the price of the room The attitude of the young woman member of staff who showed us to the table at breakfast was disrespectful shame because she let down the rest fo the team, Very comfortable room although provision of milk for tea coffee very mean Enjoyed time in the pool Almost all staff very friendlyand polite
266483,The Waldorf Hilton, The only criticism was that the room was a little on the small size although that s fairly common in London , Loved our evening meal and breakfast The room was clean and comfortable and had a mini bar tea and coffee facilities tv etc 
266484,The Waldorf Hilton,No Negative, We had a voucher to stay in this property following an awful experience in New York The staff were amazing and couldn t do enough to ensure our stay was perfect THANK YOU
266485,The Waldorf Hilton, On arrival no one was on the door I had to ring and ask how to valet park They said pull up to front someone will be waiting No one was there I had to jump out my car get someone Checking staff were not very welcoming and it took long time to check in I pre arranged for a cake and champagne to be in my room this was not done and I had to chase again staff not very happy to help My air con was not working I called reception again sounded like it was a real effort to speak and normally I call down they know my name and room number which is always a nice touch not this time I had to say my room and name There were 4 of us and only 2 of everything inc champagne glasses when they finally brought it up Checking out was long Concierge unhelpful and grumpy Breakfast staff again miserable unhelpful I have stayed in Waldorf in Orlando New York both out of this world experience this was just a huge disappointment I have a suite booked for 18th of Dec I will be cancelling this and staying elsewhere , Location was perfect for covent garden
266486,The Waldorf Hilton, Queuing at reception blocks access to lifts and other areas this could be easily resolved, Mary working at breakfast absolutely 1st class customer service Meeting Mary and the service and welcome she provided made the difference to our stay Have you thought of her being a customer service trainer 
266487,The Waldorf Hilton, Pretty satisfied, First time I ve slept the whole night through in a hotel Great bed Excellent location 2 min walk to the Lyceum Theatre where we were headed Staff were helpful Would stay here again 
266488,The Waldorf Hilton,No Negative, Amazing hotel very friendly staff that made our trip very special for my girlfriends birthday Brilliant location lots of bars and restaurants near by however the food was so good in the hotel we ate there 
266489,The Waldorf Hilton, We asked for an early check in When we got there our room wasn t available An executive room would be available soon she even mentioned the room number so we decided to take and pay for an upgrade When we came back one hour later that one was not available at all Finally 3 hours later it finally was available at the normal check in of 3pm But we got another room When we said we were waiting for another room they mixed it up and then we got the upgraded room who was supossed to be available at noon So in fact we booked an upgrade because that room was available for an early check in but finally we didn t get an earlier check in Furthermore every time there was a big line for the reception and every time we had to go in line again to ask if our room was ready The staff should have paid more attention to that We paid a lot of money for an executive room but the service at the reception was very disappointing, Location is wonderful Great hotel with perfect rooms Friendly staff in particular the concierge service is excellent However the check in went too chaotic why we paid too much see my negative comments 
266490,The Waldorf Hilton, The high tea the sandwiches had different types of bread when white bread for all the sandwiches would do and the scones were heavy and doughy very disappointed for our first visit , The friendly faces when you approach the door and when you enter the hotel 
266491,The Waldorf Hilton, cant fault anything, I found all the staff to be so helpful and friendly loved the hotel The room was comfy the towels were big lovely and soft and plenty of them The breakfast was served in a lovely dinning room nice and light We had a brilliant time in your disco bar Yet again brilliant staff who made our trip a memorable one
266492,The Waldorf Hilton, Not being able to check in till 3 on a one night stay as u don t get your moneys worth for the room, The exclusive lounge with complimentry food was excellent 
266493,The Waldorf Hilton, Very very hard mattresses You can t open the windows, Staff very helpful breakfast and service are good concierge tries its best especially Robert location very convenient air conditioning works free wifi available
266494,The Waldorf Hilton, The fact we could only stay for one night On previous occasions we ve stayed for two or three , When checking in I was asked the reason we were staying there and I mentioned it was a special wedding anniversary Later on a bottle of Prosecco arrived in the room with an ice bucket and two flutes A lovely surprise which together with the spacious room and helpful staff made it a memorable stay As long as I can afford it The Waldorf will always be my first choice London hotel 
266495,The Waldorf Hilton, I couldn t undo the plug in the bath Slightly embarrassing, The bed was amazing I was really impressed with the kindness of the staff and the breakfast was perfect
266496,The Waldorf Hilton, The room was awful overlooking a grimy backyard and roof Could not swing a cat around in the bathroom but have dealt with this direct with Customer Relations Officer at The Waldorf , The dining area was good no complaints about the food
266497,The Waldorf Hilton, Food trays left in corridors No response from telephones Hot water out a cold tap Being talked into an upgrade Put on the top floor an furthest away from lifts oops what lifts 2 flights of stairs then lifts Nor did they take any notice of room request , Easy access to theatres 
266498,The Waldorf Hilton, You advertise a pool however is run by a third party and has stipulations on when children can swim I understand this policy in London however you need to look at the times that members will use facilities This would be early 06 30 to possibly 08 30 then after that then could be opened to children Certainly not 10 to 12 when the day is over Leave that easy change for you to sort Rooms ok In terms of the breakfast not great Need to remove the plastic fried eggs and paper napkins that you would expect from a lower star hotel I thought 5 star hotels only use cloth napkins Maybe a visit would be prudent to determine changes I lot could be learnt from your 5 star competitors, Location ok and all the basic requirements Reception personnel excellent Young lad Monty Yang superb and as a seasoned traveller flying weekly around the world on business have never met a better person to greet and sort issues out at reception A gem of a person and an ambassador for Hilton Hilton needs to appreciate him or you will soon loose him 
266499,The Waldorf Hilton, Generally a very pleasing stay with lovely staff on the door reception and in the bar and helpful concierge Housekeeping was erratic however On Day 1 all was fine on day 2 I had to call them in to clean change linen when we returned from a day out Day 3 heard four knocks at the door between 9am and 10 30 am despite checkout not being until 12 noon Toiletries were not replenished until day 3 and the teapot was not emptied or washed days 1 and 2 , Reception and bar staff
266500,The Waldorf Hilton, The only negative is that unfortunately there is not enough room for everyone to have breakfast in the morning in the restaurant you had to line up outside the restaurant and the quality of the food and coffee for room service was not great , This hotel was a welcome oasis in a fantastic location worth every penny Great beds Awesome staff ready to help with anything lovely hotel The gym and pool were absolutely stunning Rooms were gorgeous and exceptionally clean Was fantastic to just walk out and next door go to a show or wander around Covent garden 
266501,The Waldorf Hilton, There were a range of options for afternoon tea but this was not made available when I was was trying to book online I felt a bit embarrassed when I had to ask the girl in the front of the restaurant as I feel it was a bit expensive , The receptionists and doormen were so nice in particular Lourdes who went out of her way to help us a great deal I really loved the decor of this hotel it was so beautiful to look at The location is excellent It is close to transport shops restaurants theatres 
266502,The Waldorf Hilton, A C a little loud a minor annoyance in an otherwise very comfortable room the hot buffet breakfast option was luke warm at 7am uninspiring sadly standard for larger hotels in central London , Clean comfortable modern classic room Friendly professional staff Location excellent for our theatre trip 
266503,The Waldorf Hilton, No acknowledgement of my daughters 30th birthday on her birthday spoke to reception the next morning and a bottle of wine was sent to her room A phone charger was left in my daughters room on checking out Tried phoning reception with no joy with them answering the phone once getting through to another department got told to ring back at another time Understand that the staff are very busy however a call back would of been more profesional this was resolved by email , Curtious staff Great location Rooms clean overal great stay especially if you are attending the theatre 
266504,The Waldorf Hilton, The wedding reception ball room played music way beyond midnight and kept us awake The regulatory fire drill woke us up at 1 30am on our last night of stay and then we were made to hang out in our PJs on a cold very early morning in London The bathtub flooded while having a shower and did not drain properly The air conditioning in the room did not work and was very hot There was a bad smell in the corridor on the way to our room every day , Close to shops
266505,The Waldorf Hilton, Hospitality tray was poor Only one biscuit and no hot chocolate Room was not serviced by 5 pm and had to request this Corridor carpets quite stained Lifts slow at busy periods , Location was excellent 
266506,The Waldorf Hilton, Long queues for breakfast were disappointing, The bedroom was excellent Very spacious and the disabled bathroom was the most agreeable I have ever had Even the fire alarm was dealt with extremely well 
266507,The Waldorf Hilton, Creaking floors dysfunctional air conditioning No free wifi you could expext it for this price and even the payed wifi is difficult to get , Helpful committed staff 
266508,The Waldorf Hilton, We would have liked a nicer view As we had a view of a wall and boilers Also the fire alarm went of at 2 in the morning and we had to be evacuated out of the hotel but that s not the hotels thought , bed where really comfy and nice rooms The spa area was really lovely Loved the bar area too And all the decor around the hotel All the staff seemed very welcoming and friendly 
266509,The Waldorf Hilton, I thought it strange that housekeeping didn t attend to the room until we called reception to enquire why it hadn t been done , With one exception everything was excellent 
266510,The Waldorf Hilton, Terribly managed hotel They allowed two weddings in the weekend were there The guests were drunk and allowed to roam through the hotel On the final night of our stay the drunk wedding guests were arguing to get into someone s room when refused they set off the fire alarm and everyone had to evacuate the hotel at 2 00am We got 3 hours sleep and the manager of the hotel didn t know what was going on Do not stay with this hotel it does not live near the reputation it claims, Location
266511,The Waldorf Hilton, The room I was given already had an occupant I do not feel this was handled very well when I went back to reception as was concerned with regards to room secutiry and the credit card information I had given to cover my incidental costs , Beautiful building well located Rooms were clean and comfortable 
266512,The Waldorf Hilton, Underneath the bathroom sink was dirty and the shower leaked , We visited for my daughters 18th birthday She received a card and cake to the room as a special gesture That was very thoughtful 
266513,The Waldorf Hilton,No Negative, House keeping was amazing They changed out at our request the down bedding for hypo allergenic Also loved the gym Breakfast was delicious Loved the complimentary water bottles in our room everyday 
266514,The Waldorf Hilton, Air conditioning wasn t working in the room but it was too late at night to bother calling for it to be fixed The wait for breakfast was unnecessarily long The staff were working as hard as they could but they couldn t keep up with clearing laying tables There were loads of tables which could have been used had there have been more staff , Wonderful selection for breakfast Quiet spacious room 
266515,The Waldorf Hilton, The view I requested a quiet room with a nice view of London but maybe the two are mutually exclusive We were allocated a room on the 6 th floor which was lovely quiet but the view was of the inner courtyard which is just walls of other bedroom windows However the lack of a view in no way detracted from the wonderful time we enjoyed , Fabulous hotel Fabulous location Fabulous city Congrats well done to The Waldorf Hilton Team Absolutely loved our stay Can t wait to return Hotel concierge team so helpful Room pleasantly spacious lovely for a city hotel had everything we needed wanted Loved the bathtub the extra fluffy towels the daily replenishment of our water Also enjoyed our swim in the pool Fantastic hotel wish all hotels could be this good Oh We asked the hotel to arrange a car for us from to the airport which was great It was a Jaquar we felt like royalty 
266516,The Waldorf Hilton, Door knocked twice within 30 mins by the maids before 9 30 wanting to clean the room , A very elegant hotel very clean and comfortable Breakfast was delicious too 
266517,The Waldorf Hilton, The pool area had a very slippery floor and they had to keep making announcements to be careful If they only just put down rubber tread mats it would have saved all that danger and announcements , The rooms were a good size and classically designed The night lights were a nice touch I hate not knowing where the bathroom is in the middle of the night 
266518,The Waldorf Hilton, Surprise for wife was a day early even though I had confirmation email Card access after 23 00 hrs A bit strange for the price of rooms , Staff very helpful Location could not be any better 
266519,The Waldorf Hilton, Air con in room a bit noisy orange juice at breakfast not freshly squeezed queues to check in and also slightly chaotic, Comfortable beds excellent shower express checkout decent sized room excellent provision of towels toiletries etc
266520,The Waldorf Hilton, Tortellini at the restaurant, Excelente trato del recepcionista Daniel y del botones Excelente cama muy c moda Excellent assistance of the receptionist Daniel and the porter Excellent bed very comfortable 
266521,The Waldorf Hilton, The deluxe room was Ok but not deluxe , it was worth upgrading to a better room as we also got use of the executive lounge free food and drinks so we didn t have to buy an evening meal 
266522,The Waldorf Hilton, Wifi 15 Felt it should be free at a quality hotel Drinks in lounge silly prices , Nice room and helpful staff The offer to store our luggage on the day we checked out 
266523,The Waldorf Hilton, Breakfast was a lost cause We had to wait in a queue the first morning for 20 or so mins The second morning we waited about the same The queue didn t move at all so we walked away Not enough staff at peak times , The hotel is in a very good spot for the West End 
266524,The Waldorf Hilton, Double bed was a small double even though I did know this at time of booking it did mean a disturbed night sleep this was the only thing that let the hotel down , For the location facilities and price this is by far the best hotel in the area Staff all friendly and the breakfast was AMAZING Will be using this hotel again 
266525,The Waldorf Hilton, The room had slight areas of mould within our bath and cupboards and the air conditioning was non operational at all during our stay the robes had what seemed to be food stains over the back of them so we felt slightly off put and moved them to bottom of cupboard We were not told we were required to pay a 50 deposit upon our arrival until the last minute of the check in even though they possessed my card details from my booking and we were not told it would take up to 5 days for this to be refunded back to my account after being told 5 minutes earlier it would be returned immediately The staff upon entry seemed welcoming and professional but a young lady had an appalling attitude towards her breakfast shift being extremely moody when offering us tea and coffee tutting as she walked away taking 20 minutes to bring this too us nearly brought us too walking out and complaining too the reception We also overheard the supervisor telling the young girl to smile and seeing staff with their mobile phones hanging out of their pockets and checking them behind the curtain seemed unprofessional when seen by guests they continued to look A room attendant appeared early and as both my partner and I were showering and getting ready she proceeded to walk in after we said no thank you Are they not aware of when we check out We felt these errors we found were poor from a hotel of this calibre and a gesture should be offered to guests who ve had an experience like this I felt the need to not complain in front of my other half as it was for her birthday I hope management take notice of these errors make the amendments for future guests who choose the whaldorf for a good experience , Breakfast was a good setup with plenty to choose although hot buffet was luke warm with limited options Location of room was easily accessible to and from lobby A complimentary drink was given due to it being my girlfriends birthday suprise also 
266526,The Waldorf Hilton, No coffee in our room and had to ask 3 times to have some sent to our room , Stayed here before in 2009 and it was a bit more exclusive then As breakfast was served in the ballroom and it used to have the cocktail lounge and champagne bar 
266527,The Waldorf Hilton, Staff came into our room to turn our beds down and leave a chocolate on the pillow when we were out but unfortunately left the door ajar We came back late and were looking for an intruder in our room , Everything was excellent nothing too much trouble for staff welcoming you with a smile We were late for breakfast as we slept late in this wonderful room but there was breakfast left wonderful orange juice fruit and yoghurt and plenty of croissants left All out of this world and we will certainly stay again There was of course fried breakfast which again looked freshly fried grilled There were also staff still cooking breakfasts and I can only assume that whatever you wanted for your breakfast it would not be a problem to give you I was sorry we were only on a one night stay in London 
266528,The Waldorf Hilton, Staff did not seem up to coping with the number of visitors Breakfast was chaotic and checking in took over an hour as despite the fact that I had booked twin beds they thought I might have done this by mistake and had to make the bed into twins before they would let us in to the room this could have been handled better if the receptionist had actually told me up front what the issue was , Excellent location and room was really nice Great value for money I would definitely stay here again 
266529,The Waldorf Hilton, Booked a non smoking room and was given a smoking room staff said it wasn t but it smelt as soon as walked in Plus ashtray on table sort of gave it awAy But reception soon swapped when rang and told them , Close proximity to theatre and embankment etc Staff helpful
266530,The Waldorf Hilton, Customer service We were told they didn t have food available for lunch We had to wait until 3 30 for our room then another hour later our bags still hadn t arrived had to go and take our luggage from the front desk, Everywhere in the hotel was spotlessly clean the breakfasts were excellent
266531,The Waldorf Hilton, All other staff were rude wedding was going on so clearly under staffed Last time we came to London stayed at the Savoy stayed here because no rooms available The difference in service and standards was vast considering the difference in price was 30 for a overnight stay Really dissappointed Low point was mould on my muffin at breakfast , Restaurat manager was brilliant
266532,The Waldorf Hilton, Service checking in was very poor room not ready when other rooms were ready Water dripped on my head from the ceiling above in the lounge area in the morning very dangerous as it was through a light ,No Positive
266533,The Waldorf Hilton, The AC was not working properly as warm air was coming out of the vents And when i called the reception and asked them to fix it they said there is no one available to fix it and all hotel rooms was booked and they can t do anything except sending a fan to my room This was my first night after a long flight Second night I was out all day and when I came back and asked if they fixed it they said no and gave me much smaller room with one bed We were tired and didn t care WE JUST WANT TO SLEEP WITH WORKING AC In the third night they asked us to move again to another room in the 8th floor lift only goes to the 7th you must use the stairs to 8th floor and finally the AC was working fine After all of this when I checked out I asked for compensation and for the downgrade and all the disturbing experience I got and they said we can t They only can add points to my Hilton rewards membership which I don t care about Checked out and went to the Sheraton Park Lane which was the best , The only positive thing of the hotel is the Location
266534,The Waldorf Hilton, Check in could have warned us about Central London being closed for a cycle event It was a chance to show expertise A non smoking room isn t a preference it s a deal breaker Not sure if this is down to Booking com or the Hilton , It has the nice period feel I d hoped for without being excessively swanky Staff responded well to initial mistake of giving us a a smoking room skilfully and warmly fixed us a room move and a reconfiguration to twin The pool is a pleasing bonus
266535,The Waldorf Hilton, The room was a little small with the child s bed being pushed up close between the adult bed and the desk This made it impossible to get into the adult bed on one side had to climb over the top , Use of executive lounge was fabulous Comfortable and relaxing 
266536,The Waldorf Hilton, Nothing really except that the pillows were feather and far too soft Toiletries were nothing special compared to other high end hotels Nothing to really complain about , Excellent location close to theatres restaurants and shopping Wonderful breakfast fresh fruit cooked English breakfast and pastries We had booked a double and then asked for a twin and that was arranged Beds were very comfortable and the sheets were beautiful soft and very clean The air conditioning was fantastic especially as we had experienced very hot weather Staff were brilliant and always checking that everything was ok My daughter and I always feel very safe at the Waldorf 
266537,The Waldorf Hilton, Stale bottle of milk in mini bar T plates for saucers Bag not sent to room No one answered internal phones ie reception housekeeping Marked sheets Exucutive lounge no seats very little food No hairdryer , Location
266538,The Waldorf Hilton, Our room was not ready when we arrived and we had to wait four hours Consequently we were not able to use the spa facilities as advertised because by the time we managed to get into our room we had to leave for the show we were going to see The shampoo and conditioner bottles were both empty when we arrived Also there was only one tiny bottle for two people Very mean There was very little in the way of vegetarian breakfast food I am sure it would not be too difficult to include a veggie sausage or two Some rice soya milk would also have been nice Service at breakfast was slow and I had finished eating before I even got a cup of tea Staff in the dining room were sour faced and unfriendly , Beds were comfortable Reception staff really polite and very apologetic regarding delay into our room 
266539,The Waldorf Hilton, The executive room was no different to a standard room Requested a walk in shower as my wife is disabled got a bath which meant my wife couldn t get in and out of the shower on her own Very disappointing as we know they have executive rooms with walk in showers Had the afternoon tea and have to say this is the only London hotel that we have never been offered a refill of our champagne food or tea Had afternoon tea in 5 other venues in London and always been given extras free of charge , The staff Always helpful cheerful and can t do enough for you They saved the weekend for us Disappointing stay this time always been very happy during previous stays but not this time Afternoon tea in Homage restaurant was good bit stingy with the champagne though one glass only 
266540,The Waldorf Hilton, The room was very small for the price there was not enough shower gel shampoo etc for two people and not enough milk for more than one cup of tea each The dining room was pleasant but the food had clearly been sitting far too long in the dishes and was not great Having stayed in London a lot we felt that it was poor value for money and disappointing , The position is excellent and the staff very friendly 
266541,The Waldorf Hilton, Housekeeping was dreadful On the first day my room had still not been serviced by 15 00 and on the second day when requested at 09 00 it was still not done on my return at 14 00 Long black hairs were left on the bed and on the bathroom floor Hotel no longer appears to offer a turndown service Being HHonors Gold does not hold any value at this hotel not late checkout even if willing to pay no Gold Status upgrade , Location
266542,The Waldorf Hilton, We asked for a twin room as I was with my father so needed separate beds We received one double bed and after asking them to correct this moved us into a room with one double bed and a cot only suitable for a small child not a 64 year old , The location was really good 
266543,The Waldorf Hilton, I spent more an hour check in the receptionist of leader has not help me sovle the problem for long time until I would compained him so he gave me the room key ,No Positive
266544,The Waldorf Hilton, Cheapest wine in the bar was pretty expensive Not enough coffee in the self help drinks tray , Bedroom fantastic Superb staff Excellent position for theatre land 
266545,The Waldorf Hilton, Swimming pool and gym shut at 6pm on Saturday would ve been nice to have known this earlier in the day, Very comfortable bed and fantastic location
266546,The Waldorf Hilton, The hard upgrade sell at check in I watched the front desk try it on every person checking in arriving from the overnight flight to London Your room is not ready sir but we do have a suite right now , Staff was great Bartenders were all really talented and funny people The room was one of the largest rooms I have ever had in London 
266547,The Waldorf Hilton, staff were slow to respond to simple tasks we didn t have an iron in our room and it took them an hour to bring one to us , location was great for doing all tourist activities
266548,The Waldorf Hilton,No Negative, The comfort of the rooms the friendliness and efficiency of the staff and the proximity of the hotel to the places we were visiting in Central London
266549,The Waldorf Hilton, We would have liked a bath but it wasn t a big deal , Staff in all areas of the hotel were very friendly and welcoming cocktails were delicious Breakfast was amazing We both enjoyed the fabulous leisure facilities 
266550,The Waldorf Hilton, The staff do not make you feel that welcome and they are just going through the motions The odd person had alittle more personality but some of the staff on reception whose English was more limited seemed to usethis as an excuse not to engage that much with the customer and were not particularly friendly Booked two superior doubles tiny rooms and beds uncomfortable Object to being charged for Wifi WHY it is a free service on our local buses in cafes and evenn our local hospital in communal areas With the amount that is charged find this totally unreasonable and have since paid less to stay elsewhere with higher scores in all sections and free wi fi , the location was great fo rthe theatre we were visiting and for Covent Garden
266551,The Waldorf Hilton, For a brand like Waldorf many things could should have been better The room in booking was called King Executive yet it had a Queen bed and they said the title didn t imply a king bed The second room had things like the shower knob broken the bed sheets ripped The response time for simple requests or food was very long Frankly a bit disappointed by the whole experience , The location is nice the area is easy to walk around in it depends what you are in town for 
266552,The Waldorf Hilton, Room could have been cleaner but it was just minor points overall happy with our stay , Staff were exceptional at all times very attentive polite and friendly
266553,The Waldorf Hilton,No Negative, Staff was very friendly and helpful Loved Good Godfreys Bartenders were excellent Especially Gabriela Our group was a mix of family and friends age range from 20 50 and everyone was very happy with the hotel stay 
266554,The Waldorf Hilton, Late checkout not available as hotel booked and the executive lounge could have had better food it was limited in choice, Location and breakfast great
266555,The Waldorf Hilton, bathroom was not as clean as I would have liked The previous person s 1 2 used shampoo and soap were still in the shower , bed was very comfortable
266556,The Waldorf Hilton, Rang reception twice to ask them to bring my bags up After 1 hour I went back to reception and got them myself , The hotels location in relation to Covent Garden theatre land and all the other wonderful places this part of London has to offer 
266557,The Waldorf Hilton, This is an old building with limitations the reception is not as glamourous as at some hotels and the dining room is limited by architectural features meaning tables are slightly sardined around the edges The route through to the restaurant is rather dingey The air conditioning was a bit noisy The bar was smaller than I was expecting but quite pleasant The fruit bar at breakfast was disappointing a lot of under ripe melon on offer and few gluten free options , The staff were very pleasant and helpful Our room after a free upgrade was a nice size I think we would have found the standard room a bit small The location is great we didn t need to use the tube atall The pool and gym were very good The breakfast offerings of nuts seeds and creamy yoghurt were good and the omelette chef was a nice touch I liked the slight feel of faded grandeur and the decor of the ballroom looked nice where they hold tea dances and business events Overall I would recommend booking this hotel 
266558,The Waldorf Hilton, The bath was dirty In room tea very limited and only one coffee sachet was provided One sink was blocked water taking an age to disappear, Great location
266559,The Waldorf Hilton, Problem with the air conditioning They couldn t fix it or give me another room and didn t seem to care when I complained They even charged me for water which I had to take out the mini bar as it was stifling hot at 4 30am Would never go back, Good location
266560,The Waldorf Hilton, Breakfast was a bit of a let down the buffet was not replenished quickly enough and had to ask twice for tea coffee to be served, Location cleanliness
266561,The Waldorf Hilton, Music at breakfast was noisy not relaxing Breakfast was ok but for the charge I would expect it to be freshly cooked I suspect that we paid over the odds I am sure that most of the other guests were on a deal at the hotel Still a very nice hotel but would not stay again unless we were on some sort of promotion , Everything but a bit expensive 
266562,The Waldorf Hilton, First impressions were disappointing with dirty Windows door untidy lobby and didn t smell that great Bedroom hadn t been cleaned properly ran a bath that we couldn t use TV was old and kept switching off automatically Bed was hard overall very disappointing for 191 , Breakfast
266563,The Waldorf Hilton, It got very crowded by the check in out desk and during breakfast It felt like those facilities weren t big enough to accommodate that many guests , The concierge was fantastic The bar is also very nice 
266564,The Waldorf Hilton, The room was to small the bathroom was so small you had to shut the door to menuva your way round must have been no more than 3ft wide very claustrophobic for the price we paid would have expected a little better, Staff were very good nothing to much trouble
266565,The Waldorf Hilton, I was given a price on booking and when we checked out it was a hundred pounds more when i asked about this they said we had been upgraded which i hadn t asked for, Staff were nice
266566,The Waldorf Hilton, The only thing I could fault was the queue for breakfast was a little long but that s being picky , For such a famous hotel the price was surprisingly good The staff were very nice and welcoming and the room was very comfortable The breakfast menu was very impressive We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will hopeful be staying again in the future 
266567,The Waldorf Hilton, Checkin queue was very long after more then 20 minutes waiting we were ushered upstairs to the executive checkin which was quick There was a big wedding on the first night of our stay and we could hear the music in our room until we fell asleep around 11 30 We couldn t have breakfast on our first morning as the queue was too long and we needed to be out by a certain time The second morning was fine and we enjoyed our breakfast , The location of the hotel is excellent The bed lovely and comfortable Loved the rain shower 
266568,The Waldorf Hilton, Bar staff not very friendly everything seemed to be an effort for them even down to hotel clients asking for drinks only to be told bar was closed and couldn t have drinks , Staff were friendly in reception and door men were great as were restaurant staff Location great too 
266569,The Waldorf Hilton, The rudeness of staff The cleanliness of the room The wait for breakfast The lack of use of executive lounge due to timings and staff The fact of two rooms booked together but one on floor 2 and the other on floor 7, The location
266570,The Waldorf Hilton, Bed was far too hard Prom and party loud music but it did not effect our sleep sink plug not working in room also knob broken in bathroom for TV volume, Hotel was perfect
266571,The Waldorf Hilton, Service in the restaurant on Saturday night was rushed We were the last couple in 9 30 Meal ok but last course it was obvious that that the staff wanted away Was going to have last drink in there but opted for good godfreys , Room very comfortable concierge and bar staff excellent 
266572,The Waldorf Hilton, Absolutely everything look at the photos This was a superior room so slightly more expensive Dirty bathroom no view broken fixtures bed which moved constantly rock hard mattress problems accessing room Not recommended at all We paid 260 for this room we could have stayed at the savoy for slightly more We should have , Location was good 
266573,The Waldorf Hilton, Breakfast on the 2nd day was a bit of a let down the girl on the check in desk was rather rude and we didn t get offered any juice tea or coffee like we had on the first day but other than that everything else was great,No Positive
266574,The Waldorf Hilton, I would have appreciated the availability of water from the mini bar there was only alcoholic drinks in the fridge no healthy options were available This resulted in the night being a little uncomfortable, I liked the variety for breakfast and the complimentary water in the rooms I did appreciated being upgraded and found all the staff pleasant smiling well presented and friendly They even were helpful concerning getting a taxi at the front 
266575,The Waldorf Hilton, One room we booked for a guest was given to someone else and she had to drive back home Very disappointing We had items in the board room for our makeup event Many items went missing Would like to know what happened , The staff were helpful We held an event here and the room was just about good for us 
266576,The Waldorf Hilton, Having to pay for WiFi I get it free at my local pub Poor choice of TV stations, Very comfortable room but couldn t get any cold water out of the tap both where hot Very good breakfast with lots on offer
266577,The Waldorf Hilton,No Negative, A plate with happy birthday written in chocolate and a dish of truffles and macaroons left in the room after the receptionist asked if we were here for a special occasion 
266578,The Waldorf Hilton, Was expensive and room was quite basic for a luxury room Had to queue for breakfast despite booking , Location was fantastic Surroundings and communal areas lovely 
266579,The Waldorf Hilton, Can t say anything bad about it other than the fact that we should have stayed longer , The whole experience was fantastic our room queen Hilton deluxe was superb and the staff were a delight The cocktail bar Good Godfrey s was great and we enjoyed our well prepared drinks and the excellent service 
266580,The Waldorf Hilton, Room not ready on arrival at 345 room not cleaned one day had to ask for toilet rolls , Breakfast was good but plates not cleared away had to ask for knives 
266581,The Waldorf Hilton, It s not often I would say this but there wasn t anything I didn t like , The location was great the bedroom was really comfortable stylish 
266582,The Waldorf Hilton,No Negative, The staff at the front desk were very very friendly and Helpful The room was fabulous and will definitely be returning to stay on my next trip to London 
266583,The Waldorf Hilton, The Breakfast experience was v disappointing no cuttlery on table no milk in table Jug and a number of breakfast food items were missing Milk for cornflakes orange juice , Bed comfort 
266584,The Waldorf Hilton, No do not disturb signs I was out of my room over 5 hrs Saturday was asked 3 times before I left once as soon as I got back for house keeping but room was not cleaned when I was out, Great location lovely room
266585,The Waldorf Hilton, Air conditioning was smelly not good, Staff were good breakfast good location was excellent room was spotless and we were given a room on the 6th floor very quiet indeed pool nice and warm
266586,The Waldorf Hilton, Do not pay extra to upgrade to an executive room the executive lounge was very poor with very little choice Check in staff were very difficult and unfriendly at times, Location is perfect Bedrooms are comfortable Breakfast was enjoyable
266587,The Waldorf Hilton, The service was poor waited 40 minutes for a coffee Bar staff got our drinks order wrong twice The final straw was the mouse in our bedroom , Hotel was in the right location for our trip to the theater 
266588,The Waldorf Hilton, We liked everything The Waldorf offered no negative comments , This is the first time we have stayed at a hotel that was wonderful from entering the door on our arrival to the time when we left Every one of the staff was pleasant helpful and good representatives of The Waldorf hotel The bedrooms were fantastic the breakfast and dining room were excellent and the lounge area very comfortable and relaxing On speaking to other guests at the hotel they all gave similar comments and a number of them had dinner there and said that the meals were very good Given the fact that the hotel is so central and such an excellent place to stay we would highly recommend this venue to anyone visiting London EXCELLENT
266589,The Waldorf Hilton, Noisy from road traffic at front Room quite small but bathroom big, Excellent location for Covent Garden and West End Theatres Valet parking excellent Lovely breakfast
266590,The Waldorf Hilton, Having to wait for 50 to be put back into my account taken out the minute I checked in and I extras to charge my room but three weeks I m told for money to go back in , The room was a good size very clean and comfortable
266591,The Waldorf Hilton, Didn t realise it excluded breakfast It was a treat for my wife s birthday on arrival the staff advised that they would do something special for her nothing came of it , Room was lovely
266592,The Waldorf Hilton, Room key didn t work on second day I asked for a room on a low floor because my wife suffers from vertigo and can t use lifts and the room was on the second floor It was changed on checking in to the first floor which is actually the second floor Disappointing , We enjoyed lunch in the bar area service particularly good The room was spacious and comfortable and clean 
266593,The Waldorf Hilton, View from window was not very good as it looked out onto the back of other buildings fire escapes etc however we didn t want to look out of the window , Perfect location for a short mini break in London Lovely staff and facilities felt a very high class venue we are usually in a premier inn with the kids 
266594,The Waldorf Hilton, The restaurant was filthy and for such a prestigious hotel with so much history the decor really doesn t do this justice The Bar is more impressive than the restaurant The breakfast was like a buffet which you would expect in a budget hotel not a 4 5 star Order breakfast in bed Much more like it , Excellent location 
266595,The Waldorf Hilton, Bath was not comfortable as a big ledge all around Also the bed was on wheels and really high , Very helpful and friendly staff Brilliant location for the theatre and Covent Gardens 
266596,The Waldorf Hilton, We paid for a room for three adults We got a double room with a single pull out bed It certainly was not for three adults two glasses two tea cups two dressing gowns We also paid for executive lounge access and this was a complete waste of money We asked when it closed and got told 11pm so decided to head up at 8pm Twenty minutes later a member of staff said to fill our plates as the food was going nothing was mentioned about the drink going also However when we went to pour another drink we got a very snappy response that it had finished and that she had told us this The next morning for breakfast the lady at the desk had said it was busy and to go to the main restaurant We did to be stood in a queue with about thirty other folk in front of us We all felt the executive lounge was a complete waste of money The hotel is in a fantastic location but I believe that you d get more for your money in other hotels in the area , The location is excellent 
266597,The Waldorf Hilton, My flight was delayed 24 hours and my room was cancelled despite having already paid the full fee up front The reception staff were not very pleasant or helpful in helping to resolve the issue Eventually I was given a room but advised I could not access until after 3pm I should have been provided access straight away When I eventually got to my room it was barely big enough to swing a cat There was no drawers in the room to be able to unpack properly only a wardrobe was provided you cannot hang up socks Overall not impressed and expected better from the hotel ,No Positive
266598,The Waldorf Hilton,No Negative, The staff were very helpfull and friendly from the doorman to the cleaners Would definitely stay again when going to London perfect for the theatres
266599,The Waldorf Hilton, Room was comfortable if somewhat plain especially for a deluxe room , Location was very good for us and overall we enjoyed our short stay Not here long enough to say anything else 
266600,The Waldorf Hilton, It was booked by Mrs for my husband birthday present However everything is in his name MR even my email Its me who signed up for the Hilton Membership Mrs Such a busy weekend we had to wait to be seated for breakfast for a while for topping up of breakfast food , The comfort of the bed amazing and the lovely warm room on a very cold day Lovely staff very attentive to needs Mentioned something needed fixing 1st night whilst we were out it was repaired by the time we got back wow Great Breakfast 
266601,The Waldorf Hilton, Nothing , Diidnt have breakfast booked but heard how good it was from others in hotel So central for shows and our walkabout on Sunday We had a great time and will stay there next time 
266602,The Waldorf Hilton, The lounge doesn t have much of a cooked breakfast selection and throughout the day there wasn t a great selection of drinks available Some staff were rude and gave mixed messages about what we could and couldn t bring in to the lounge A shame as we had such a great experience last time , Comfy bed and a nice hotel in a great location Good facilities and very clean and comfy 
266603,The Waldorf Hilton, Paid for breakfast 32 when booking Nothing said about supplement for full English Could have got better food on any town high street for the supplement cost Would not have expected this type of very poor food and having to queue for food at this price and at a hotel of this quality We work very hard for our money and this was a real treat for us completely spoilt for us by having motorway service quality fast food We treated ourselves in the Savoy 4 yrs ago and for 50 we had the most amazing experience of a breakfast you could ever imagine That s what I believed the Waldorf would and should have given us , Room was fabulous bathroom great staff friendly Had a good stay
266604,The Waldorf Hilton, Didn t service our room and then tried to do it at a time which was wholly impractical to do so Queues for breakfast and check out awful Breakfast quality was mediocre , Rooms were satisfactory and clean on arrival Staff were helpful but clearly not enough of them 
266605,The Waldorf Hilton, There was an event going on late into the night with a lot of young drunk people in the main area of the hotel one who dropped a full bottle of red wine which broke and the glass and wine went everywhere , Great hotel we got a good price via Booking com
266606,The Waldorf Hilton, Slippers poor quality compared with other hotels No assistance with luggage from taxi or to the room Window was too small no view , Comfortable bed thick towels nice fluffy bathrobes Surround sound in bathroom Friendly staff easygoing staff
266607,The Waldorf Hilton, Breakfast was very disappointing and service very poor Fried breakfast was cold and the reception staff never asked if we enjoyed our stay so couldn t raise our issues , The room and steak at the evening meal was beautiful
266608,The Waldorf Hilton,No Negative, Very helpful friendly and efficient staff who were attentive without being obtrusive Great location right in the heart of the West End and next door to the Aldwych Theatre Spacious room hich was spotless and had every comfort 
266609,The Waldorf Hilton, For the amount of money I was quite surprised that my room did not have a window but had a porthole and a sky light on top of the bed The room was quite outdated, The location of the property was great Close all to sites to tour
266610,The Waldorf Hilton, The very very tired cocktail lounge faded and thread bare seating carpeting as old as Captain Cook or dare I say Napoleon Reception dowdy , Going home
266611,The Waldorf Hilton, My only complaint was the shower door in the bathroom It was an old fashioned half door that swung open It wasn t water tight or long enough to keep water inside the tub , I liked everything about the property The staff were friendly and helpful Room service was extraordinary and the location was perfect for theater and museums Food in the little bar area was good and wait staff excellent 
266612,The Waldorf Hilton, No slippers in room No tooth pick Could do with spare toilet tissues , Absolutely loved it Can t wait to go again Wish I could remember name of breakfast staff who served us A black African lady and another black staff who where so attentive Receptionist was fabulous Will be booking again 
266613,The Waldorf Hilton, I understand the reason a cot bed couldn t be guaranteed but its a risk some people might not take A clear yes no would have been appreciated , Staff couldn t have been more attentive when we arrived They were all so helpful with our requests and despite not being able to guarantee a cot bed for our 5 month old or an adjoining room for our parents we were given both as they were available on the day 
266614,The Waldorf Hilton, Not a bad experience but the television didn t have a guide to what was on each program at each hour only the channels available and we didn t have TV magazine , Excellent front of house staff Clean and comfortable room 
266615,The Waldorf Hilton, Ahh we are very fussy always check room often asked to be moved but no everything wonderful , We were three ladies two recently lost our husbands and dreading new year booked last week from getting out of taxi to getting back in after three days faultless usually stay in Kensington how foolish would like to be sent offers will always if affordable be our first choice 
266616,The Waldorf Hilton, The bar is slightly disappointing smaller and less comfortable than you might expect Breakfast is taken in a reduced area of the dining room which is a shame , An iconic stylish hotel in the best location in London Magnificent dining room Helpful staff 
266617,The Waldorf Hilton, Hotel was very shortstaffed waited 40 minutes to get a table for breakfast and then it was like a team of locus had set in staff were rude and under pressure,No Positive
266618,The Waldorf Hilton, Very poor food Christmas eve menu food not cooked turkey dry inedible Breakfast in executive lounge fault on heaters cold scrambled egg and sausage Would not ever go back to the Waldorf London Also paid for other facilities but pool and leisure closed on Christmas day ,No Positive
266619,The Waldorf Hilton, The food was appalling I ordered a pannini and chips from room service and the chips were literally the worst I had ever seen The pannini was not very good either The breakfast was a buffet and the food was lukewarm and congealed I have had much better in a greasy spoon , The room was ok 
266620,The Waldorf Hilton, You pay above the odds to stay here but it was a pleasant experience It was a birthday treat that didn t disappoint but not cost effective for general use for us , The stay was pleasant and ideally located for the theatre we wanted to go to The staff were very helpful 
266621,The Waldorf Hilton, Fully booked waited 20 mins to find2 rooms Second one smoking so unacceptable Next room noisey family room and no electrics all night so no lights or air con Refunded one room ,No Positive
266622,The Waldorf Hilton,No Negative, The staff were superb at making our two day trip a pleasant trouble free stay From arrival and valet parking to checkout with the luggage placed seamlessly in our car which was waiting at the pre arranged time outside the hotel Cocktails were delightful too 
266623,The Waldorf Hilton, Not anywhere near a 5 star hotel anymore Breakfast was appalling Nothing filled up no drinks no staff no table waiter until we asked new food brought out cold tables not set correctly staff didn t know wether they were coming or going it was like faulty towers I did complain and the manager came to us and apologised he said they were having to use another kitchen that hadn t worked and in his words No one could be more embarrassed by what is happening in here today than me your breakfast experience has been a total disaster he did promise to e mail me with some sort of compensation by the end of that day but as yet now 2 days later I ve not heard a thing from the Waldorf Disgusted , Location is excellent 
266624,The Waldorf Hilton, leisure area badly in need of refurbishment swimming pool area very poor and steam room sauna not working Very unfriendly female member of staff in leisure center and was annoyed no matter what you asked for which was only a towel , Breakfast excellent large comfortable room 
266625,The Waldorf Hilton, The one little thing that let you down was the service at breakfast Bearing in mind the status of the hotel we would of expected more attention to detail Tea was wrong eggs beans had run out and not refilled but the staff were very nice just could of been a few more maybe It was very busy and we had already been warned by way of a letter left in our room to warn of the very busy weekend, We loved our family room with loads of space and everything you could possibly need for an overnight stay The beds were comfy and the bathroom was great
266626,The Waldorf Hilton, The room was very compact as was the bathroom The bath was very narrow so with the shower over the bath it meant there was no elbow room bath approx 70cm wide , Position of the hotels right next to Covent garden was exellent
266627,The Waldorf Hilton, Function on floor below our room was so loud it vibrated through the headboard of our bed until 1am Check in staff rushed us through to get to the next customer Breakfast not well stocked needed to wait 20 minutes for refills of buffet sausages etc Not acceptable when you pay 309 GBP for room without even breakfast included I ve stayed in much better hotels for a fraction of the price , Location Bar 
266628,The Waldorf Hilton, On ark all are room was not ready at 6 45pm We had to take another room as ours was not ready which was a disability room No room service the next day until 4 40 just as we were getting ready to go out for the evening , Location very good
266629,The Waldorf Hilton, Room was poor for price paid view of fire escape stairs not expected when paying 345 per night for an executive queen room, Location friendliness of Staff
266630,The Waldorf Hilton, High prices that are not matched with the quality of the Hotel Rooms are small and lack eye for detail breakfast fairly mediocre for a five star hotel e g sugar clotted in old paper bags , The location is superb in Westend at the Strand 
266631,The Waldorf Hilton, Had to queue for breakfast and room looked tatty The bar in the evening was nice but v small so we had to sit in a waiting area to get in how many in the bar were guests at the hotel , All the staff were helpful and friendly Our room was very comfortable and spacious 
266632,The Waldorf Hilton, Turned away from bar and refused drinks at 7pm at night because we were told no tables available also told no tables available following morning for breakfast dispite paying 96 and being a resident also hotel ran out of many items like baileys peroni etc, Hotel position and room standard
266633,The Waldorf Hilton, Asked for an ice bucket twice but one was never delivered to the room Fully booked so no option to upgrade Wanted a bath in the room, Beautiful facilities and room with lovely staff
266634,The Waldorf Hilton, Nothing all excellent, Comfortable beds and pillows friendly helpful staff especially the Scottish concierge who went the extra mile Breakfast very nice Excellent location quiet and comfortable
266635,The Waldorf Hilton, Hotel was little dated and rooms small Wasn t what I expected going on what I heard of reputation , Location was perfect staff friendly and very helpful 
266636,The Waldorf Hilton, We did not like the tray with dirty crockery outside our room We reported this but it was still there in the evening In the end we moved it ourselves Considering what we were paying for the room this was unacceptable , We enjoyed the Executive Lounge
266637,The Waldorf Hilton, Nothing all was perfect, From the moment we arriv d and was greeted with a smile and courtesy the weekend was perfect as were the staff and accommodation
266638,The Waldorf Hilton,No Negative, The hotel was beautifully situated just over the bridge from Waterloo and a stone s throw from Covent garden The staff were all very helpful and the room was comfortable and well appointed 
266639,The Waldorf Hilton, We ordered room service and the man that delivered our food was not very friendly in fact we felt like we had put him about and we didn t receive all of our order but didn t say anything because of his manner, If your going to the theatre the Waldorf Hotel is perfect right on the door step it was very comfortable a beautiful building and the staff were polite but the best bit was the breakfast worth every penny and a good start to a busy day We would definitely stay again 
266640,The Waldorf Hilton, Room was far too warm even though AC was maxed out Our room was also next to something that required to be switched on 24 7 as it was very dull hum from somewhere Room service took 1h 5m when quoted 35m on phone , Location was excellent made all the difference to the trip 
266641,The Waldorf Hilton, Nothing , Staff always friendly and helpful Love staying at the Waldorf Executive lounge goodies on offer makes the package very competitive I stayed with 2 friends and we had a beautiful room 
266642,The Waldorf Hilton, Rooms are small for the price Toiletries small and could have been nicer Breakfast only average I ve had better in cheaper hotels , Bathroom room good size Hotel Good central location 
266643,The Waldorf Hilton, Being charged for wifi really in this day and age when wifi is free in mcdonalds why do hotels charge for wifi , Location and most of the staff went out of their way to help Great bar to come back to after an adventurous day sight seeing 
266644,The Waldorf Hilton, Unaware of child travelling so room not ready Allocated to alternative room which was cramped with extra bed in and very noisy from downstairs disco music etc until 2am Receptionist apologised arranged discount appreciated but lack of sleep spoiled weekend , The whole hotel is lovely and in an ideal place for all attractions Stayed several times with no problems Breakfast food exceptional choice 
266645,The Waldorf Hilton, For the money this hotel costs i wasn t pleased at all and this is the first bad review i have ever given the room was clean but the bath leaked and had to use all the towels to stop it flooding the TV didn t work properly the radio switch in the bathroom has never been connected and top it all of the bed was massive but was so uncomfortable i know this is personal preference but i am easily pleased usually , very clean and tidy rooms and the staff were helpful
266646,The Waldorf Hilton, Whilst the room was clean it wasn t cleaned beds made on our 2nd day which was very disappointing So after a long day at theatre Galleries coming back to an unmade room wasn t great , Excellent location comfortable room 
266647,The Waldorf Hilton, Better if they had draught Guinness in the bar , Location combined with comfortable spacious room and great staff made it very memorable We will return
266648,The Waldorf Hilton, Executive king room incredibly basic one dressing gown and no slippers to share between 2 2 small complimentary bottles of water No turn down service all in all not worth the 415 per night price tag , Beautiful bar comfortable bed superb location Breakfast was brilliant 
266649,The Waldorf Hilton, Twice out of three times when we asked for something they said they wud do it but didn t also shower leaked onto floor no matter what we tried to do to stop it the swinging door on the bathtub is just not built properly chuck, Great location nice sized room 
266650,The Waldorf Hilton, No free Wifi 12 99 per day Being woken up by housekeeping at 8 30am on a Saturday morning , Great location for West End and really good sized comfortable room 
266651,The Waldorf Hilton, Breakfast was cold and staff took forever to replace food after being asked several times Prices for drinks are extortionate we are used to staying in 5 star accommodation and have never been charged so much for poor service and drinks i e they had no idea what a Irish or liqueur coffee was then said we couldn t have one after 22 00 hrs Staff speak hardly any English although have to say very polite except for one of the concierge who gave us incorrect information on three separate occasions No one offered to take our luggage to our rooms , The rooms are very nice beds really comfortable and spotlessly clean They are also very quite so no trouble sleeping 
266652,The Waldorf Hilton, The only thing my sister and I did not like was the hard bed This meant we did not get any sleep We just dosed off and kept changing positions to stop us getting a sore side or back , Location Friendly staff Cheerful and very hardworking and very accommodating The room was quiet which was surprising bearing in mind its location Did not hear the other guests at all 
266653,The Waldorf Hilton, The afternoon tea was a gift for us and we waited a good 25 minutes before anyone bothered It appears that if you purchase an afternoon tea reservation rather than directly from the Waldorf they really do not bother , The 2 guys whom did assists us when needed Sunny Daniel 
266654,The Waldorf Hilton, Having somebody else s leftover bottle water in our room with no fresh water provided as part of the facility breakfast was cold and the scrbed egg running with water Sausages cheap and nasty and bacon not cooked properly poor quality food I had to leave mine with only couple mouth falls taken , Venue and location
266655,The Waldorf Hilton, The stampede for the buffet breakfast The service level of the Cocktail lounge and breakfast diner The lack of creature comfrots in the room and cocktail bar No turn down service in our room Not a single complementary chocolate or flower in our room , The quality of the room and the cleanliness of the Hotel 
266656,The Waldorf Hilton, Our first room had water seeping through the ceiling in the bathroom resulting from a bath overflow in the room next floor above Second room offered was inferior not a wise move when there were problems with our first room and we had already unpacked Third room offered was satisfactory but whole process took 45 minutes when we were up against time pressures to meet someone , Great location great feeling to the place
266657,The Waldorf Hilton, Road in front of hotel is really busy, Great location for theatres beautiful building great breakfast comfortable stylish spacious bedrooms and the staff was very friendly and professional 
266658,The Waldorf Hilton, Nothing not to like, From the moment you walked through the door to the moment you leave the staff are attentive smiling and extremely helpful They go that extra mile The rooms and facilities are first class
266659,The Waldorf Hilton, Found 5 black hairs in bathroom on arrival Breakfast was chaos with too many people and many staff not speaking English Wifi was very temperamental , Location is excellent 
266660,The Waldorf Hilton, room not available at 3pm in fact not ready for over an hour , concierge were excellent room was sizeable and well appointed bed comfortable room very clean 
266661,The Waldorf Hilton, Absolutely nothing, The entire experience was wonderful Couldn t fault the hotel or room or staff Nothing was too much trouble and they even put a chocolate cake in the room for my Cousin s 40th birthday It was a really lovely and totally unexpected surprise 
266662,The Waldorf Hilton, Breakfast was disappointing waited a long time for tea coffee after hunting down a waiter to order it Scrambled eggs from a packet and tinned button mushrooms were not the standard I expected , Excellent Reception and Door and Concierge staff very helpful and friendly Room was a fair size for a London Hotel Located over looking the central court yard so although we didn t have the best view it was very quiet 
266663,The Waldorf Hilton, One of the cups in the room was not washed before our arrival and was sticky Charged for laundry service which we did not use and was taken off the bill so people must check before paying , Loved the location of this hotel near Covent Garden which had great restaurants receptionist were happy and willing to help concierge staff always welcoming lovely room with a fab view of bt tower 618 close to bus stops where open top tour bus stops 
266664,The Waldorf Hilton, Uncomfortable beds and pillows Unhelpful door staff Dining room for breakfast too small for size of hotel service slow and not able to order food to be cooked fresh Room only serviced at 4 30pm and then arrived to do turn down 90 minutes later, Location is really good
266665,The Waldorf Hilton, Not up to standard expected Room small and rather dark No full length mirror which seems remiss Lifts not adequate for volume of guests and very slow Swimming pool only open 10 5 at weekends so very restricted to use Breakfast rather noisy and chaotic with tables crammed close to each other Reception busy and queues formed On checking out were informed we could have asked for mini fridge in room but no one told us on check in Hotel bar small for size of hotel and did not feel relaxing or comfortable Whole place could do wth facelift given iconic history of this London hotel , Location of hotel
266666,The Waldorf Hilton, The staff in the Homage restaurant were not very helpful or even assertive The food for dinner was average and the breakfast that was served every morning was stone cold on the hot plates For a Hilton Hotel I would of expected breakfast made to order not sitting in the middle of the room to go cold Also waiting 20 30 minutes for a table at breakfast is totally unacceptable , Location was really good and within walking distance of Covent Garden Oxford street and Carnaby Street 
266667,The Waldorf Hilton, The worst part of the stay was a leak from the ceiling drenching the bed in a musty yellow liquid which resulted in a slow room change at 0100 The free wifi available in the lobby didn t work , The staff were friendly enough 
266668,The Waldorf Hilton,No Negative, All the best luxury nuances that other hotels miss Amazing service Even we came down for breakfast late the duty manager organised for restaurant staff to prepare it for us including Eggs Benedict at no extra expense 
266669,The Waldorf Hilton, The breakfast at the hotel restaurant was a buffet not a problem per se but all of the food cold , Great location excellent staff superb accommodations I really enjoyed the hotel and would definitely return 
266670,The Waldorf Hilton, Made a few special requests Although some the requests were made others were ignored bit of a shame really as this important to our stay , Love this Hotel will always come back really enjoyed our stay The staff are always helpful and friendly Midtown Manhattan Hilton Staff take note of the above 
266671,The Waldorf Hilton, My parents liked everything about thier stay, I booked this trip for my parents wedding anniversary and the staff were wonderful They made my parents feel very special The room was lovely Nice size room My mother is OCD and she said the room was lovely and clean 
266672,The Waldorf Hilton,No Negative, Concierge and front of house service excellent Lovely room which was beautifully prepared and the maid came to check everything was ok and if we needed anything further Complementary touches were provided for my partner s birthday cake room decoration Location of the hotel perfect
266673,The Waldorf Hilton, Old hotel with smelly carpet and most rooms facing the rear to walls etc Way way out in price compared to the rooms and the hotel This is a 4 star hotel or lower and charges like a 5 hotel Not worth it , Position is excellent for theatres and restaurants 
266674,The Waldorf Hilton, No wifi in bedrooms Why on earth not I buy a coffee o get free wifi I stay and pay out good money for a hotel I would expect free wifi xxxx, The hotel is gorgeous and had amazing wow factor I m disabled and the staff couldn t have been more accommodating we felt very looked after xxxx
266675,The Waldorf Hilton, Got woken up at 3 am by a woman suddenly screaming something in the hall way lol , I booked to stay at the Waldorf last night as a surprise bday present for my boyfriend I had come for afternoon tea a few weeks ago and fell in love with the place Such friendly staff and the afternoon tea was the best I have had Last week I emailed the reservation team telling them it was my boyfriend s birthday surprise and they upgraded us to a larger room When we arrived yesterday we were early and the room wasn t ready yet so we went in Good Godfrey s lounge in the lobby for tea and scones When we went up to the room Omg It was beautiful I was so pleased We were on the 8th floor with views of the shard a huge bed double sinks huge bath tub seperate shower and it was all amazing We went for a meal I had booked at our favourite restaurant stk right opposite the hotel then came back after We didn t want to leave We paid for breakfast in the Homage restaurant this morning and I do recommend going for breakfast before 9am You get a free complimentary Buck s Fizz and it gets very busy after 9 When we were leaving there was a huge queue Over all I would advise everyone to completely ignore all the rubbish reviews on here because it really was 5 and worth every penny We will be coming back soon 
266676,The Waldorf Hilton, Got the room rate incorrect second time it s happened when staying here Says 24 hours room service but rang at 3am and no one answered Rang externally too and no one answered there could have been a problem Rude staff too ,No Positive
266677,The Waldorf Hilton, the persistent smell of feces in our room the quality of food of the room service and the too restricted list of available dishes after 11pm the breakfast insufficient quantity of food quality and choice should be better no bread available mistakes in orders the general feeling that the accountant is behind every single thing not enough shower gel not enough bread not enough sugar not enough tea not enough milk sheets not changed when necessary minibar not correctly reassorted the uncalled for embarrassing familiarity of certain members of the personnel the situation of the room last room of the last corridor on the last level only walk up reachable not for heavy suitcases , the size and decoration of the room the quietness of the room
266678,The Waldorf Hilton, Quality of the room including bed toilets equipment etc was just weak really bad To complete the picture the room was not properly cleaned including a wine glass that was just disgusting All in all very disappointing , Location is great
