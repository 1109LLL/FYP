211016,The Dorchester Dorchester Collection,No Negative, We stayed at the Dorchester for my sisters wedding The staff went out of their way to make sure we had a comfortable stay Before our travel we were worried about little things that might ruin our stay especially as we were traveling with our 8 month twins When we got to the hotel the staff we ever so polite amicable and most importantly approachable We managed to have a comfortable stay and little things like sterilizing babies bottles making their milk and ensuring they had comfortable naps became least of out worries as the hotel offered a complimentary extension to our check out time which was after the wedding ceremony had finished This allowed us to enjoy the wedding and plan our babies needs accordingly Thanks to all the staff at the Dorchester including the doormen who were extremely polite and welcoming We certainly will come back again 
211017,The Dorchester Dorchester Collection, None that I can recall , Staying at the Dorchester was a treat for my partner as this was an early birthday treat The staff the decor the ambience to the glamour and obvious history of the iconic hotel made this an experience to savour

211020,The Dorchester Dorchester Collection, So old the food quality is not that good it feels like a 4 stars hotel plus the facility is not that advanced and the TV was on the corner of the room which is very far a way from the bed or the sofa you have to turn off your head to watch it The water pressure of the shower box and the bathtub was very low i got an apology from the manager but seriously i don t think is enough cause i really paid for a special stranded and it was so below my expectation , LUXURY BUT 
211021,The Dorchester Dorchester Collection, I have checked out three days ago and until today they are still charging and refunding charging and refunding my credit card The worst hotel in this regards ever When I checked in I reminded them of the guest from Qatar whom I saw complaining about the same problem with the credit card on booking com website BUT They did the same to me and even worse Another thing I was a guest and couldn t book an afternoon tea for two days because as they say it s Valentine On the first day of my stay I managed to book but one of the staff Chinese origin female sat me very close to the entrance although it was 1 o clock and the place almost empty then Another employee a man sat me on a table inside after I told him I don t like this table In general I didn t feel it s worth the money I paid Will not stay there again especially after the credit card they are still charging I hope they stop after reading this , There is a nice lady from the guest service I think her name is Louisa 
211022,The Dorchester Dorchester Collection, The amount held on card for security after the stay I stayed on sat sun it is now Tuesday and still 732 being held over half of the bill for 2 rooms was paid in cash and the other on card My partner paid the card therefore he now has over 1000 held on his as well as mine as I booked with mine This not very useful to us or anyone else I shouldn t wonder , Great stay beautiful rooms service great everything about the stay perfect Both bars amazing China Tang Good 
211023,The Dorchester Dorchester Collection,No Negative, This is that second time the Dorchester hotel try to use my credit card after I finished all my bell and hold the invoicet that nothing more I have to bay for so can any one explain to me what is this mean Why I have to call them directly and lost my time to explain to them I don t have to bay more than one And in the end Theu sad sorry about mistakes It s Not supposed to happen with an ancient hotel like the Dorchester hotel Its It is shameful and very unfortunate The accounting department do more one They have to find out the weakness 
211024,The Dorchester Dorchester Collection, I was really looking forward to breakfast at this hotel as this is my favourite meal of the day The breakfast was awful The omelette was over cooked even though we asked for it medium done the sausages were hard and rubbery and there was not a good selection of bread just cheap toast was offered For a hotel of that calibre you would think that the breakfast would be first class I stayed at the Corinthia in the summer and the breakfast there was outstanding I was extremely disappointed with the breakfast at this hotel very sub standard considering it s a five star hotel and the very high rates they charge , Lobby area is beautiful It s nice just to sit and people watch The staff are also excellent 
211025,The Dorchester Dorchester Collection, They don t have any amenities like complementary tea coffee bath products Too much expensive room rate Too old fashioned interior , Kind staff classic and comfortable mood good location 
211026,The Dorchester Dorchester Collection, Room service was at best 3 too many folks in trainers and jeans gave the feeling of a informal meeting place Overall service was ok but compared to 2 other hotels we stayed at during our Xmas holidays the Dorchester doesn t come close , The promonade China Tang
211027,The Dorchester Dorchester Collection, All the restaurants were overbooked and only availability for Christmas lunch for example was at 16 30 The Gym is really small and old fashioned and not in keeping with a top quality hotel I have stayed at the Dorchester many times before and was most surprised to discover a really pungent smell of take out curry permeating the whole of the fourth floor This however was not the case on the floor below but rather unpleasant and disappointing , Good location and glamorous setting Very good range of high quality restaurants Efficient service 
211028,The Dorchester Dorchester Collection, Service not what I expect in a hotel of this calibre One hour and three phone calls for bottled water replenishing coffee mugs is one example , great location lovely rooms
211029,The Dorchester Dorchester Collection, NOTHING IT WAS FABULOUS, THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE AT THE DORCHESTER WAS MAGNIFICENT THE HOTEL IS FIRST CLASS BUT THE STOUND OUT POSITIVE IS THE STAFF I HAVE TRAVELLED THE WORLD AND STAYED AT MANY 5 STAR HOTELS NOTHING COMES CLOSE TO THE LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT THE STAFF AT THE DORCHESTER PROVIDE THEY ARE FRIENDLY SCRUPULOUSLY POLITE AND KNOW HOW TO MAKE THEIR GUESTS WELCOME
