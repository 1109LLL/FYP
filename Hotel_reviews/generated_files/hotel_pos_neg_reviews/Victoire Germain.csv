260049,Victoire Germain, I liked everything about this hotel , The location was perfect right off of Rue Saint Germain nestled a small street with outdoor cafes shops and services We walked about 150 meters from the train station Had breakfast there and it was delicious for the 14 00 sur charge we had fresh cooked eggs and bacon fresh brewed coffee juices fresh baked pastries cheese and meats The next day we went down the street to a cafe for the more Parisian relaxed breakfast We walked to all of the main tourist attractions except to the eiffel tower 
260050,Victoire Germain, Our train got cancelled but we still got charged for our room for the night we were not staying there I know it s not their fault but it wasn t ours either, Excellent location for everything we wanted to do In a lovely part of the city and getting to it via the metro is very easy I d be happy to recommend this hotel 
260051,Victoire Germain, Internal doors could have better soundproofing Other than that a shower cap in the bathroom would be good and we didn t have breakfast in the hotel because the breakfast room was in the basement Plenty of places to have breakfast nearby though , We had a great stay here The location is great The bed was the most comfortable bed I can remember sleeping in The bathroom was small but the walk in shower was spacious and had a great shower and the air conditioning was perfect effective and almost completely silent The reception staff are fantastic so helpful and efficient as well as friendly and pleasant Thank you for a wonderful stay 
260052,Victoire Germain, The rooms were rather small , Although the rooms were rather small we got everything we needed It was very clean and the beds were very comfortable and the staffs very friendly I have been travelling Paris frequently but in terms of value for money it was the best 
260053,Victoire Germain, Rooms are small , The location was prime next to popular restaurants and cafes and within walking distance of many attractions The front desk staff was friendly helpful with restaurant advice and spoke excellent English The room had been recently remodeled with an extremely comfortable extra large bed and a small but beautiful bathroom The air conditioning was wonderful during a hot spell in Paris The in room Nespresso machine was a plus We especially appreciated the thoughtful lighting room and reading 
260054,Victoire Germain, Everything was just sensational , We were greeted by one the most friendliest staff and quickly found out all the staff were amazingly friendly but this one young lady in particular made me fall in love with Paris She was attentive to our needs helped us in and around the city and was just a breath of fresh air to walk down to each morning The location of this boutique hotel is central to everything Metro is 200 mtrs away the best restaurants around are just around the corner The bedroom is a little small but the bathroom made up for that I mean for its location it is understandable The bed was the most comfortable bed I have slept in truly amazing I cannot recommend highly enough this accommodation and the staff fantastic it made our time in Paris truly memorable Thank you
260055,Victoire Germain, No complaints at all, Location was perfect buzzing area but just off the main drag Fantastic restaurants bars and shops on your doorstep Staff were extremely helpful and friendly Room was spotless and very comfortable bed 
260056,Victoire Germain, Fixed timing for room cleaning We were out the whole morning and came back after lunch to have a short nap However the room hasn t been cleaned were told that they were about to clean our room now or the cleaner would have to leave for the day In the end we opted not to have our room cleaned Not a huge issue but could have used the time we were away to clean the room , Walking distance to lots of restaurants and several metro stations The Seine was just a short walking distance away Great staff and fast wifi
260057,Victoire Germain, Just one small thing in our room 20 there s not enough space for clothes We were there for 3 days which was just about ok but a week of living out of a suitcase would have been a nuisance However it wouldn t stop me booking this lovely hotel again , Superb peaceful location right in the thick of everything 5 minutes stroll to Pont Neuf Easy walk to many famous places and minutes away from lovely restaurants and the Metro Smart modern room gorgeous shower dreamy bed I wouldn t bother staying anywhere else 
260058,Victoire Germain, The trip wa too short, Beautifully renovated boutique hotel Staff were amazing and always friendly Room was generous with modern decor and a great bed The bathroom was small but met all our needs and besides this is city centre so to be expected This was in the perfect location to explore Hotel is still in its first year and I sure they will have many return visitors I highly recommend this hotel
260059,Victoire Germain, Size of the room the room was small and withouth an armchair but it s difficult to find better in the hearth of Paris for a reasonable price, Perfect Location for visiting the city but also for enjoying the evening many good bars and restaurants close to the hotel Staff friendly kind and willing to help
260060,Victoire Germain,No Negative, Spacious room with beautifully appointed bathroom and large king size bed Located with many restaurants around it it made for a lovely night s stay 
260061,Victoire Germain, There was a little noise through the walls but nothing too bad Room was small but it s Paris , The staff was friendly and helpful Our bed was incredibly comfortable Location was perfect Although the room was small it felt very comfortable 
260062,Victoire Germain, There s nothing I didn t like about the hotel itself The only issue some people may have if they are in a front facing room is that there is an Irish pub a few doors down where the patrons often hang out in the street out front smoking and talking If you are a light sleeper and in a front facing room you might hear some noise from the street , Great location on a small restaurant lined street Only 10 minute walk from the St Michel Notre Dame RER station with connections to both Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports Friendly staff Nice Scandinavian inspired decor Super comfy bed Loved the scents of the bathroom amenities
260063,Victoire Germain, Watch out for the towel radiator in the bathroom They get very hot and if you bend over you can get a burnt bottom , Great design super comfy beds and in a cool location What more could you ask for We loved stepping out and having everything on the doorstep But what we really loved was how quiet our room was despite being in a busy area You will love a stay here We will be recommending to anyone staying in the city for a long weekend 
260064,Victoire Germain, The room like most in Paris was quite small Not an issue though considering how nice it was , The staff were very friendly and helpful printed off some documents for us and lent us travel adapters The location is in a great area with lots of bars and cafes Within walking distance of the river boat cruise Louvre Etc Supermarket around the corner The room was very nice with a good TV and a lovely bathroom

260070,Victoire Germain,No Negative, The location is very nice right in the heart of everything going on in central Paris This is a clean relatively new hotel and is within 10 15 minutes of key tourist sites restaurants shops etc The front desk staff is very friendly always going above and beyond to help Would definitely return 
260071,Victoire Germain, The hotel is friendly and well maintained at an excellent location However while it may be pleasant for young people we are senior citizens and we found the rooms very cramped wth almost no space to hang clothes or shelves Also the rooms are rather claustrophobic So despite reserving for eight nights we moved on after one night to the Holiday Inn St Germain also booked via booking com It met our expectations and even though we booked on the same day offered much better value for money ,No Positive
260072,Victoire Germain,No Negative, Huge surprise and profesional service We could not arrive because of the accident and even when our booking was non refundable so we got a big discount on the next arrival valid whle year We re very pleased and thank you It is extremely important that it treat guests like this We will come for sure
