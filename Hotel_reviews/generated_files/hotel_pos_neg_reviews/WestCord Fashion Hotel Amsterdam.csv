338984,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Staff behind reception were not very welcoming and arrogant at times the resturants not very accomadating for vegetarians you can t have something standard that is not on the menu ie cheese salad instead of ham or chicken ceaser salad and you also can t change anything on the menu eg with no meat or a sandwich with no onion if the menu says there is onion in the toastie silly things that I have not had the problem with in any other hotel was shocking the hotel maid just walked in our room while we were getting ready to go into centraal found that very rude but she did apologised instantly we only got given 2 tea bags a day and 2 small pots of milk a day 2 glass cups which one of the days didn t get replaced along with the milk and tea bags also our shower toiletries and towels did not get replaced on that same day so we went and Baught our own we told maid the next morning but other than that these are not major things and would not affect most people overall the hotel was lovely and I would recommend it to people we really enjoyed our stay here , Clean hotel in a ok location very modern with great facilities

338990,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The view wasn t great and the TV channels were difficult to navigate but I was there to see Amsterdam not watch telly I found the fridge a bit annoying because I like to buy my own food so storage was a problem, The bed was really comfortable and your swimming pool is just the right temperature and a great length for doing laps So I was very pleased to be able to keep up my fitness regime Also having a bath is great it helps to be able to relax at the end of a day with some bubbles I also stayed in close to Amsterdam for a couple of days and I enjoyed having a change being in the commercial centre with the local supermarkets and cafes The tram was close and quick to get to the city centre and the sights
338991,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast at 19 each is nice but a little expensive and the lobby bar food is poor, Modern hotel well located with friendly staff comfy beds plus for 45 extra you can upgrade your room to add slippers fluffy robes fresh fruit water chocolate and a late check out of 3pm on day of departure 
338992,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Skyy bar was a little disappointing , Nice comfy bed large clean rooms good bath and shower excellent coffee machine Downstairs Restaurant was excellent even though a little pricey 10 minute walk to the Vondelpark which is a fantastic place to relax and walk cycle 
338993,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The lift was a little slow but that s scraping the barrel for something to complain about, The room was clean spacious and well equipped with a roomy walk in shower and bath The glass shower door opens into the bedroom so if you re a little shy that could be a problem The restaurant options including breakfast were comprehensive and very reasonably priced

338997,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, There s not really any appreciation or value for the customer No complimentary water tea etc and the room service was incredibly appalling It took 2 hours for hot chocolate to be brought to the room , Absolutely beautiful hotel Very easy on the eye and very comfortable
338998,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Great location good restaurant bar and patio on site Check in service was fast and efficient with staff friendly and knowledgeable We had a large party 24 people and the hotel added extra staff on a couple of occasions to help accommodate us both in the restaurant and on the patio which was greatly appreciated and made our stay very family friendly Great accommodations overall the hotel also included an interior pool sauna and spa as well and I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel and if given the opportunity will return very classy modern accommodations 
338999,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, I have expected to have free slippers and bathrobe My first room had windows which couldn t be opened so I received an other room The offer for the breakfast is the same every day OK for few days but not for a week or more Good food in the restaurant but no diverse for lunch and dinner The receptionist didn t inform me about using the card room in the lift and I spent 5 minutes going up and down till somebody finally helped me to proceed properly , Good room size for Amsterdam comfy bed facilities for tea coffee clean and quiet the orientation was to interieur court Breakfast very good and diverse fresh juices pancakes fruits meat warm and cold meal everything you need Also there is a nice restaurant I had a good onion soup for lunch and fish chips for dinner 5 minutes by foot till the tram 1 to Amsterdam city centre 20 25 min to Dam Square I enjoyed to stay there and I definitely recommend this hotel to all my friends

339001,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Pool was closed for maintenance on the one day Apart from that no issues, Beds were very comfortable Competitive prices for food drinks at the hotel Staff very friendly and could not do enough to help Not far from the airport and tram is a 5 minute walk direct tram into Amsterdam
339002,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Maybe it would be better if the room services ex food asking for a travel adapter were not self serviced It s a bit embarrasing to go down in the middle of the night in jammies while the guests and staff downstairs are all dressed up Also hopefully the gym could open earlier and close at a later time , The hotel itself was beautiful It had different areas that catered to various needs Its facilities ex gym pool spa and its services ex tram tickets sightseeing suggestions were so comprehensive and efficient The staff were also so prompt and helpful 
339003,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Location could have been nearer to City as didn t expect hotel to be on outskirts but the tram service was regular, Breakfast choices good and rooms clean and modern Staff friendly and helpful
339004,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, I was staying in a twin room with an old school friend the bathrooms have a glass door and window allowing anyone else in the room to see you in the bathroom and shower not the toilet that s private and seperate it didn t bother me but could see it being embarrassing in other situations ,No Positive
339005,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Disgustingly poor food hygiene practice Poor customer service they really don t care Even scrimp on tea bags They advertise bikes to hire but had none left each time we asked Too far from centre, Proximity to Vondel Park and to the airport Presence of a swimming pool 
339006,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Bar upstairs was a little too formal The breakfast room service was a little over the top with breads Would have liked a little more warm food for the amount that we paid Otherwise the food was nice, Fantastic room and even had our own nespresso coffee machine 
339007,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The only thing I would have liked to be better was the hairdyer there were 3 females in our room and it had no power at all when travelling hand luggage a hairdryer is hard to take with you that really is the only thing I d like to see changed , The transport via the tram was very simple to use it was only a 7 minute walk and on a safe road the link to the airport was good although we did get a bit mixed up when we first arrived fine going back to the airport though The hotel was lovely and the staff were very pleasant too The triple room we had was great for space and comfort Amsterdam is a great cityto visit and I d definately return I d stay at this hotel too

339009,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The restaurant service took too long i e from taking our order to delivering it We had to wait 25 minutes for our coffees which we had to chase the staff twice on where they were They stated that it was due to the delays from the kitchen which if this was the case they should have notified us as we had a ferry to catch in the afternoon , The rooms were a good size and the underground parking 
339010,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The decoration felt outdated and the overall cleanliness was fair Rooms felt dusty Also the location is a little remote requiring some walking to nearest public transport , Spa nearby Good gym and pool

339014,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Tables at breakfast were not cleaned fast enough and sometimes we had to sit at the dirty table until the waiter cleaned it , Location of the hotel is very good close to tram station where nr 1 and 17 are taking you straight to the city centre A drive by taxi if traffic is low is around 20 EUR to Dam square and around 35 40 EUR for Schiphol airport We had a family room which was great spacious clean two sitting chairs big sofa very comfortable bed and nice bathroom with separate toillet We also used swimming pool area and water temperature was around 30 C perfect even for our little baby Breakfast was served 7 10 am and until 11 am on weekends excellent for night birds Choice was excellent cooked food fruits scented water fruit juices pancakes you name it Would definitely raccommend this hotel to everyne decor is interesting staff was very profesional and friendly It is a bit expensive but taken the other accomodation prices in Amsterdam it still gives you a good value for money 
339015,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Lighting in the room is a bit dark The food choice at the restaurant was so so Would have been nice to have breakfast hours last a bit longer say until 11 It is about a 20 min tram ride into the city centre So this can be a bit long but it is only 1 tram so easily done , The staff at the hotel were excellent Cannot say enough about how great they were There is a great bar on the 10th floor and the bartender Julian is amazing Clean rooms Comfy beds Vast TV selection The train to the airport is quick only 1 stop away which is great

339020,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Purchased 4 day tickets to the tram for 24 hours but no one told us that children pay only 1 3 of the price of an adult A very inattentive staff at the front desk Some one more attentive would point this out to us and not have check in women on the tram point it out to us and tell us that we have overpaid , Very nice modern hotel Location is about 15 min by tram from Dam Place Good breakfast Half price for kids
339021,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, A little expensive overall but not that bad Really the only thing that was dissapointing was the skyybar It was very poor It gave the impression of something nicer and somewhere you could go to and then sit outside looking over the city but in reality it was just a small room with badly stained seats and an odd smell The downstairs bar was much nicer , The pick up from the airport in a taxi for 9 was fantastic Check in very easy room large bathroom spacious and good toiletries Large windows let light in bed comfy Buffet breakfast was amazing and has everything you could want added bonus of a swimming pool was great to use after breakfast before heading out The tram stop is only a 5 min stroll from the hotel and takes you to Central Station in around 15 mins The area around is nice and I recommend Cafe Oslo around 7 mins walk from the hotel Great food great drinks selection and you can sit outside and take in the day 
339022,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The front desk staff was knowledgeable however they were overwhelmed when two to three people were at the front desk Additional front desk staff may be needed , We stayed at the WestCord on the last night of our honeymoon and only night in Amsterdam When we arrived back at the hotel to go to sleep we received a beautiful bottle of champagne roses and chocolate covered strawberries with turn down service It was the perfect touch to the end of the perfect honeymoon Thank you to the staff at the westcord for making our night so special 
339023,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing, Just everything about the Hotel and Staff were very polite helpful but most of all they seemed very happy We were there to celebrate our Golden Wedding Anniversary and the staff made it all very special for us Our room large double overlooked gardens was beautiful The location was only a 5 min walk to Tram Station and a pleasant walk to Vondal Park We booked the breakfasts which were excellent and dined in on one evening food was delicious and very well presented could not fault hotel on anything 
339024,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Taxi driver dropped us off at rear entrance so had to carry luggage up a steep set of stairs to get to main reception No obvious information to let us know of a better way , The hotel is great value for money The location for me was very good The rooms were of a good standard which made the stay nice 
339025,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, I booked it for me and my partner and we were given 2 single beds so much sure you request double bed , Hotel is lovely and the staff are great Its clean and very stylish Lots to choose from at Breakfast The restaurant and bar is nice Would recommend getting the Tram into central Amsterdam as it is only a short journey and a lot cheaper to do it this way We were getting cabs on the first day and only discovered the tram on the second day 
339026,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, I didn t like that for the price buttons were missing from the tap inthe bathroom and that breakfast wasn t included and that we had to pay for the sauna , I liked the overall look of the hotel 
339027,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Nicest hotel room I have ever stayed in The Beds were very comfortable and the room itself was so clean and tidy The staff were also very helpful and polite Only thing I have to say bad about it is the distance from the city centre 20 minute tram ride and it can be confusing at night time

339029,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The coffee machine in our room didn t work properly I think having it and the drinks dispenser plugged in at the same time trips the fuse We left a note asking to have the coffee machine fixed but it never did work despite the note being removed , The location staff breakfast and facilities were all great 
339030,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The price a bit high But since I visited in June it may well be the average for Amsterdam and this location , The rooms and the hotel overall is quite spacious There s a terrace which can be covered It s great for enjoying the precious sunlight Both Rembrandt and Vondelpark s are nearby The hotel is not in the city centre but in a family neighbourhood It s quiet and good for a rest after long eventful day Don t forget to hit the indoor swimming pool no cap is needed 
339031,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, No supermarkets or restaurants in the neighbourhood , Everyone we met at the hotel from front desk to housekeeping was very friendly and helpful They made us feel really welcome After an overnight 12 hour flight it was such a bonus to find that they had a room available so we could check in right away for a recuperating nap before heading out to explore the city Room was clean bed comfortable Breakfast offered a wide variety of delicious quality food Some had said that the hotel s distance from the tram station is a disadvantage Actually the 10 min stroll we did everyday was quite enjoyable provided the weather is fine Overall I rate my experience with Westcord Fashion even better than with some of the more expensive downtown 5 star hotels Next time I will choose them again 
339032,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Can t think of anything we didn t like , Convenience of the tram We were two blocks away from a pick up point and it was convenient and easy to see the city via the tram Multi day tickets were available at the Westcord desk 
339033,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The hotel is very nice and the staff members went out of their way to be friendly and helpful The location is not very good for sightseeing tourism a long walk from the city center I spent a lot of money on taxis 
339034,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, 1 The parking system require many manual process 2 The staff didn t arrange additional bad although we pre order it In addition the customer representative in the hotel conducted an empty argument with us instead of admitting the mistake , 1 Good access to the highways 2 Nice pool but small one 3 Good Breakfast and hotel restaurant

339036,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, our room was not cleaned until about 7pm which was disappointing as we wanted to have a wash etc before going out for dinner , the hotel was excellent With the exception of the comment below regarding the cleaning of the room which I am sure is a one off I can only praise the hotel 
339037,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, 20 euro extra for breakfast seems quite harsh, Location is fantastic tram lifts you no more than 5mins walk away and can take you tonall main tourist spots
339038,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, We were quite disappointed with the restaurant and lounge bar food, The bed was really comfortable and the location was good as it was out from the hustle and bustle but very close to public transport so we didn t feel too far away from anything

339040,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, getting to and from the city was a bit of a stretch i was under the impression we could walk into the town which really isn t the case also we were given very poor directions the first eve and wasted the first night walking around for hours trying to find the city center which after two hours we didn t and luckily found the hotel again very disappointing , the restaurant with the beautiful flowers was stunning 
339041,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, 10 for sauna and 4 5 that s unfair when you are paying 220 per night The staff at the lobby bar they pretend not seeing you and are very lazy I had to get the menu 3 times by myself The hotel is a bit out of the way you have a 500 meters walk to get to the tram which get you to the centre , Breakfast pool terrace coffe machine in the room security

339048,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Hotel is a little out of the way from Amsterdam centre and the nearest tram bus stop is about 500m away Not an issue for active travelers but may be a problem for those with mobility issues Getting to the centre takes about 20mins on the tram and the hotel will sell you a travel pass that covers buses trams metro which is very good value Trams run frequently and until very late into the night , The staff were brilliant from the front desk to restaurant staff We had an issue which was handled very professionally and with great sympathy consideration by the hotel management Rooms are very comfortable and facilities are excellent I can highly recommend the Spa too 
339049,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Excellent stay would come back again but it was a little hot in our room and seemed the cooler didn t work , staff and the room very friendly and very nice 
339050,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, if i had to say one negative point it would be that its a bit of a distance to walk to Dam square from the hotel it would take about 45 mins if your strolling but a enjoyable lovely walk probably a bit far if you have walking difficult taxis are very easy to get and cost about 15 euros approx was told to always try and use TCA taxis , everything sky bar was a lovely relaxing bar to chill out in the evenings very quiet relaxing hotel staff excellent very polite and friendly

339068,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Restaurant choices expensive for the quantity and quality of the food Would have preferred menu to vary from one night to the next Had bad experience with quality of meals on one evening After complaining a fair adjustment was made to the bill which improved the situation but felt that the hotel had been let down by this fall in standard , Good breakfast selection with fresh fruit and smoothies Large bedroom with seating large comfortable bed and great pillows Huge bath with plenty of hot water as well as separate shower and separate toilet Plenty of space for computers etc Efficient free wifi 
339069,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The Sky Bar with its ear bleedingly loud music on the night that I visited I suspect I m too old for such bars but even my 20 year old daughter thought it ridiculously loud too , Friendly and helpful staff Lovely clean room and very comfortable bed 
339070,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Although close to RAI and Schipiol and walking distance to metro the walk itself by half deserted building sites was not one I would have felt comfortable doing at night Also nearest local shops nearly a mile away , Comfortable hotel
339071,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Room is quite expensive but not very comfortable the door to the bathroom was absolutely transparent which is not nice everybody needs a bit of privacy Air conditioner was not easy to adjust the air in the night was very dry and no chance to open the window Breakfast was OK but nothing really special or enjoyable Choice of bread was minimalistic whole wheat bread was not presented we have got only white bread plus some bread in plastic The hotel takes additional deposit about 100 EUR when you check in with my debit MasterCard it was immediately booked out from account It took some days to get it back Small issue but not giving pleasant feeling Did not have this experience in other hotels , The restaurant is very good We had nice dinner with flavour of Italy fresh baguette fantastic olive oil food was delicious and interesting If you are in this hotel try this restaurant

339074,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, One of the key cards for one of the group stopped working and therefore we had to ask for a new one I understand that the hotel needed clarification of our stay for security purposes but the attitude of the night porter was extremely rude This was on a our last night and previously the staff had been very helpful however this experience fell very far from our expectations He was eventually persuaded by the confirmation email and two forms of ID however the encounter was an unpleasant experience I m not sure what would have happened if our friend hadn t been able to get in touch with me in order to provide confirmation of the room Would he have been refused entry , Rooms were excellent and the Skyy Bar was a great place to finish off an evening For the most part the staff were helpful and courteous The hotel was located near a tram stop for easy access into the city centre If you want to stay out in Amsterdam until later in the evening after the trams have stopped I wouldn t recommend this hotel as a taxi back from the centre is rather expensive but it suited our purposes 
339075,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, It s not so convenient if u need to pull your luggages from nearest tram station surinaplein to hotel as it is at least 750m away few restaurants near hotel and those few are not convenient to use public transport and a bit far to walk maybe more than 1 2km room has separate WC and bath areas shower floor could b slippery, Service level was good staff was accommodating to all our requests breakfast spread was great

339117,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Room wasn t as big as it looked on the photos Breakfast was okay but was NOT worth 38 euros for two that appeared on my check out invoice seriously disappointed that price was not advised when we were sat down Found the whole stay at the hotel very expensive in general as the room was nearly 300 euros for two nights and it was very secluded away from wherever you need to be , Skyy bar was a very cool atmosphere that could be enjoyed by any age 18 very clean room hotel was very secure room was nice 
339118,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The room wasn t clean enough the shower kept leaking on to the floor so couldn t enjoy a shower without worrying about that the hairdryer in the bathroom the room service charges and prices 20 for a toasted sandwich and to be deliveried No vending machines in the hotel was the worst part Also I was messaged the hotel back and fort before my trip about partner birthday they told me they would give complentarty slippers and bathrobes in room waiting but when we arrived they werent there I had to ring and ask also they told me they would give me and my partner for his birthday free cocktail each for sky bar and a happy birthday message which we were never given Wasn t too happy about that The bathrobes were appalling also like hard rough towels made into it Cheap not comfortable , The pool the view from our room
339119,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, I thought it was poor that you had to pay 5 for delivery charge on room service lighting in the rooms could of been better it was just a bit dull in there that s just being a bit picky , Brilliant sized bed how secure the property was location of the hotel was easy to get in the centre bathroom was great and overall lovely hotel We didn t eat at the hotel but the food served looked nice

339131,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Pool a bit on the small size and is unmanned so can get a bit rowdy with people dive bombing etc Not very relaxing after a treatment Sauna steam area is nude only and quite an experience Both pool and sauna is an extra charge from the room rate which I think is OK as the board price is so reasonable , Bed was huge and comfy Staff really helpful and friendly Treatments were ok body wrap was quite poor but sports massage excellent so OK as an average Food v v good 
339132,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Pillows not very comfortable and also no fresh water in room each day it had to be purchased from the desk for a 4 star hotel I think water is standard in each room, Bed very comfortable
339133,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, No divided shoe free zone area in the changing rooms meaning the floor was dirty and you had to walk between the changing rooms and pool where outside shoes had been trodden , Skybar Restaurant shoe cleaning machine facilities all staff reception cleaning team friendly swimming pool cleaniness quiet rooms no corridor sound or aircraft road sound but our bedroom was at the back of the hotel 
339134,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, We didn t get any slippers or a bath robe which I am used to getting even in hotels with less stars , The bath tub was great and the bed really was extra comfy 
339135,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The aircon could have been a bit more powerful We had to leave it on for quite a long time to feel it but this was due to the size of the room , We loved the atmosphere and music in the sky bar The room was beautiful and the staff were happy to help with any queries
339136,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Location slightly out but tram takes 25 mins in to central Food and drinks very expensive, Great rooms perfect Very fresh rooms nice an warm lovely views Great entertainment at sky bar

339138,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The staff is not professional I opted for the spoil me package that was a huge dissapointment They state daily fruit and snacks while I actually got just a banana and 2 2x2cm brownies the first day and nothing the second The package also was supposed to include the late check out by 15h My card got blocked before 15 and I had to revisit the reception to get it working again This was not a problem for me but really shows that they are not in sync and have no idea who paid for the pavkage and who hasn t I had received the mineral water and shampoos only the first day and had to call the reception and ask for additional ones Even though the package said DAILY mineral water and toiletteries Then at about 14 15 even though i had the do not disturb sign on my door was in fact disturbed by the employee at the reception who said to me and I quote You know you have to check out I replied yes by 15 00 to what she said By 15 00 Okay No apologies nothing Not really on the level of a 4star hotel Finally I requested a company receipt on my email address in english First i got the normal invoice then i got the company one in dutch and had to double check it twice to arrive at the reception one last time and then I was told i cannot get it in english because i had already checked out My company has very strict rules regarding the receipts for the trips I take and without a propper one I would have to cover the expences by myself so this was a problem for me All in all I am very dissapointed by the service I received Would not stay here again not recommended The employees that were not helpful were mr Carol and trainees whose names i wont mention as they are still learning , new has a nice pool and sauna but had to pay extra for it 10 Good breakfast clean

339141,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Fire alarm went off one day at 4 30am There was no communication or a member of staff in site It was a false alarm and all we received was a piece of chocolate as an apology left in our room the following day ,No Positive
339142,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing I did not like except a false fire alarm in the early hours It happens there was an apology Safe in the room did not work Getting into the city centre is straight forward tram 1 or 17 but you are a bit out of the way in a fairly non descript area , The room was comfortable and nicely decorated Checking in and out was straightforward The Skybar has a good view and pleasant ambience 
339143,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The location of the hotel is just a little far if you are looking for a walk as there is nothing much to do near bye , We really enjoyed to hotels facilities like the swimming pool the bar the restaurant but mainly the sky bar on the top floor 
339144,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Check in was smooth staff were polite and it was a speedy process We had a twin room and it is a lot smaller than the images portray but this wasn t a major problem we settled in easily and the views from the room were nice and calm Although overpriced the breakfast buffet was lovely there was a nice variety We figured it worked out cheaper and better than getting a taxi to a get breakfast as the hotel is isolated from everything not in central amsterdam The pool is small and the changing areas are awful no privacy no lockers and one tiny shower There unfortunately were children s swimming lessons going on during our stay so several of us including children boys and girls were cramped into the whole spa area The hotel should keep such events separate from when hotel guests can use the spa facilities Overall the stay was pleasant and the hotel served its purpose 
339145,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The woman who worked in the sky bar refused my partner entry because of the shoes he was wearing This was embaressing as we were with friends and everyone else was allowed entry It was obvious we were guests at the hotel and my partner was wearing comfy SMART trainers as he has an ankle injury at the moment The woman upstairs was quite rude about this Also the pool area was nice however you had to be naked in order to use the sauna which we felt was rather odd It would be nice if you could order drinks to relax with besides the pool , The room was lovely and very clean The breakfast at the hotel was great and there was a lot of selection The coffee machine in our room was another great touch The location of the hotel was good and it was very easy to access public transport into the centre

339147,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Lovely hotel Great facilities Lovely pool Lovely staff Very clean very close to tram stop Not fat form the centre Great value for money It s the second time I ve stayed in this hotel 
339148,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Bit far from heart of Amsterdam but 3 5 min walk will take you to the tram stop then it s only around 10 mins to city Room 643 was quiet smaller than the rest on the floor witch was a bit annoying to see other guests with a bigger room on the same floor also it was right beside the cleaners room witch was quiet loud at times when they opened and closed the door , Beds were very comfortable staff were friendly clean rooms free wifi and the food was nice showers was lovely 
339149,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Ordered two rooms with 2 single beds they were there but every time the rooms were serviced they were pushed together to make one bed which defeated the purpose to me But that not a big deal at all easily dealt with , The hotel was very clean and well heated the staff were accommodating and very kind The rooms were sound proof too we didn t get complaints of load music like I thought we would have thankfully 
339150,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The location We was aware it was one tram ride away however it is a ten minute walk to the tram stop and then no less then 25 minutes into dam square on the tram There was also no shops or facilities nearby unless you wanted to walk 15 minutes down the highway , The hotel itself was lovely and all the staff was very welcoming The room was clean modern and comfortable The beds was huge and defiantly fit for a good night sleep I couldn t fault the hotel or room itself bar location Our telly had broken the first day so we had rang down to reception and they replaced it straight away no problems The room service was also outstanding The hotel was quiet and calm considering it being on the edge of a highway 
339151,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The swimming pool is quite good but just to say something the lighting and the ceiling could be improved a bit , The room has got a nice modern design it was so cozy clean and confortable Really good bathroom with both bath and shower and a separate toilet Perfect for a trip to Amsterdam I would repeat no doubt There is a coffe machine and a kettle to have coffee or tea in the room itself Ironing facilities and even an umbrella just in case Perfect 
339152,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Pool closed during one of our days which was disappointing , Rooms are beautiful beds are amazing big and comfortable Sky Bar is also relaxing and views are special 
339153,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Friendly staff very clean and modern great sound prof as we was on the 10 floor next to the sky bar we could not here any noise Want to say a big thanks to taco he was great and gave stunning service
339154,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, the Sky bar was dissapointing and unless you are a party of more than 2 siting at the window for the views seems to not be an option we were given seats in a dark cubicle opposite the bar and when a table came free at the window we asked could we move but told no as that was for table of 4 or more then to our supprise 3 people were then given the seat, bedroom good with excellence shower
339155,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The fact that there wasn t already slippers and a dressing gown in our room Instead we had request them Also our covers were not changed until our last day On the first night we requested for glasses and some water and those were the same glasses for the whole stay We was not very happy about that ,No Positive
339156,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Little bit far from everything but tram stop just up the road makes it easy to get around , Great hotel Lovely and clean and extremely safe Liked the fact that you could only get into the hotel after a certain time with your room key 
339157,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The service was excellent and the room beyond our expectations This helped us giving an experience we shall remember for a long time even though we only stayed for a single night 
339158,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Couldn t have a shower as it was blocked twice Had to get changed rooms as the one we requested wasn t available on the first night, Couldn t have a shower as it was blocked twice
339159,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, I found it quite rude how a member allowed another guest to cut in front of me in line completely disregarding me and not apologising for it I only had a small query and this was very off putting I usually stay in 5 s for this reason The facilities are generally similar however the service is what makes the difference They also weren t very helpful with small requests I tried to explain I only needed a car parking ticket for one day of the stay on a number of occasions On check out I was charged for 2 days The bathroom wasn t clean on arrival The towels in the bathroom were very thin , The hotel itself was reasonably decorated The bathroom was nice The beds were comfortable and the sheets were very clean I didn t get chance to use the spa facilities which I usually do when travelling but they do have good opening hours 
339160,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel is a bit out of town and required a 15 minute tram ride into town the trams are very easy so not a massive problem Worth the travel for the hotel, Lovely hotel very pleased and would definitely stay again
339161,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The pool was out of use and no alternative of using any other pool in the whole of Amsterdam was offed Spa vouchers were given instead but only after we complaint , The room cleanliness breakfast
339162,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Thanks to the front desk team members very pleasant to see that they are always available for help Thanks to Anita from the bar where I was enjoying my breakfasts I recomend the mercure breakfast dish great to start the day 
339163,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, A few basic issues hairdryer is DREADFUL so if you have long hair or hair that needs styling it is close to useless so bring your own Also the design of the bathroom is strange it has a glass wall door so whilst i was in the shower we ordered room service but they couldn t come in as the walkway would have meant I was very exposed Such a silly design And the hairdryer being in the bathroom and attached to a unit means you cant use it if someone else is in the bathroom Plus the glass door is an accident waiting to happen I hope the hotel reads this Finally the staff lacklustre on check out i am not sure she even noticed i was there paying let alone wish me a pleasant day or ask how our stay was I did like the hotel honestly just a few gripes particularly around design faults and receptions service , Reception is impressive and has great facilities if you make use of them and its a short tram ride into the centre and just a short train ride from Airport Lovely big beds too It is a very modern looking hotel so perfect for young couples groups of friends or someone just loving a more creative environment Sky Bar is nice and great service and nice selection of cocktails 
339164,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, I was really disappointed that the price Booking com gave me differed from the actual costs even though we booked way in advanced their room prices change on a daily basis so we ended up paying way more , The staff was great and made an effort to make you feel like a valued guests
339165,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Value for money is not good at all You have to pay extra if you want to use the sauna and also it s a naked only sauna This was very disappointing , The food and design of the hotel was really nice and it s very clean
339166,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel explains it had a pool and sauna but It doesn t state that you have to pay for the sauna Ten euro extra per person to use the sauna Also whilst we were there the pool was being used for children s swimming lessons So the changing room and pool was full of children I could hardly move and in the end I decided not to use the pool at all as it was impossible I had a massage in the spa which to be honest wasn t very good I am a trained beauty therapist myself and the therapist didn t seem like she knew what she was doing at all , Staff were helpful Room was clean
339167,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Far away when it rains from tram station Bathrobe and slippers are missing Toiletries are only for ONE person Bathroom s door is transparent so it is ONLY for couples Fortunately the basin is seperate WC , Absolutely recommended Clean excellent room service very nice restaurant good wine list and sef s course meal is a must Pool and other services are very good Also nice area is the SKYY Bar Only 10 min from the airport by taxi Perfect matress and cozy room 
339168,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Noise issues with room just don t stay in a 01 room and then there should be no problems as all the other rooms are further away , Really great stay had a few issues with noise from our room and the wifi not being great due to the position of our room Frank the manager was so helpful in sorting out a solution he was great When I come back to Amsterdam will definitely stay again will not stay in the same room is all 
339169,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, If your expecting to step out of the hotel and be straight into the heart of Amsterdam you will be disappointed but it is a short tram ride from the centre and it s next to no hassle getting there, Hotel is absolutely beautiful Staff are wonderful and can help you with anything Facilities are brilliant and for the price we really couldn t complain 
339170,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel offer a 45 offer to be upgraded robes late checkout etc and I feel this should be information offered at check in time Just a small piece of advice not a complaint at all , Beautiful hotel Clean all mod cons and lovely staff Tram stop 5 min walk away where they run into centre every 3 5 mins Takes about 10 20 mins to get to attractions Skybar at the top of the hotel is lovely and the view is amazing Cocktails good too We liked staying a little further out of the centre and this was perfect for us Would highly recommend this hotel 
339171,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Bedroom was always clean and bed was so comfortable it was hard to leave Good location as 5 minutes form the tram which is 10 minutes to the centre of Amsterdam 
339172,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, They put one soup for hands and body We would like if they put one for shower and other for wash hands, The breakfast was excellent and the staff super friendly
339173,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, There was no hair conditioner Only shampoo was provided Shower rob and slippers not provided Otherwise amazing place to stay the pool was awesome,No Positive
339174,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, I asked for a late check out but the staff didn t communicate very well and after 12 they came into the room and than called everything else was ok , clean good price 6 min away from the tram station wich left us right in the city centre
339175,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, There wasn t much to dislike at all , Hotel was very mordern and querky In a good way The rooms were wonderful clean and the bed was huge I loved the sky bar which stays open fairly late that serves spirits cocktails and they also have a DJ playing music until close 
339176,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The only slight downside is the location of the hotel was a little further out of the centre but the travel is easy once you get the hang of it Tram stop is about a 5 min walk from the hotel and then about 15mins to reach Dam Square We got tram tickets at reception , Wow such a great hotel We arrived hours ahead of check in time but our room was ready for us so it was great to be able to get into the room quicker than expected We received a complimentary bottle of prosecco and two roses to mark our wedding anniversary such a lovely touch The room itself was gorgeous very modern and a shower and a bath Free wifi without the hotel The hotel is immaculate and there was literally nothing that could have made our stay more enjoyable Would visit again 
339177,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The distance it was from the city centre also everything came at an extra cost You had to pay 10 per person just to use the sauna and steam room when really that should be inclusive of the whole price, The rooms were really spacious also the staff very attentive
339178,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, If I was to go again I would like to stay closer to central as it was a 5 min walk to tram line and then 20 min tram ride to central either 17 for 3 days tram ticket or a cab is 20 The restaurant I would not go again very overpriced for what was served and wasn t up to expectations I had better in little cafes in central The coffee machine in the room is ok but too fancy than needed, Late check out was available One night we wanted to stay in and had the sky bar to visit and restaurant The shower was lovely and powerful Overall was a lovely pleasent stay very comfy and clean
339179,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast is very expensive at 17 per person however there s an extensive choice that s all well prepared, Nothing to complain about everything was excellent Hotel is easy to reach from the airport using the train It s located away from the more tourist areas but they are all easily accessible via the No1 tram Staff all very friendly and efficient room was a decent size tastefully decorated and most importantly spotlessly clean Good facilities within the hotel Skybar on the 10th floor very enjoyable I will certainly use this hotel again 
339180,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, I think when a hotel advertises pool and saunas these should be included in the price otherwise they cannot really be considered a hotel facility you might as well use a full wellness place like Sauna Deco which we did Pool was included but there was a cost to using the saunas , Short taxi journey from airport Five minute walk to tram stop and about 15 minute ride into central area Buy day travel passes at the hotel reception Room very good tea coffee making facilities separate toilet and bathroom with shower as well 
339181,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, nothing, perfect hotel for couples gorgeous hotel definitely one of the best i ve stayed in just a short tram away from central station where all the shops are best to buy a weekly tram pass if you re there for a few days only 20 swimming pool is also lovely aswell as the sky bar couldn t have had a better trip thank you so much westcord 
339182,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The way they handled our money situation We payed 130 upfront before we arrived and then wanted 3 nights aswel even though we d payed our first night upfront, Bedroom was perfect
339183,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The spoil me package that we have paid and the information about the Skyy bar reservation for the NYE The pool could be hotter , The warm pool the Skyy bar The huge bedroom 
339184,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The prearrangements we tried to make for the restaurant and SKYY bar ended up a mess The breakfast food other than the croissants was awful Horrible scrambled eggs everything that should be hot was cold the sliced fruit was all dried up the baked beans had a skin on them Nobody appeared to be in charge of the food on offer The room was too hot and the temperature could not be controlled , The croissants were extra flakey delicious The bed was very comfortable 
339185,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Was a bit far from central Amsterdam but was easy enough to get to via tram, Hotel was clean very modern staff were friendly and helpful and the bar and restaurant was very good prices
339186,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The location the size of the room didnt match the photo of the room they said i would get the service as coffee maker was broken an they didnt believe us then i had to demand a new 1 juat didnt like the hotel at all an i have stayed in cheaper hotels in amsterdam an they were better, Bed was comfty
339187,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Location of the hotel as it s a five minute walk to tram stop especially in freezing cold conditions then having to tram it into the centre four times a day was tiring Also not keen on the lack of privacy in the bathroom all glass doors opposite the bed no where to hide , Really nice comfy bed and nice contemporary room decor Loved the heated swimming pool very relaxing after a day of walking around the city 
339188,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Staff not that friendly as we were there 5 nights no body asked if we were ok we were just another customer too corporate and you would never know it was Xmas not one thing was done, Bed
339189,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Guys I like your hotel and I wish to return next year However there are things that I wish if you could kindly look into Incident 1 None at the big reception at 8 PM and had to wait 10 minutes for check in The feedback was not received well and I felt like I shouldn t have told him so Remember other hotels have kiosk check in these days The check out was super quick and thank you Incident 2 Requested for a quite room far away from elevators and not near any frequent access areas and what I was allotted initially was a room next to the elevator and also next to a frequent access door which slams on every entry and exit I had to request for an alternate room and the second room was perfect Thanks for the gentleman for sorting it out but he could have read my comments from the online booking request Other hotels do read it out for me at the time of check in and they make sure I get something close to it Incident 3 I felt uninvited when the lady staff at the bar told me that she is unfortunately closed at 10 55 PM I thought the bar was open till 11 PM and all orders are honoured till 11 PM It s great if you could state that the kitchen closing time as a separate one However the gentleman at the reception was very friendly and helped me order a pizza that night Thank you Incident 4 One of the cleaning staff rejected my polite request to change my bed sheet stating that its not listed for change and she showed a lot of aggression when I asked her whom should I contact to get this done We all know when someone is angry However her fellow colleague another lady was kind enough to change the bed sheets and please convey my sincerest thanks for help time and help Thanks and all the best , Comfy room top notch mini bar nice view from room great mattress nice coffee maker and few committed staffs who made sure that all my little concerns are addressed with great satisfaction

339191,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Upgrade cost for slippers and bathrobe they should be included like most European hotels , Very nice hotel with close proximity to the metro and train line Very good and varied breakfast and very friendly staff 
339192,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Have to use a keycard to get lift to work quite annoying but i suppose its a good security feature , Room was very stylish and spotless Staff were friendly and helped when we asked for directions
339193,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, nothing to report, Receptionists were very helpful could print boarding passes at no extra charge with easy access to p c lifts accessibility perfect stayed for 3 nights and then a further two on return to Amsterdam could leave luggage while we travelled to Brugge easy access by tram metro and train to city food was amazing dined in one night in restaurant food was out of this world lovely bottle of wine waitress was pleasant had a facial in the Spa was great 
339194,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, It was not well located and a bit of a walk to the tram stop They should try and see if they cannot organize a tram stop right outside the hotel then this would be a really good place to stay , Nice size room enjoyed the indoor pool very good security and lovely food 
339195,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, I think that 20 is a bit steep for a breakfast per person per day , The hotel is just on the out skirts of the city centre which makes it a nice comfortable quiet area Lovely rooms and staff with great tram links near by 
339196,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The staff were not helpful via checking in and out we had a few problems throughout the trip and the staff didn t want to help , The rooms are very nice the swimming pool area is lovely 
339197,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, My daughter and I were on a special holiday together so on arrival I chose the 45 upgrade which included a complimentary cocktail in the Skybat excellent lovely soft gowns and flip flops great for pool use and snacks water and lovely upgraded special products each day On 2 occasions I had to ring down and ask where they were as we d been forgotten Which made us feel a bit embarrassed On the second day of our stay we were out all day from 10am until 4pm we returned to find our room not serviced I had to go and find housekeeping to assist , Breakfast was wonderful substantial and catered for all choices Lovely swimming pool and health centre Staff very friendly and accommodating Location not too bad really Tram stop a 2 min walk from hotel 2 main trams no 1 and no 17 directly into the city centre in about 10 mins very regularly 
339198,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, no faults, I know the hotel from the wellness as I was a member for a year I didn t know the catering or rooms but they were just as up to scratch as the wellness 
339199,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, the prices were pretty high e g for food drinks considering it is a fair distance from the centre The language barrier was a bit of a problem at times especially on the reception desk which made things slightly harder work than they needed to be unfortunately it is not stated anywhere on your website about the dress code for the skyy lounge so when we couldn t get in because of the lack of formal wear it spoilt the stay a bit also had to repeatedly ask the reception staff 3 4 times for items to be put in our room that was missing , the hotel itself was extremely nice very clean staff helpful location and noise levels were good excellent bedrooms both space and facilities wise terrace bar is a lovely space and the option to use the spa area is great 
339200,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Portion size vs cost of food in sky bar is not right Down stairs bar staff inattentive and not trained to same level as reception or sky bar staff It also closes much earlier which is a shame as it is a nice area for a quiet drink sky bar can be loud, Very comfortable bed great nights sleep Reception staff were excellent Very friendly Sky bar is open and serving food late
339201,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The service at lunchtime was a little slow and we had to wait a while for our food Once it came though it was great , We absolutely loved the hotel it was beautiful and in a great location The Skyy Bar is fantastic for an easy night out as well We would love to come back and celebrate New Year s Eve here one year Thank you so much Westcord Fashion Hotel

339204,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, If you re a light sleeper probably ask to not have a room at the front of hotel passing trams can occasionally disturb The restaurant is a bit dark and having catwalk videos playing is a bit much at breakfast , Large selection breakfast foods and drinks Rapid table clearing keeps availability constant so no waiting even the busy hour of 8 9am Reception Bar very comfortable and great staff Walk in showers are very spacious airy light and have a refreshing ambiance Beds and bedding were very comfortable and felt luxurious Room air control was easy to use and kept room both warm and cool as required A brisk 20 min walk or 5 min taxi ride to Leidseplein makes this perfect location for quick in out of the city 5 min walk to the station for direct train to from Schiphol Very safe neighbourhood 
339205,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel was a little out of Amsterdam city centre however the tram was a short walk away and easy to navigate , Very friendly and helpful staff combined with great facilities and comfortable rooms 
339206,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The only down side to this magnificent boutique hotel is the mean set of steps you might confront if you happen to walk from the train station as I did instead of hopping the tram The tram line and tram station a block away is on the same level as the lobby of the hotel If you walk from the train station as I did what a klutz you end up on a street at basement level with the hotel Climbing up the stairs with luggage is a pain Be smart get on the tram when you get off the train from the airport , The room was small but efficient and tastefully modern avante garde funk but stylishly so And it was clean Loved the glass door to the washroom Oh relax the toilet was in its own separate little room cloistered Japanese style with a solid opaque door The washroom also featured a picture window looking out over the main room and through the room s big picture window beyond Nice view of the International Fashion Center next door while showering if you are daring enough to leave the room drapes ajar Best thing about the room in my opinion other than the all important cleanliness was the coffee maker It brewed up descent coffee from little plastic packets for this admitted coffee snob Should I tell you about the TV with a lot of English language offerings and the free 24 sssshhhhhh 24 hour porn channel Maybe not Used the gym downstairs a couple of times Very well equipped for a hotel gym And it is clean Two TV screens in the gym provide diversion if your workout becomes tedious The free towel with your workout is a nice touch The main hotel restaurant is magnificent You haven t lived until you have had the veal croquettes served here with Dijon mustard Wash them down with draft Heineken on tap at the bar There is nothing better The location of the hotel is great It s one train stop from the Schipol Airport It s also on a main tram line so getting downtown is super easy and convenient The Dutch know how to do things right And just so you know this website lists me as being from the UK probably because that s where I booked the room from I m from Canada and am used to clean modern facilities This hotel fit those requirements completely 
339207,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Me and my partner paid for a large double room but it didn t seem very big wasn t enough space to move around bed was a bit out the way from the centre of Amsterdam but was only a 10 minute tram journey be good if it was more centred All in all though it was still a great stay and would definitely recommend , The bed was really comfy bathroom glass door was very unique The staff were very friendly and helpful also felt very secure as only way you could get into building at night you needed your room card to scan in Me and my partner also loved the sky bar was open til 2am at the weekend which was good It was a fantastic stay and would definitely stay again

339209,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The sauna area was supposed to be nude but even when staff entered the area and people were seen in clothing this was not enforced , Very good price for a quality hotel Even though it s in the suburbs it s only 20 25mins from central station on the 1 or 17 tram 
339210,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Design of the rooms system down during check in due to which we had to wait for hours no mats in the toilet no wash basin in the toilet , Location connectivity to city and spacious room

339219,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Room way to hot and air con was not good enough opened small gap in window but even in November felt too hot during the night hence sleep was not the best which is a shame , Great location and lovely hotel
339220,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, food prices a little pricy so we ate out every meal tried to charge us an extra 80 upon checking out which they then said was charged in error after much questioning which put a dampener on the trip , room very spacious and clean in ideal location a short journey into the city by tram 
339221,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Sky bar was a let down for us personally Check in was a little careless could have been a little more friendly , Fresh contemporary and different Loved our room Loved that the toilet was separate from the shower and bath Lovely deep bath and walk in shower Really comedy bed The bar was lovely and the lady took an interest in us and our reasons for staying Fashions restaurant the food was great Real care and attention had gone into the food Almost fine dining quality food Was disappointed a little by the Sky bar After reading and the hotel staff saying we should go we went and I felt the staff did not really pay us great attention the cocktail was mediocre and the smell from the grill was off putting We were there to celebrate a special occasion and didn t feel special there Should have stayed in the downstairs bar where we were more looked after Pool was lovely Didn t use the sauna steam Didn t want to pay extra Did have a treatment which was lovely 
339222,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The toilet was in a separate room to the bathroom meaning the wash hand basin was in a different room A little bit further out from the city than we would ve liked but still fine as there were frequent trams only a short stroll away takes roughly 25 minutes to get into the city centre from leaving the hotel, Room was comfy and had good facilities also everything was very very clean Very handy for travelling to from airport as only one stop on the train 
339223,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, lacking in character no sandwich snack option for bar food just the full restaurant menu square pillows are not for everyone , very comfortable bed spacious room good breakfast quiet at night friendly staff

339227,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Nice sized bedrooms kettle and coffee maker available safe all you would expect Enjoyed Sky bar as it was lively and good music Asked for all rooms to be close as a group of friends and this was accommodated Decided against breakfast and found a local cafe by Vondelpark 
339228,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, They only thing I found disappointing about my stay was when housekeeping decided to not clean are room on one of the days of our stay I found this very bizzar and complained which unfortunately couldn t be rectified until the next day die to the time I arrive back to my hotel room to discover this Nevertheless I spoke to management in the morning and was compensated for this error , The beds are so comfy and most staff are attentive 
339229,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The room air conditioning didn t work so the room was like an oven I mentioned this to reception and they said they were working on it but didn t seem that interested In the room there was a Nespresso machine which was good but it had paper cups Surely someone could nip out to Ikea and buy some proper cups On the second night in the Sky Bar they had the great idea of putting a DJ in with Euro Disco music pumping out at a 1000 decibels It was like being in a nightclub and reminded me why I hate nightclubs so much We left without buying a drink Finally for a hotel charging 175 euros a night they charge an extra 10 euros to use the sauna That s just penny pinching and left me feeling a bit cheated , The hotel is well presented and the rooms are large clean and also well presented The breakfast is good the Sky Bar is excellent and the pool is a nice addition 
339230,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Be carreful in the swimming pool during swimming lessons at 5 30 pm the trainer allowed childrens to go in the water with street shoes and clothes , The very good breakfeast the cleanliness and silence of rooms Staff were very friendly and helpful The closeness of the public transportation

339232,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, I booked my father to stay here for his birthday and I asked the staff to place a happy birthday note from his 3 kids He was delighted and got a free cocktail I appreciate that the hotel did as I asked and made him feel extra special

339234,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, I left room at 09 30 and put green tag to clean my room Came back at 17 30 girls were finishing to work on same floor but my green tag to clean room was still thee and room was not cleaned towels not changed and so on Front desk did not help either saying that service personnel finished the work and they can bring new towels if I like Stayed 2 nights came Monday left Wednesday and nobody even tried to clean my room poor attitude , Cozy room good breakfast
339235,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, When we went to the pool we sat there for an hour and ended up going back the room due to the fact there was swimming lessons going on and we couldn t get into the pool, The shower in the bedroom was a dream and the full length Windows made it heavily
339236,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, On a busy road so it was noisy if you opened the window but excellent sound proofing if window was shut Two friends with us were sharing a twin room clear glass doors into ensuite and clear glass shower screen made it awkward for them , Great stay at WestCord loved the fun fashion decor online photos don t do it justice The bedroom was very clean lovely smellies included Bed was comfortable yet firm Staff friendly and helpful Very easy to get into town either on the tram or a beautiful stroll through the park to the Museum district perfect for aiding digestion of the yummy buffet breakfast Short taxi ride to airport

339240,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The Hotel is a good distance from the center unless you want to take the tram all the time The food is over priced and not very nice , Staff were very friendly the starbar was fabulous

339242,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Shower is nice but bathroom doors are all clear glass so no privacy while bathing Separate toilet is fine but you have to go to the other bathroom to wash hands after using Location is decent 10 minute walk to tram and 10 minute ride to city center , Beautiful modern clean hotel Travel extensively and this is one of the most comfortable hotel beds I ve ever slept in 
339243,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, There was a big mirror which was facing the bed which is kind of weird Also although this is a fashion hotel it was kind of awkward to have so many plastic models in the lobby Kind of frightening at night One more thing the toilet was distance from the showering and the sink which makes it pretty inconvenient The staff in the spa section was not really friendly , The hotel was nice the staff were friendly and the breakfast was great and delicious The room was spacious and the room view was pretty good Some would say it was quite far from the city centre but there are two tram lines and I think it s fine Overall nice hotel and good staff 
339244,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, No dislikes, Beautiful hotel very clean staff very pleasant and polite food excellent Out of town but train station only a 10 min walk away then a further 10 mins or so train ride and you are in the centre of Amsterdam 
339245,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Odd check in involving asking if we wanted a view or frosted glass in bathroom Bar service very slow Wanting charge 100 incase we used minibar which would not be refunded for up to 10 working days My debit card provided when booking hotel could not be used to secure room despite always do so Later discovered was because wanted charge us for minibar travel the world and all these things were a first Very rude and condescending check in man , Stylish looking hotel Not too far from city on the tram 
339246,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing, Couldn t rate this hotel highly enough from location to attention to detail to staff this hotel exceeded our expectations from the moment we checked in the staff could not do enough for us our housekeeper was nothing short of amazing cleaned our room every morning I m a late sleeper and when we were going out for the day she always had a smile asked could she do our room and was just so warm and nice a credit to the hotel The assistant manager went out of his way to get us Ajax tickets and we are so grateful We will definitely be back would not go past this hotel best hotel in Amsterdam pure luxury

339248,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing, Friendly staff with a warm welcome nothing was too much trouble they even sourced a fabulous cake for my husband s birthday along with complimentary cocktails 
339249,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, More things need to be included in the room like wine glasses corkscrew extra plates cups, Really friendly helpful staff a clean comfortable room with a good bed 
339250,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, I m not sure how it could be better given the things that were unhelpful other than moving the hotel Contrary to the impression I had been given it s quite a long walk to the train metro tram stops there are no restaurants or other shops anywhere near especially if the weather isn t so good More suited to the highly fashion conscious crowd than general tourists the price reflects that , It was ok the staff were helpful enough although it took them some time to find the alteration to the booking made several weeks previously in writing But it s Amsterdam even booking months in advance the choice is limited 
339251,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, i seen sometimes if you let the hotel know your travelling on a special occasion e g a birthday as i was that a little note and a cocktail for the sky bar was added in but not this time anyways still great, the staff were super friendly we always came home to a comfrotable made bed fresh towels and new coffee it was overall an amazing stay
339252,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, didn t like the see through bath room door, great staff always friendly loved the cocktails in the sky bar outside the main Centre but east to get there in tram 17 or 1 free travel adaptor as reception
339253,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The entrance and exit to parking are a bit confusing and annoying at first, Excellent soft bed Good wifi Excellent breakfast Beautifully designed hotel Professional staff
339254,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The door to the floor we stayed on was right next to our room and every time someone went through it banged very loudly I didn t like that our last night I had to spend it giving my daughter ventolin and hearing her cough all night because what I thought was a smoke free hotel was turned into a marijuana fuelled smoke up by some very inconsiderate patrons This went from smoking out the corridor to wafting into our room Didn t appreciate that with a long flight home ahead of us , The rooms were comfortable and clean 
339255,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Staff didnt listen to requests and had priority guests over us very annoying as we wore treated differently to others meal prices were shockingly high 20 for 1 breakfast , Comfort was as good as it gets

339261,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, We felt that breakfast was priced for a cooked breakfast only and we only had cereal and toast and there wasn t a cheaper option for that , The hotel was great and very convenient with the tram to take us into the old city Restaurant gave us a meal option on returning late from our tours was great Very happy with our stay 
339262,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Couldn t find the tram stop at the start think you need to make sure you tell the customers where it is looks easier on the map than when actually trying to find it, Had a double king size room was massive so was the bed Loved the shower and that we had a bath as well Maid came everyday and changed the towels We didn t get to see the swimming pool and sky bar but will defo be back to see them

339269,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The ambience and views of the Skyy bar were perfect however this was rather spoilt by the service Even though the bar was quiet and it was at the end of the night trying to get served seemed to be an imposition and was rather disappointing compared to the rest of the hotel experience Didn t have breakfast as too expensive , Very comfortable clean and stylish Excellent facilities and the reception staff friendly and very helpful Handy for the tram to the city centre and train to airport Cafe Oslo nearby is excellent for breakfast 
339270,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Great hotel with clean and large rooms It is located in a nice area close to the city center and Vondelspark Fitness center has all you need and Vondelspark is perfect for a morning run 
339271,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The coffee machine didn t work and the kettle leaked flooding the drawers We reported the problems twice before they were exchanged The rooms are lovely but functionality has been compromised by the look in certain aspects glass bathroom door next to the bed so can t put the light on in the night no handbasin in the WC so have to walk round to bathroom bedside tables have a pole on them so very awkward to try and put your book ipad down , Loved the decor and the cleanliness was outstanding

339281,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The mattress was harder than we are used to Needs directions from the main station if using public transport , The restaurant was very good We paid for a voucher for two breafasts and a 3 course dinner Breafasts provided a variety of food and the dinner was wonderful Staff were very obliging and helpful with tickets tours etc

339284,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast was only included in the rate for 1 night which we were not told when booking or at checking Advised the following morning at dining room door but not advised price could not believe the amount when checked out extremely expensive unless eating breakfast as a main meal If on room only rate recommend eating out Taxis not easily available and the company used by hotel more expensive than normal cab and took much too long to arrive you need to book them min 30 mins before required , Room large and comfortable Staff very helpful and friendly and facilities excellent Sky bar especially good Location although a little far out for my purposes very good with trams very easy to get in and out of the centre Nice park opposite hotel to walk in and fairly easy access to airport via train station or quick in a taxi 
339285,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Westcord fashion hotel was fantastic I chose to stay slightly out of the centre of Amsterdam and this meant we could afford a nicer hotel Three minutes takes you to Surinameplaine tram stop and the 1 or 17 tram takes you into the centre in about 20 minutes The trams run every 6 minutes which is great Buy the 24 48 72 96 hour travel cards from reception and get on or off any tram any time The 4 day card was only 21 50 Vondelpark is nearby and this is a lovely walk into the centre if you have an hour to spare The pool was lovely and our room was kept clean every day with all toiletries replaced daily Although we didn t eat in the hotel we did use the sky rooftop bar every night Service was great and although the cocktails are expensive enough at 12 they were lovely and the beer was a good price As it was my husband s 30th I let the hotel know and we arrived to our room to find a voucher for a complimentary cocktail each in the sky bar We really appreciated this The hotel also stored our baggage after check out until we were ready to go to the airport If we go back to Amsterdam and we probably will as we loved it we would definitely stay at westcord fashion hotel again 
339286,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The manager knows don t need to tell anyone else , The manager Robbert is lovely we had a query and he just wanted to make our stay the best it could be Would stay there again 
339287,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, It s a shame that the sauna wasn t available for free to hotel guests I d also have liked a mini fridge in the room , We enjoyed super comfy beds in a stylish and spacious room Standard was generally high throughout I liked the SKYY Bar Liked the location in general set back from the main bustle of the city 
339288,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Overall the customer service was excellent There was just one thing that let the hotel down and we brought this to the attention of the manager at breakfast It was the fact that staff were extremely slow in clearing tables of used crockery cutlery and left over breakfast which wasn t pleasant when you were just about to eat yours , Extremely comfortable room In spite of our one negative comment we would definitely return to this hotel 
339289,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Peaceful location away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre whilst easy access to tram services made visiting major tourist attractions very convenient

339291,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast was a little expensive, The location even though it was out of the main centre was great with easy access to the tram stop and a good selection of bars and restaurants within walking distance We particularly liked Caf Oslo Our room in the hotel was also fantastic Beds were really comfortable and the shower room bathroom was clean and stylish 
339292,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, One thing two members of staff gave us wrong info about breakfast times we ended up missing it twice but that is the ONLY gripe, Lovely comfy bed extremely clean room loved the decor
339293,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Was a little too far from the centre A good hour walk Hotel restirant charges 5 for tap water and is quite over priced Also it s very strange to have a toilet seperate from the bathroom and sink No logic, Large beds Friendly staff Very clean hotel
339294,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing at all it was perfect , The hotel was better than I expected it to be and the staff were great I ll be visiting again Such a wonderful trip 
339295,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The last time we came they apparently outsourced their apple pie We found this out after visiting this time because the pie was NOT the same It was nowhere as good as the last and we were thoroughly disappointed at that , For the price I love this hotel which is why we stayed here for a second time It is in the perfect location to get to the train and you can also walk around and discover the neighborhood that is surrounding the hotel The hotel has a cool bar that has a good dj and the drinks are also amazing I cant think of a reason not to stay here They also have bikes for rental 
339296,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, A bit pricey for parking was told we would pay a discounted rate of 15 per night when we checked in and was charged 25 per night , Attentive and very kind staff Facilities were modern and pleasant Location was a very short walk to the tram 
339297,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Small bed compared to CitizenM , Everything was Great Good breakfast friendly staff also good with children The pool is a plus Close to public transportation and the airport We ll be back 
339298,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Almost no restaurant and kiosk around the hotel But you can buy water at reception and order room service with reasonable price range , Room is big and comfortable We can easily access the train station by walk Good restaurant and staff Small park is available nearby and it s also good for small children Train ticket is also available at the reception 
339299,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, the pool was a rather cloudy which was offputting , Service was excellent staff very friendly and helpful Made the effort to be friendly even though the hotel is large and has a quick throughput of guests The food was excellent one of the best dinners we had while in Amsterdam and we had several Breakfast choice was very good also a wide choice and mainly healthy options 
339300,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The music in the sky bar needs more variation than dance remix all the time as a variety of ages were in the bar OK on a dj night fair enough but not every night, The cleanliness quietness shower bathroom size of rooms
339301,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Really clean and modern hotel Short walk to vondel park but it s a fair walk about an hour into the city Centre but it s very easy to hire bikes from the hotel or get a tram into the city centre Overall had a great stay and would stay again 
339302,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, There was a not so nice smell in the halls Parking was horrible over there since they crack cars in that area all the time So you are kind of forced to take their parking space , Very nice staff Especially at the bar Also a good choice of wine 
339303,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Directions to the hotel to be included From the airport take the train to Leylaan Take tram 1 or 17 direction Centrum second stop as you pass the hotel on your right Walk back 5 minutes arrive , Dining in the evening is Michelin standard You may only need one course If you are a big eater it may be pricy Visit the Sky bar for a cocktail and enjoy the view 
339304,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, See through doors and windows in the bath room this was a problem as we traveled with our daughter , Sky bar was great for a afternoon drink Easy ride into town with the tram systems They provide a great breakfast 
339305,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, When we arrived our bathroom had a large puddle of urine e Reported it immediately and they waited until the next morning after another phone call before they cleaned it No compensation was offered We also were charged 3 times and had to call from another country to report this Two days later and it hasn t been fixed Over 1 000 in charges that we do not owe They said it would be fixed but to this date it had not reached or account , The hotel as a whole was very nice 
339306,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Not in the City centre but wasn t really too much of a problem, Very friendly staff lovely decor very clean beds were so comfy all around pleased
339307,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, far too soft mattress door lock makes noise everytime someone is closing his door so quite noisy and you could hear everything the neighbours said bike rental expensive, free coffee in the morning when you dont take breakfast friendly staff free umbrella on rainy days
339308,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, It is a bit far from everything, Nice clean hotel with super comfy beds and spacious rooms the staff is always smiling and very attentive the breakfast is very nice and complete the rooms are super silent
339309,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff were really friendly and helpful throughout our stay which was great and made us feel at ease The breakfast buffet was really nice they had loads of different foods and was very fresh The hotel is only a few stops on the metro to the city centre and 2 stops from the hotel to the airport by train Overall this hotel is the perfect hotel for any stay they have everything you need and a great overall location to stay I would recommend to anyone 
339310,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Bar on top floor was a good idea but could have done with a dance floor Wasn t too keen on being told where to sit by waiter, Bed comfy most staff friendly Clean and rooms very well soundproofed
339311,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, That we can no smoke in the rooms is such a big turn off We pay so much money but are blocked off from our habbits , The bed was comfy nice design in the room bathroom was modern and stylish Had no complaints about the room at all 
339312,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Parking difficult to impossible car park hotel expensive 25 Complimetary water at reception desk but not in the room, Nespresso machine in room Room size and decoration
339313,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The sauna wasn t free for guests which I thought was a bit unfair considering the priced payed , The bed was very comfortable and the rooms were cleaned even when we left later than usual and just left out the please clean sign on the door The hotel overall had a great atmosphere and was very clean throughout The Skyy bar was fabulous and the team stop was only a short walk away which brought you directly to the centre 
339314,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Specifically checked about gluten free breakfast A Art from the bread the chef was unable to tell me whether any of the other food was gluten free I phoned before to check so this is disappointing , Price was good and included breakfast Close to tram 
339315,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, No smoking rooms, Excellent staff very friendly and helpful Room always clean We thought it was very kind to leave us bottles of water and snacks for free 
339316,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, mini bar vending machine didn t work for 2 nights the reception happily wrote off the charges for the goods we did not receive though, The room was amazing bed comfy and the room service food was unreal
339317,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, not very clean asked for an early check in replied but didnt answer a question facilities worn down price for value one of the worst i seen lately shower could not be closed some drops all the time during the night as well , TV channels
339318,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Location isn t superb in that the hotel is 10 mins from the city center by public transport tram 1 or 17 But this is hardly an issue and it s something we knew when we booked , Very clean and modern rooms comfortable bathroom with separate toilet friendly staff very good breakfast 
339319,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Went to the restaurant based on Trip Advisor recommendations and felt that the wait staff was rather snooty and not very friendly Also beds were quite hard and the pillows even though there were two different types were not very comfortable I booked this hotel because it had a pool and others did not We were looking forward to sitting by the pool while our children swam but were told we had to wait outside and could not enter without a swimsuit We did not return I also did not realize that I would be charged a different rate for each night we stayed and the price got progressively higher per night , Rooms were clean relatively large and well appointed Very nice shower and bath Great location outside of the craziness of the center but easy to get to all sights on the tram 
339320,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, One if the best ways to discover Amsterdam is via bikes The hotel offer very good bikes which include suspension and gears They charge a flat daily rate But I think that there should be an economy of scale therefore the rate reduced for hires longer than 24hrs I think this would be added value for customers , I have visited Amsterdam 3 times over the last 3 years and each time I have stayed at this hotel It is a little further out but the centre is accessible via tram or bike What I like about the hotel is that you get good value for money a spacious well designed room with good modern features Nespresso machine simple fridge plus a standard of hygiene that satisfies a clean freak like me The cleaning staff are very good as they do an excellent job of achieving a nice clean room It helps that the fixture and fittings are simple modern and of good design There are also some very good local shops and restaurants near the hotel on the South end of Vondelpark which are a 5 10 min walk from the hotel Visit Blauw which is an exceptional modern Indonesian restaurant 
339321,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, I m being a little bit picky but using chipped crockery for breakfast when providing room service in a hotel isn t ideal I didn t make a fuss about it just a little thing you wouldn t expect Breakfast a little bit pricey but as I say I m being picky , They had a very good selection for breakfast it was very nice All the staff we encountered were very pleasant and extremely helpful to us We were up to start traveling to Amsterdam from 3 15am requested before our arrival could we check in earlier instead of waiting until 3pm as this was their normal check in time We arrived at about 10am and they had our room ready so we could check in and rest straight away which was fantastic by them and really appreciated by us Hotel location is excecellent for public transport tram bus available into Amsterdam city centre 3 min walk away also for when we arrived from Schipol airport by train the train station beside hotel is 2 min by taxi or a very easy 8 10 minute walk Would I stay there again or recommend them Absolutely 
339322,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Level of staffing in bar could have been better Waiter was trying very hard to attend to everyone , Quality of food in bar was very good Very comfortable room 
339323,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, It was a trip for my wife s birthday which I informed the hotel of They stated they would do something nice and didn t I was a bit disappointed by this , Lovely room very comfy bed Facilities were good We had a nice meal within the hotel The skyy bar is great lovely cocktails and very nice cool feel Location wasn t an issue Tram number 1 or 17 takes 15 minutes to centraal station The tram stop is a 3 minute walk from the hotel 
339324,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The Sky Bar had good music but the cocktails were far too strong to enjoy and ridiculously overpriced 36 for 3 , Great location for the tram only 5 minute walk and then 10 minutes on tram into centre There was a small glitch with the rooms on check in but the issue was resolved immediately and was allocated different rooms Beds huge and comfortable great walk in shower and bath Clean and comfy 
339325,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, No fridge in room There was a minibar vending machine but we couldn t put anything into it to keep it cold , Bed and pillow very comfortable Located near the tram stop
339326,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, No minibar fridge only an automatic vending machine so no option to cool your own drinks A little far from the nearest tram station, Nice quiet room good parking easily accessible by car
339327,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, pool area tiles especially not the most hygienic Dust in room cleaned daily so possibly came from AC unit , Close to public transport friendly staff Spacious room with good shower 
339328,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, I never used the pool really wished I had My fault entirely as we where too busy sightseeing , Excellent location 15 mins tram to Dam Square Would definitely stay here again it was far more luxurious than the 5 star hotels in Amsterdam Central Great value for money Breakfast could have fed a family 
339329,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Couldn t fault this hotel, Great stay at this hotel in a quiet location away from the hustle bustle of the centre Easily accessible by tram with stop 5 10 minutes from hotel Another 5 10 mins walk to local bars restaurants We purchased a 48hr travel pass from reception which was great value for money Skyy bar was great for tapas cocktails Cocktails a bit pricey though Staff at skyy bar were excellent Great selection st breakfast although my daughter was a bit disappointed that the only yogurt selection was natural in a large bowl Our room was spacious comfy with plenty of amenities Would be nice to have a restaurant bar menu in room Would thoroughly recommend the West Cord Fashion
339330,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in It was a very spacious room The location is ideal 20 minutes from airport when using the train and then 8 minute walk to the tram to get to the centre which was only about a 15 minute journey We rented bikes for one day which was very cheap and cycled through Vondelpark We never had food at the hotel so can t comment on that 
339331,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Only 1 tablet for dishwasher no teatowel no other detergent or washer for dishes had to buy our own Housekeeping said to be every second day however only came after our first night of five , New hotel with nice accommodating staff Tram stop in front of hotel 
339332,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, A bit far out from town Trams finish early so cabs home Cost about 20 25 euro which is a shame as trams are great value for money , Clean hotel with a buzz Good bar on the 10th floor good music reasonable drink prices Hotel offers everything you could want for 
339333,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The location is just a bit far out Nearest Tram stop for the 1 or 17 is 500 yards then about 15 mins to Centraal Also nearest Cafe was 700 yards way from hotel as they charged 19 euro for brekkie Some staff in restaurant were not friendly and frequently had to ask for bill after waiting for ages , We stayed on 7th floor with view over the Rembrant Park Bed was huge and probably one of best I ve slept in Room had a Nespresso machine but you only got 3 pods and 3 milks per day seems weird for 2 people There was ice machine on our floor but no ice bucket supplied so you have to ask Food in restaurant was top class and can recommend the Chicken Satay and Tagliatelli with salmon not cheap but nowhere decent is Skyy bar was also very expensive most cocktails around 12 euros For breakfast go to Cafe Oslo which is fantastic also good for dinner this is nearest best cafe 
339334,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, nothing to complain, The Room was perfect very big and extremely clean Lovely Hotel situated only few minutes walk to tram stops in 5 minutes you can easily reach town center
339335,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing bad to report , Stylish clean friendly hotel 5 7 mins walk from Tram Trams v regular Breakfast AMAZING Pool and gym compact but great Staff lovely efficient and helpful Cool skybar with seriously yummy cocktails and nibbles Train from airport 20ish mins 4 50 and 10 min walk or 15 mins in taxi 36 
339336,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Didn t stay long enough to use the facilities It is away from everything else but was a perfect location to get to AWAKENINGS Festival , Can t wait to return
339337,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Buffet breakfast was great with a good variety Hotel room was lovely cosy and clean Easy access to the main city centre Great value for money Staff very friendly Good use of facilities swimming pool and sky bar
339338,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, breakfast was a little pricey , the hotel was lovely very modern and staff couldn t have been more helpful Sky Bar was amazing and a wonderful place to have a drink and watch the sunset pool was a great addition after a long day touring the city 
339339,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing Liked everything about the hotel , The room were very spacious comfy beds great bathroom All very modern well decorated Facilities were great although out of town centre very easy to get the tram into town only 3 mins walk to nearest stop Really enjoyed our stay 
339340,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, We got a good deal on this hotel so we werent expecting too much well how surprised were we it was fab comfy clean lovely staff and 5 mins to tram stop straight in to centre definitely one the best hotel we ve stayed 
339341,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Only thing I can say is that the cleaning staff came to clean whilst we were sleeping but we didn t realise we had a do not disturb sign on the back of the door that we should have put outside so I would suggest if you re a late sleeper like me you should definitely put that sign outside your room , The staff were really friendly from the moment we arrived We arrived with another couple so wanted to be on the same floor and they managed to arrange this for us which we was very grateful for The hotel itself is so beautiful Went for lunch at the restaurant on the terrace and the view was spectacular Our room was on the 8th floor which I appreciated as I love higher rooms and the room was nice and clean The bed was really comfortable and spacious Loved the bath shower room and the lighting in the room was good too so I was able to do my makeup without having to go in the bathroom This hotel has a lot to offer although it s not in the centre it s only two trains away so doesn t take long at all 
339342,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, we arrived at 16 00 o clock and our room was not ready yet I complained about that and the receptionist was really irritated and arrogant The room was ready about 30 min later The city centre was about 20min away by tram or taxi , The breakfast was good the room was spacious and the mattress convenient I liked the design of the hotel
339343,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Sheets did not get washed during our week long stay Price for an extra bed was more than the room itself Glass bathroom door and window through to the bedroom so you can see everything , Great location so easy to get into the city centre during the day and at night Bar on the top floor has great drinks with a view at night 
339344,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel was too far from the center though it wasn t too difficult to get there By trams 1 and 17 about 20 minutes , The rooms and the pool area were great 
339345,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Price of the breakfast buffet we didn t use it as brakfast outsideof hotel was 1 2 the price, the comfort of the room relatively close access to tram good selection of restaurants in the area 
339346,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The restaurant and drinks are more expensive than in the city centre which I did not appreciate especially when the hotel location is further out , I found the hotel lovely however location is a little further out therefore tram or taxis were required Overall the hotel was lovely and rooms nice a big 
339347,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, If you need to take a early train you have to take a taxi , Quiet but far away from city center close to bus station Easily to buy tickets and reserve taxi in the counter

339349,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Enjoyed everything My room was quiet nice and clean I have also appreciated the water boiler the Nespresso machine and the three coffee capsules and two tea bags per day Breakfast is of good quality and variety The swimming pool is about 12 meters long It is very good for a hotel pool if you like swimming a bit Water temperature was very good too The hotel is not in the centre This can be an advantage or a disadvantage depending on the case An advantage is that you are not in the middle of the main touristic routes with the associated chaos A disadvantage is that there are not many restaurants at walking distance beyond the hotel restaurant which is however not bad although selection is quite limited Anyway the restaurants available in the neighbourhood are not exclusively targeted to tourists and this is a pro for me Walking to the Damrak is about 40 min Tram stop to from the centre is about 5 min walking With a tram you can reach the Damrak in around 15 20 min The hotel is at 1Km so at walking distance from the Amsterdam Lelylaan train station which you can easily reach from to the Schiphol airport Journey from to the airport is very short around 10 min

339355,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, No one told us there was swimming lessons in the pool but this didn t bother us so much as we only went for a quick dip , We was travelling for my partners birthday and we couldn t of been looked after any better with a room upgrade and complimentary cocktails as a gift as well as a immaculate room with a big big enough for 4 and a spotless bathroom Only 10 mins from Amsterdam central and 15 mins from the airport 
339356,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The onsite Skyy Bar is listed as closing at 1AM but they refuse entry as early as 12 45 so just be prepared As a consequence of miscommunication we were surprised to be turned away , The aesthetic of this hotel is stunning It s truly gorgeous It s got a hip and trendy vibe that is sexy and mature It s really close to the tram which makes for a quick ride into the city center and it s only about 10 15 minutes by taxi from the airport so that s rather convenient They also prepared a take away breakfast for us because of our early flight which was really considerate

339360,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, A bit far from the nearest tram station about 10min walk to go to downtown But if you want to enjoy the local neighborhood not only downtown then the location is good Shower room was glass paneled so if you are not couple a bit awkward, Very fashionable and clean Had dinner at the restaurant in the hotel and it was good except the spaghetti was too soft

339373,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The only thing I was disappointed at was the massage booking system, The hotel was well designed we booked the 3 course dinner 2 breakfasts a cocktail which was great value The only disappointment was 3 out if 4 of us booked a massage and confirmed the booking but not shown on the spa booking system
339374,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel is a fair distance from the centre and was a 15 20 minute tram ride in each time but the trams are easy to use and good value for money with 12 24 72 and 96 hour passes , The hotel was beautiful clean and modern and very posh The staff were great very attentative and looked after us well and the hotel was very safe and secure with key card access for the lifts corridors and rooms The food was great and the sky bar on the 10th floor is a great place to drink in the evenings with djs on Friday and Saturday nights 
339375,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Location was well out of the centre unfortunately not walkable Bathroom in rooms had a glass door and glass shower door which they do not tell ask you about So for a couple of friends sharing a room a little inappropriate , Clean friendly great breakfast and restaurant Bar and lounge areas smart and well designed
339376,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Location of hotel really poorly impacted our holiday The hotel is unexpectedly situated right on a motorway and while there are regular trams to the centre it was extremely difficult to navigate there are no English translations of tram stops making it extremely difficult to plan your journey It took us around 35 minutes to reach the centre via tram which was a bit disappointing The hotel isn t close to any of the tourist attractions the dam square musems vondelpark red light district and so on if I was to return again I would definitely benefit from a more central hotel Only good thing about the location is that it was 10 minutes from Schipol however even though this was a short ride in a taxi it was still over 40 Keep this in mind when booking a hotel, Hotel staff were lovely Spa treatments were amazing and the room was spacious and comfortable

339395,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, I was just so disappointed with this hotel I was expecting a night of a nice swim pamper in the bath room service in front of the TV and a big bed all to myself I m not sure why this hotel has such wonderful reviews For me it was rather impersonal a bit bling slightly dated style could have still been happy with this though if it wasn t for Pool was closed due to low level of chlorine so I couldn t swim during my stay double bed was actually two singles pushed together so it looked like a fabulous big king bed but actually I was falling down the middle no star fishing for me crud and a long hair in bottom of bed splats of milk coffee up the wall near coffee machine scratched and worn leather on desk chair lots of chips along edge of desk essentially nothing like what I expect a 4 hotel to be like After reading the above issues the front desk graciously wiped my bill , Lovely big bath great wifi responsive front desk staff nice coffee in the in room machine good TV channels comfy lounge seat in room room service was hot tasty and arrived when expected fab shower good storage good general comfort

339403,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Only came for a weekend so did not get a chance to try out the spa and some of the other facilities , We loved the sky bar and the rooms It was my boyfriends birthday so they kindly gave us two free cocktails in the sky bar which was lovely Plenty of choice at breakfast Staff all really friendly and helpful Short tram ride into the town about 15 minutes which is excellent if your looking for a quite 
339404,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast very expensive so didn t go for this as there are so many cafes around The bar is very cool but there is very loud music so it s more like being in a club and not somewhere to go and unwind after a busy day of sightseeing so we did not stay for drinks in the end Location is out of town so once you are out of the hotel you cannot just pop back you need to be organised to be out all day However the area is quieter and more relaxing due to this The tram is a mere 10 min walk away so it s easy to get to the attractions , Room very big and comfortable Friendly staff and wifi very speedy Lovely selection of postcards in the lobby which reception posted for us There are rental bikes too

339408,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, No jacuzzi but that would just be the icing on the cake, Amazing stay From breakfast to swimming to the design of the room will definietly be returning in the future The sky bar is unreal 
339409,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Only thing I would say is the hotel s website could do with more detailed info on getting there from the airport We spent 35 on a taxi getting to the hotel to then discover it s only one stop on the train less than a 10min walk from a station only 4 , Hotel was stunning spotlessly clean every member of staff we spoke to couldn t have been more friendly or helpful The barman in the Skyy Bar even drew us a map of where to find less touristy areas for dinner sorry didn t get his name but he had dark curlyish hair he is an asset to the hotel

339416,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The mini bar was a vending machine in your room and there was only a very narrow refrigerated space for your own food Complimentry breakfast would have been appreciated The restaurant was too expensive , Comfortable beds quiet rooms we slept like babies Very clean and coffee was well stocked We appreciated that room keys were required to operate the lift and an entry door to the floors although it seemed the door on the opposite end of the hall was left open There was excellent lighting in the rooms and all materials were quality Also liked that it was away from the crowds of the city

339421,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The coffee machine in our room didn t work i notified reception 3 times and i was assured it had been fixed and to be fair it worked once but then it died again I couldn t be bothered asking for a fourth time to have it looked at especially as we were leaving the next morning I think 19 is overpriced for a breakfast be more reasonable , The rooms were lovely and comfortable although the clear door to the bathroom was a little off putting but at least the toilet wasn t in there The breakfast was really great loads to choose from and it was all replenished quickly The staff were always there to help and always with a friendly smile We would stay again

339450,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The cost of breakfast was prohibitive with four of us for four mornings it adds up to quite a bit of spending money There are cheaper alternatives within walking distance or the city centre is just a short tram ride away , Travelling with two teenage children we booked two rooms which were across the corridor from each other Rooms were comfortable well appointed and quiet the pool and gym were a real addition and meant we could have some down time in between sightseeing etc The food was really good although we generally ate out The hotel has bicycles to hire a great way to get into the centre we cycled through the Vondelpark which was lovely early in the morning Our teenagers were very happy they thought it was cool and comfy the Wi Fi was fast too Great hotel super helpful staff we d definitely go back

339463,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, I thought that the menu for the restaurant could have a wider variety and if you want to eat the bar snacks like the stake in the restaurant then there could be an exception , the staff were really friendly and helpful and the rooms were always clean and fresh which made me feel really comfortable whilst I was staying here 
339464,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The drinks in the sky bar were overpriced which meant we ended up not staying there very long despite the nice setting , Really helpful staff who made it really clear and easy for us to plan our days

339472,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The music from the sky bar was quite loud every night and continued into the early hours It didn t bother us too much but I imagine some people would find it disruptive The directions sent to us describing how to get to the hotel from the tram stop on our arrival weren t very good as we ended up in completely the wrong direction So something a bit less vague would have been helpful , Room was very modern and comfortable All staff were extremely friendly and helpful and went out of their way to accommodate you The Sky bar was great to relax and drinks reasonably priced The proximity to the tram stop made it really easy and cheap to get around just a 2 minute walk to get the tram and you can use it go all over the city If you purchase a 72 hour ticket for 17 euros from the hotel desk it covers you for a weekend

339478,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, It was not possible to have privacy in the bathroom toilet becauseOur it had a see through glass door and there were a lot of mirrors in the room Also we were disappointed by the fact that our large double room apparently was somewhat smaller than most others The images for our room type show a larger room and the hotel website mentions that most of the bathrooms have a separate bath and shower as well as a separate toilet and ours did not , The room was really nice quiet and clean and the bed was very comfortable Perfect with a Nespresso machine in the room Although the hotel is not centrally located it is easy to get around with trams nr 1 and 17 which run frequently The hotel is easy to reach from the airport it only takes 7 minutes from Schiphol to Amsterdam Lelylaan station which is a ten minute walk from the hotel The wonderful Vondelpark is also very close

339512,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, The sore point is the staff which is a shame since apart from this the hotel is Amazing even though its far from central amsterdam Some of the staff are cold and not very welcoming the blonde girls at the reception are the worst of the lot it would be unfair to generalise Cleaning of rooms is not done everyday you have to specifically request for this and we were not informed of this u can imagine our surprise when we reached the hotel at night There was a technical problem with one of the rooms we were allocated reception asked us to go to sleep and they will look into the matter in the morning no seriously Unprofessional We had to make a scene for them to do something When you go at reception or call at reception for some info its as if you are bothering them they reply with such an exasperated tone that you dont want to go see them again , The hotel is located not far from the airport Schipol 15 mins by taxi 45 euros and a tram station 5 7 mins walking distance so its easy to get around The room is spacious beautiful and clean There is a heated swimming pool in the basement There is a heated smoking lounge outside The hotel provides additional services like sale of tram tickets tickets and reservation for various attractions which is a time saver Nice people from room service who attended to our requests promptly and with a smile

339515,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Much smaller bathroom than our first stay Charging for sauna use is a disappointment Pool and sauna too busy to use during stay Bike hire expensive for a hotel out of town Should be free or cheaper Coffee machine broken the whole time we were there 3 nights was not mended despite 2 separate requests , Excellent staff Super Sky Bar for cocktails pre dinner Beds are amazingly comfy best I ve been in Lovely area just be prepared to walk a bit or pay the tram card

339518,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, We booked a room for 3 people which should have been a triple room consisting of a double and single bed however it was a double and sofa bed with not even a mattress just sheets on a sofa A proper bed had to be added to the room Complimentary drinks and breakfast was provided to compensate The USB port did not work in the room and the staff were not aware of this utility This would have been very handy if was working Rooms were quite dark so not great for doing your make up, The hotel was very clean and having a lovely Sky bar was great The bar was gorgeous and had a vast selection of cocktails and drinks at a reasonable price It was my birthday and we also were given a complimentary cocktail Bathroom in the room was lovely and had an amazing large bath and a shower Alot of wardrobe and storage space in the room Was very very nice The hotel is extremely secure Swipe card is needed to get everywhere so this is reassuring Having a spa in the hotel was very nice and extremely clean however the facilities are NAKED for the sauna and steam so no swimwear Room facilities such as nespresso machine is great and also the mini vending machines in the hotel were really good Iron and ironing board etc where great Brunch in the hotel is amazing and had the best coffee ever at the reception bar Staff were all very friendly and helpful No problems were the service at all

339520,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, We had twin beds in the room pushed together and they even had seperate quilts not great for a couple on a romantic break together Would have much preferred a double bed Odd that the rooms are obviously set up for couples as the bathroom has a window in and you can see each other in the shower but your given seperate beds , The staff were really great went out of their way to help us and were really friendly The rooms were very stylish 
339521,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Reception ask for 100 euro deposit which you get back at the end of stay just a bit of an annoyance if you only have enough for your stay however you can order food and get tram passes etc to the room which will come off that bill , Hotel was very modern and clean
339522,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Really friendly helpful staff Excellent rooms Located away from the congested centre next to tramline and cycle lane and close to railway station

339524,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, They should state in the room info that nespresso pods are chargable not a biggie but annoying when you go down to collect them and you have no idea you re meant to pay , Can t think of much I didn t like Lovely room nice bar great cocktails good food in both the restaurant and bar

339527,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, We were accused of smoking in the room Staff rang and said can we check your room we have complaints of smoking We weren t Felt it was a little invasive when I was in nightware to demand to come in Fair enough that someone was but not us Should be smoke alarms , The decor of the hotel was fabulous as always Staff were very friendly Great location and value for money 
339528,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Good location with easy walk through park to main areas Or just hop on tram Only one train stop from airport Nice to get away from busy areas at end of day Stayed here twice and wouldn t hesitate to stay again Good food lovely bar Fantastic 
339529,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, the shower pressure for me was not good enough and it took to long for me to be able to wash my hair Also the outside terrace where people would go to smoke wasnt kept clean and tidy throughout the night and the outside heaters really dont do anything Im guessing during warmer months the terrace is better kept however if guests are using it during winter it should be clean and tidy for all to enjoy all year round Furthermore a deposit was asked of us when we arrived for the amount of 100 euro if you then used the mini bar or ate at the hotel the cost would be deducted from your deposit and im guessing whatever remains would be returned to you We didnt give the deposit as we weren t informed previously and so our mini bar was locked so we couldn t use it Another thing that they charged us upon arrival was city tax it was only 14 euro however this wasnt mentioned before booking either I dont know how they calculate the city tax so please dont use this amount as your basis Saying so Ive heard other traveller s mention about paying city tax at hotels in Amsterdam so I assume this is an ordinary all this though should be mentioned for people to be aware before booking , large rooms very comfortable bathroom area and large comfy bed also near enough to center to travel everyday around 5 10 mins to central station but far enough that you can escape the noise and busyness of the centre when you wish t is also easy to get to and from the airport Nice food at the lobby bar and good room service enough satellite channels to find something to watch nice espresso machine and good amount of cupboard space for a hotel Will stay there again if we return to amsterdam

339532,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, Some staff were rude to us and laughing at us and made us feel like we shouldn t be at the hotel Hotel knew it was my birthday they didn t wish me a happy birthday which I just found Un polite , Smoking area SOME friendly staff 
339533,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, the location was a bit too far out of the city centre the tram stops were also a bit too far from the hotel as I have some walking difficulties apart from that everything else was fine , the hotel was fine all the staff were friendly helpful the hotel was clean the rooms were well equipped 
339534,WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam, I didn t like that breakfast ended at 10am not 10 30 or 11am , I like that the hotel offered a bar and awesome restaurant since it was out of the main city
