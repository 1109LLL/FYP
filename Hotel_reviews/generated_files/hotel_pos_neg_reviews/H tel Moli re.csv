105951,H tel Moli re, Nothing to complain about , Everything Very friendly and helpful the entire staff went out of their way to accomodate our needs nothing was too much trouble Superb location No language issues as all the staff spoke English Beautiful rooms very comfortable Wifi excellent Loved having own coffee machine 
105952,H tel Moli re, N a, Excellent property in the right location Good both for leisure and business travelers Very friendly staff and great design rooms All best Japanese restaurants in Paris are near by as are some good French ones 
105953,H tel Moli re, Rooms are really very good just small as one would expect from the age of the building , Beautiful and quiet facility in the 1st Arr which is a better location than I anticipated The neighborhood around the Palais is filled with fun quality restaurants Excellent connections to Metro very short walk to Louvre Seine Comedia etc They have done very well upgrading this property 
105954,H tel Moli re, Room a little tight low ceilinged subway stop a bit farther than I would like breakfast didnt look too good , Clean comfy strong a c staff very helpful
105955,H tel Moli re, The second night Julian Staveley was in a different room which wasn t up to the standard as the previous night , good rooms great location the second night Mr Staveley had a different room which was not as good 
105956,H tel Moli re, No vent in the bathroom and they only change the sheets every 3 days, Great location great team and service The room was clean and large we took the double room 
105957,H tel Moli re, All exactly what we wanted , Air conditioning Bed Quiet Size of room Lift and when the staff knew it was our wedding anniversary they brought us free champagne very classy and thoughtful 
105958,H tel Moli re, I guess Paris and location are inflating the pricing but the room normal double bed of what I got should be around 120 not 170 Gym terrible design , Breakfast 15 Staff is nice Hammam steam room Late checkout
105959,H tel Moli re, smal rooms, location is perfect nice hotel slightly smal rooms on the top floor very very nice staff putting even sauna on for us althought its after 22 00 and officially closed good breakfast for french understanding because in france you eat usually only croissant jam butter and a coffe here you had cheese sausages eggs fruits and so on nice design of the hotel 
105960,H tel Moli re, We do not have any negative comments to leave , This is a gem of a hotel The staff make an extra effort to make sure one is well looked after Although the room we had was quite small it had everything needed and most of all the bed was really comfortable The hotel is perfectly situated to explore Paris 
105961,H tel Moli re,No Negative, Stayed three places on this trip to Paris and Hotel Moliere was by far the best The staff was the friendliest the breakfast was delicious the facilities were well cared for and designed well Very tranquil and a beautiful place to rest Best value When I go back to Paris I will be staying here again 
105962,H tel Moli re, I cannot fault this hotel , Staff were excellent and helped every step of the way Cannot remember their names but they were all so lovely To my surprise I got upgraded which was very much appreciated and unexpected Room had everything you could need Bed was huge and very comfortable giving me the best night sleep I ve had in a while Tea and coffee making facilities in room were decent Very central location only 10mins walk from where Roissybus drops off at op ra Stored my bag before check in 
105963,H tel Moli re, Maybe a couple more coffees for in machine , Service was top quality friendly and efficient I received a small gift on my birthday and they prepared breakfast in bed for me upon request Even after checkout they made us feel welcome allowed us to use leisure facilities and made us coffees before we departed for the airport 
105964,H tel Moli re,No Negative, Very good quality products for breakfast One always hesitates before paying 15 person for a breakfast but it was money well spent in this case 
105965,H tel Moli re,No Negative, The room was small but an amazing use of space and really beautifully decorated with a great shower and a really comfy bed The location couldn t have been better The hotel was spotless with really lovely French style decor and modern Above all the service was second to none The staff were so friendly and helpful 
105966,H tel Moli re, Very hot in the lobby breakfast area but probably just a glitch the days we were there , Newly renovated beautifully decorated well laid out room amazing breakfast with huge selection Lovely helpful and friendly staff 
105967,H tel Moli re,No Negative, I have really high standards when it comes to hotels I travel a lot and stayed in countless hotels for business and leisure around the world Truely Amazing place Service was excellent We stayed over New Years Eve and got an upgrade to a bigger room with balcony on arrival Room was very spacious and the bathroom offered a spa feel We asked for a late check out at 4 pm and it was no problem at all Fantastic 
105968,H tel Moli re, If they had a steamer I had a dress that got super wrinkled and the iron was unfortunately an impossible task, love the location the hotel is quiet quaint and the architectural details were great Staff was so helpful and amazing I flew in quite early from USA they gave me my room so I can rest Thanks 
105969,H tel Moli re, I didn t get a wake up call and almost missed my train , Location is excellent Hotel has been modernized but still leaving touches of the original building 
105970,H tel Moli re, We didn t realise the shower was in the bedroom when booking and the shower door was broken which we mentioned on or first day but it wasn t ever fixed Also staff seemed to come into the room unannounced so double lock the door , The hotel was in an excellent location and the staff were attentive and very helpful 
105971,H tel Moli re,No Negative, Beautiful boutique hotel in a grate center but Quiet location Beautiful and very comfortable Room Very good bad and bathroom Very nice Stuff Recommended 
105972,H tel Moli re,No Negative, Great value Nice people Top location No disturbing traffic Close to shopping Close to nice cafe Bakery and tiny grocery store on the corner and what not 
105973,H tel Moli re, Can t think of anything Even though i am usually not a boutique hotel type of girl this will be the first place I look up for my next return to Paris Great Find , Charming boutique hotel that embodies french feel while also offering the size comfort and facilities of a larger hotel My room was adorable with modern updates while maintaining french character Location was perfect i really can t think of a more ideal location in Paris Right on top of shopping the Louvre the Siene etc Hotel staff was warm and helpful Air France had lost my bag so I was a bit stressed The desk spoke with some of the Air France contacts as I was running into a bit of a language barrier the Hotel Moliere staff seemed much more invested in resolving the missing bag issue than Air France did I think anyone who has been stuck in a foreign country without their belongings would really appreciate such assistance Also the bed was awesome Seriously 
105974,H tel Moli re, The only comment I have is that the gym could have been a little bigger but all the equipment we needed were there , The staff was extra welcoming during check in I have travelled a lot and really was excellent 
105975,H tel Moli re,No Negative, Really happy I choose this place is was a successful choice Check in out were fast room was nice comfortable and clean location is great and close to many attractions and staff was really nice and helpful all of them morning and night shifts Would highly recommend 
105976,H tel Moli re, For a smallish hotel the facilities were outstanding The use of space and design could only be admired , I agree completely with Nathalie s review For a fairly unassuming hotel the design was excellent as was service cleanliness breakfast and room service food The location is excellent with dozens of good restaurants within 5 minutes walk and metro access good It was quiet free internet worked well and staff were friendly
105977,H tel Moli re,No Negative, The terrace off the room was fantastic the bed was very comfortable breakfast was great and very good value for money and the staff made everything easy and were very helpful 
105978,H tel Moli re, eggs were cold at breakfast, great location walking distance to the Lourve Opera House shops and restaurants Close metro stop Awesome shower in bathroom No regrets staying here

105984,H tel Moli re, No air One small window that gave little circulation Staff tried but could not get air to work Turns out it was turned off at master, Staff location Room was very lean Bath unique
105985,H tel Moli re, there is a lounge area which could do with a little bar apart from that I cannot fault the place, cant fault the hotel perfect location clean staff were more than helpful and very friendly I would have no hesitation to return only thing missing is a bar for an evening drink 
105986,H tel Moli re, Breakfast room a bit cramped and breakfast quite pricey 15EUR pp with poor coffee , Quiet side street location but central just 5 mins from the Louvre Lots of nearby restaurants Hotel very comfortable with everything we wanted Good wi fi 
105987,H tel Moli re,No Negative, Location of the hotel was great Breakfast although extra was good value offering an excellent selection Staff were all very friendly and helpful The hotel was super clean and room well equipped despite us booking into the cheapest room e g with a lovely shower bathrobes decent hair dryer a nespresso style coffee maker etc Would happily stay there again 
105988,H tel Moli re,No Negative, Firstly the location was so central for accessing everything we wanted to see by walking by Metro and by tourist buses Secondly the staff were wonderful You can help yourself to coffee and pastries every time you step in the door but if the staff see you they will offer to make your coffee they are delightful There is no bar but when we wanted to celebrate a special birthday the staff were more than happy to provide glasses and an ice bucket and we bought our own drinks at the shop over the road We sat and drank it in the cosy and comfortable seating area looking out onto a pretty courtyard We had opted for a room with a terrace which was on the 6th floor It wasn t cheap but we do enjoy being able to step outside from our room and we weren t disappointed the terrace was spacious with plants at the sides and enough room for our friends to sit out with us around the patio table I regret that we didn t find time to enjoy the sauna etc it all looked very nice We tried the breakfast the first morning and it was so good we decided to have breakfast there every day They thought of everything I particularly enjoyed the fresh summer fruits Little touches like the welcome gifts lovely spacious shower complimentary half bottle of Champagne for my husband s birthday large flat screen TV and helpful advice on the desk at all times made the whole experience very special Thank you Hotel Moliere

105991,H tel Moli re, Rooms a little small Very frustrating that the 4 English speaking TV channels seemed to be jammed out of a total of 90 channels , Terrific breakfast Fantastic location Wonderful sky light in room 74 
105992,H tel Moli re,No Negative, Great location close to the Metro and a suprisingly quiet location The staff leave you alone if you want them to and are very attentive when you need them to be Great coffee for free too 
105993,H tel Moli re, Not much of a complaint but a normal shower head would have been nice The rain showers are nice but I am accustomed to a regular shower head , Great location and staff I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others 
105994,H tel Moli re,No Negative, Location is fantastic we walked to all the main sights There are excellent restaurants in the area and if you don t know where to go ask at the front desk and they will give you the best recommendations The room was beautiful and spotless clean
