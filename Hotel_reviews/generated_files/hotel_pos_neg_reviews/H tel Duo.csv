34383,H tel Duo, Nothing it was all great One small complaint the bathroom sliding door in our room 61 seemed to be broken so quite difficult to close but I think it would be a simple fix , Fantastic location in le Marias Wonderful staff Lovely room and decor Obviously the rooms are on the smaller side this is Paris but not uncomfortable at all Highly recommended 
34384,H tel Duo, More smiling faces at the reception area, major mall Le Maris is only steps away close to two subways A lot of cafes to choose from easy stroll to Pompidou and Notra Dame
34385,H tel Duo, Except for smallness of rooms all was wonderful , Staff and location cannot be beaten Rooms are Parisian small Breakfast and late night beer were delightful 
34386,H tel Duo, I was surprised I was charged for bottled water If a hotel charges me 300 euros per night don t go and charge for the 2 bottles of mineral water in the room At the least one or 2 bottles should be complimentary and anything above that should be charged like most other hotels , Friendly and accommodating staff Location is superb Bed is very comfortable 
34387,H tel Duo, Doors are very thin you can hear guest talking or coming back late at night home The bathroom had a bath tube without curtain the floor of the tiny bathroom gets wet in no time, Location is top in the middle of the lively Marais district just 300m away from Centre Pompidou and 50 m from Rue de Rivoli Staff was fantastic got even an upgrade to my room very friendly incl during breakfast very chique room Wi Fi working everything was great 
34388,H tel Duo, check in was problematic we were given a room that someone was there the worst mistake then when going back to the reception was shamed to get an offer for a downgrade with a discount insisted and got a bigger room with a view to the construction that is going on very loud wake up on a vacation ask before you book , ambience and location are the pros
34389,H tel Duo, Wifi was poor at times , Very friendly staff excellent location We had the pleasure of having very nice cocktails at the hotel bar The barman was very friendly open to our suggestions Great guy 
34390,H tel Duo, construction works ongoing and a rather outdated small elevator , very central hotel comfortable albeit rather small rooms good beds and bathrooms very friendly and forthcoming staff 
34391,H tel Duo, Rooms were a little small for more than one person, Front desk was very friendly and helpful They were there to accommodate any questions and always with a smile 
34392,H tel Duo, Our room looked nothing like the website at all I booked a boutique property but had a budget bedroom Extremely dissatisfied with the bedroom The only reason I didn t complain was because we were on our first romantic weekend away together and I didn t want to ruin it , Location
34393,H tel Duo,No Negative, The hotel was centrally located Easy to get around Paris Lots of bars and restaurants nearby Metro 2 minutes walk Using the city bikes is great fun easy to use and quick to get around lots of bike lanes and great to use along the river
34394,H tel Duo, Breakfast should be included but it s okay There s a nice croissant shop nearby Nothing that i didn t like , The hotel is 3 5 mins walk from Hotel de Ville Station The staff is very nice and welcoming They provide maps and tell you about interesting attractions The room is large Better than i expected All necessary facilities provided There re many restaurants nearby and it s a fun walk to Notre Dame and nice places I had a nice stay here 
34395,H tel Duo, High prices No minibar , Very friendly chatty staff Fabulous luggage storage Luggage rack in room Great location near BHV buses and Metro Great bathroom with generous supply of toiletries Feels like luxury hotel Hotel tradition and history 
34396,H tel Duo,No Negative, Room was small but comfortable The bathroom was quite a good size The staff were v friendly and attentive and had lots of advice to share about restaurants and things to do The bar area is very nice to relax in I would definitely stay here again 
34397,H tel Duo, find it hard to fault this hotel overall is a lovely hotel both location and welcome of guests room can be cosy but this is Paris unless you pay more ive heard other reviews mention no coffee making facilities in the room but PLEASE this is Paris with excellent coffee in cafes all over 2 are literally 10 steps from the hotel who on earth would want to sit in a room and drink processed coffee Its mainly people from the North American continent that want coffee in a hotel room PLEASE NOOOOO, Modern clean friendly and helpful staff and a handsome guy on reception too Great location will be back again close to all usual attractions and shopping location is perfect high end stores one street away gucci valentino chanel etc all other regluar stores too and perisian life in abundance with cafe bakeries and independent shops all over perfect location for exporing paris My 4th time in Paris and it never gets old and glad I booked this hotel I will use again 
34398,H tel Duo,No Negative, The hotel Wes very centrally located to the historic district We could walk to most sites and there were tons of restaurants to choose from The hotel itself was very nice with plenty of amenities 
34399,H tel Duo, Probably the smallest room I have ever stayed in a 4 star hotel Wi fi not working properly Not very quite , Cool design and convenient location if you want to stay in this part of Paris
34400,H tel Duo,No Negative, Very friendly staff I checked in at lunch time and they recommended me an excellent restaurant and explained how to get there The breakfast in the morning was very good 
34401,H tel Duo, Closer parking would be nice but impossible on this historic city, On my second stay in the last two years my husband and I celebrate our anniversary here We love the trendy chic style and luxury feel of this small hotel that still has it s old world features like original staircase and winding hallways Its location is ideal for a 4 minute stroll to Notre Dame or lover s walk along the river The room is well appointed with 2 USB ports electronic door locks small stocked refrigerator lots of closet space large bathroom with plush towels very comfortable bed great pillows and fine linens No view from this particular room but blackout curtains made for a great late wake up 
34402,H tel Duo, Wish there were water cooker in the room so I can make my warm lemon water in the morning , Everything Especially the staff Super friendly and really helpful 
34403,H tel Duo,No Negative, Amazing location easy access to everything but a stylish area with great restaurants bars and shops Short walk to Notre Dam and the train there goes to Versailles the Seine and the Louvre then a gorgeous walk to the Champs Elysee Lovely hotel The rooms are small but clean and have everything you need Cute little bar and friendly staff who kindly tolerate visitors poor French 
34404,H tel Duo,No Negative, I recently stayed at the hotel duo for two nights The hotel is in the best location amongst shops and restaurants and a short walk from tourist attractions and transport The hotel was modern and very clean with everything you could need The staff were very friendly and helpful I had a great stay and would definitely return to this hotel on my next trip to Paris 
34405,H tel Duo, There was construction on the facsade during my stay so scaffolding and netting obstructed my view but otherwise there was nothing I didn t like about the hotel itself, My room was petit pretty and typical Parisian with a touch of modern Minibar was fully stocked USB ports in the room for smart devices The bathroom was good size modern and good toiletries Hotel staff was friendly but most of all the location was perfect Literally steps away from shopping cafes Notre Dame and the metro 
34406,H tel Duo, It s too basic for a 4 star property It s just basic clean tiny room The rooms are too small There is no mirror in the room , Location staff was very friendly and helpful
34407,H tel Duo, Leaving the key at reception every time you exit the building is a nuisance but you get used to it The rooms are on the smaller side but relatively clean and well worth the money , The comments are all true this hotel offers amazing value for the price Modern updated rooms Excellent location in the Marais Next time I am in Paris I will definitely stay here again 
34408,H tel Duo, Although its away from the main road my room was over looking the street The windows weren t very sound proof so I could hear people outside leaving cafes cars and sirens etc Also there was no kettle in the room only a fridge with a mini bar i d have preferred the kettle , The location is fantastic The room was very comfortable and clean 
34409,H tel Duo, Would like tea and coffee making facilities in the room Not a fan of toilet separate from bathroom with no wash basin in toilet , Comfortable beds and excellent location 
34410,H tel Duo, The room was really small no place to unpack our trolleys The bed was short considering that me and my partner are not the tallest persons in the world No slippers or other ammenities that a 4 stars hotel should have , The location was perfect And the cleaning level was quite good 
34411,H tel Duo, My room was very noise due something like a service room behind it I think with AC motor making noise all night long The room was super hot even if the thermostat was set to 19 The breakfast it s a joke for 17 The lobby has to be cleaned early in the morning not when it s full of clients at 8 30 , Location
34412,H tel Duo, Superior room has separate non heated toilet also bathroom not properly heated, Location is perfect Quiet hotel nice rooms but pricy overall Staff is good
34413,H tel Duo, I had a bad night s sleep an alarm in the street going off continuously outside my room I can t fault the hotel for this but equally I can t rate comfort higher as a result , excellent location and quality for short business stay
34414,H tel Duo, None, I like the smooth of checking in the staff were super friendly the answers all my questions the breakfast is excellent i like the fact of the key room to return it back to the reception so vintage 
34415,H tel Duo, The toiletroom was separate and unfortunately it was really cold since there was no heater in there , Friendly personnel and the location was great Also nice and clean rooms I would recommend it 
34416,H tel Duo, Rooms really small phone did not work electrical outlets in wrong area and not enough mirrors lighting Housekeeping did not clean room appropriately or change drinking glasses , Location was perfect for nearby sites to visit 
34417,H tel Duo, Just that the safe was positioned above the mini bar so it was too hot for putting things inside , The staff were really nice Great location very clean 
34418,H tel Duo, Love this hotel but still think the rooms are just that bit too small , Great location clean and stylish decor throughout the hotel Friendly staff always smiling and willing to help Quiet rooms available 
34419,H tel Duo, We didn t like the small room or the bed which we didn t find very comfortable The breakfast charge of 17 euros and the quality of the breakfast was a disappointment Please note the location is great but it is very noisy The hotel offered us a free drink this is not as one would expect it was a shot of fruit juice , The location and hotel lobby are very good 
34420,H tel Duo, There is only one remark I have and that is the fact that the hotel is noise sensitive You don t hear the street noise but the alarm going off from the room next door , I had a great experience from the moment that I checked in to this hotel The employees are very welcoming caring and their recommendations are great The hotel is perfectly located in the middle of Le Marais to ensure great Parisian memories 
34421,H tel Duo, Honestly the only thing I can think of is that the room design was so modern that we struggled to find a place to hang up our towels , The staff was extra ordinarily nice the design of the place is even nicer than the photos and the location couldn t have been any more convenient for walking getting on the Metro or eating at great restaurants 
34422,H tel Duo, There were no coffee in the room that is the basic in each hotel Stair light timers are slow and poorly lit have to walk in the dark for a bit before lights come on and dangerous as close to stairs going down, It is very central of busy le marais 
34423,H tel Duo, The front elevator needs a makeover , Great Location in the midst of Le Marais Close to great attractions restaurants bars and clubs Also close to mainstream shopping 
34424,H tel Duo, The room was very small 10 mq I had an inconvenience with my iPad long story but eventually it ended up well Thanks to Sebastian for the support , Cleanliness position modern building with gym too
34425,H tel Duo, It s a bit pricey But as ever You get what you pay for We had free upgrades so the rooms were spacious for Paris , Our go to hotel in the Marais Friendly staff peaceful space and big comfortable bed The free cocktail got our evening off to a flying start 
34426,H tel Duo, The mini bar was not working There was no or very bad wifi in room 9 where I was staying This is very annoying for business travellers, Great location Friendly staff hotel
34427,H tel Duo, Nothing , Everything was absolutely perfect The location is unbelievable everything is walking distance including 1 min walk to metro Staff was so helpful and kind They gave us the room early and let us do a late checkout for free even though they were fully booked They also changed our original room witch was close to the elevators and a bit too noisy for us to a bigger and quieter room again for free Loved our stay here very much 
34428,H tel Duo, It s quite pricey but you get what you pay for It is a lovely hotel and I think it s worth every euro , Lovely comfortable big bed in a good sized room and the added rare benefit of windows that open to get some fresh air The Marais is a great location for exploring on foot the many little shops and boutiques This was our third stay and every time we look forward to the next chance to stay The free cocktail started our evening off perfectly 
34429,H tel Duo, At night only one person manages the desk and so cannot leave their post For example when I asked for a bedside lightbulb to be changed I had to wait until next day I can see this being a problem if something more serious needed attending , The location of the hotel is excellent close to the charming le Marais and the usual tourist sites It is small chic and modern with nicely appointed rooms The man who ran the breakfast area was charming and helpful 
34430,H tel Duo, The room was sold as a double deluxe we know the rooms in older hotels in Paris are usually small but this was dramatically small No room to swing the proverbial cat glad we spent every day out and about enjoying the city , The location 
34431,H tel Duo, A small light by the makeup mirror in the bathroom would be appreciated I was a little disappointed that some of my favorite shops were closed in August but my husband wasn t , The front desk staff were extremely helpful and friendly with suggestions for shopping restaurants and directions The breakfast everyday was delicious and the location could not be better The rooms are clean spacious and stylish We walked off all calories consumed by wonderful wine cheese and pastries and didn t gain a pound We hope to return again next year 
34432,H tel Duo,No Negative, The staff was incrediblefriendly and helpful both in helping us get around and making sure our stay was pleasant I would definitely stay here again 
34433,H tel Duo,No Negative, We arrived at 9 00 am and since the room was ready the man at the counter let us check in early Much appreciated Especially after an all night flight 
34434,H tel Duo, The room was very small and the bathroom very awkward but it was immaculate and bright with a great modern design which made it enjoyable to be there, The common areas are lovely and bright and modern Excellent location staff always accommodating
34435,H tel Duo, The room was exceptionally small and although I booked a double room the bed was possibly enough only for 1 , The rate I got for a last minute booking was great value 
34436,H tel Duo, Although the room was nice it was quite small , Just a few min walk from the metro station The room was clean and comfortable My overall experience there was good 
34437,H tel Duo, The bathroom sink There was no way to stop up the sink to wash lingerie The atrium next to the bar allowed guests to smoke cigars and cigarettes and we could smell it in the lobby , Everyone at the front desk the bartender the quietness of the room and the location The beds were very comfortable and the bath products smelled fantastic 
34438,H tel Duo, Nothing , Great staff so friendly and helpful thankfully excellent English spoken Excellent location Bedroom was really good size for Paris very clean contemporary and bathroom with showe and a bath with good toiletries Looking forward already to my next stay here in September October Definitely recommend 100 Thank you to the staff in particular for helping make it a great stay in Paris great and friendly service is always much appreciated 
34439,H tel Duo, The hallway up the stairs was a little dark , Great location modern and clean rooms Good use of space for a smaller single room and very comfortable The staff was very helpful 
34440,H tel Duo, The curtains on the window were basically see through and there was light outside of the room all night long , The apartment was very nice and clean with good decor The bed was comfortable 
34441,H tel Duo, The Breakfasts for 17 euros were pathetic better going out which we did after the first day The room was small had been partially renovated on the cheap The lift was the scary part it drops 150 mmm before it starts going up and feels like it is not going to make it Very noisy room they start at daybreak washing down the sidewalks removing garbage deliveries etc and this is every morning, Good Location
34442,H tel Duo, Very small rooms surroundings a bit noisy with traffic and public just outside the windows, Perfect location with a lot of options close by for food drinks coffee shopping and public transport
34443,H tel Duo, They really should consider not playing hysterical jazz in the loudspeakers at 7 o clock in the morning at breakfast Two days in a row unbearable and there are loudspeakers everywhere there s no escape into a quiet corner or anything possible hysterical jazz Comon At seven in the morning some quiet soft music if they really really have to play music at all at that time would be suitable Lower the volume Chrissake ,No Positive
34444,H tel Duo, Nothing, Fantastic central location lots with easy walking distance very friendly staff at reception comfortable bed clean if quite small room but this is Paris this is my second visit to Hotel Duo
34445,H tel Duo, WiFi This was really awful and has been mentioned on here before It was rubbish everywhere even in reception and even for the staff It took them 2 days to get a technician out to fix This is a problem if you re there on business The room was basic and small double bed for single occupancy but probably expected for the centre of Paris Bit disappointing there s no tea or coffee making facility Breakfast is a rip off 17 for continental per day The TV is meant to have 30 channels in different languages but actually had 8 all in French and some rubbish reception No iron in the room , Location on Rue de Rivoli 2min walk to Hotel de Ville on line 1 and 8min from Ch telet lines 1 4 Loads of places to eat near by Price ok for location Decent clean and comfortable room 
34446,H tel Duo, Room was very small looked out at snother building Not air conditioned so could be hot in summer Toilet in separate room from shower on other side of room no sink in the toilet room For yhe price breakfast dhould be included , Location was wonderful Close to metto Hotel deVille stop Close to many restaurants and bars Front desk staff was very friendly helpful cheerful always knew my name Bed was comfortable 
34447,H tel Duo, The thermostat to my room was broken and the heater was on all day I informed the desk staff but all he could say was to open up the window There was no offer to relocate me to a different room that had a working thermostat with a cooling fan nor the offer to have engineer fix it Just very poor customer service on his part I was there for 4 nights sleeping with the window open and having trouble sleeping due to the street noise in order to have my room be cooled down A recommendation to not only have your staff trained properly but to also have all the amenities in the room in working order before checking any guests into a room , Location was great Majority of the staff were good 
34448,H tel Duo, I just didn t like the breakfast but it s surrounded by amazing cafes and bars so that s the Parisian thing It s no big deal , The location of Hotel Duo is perfect I arrived by train and metro and it was very easy even with lots of luggage for a first timer in Paris The staff were overly helpful One of the reception staff I feel terrible forgetting his name is a complete foodie and had the best advice on where to eat for each specific dish you might like to taste in Paris From local knowledge of the area to assisting with airlines the staff were outstanding 
34449,H tel Duo,No Negative, The location of the hotel is perfect Just 5 min walk to Seine The staffs there are very friendly and very helpful The room is very small But considering the position of the hotel it is reasonable 
34450,H tel Duo, It would be nice if a breakfast more to the taste of an English guest were available , The location was near perfect the hotel was clean and comfortable and all the staff were helpful and friendly Will stay again 
34451,H tel Duo, It did the job nothing more thought it was a little expensive for what it was and charging 17 euro s extra per person for breakfast was a downright cheek fed three people with a great breakfast at the cafe opposite for 18 euro s total ,No Positive
34452,H tel Duo,No Negative, Location was brilliant Staff friendly and efficient and spoke excellent English Rooms small but very well equipped with comfy bed and spotless bathroom Everything we needed 
34453,H tel Duo, Room was very small for a premium price, Wonderful location in le Marais close to hotel de Ville and centre Pompidou Staff is very friendly and helpful and the breakfast is great
34454,H tel Duo, Fridge not working in room hence drinks warm Informed reception on several occasions to be told the technician had fixed it This was not the case At the end of the day this is your financial loss as we were unable to drink any items from the fridge cafe across the road benefited from this greatly ,No Positive
34455,H tel Duo, Very small rooms and they have an extra charge if you want a room with a view It was quite expensive , The room was very clean and well set up for the size of it 
34456,H tel Duo, Breakfast was unremarkable and a little pricey Pre packaged cheese was a little disappointing , Great location steps from the Seine Very helpful staff gave good dinner recommendations Staff were happy to serve breakfast even when I got the timing wrong and arrived after they d officially stopped serving 
34457,H tel Duo, Nothing really , Beautiful hotel in a great location Modern rooms with incredibly comfortable beds Got upgraded because there was some construction work going on near the first room very good staff 
34458,H tel Duo, We try to ask about the reservation in advance but didn t get answers so we weren t happy to have a very very little room, Location was great Staff Very nice
34459,H tel Duo, the shower cabin in the single room was on the small side but there was nothing else really that I did not like, location staff big and comfy bed in the single room 
34460,H tel Duo, conditioner would have been handy and maybe breakfast could be a little cheaper, A lovely room not as small as I expected and impressively quiet considering location Great design throughout the hotel The bathroom was nice and warm just what you want in winter the sauna was a great treat really nicely well maintained space and staff were helpful and friendly looking forward to returning 
34461,H tel Duo, some parts of the hotel were under maintenance and renovations, As usual amazing staff clean and comfortable rooms best location near to restaurants shops and subway
34462,H tel Duo, The noise from the road in the morning In my experience it s always like this in Paris and it always takes me 1 2 nights to adapt and be able to sleep later than 6 am so I guess this is not really specific to this hotel but having better sound isolating windows would have been nice, The location is just great very central and very close to a metro station the room was small but well designed and equipped the staff was always very nice
34463,H tel Duo, The toilet and bathroom were two seperate rooms and the toulet did bot have a sink Basically one needs to cross the room in order to wash his hands after toilet use , The location is excellent Staff is friendly Got a complimentary upgrade 
34464,H tel Duo, Shower had a drain blockage and because it did not have a tub the water crept out to the rest of the bathroom Had I not noticed and stopped shower bathroom would have been flooded Attention to this should be paid for rooms with no bath tub , Excellent staff very helpful Beautifully decorated interior in lobby and common areas Comfortable bed and quiet room Two minute walk to metro Hotel de Villes 
34465,H tel Duo, In the evening the room was quite hot and there is no way to cool it off as you aren t able to open windows due to the noise in the street below The noise is fine during the day If you choose to leave the windows closed the windows block the noise very well It can also be enjoyable to listen to the sounds of the street during the day If you want a room without street noise they have them in the back of the building but those rooms are quite a bit darker , Location was perfect Hotel decor was lovely Staff was very helpful Many restaurants to choose from and lots of shopping in the area 
34466,H tel Duo, We found the room very small especially as we had a lot of luggage we had been travelling for 8 weeks The room smelled as if people had been smoking in it previously Lift was small and slow However we are aware of the age and size of the property , The location was excellent close to so many Paris attractions Staff were extremely friendly and helpful especially assisting us to access restaurants and transport Room was nicely appointed and spotless 
34467,H tel Duo, I was in room 56 and I could hear everything going on in room 57 I thought that 17 for a continental breakfast was a little on the expensive side however it was good , The shower bed TV channels and quality of reception of the signals and the quality of the WiFi I also liked the fact that breakfast was served as early as 07 30 hrs on weekend days 
34468,H tel Duo, Room way too small for the price an i could never stay with a partner because there is zero privacy due to the proximity of the bed to the bathroom, The staff at reception
34469,H tel Duo, I go to Paris many times per year Typically for the price we paid one can get a better room Bigger more comfortable Breakfast although cheap for Paris prices was just inadequate I would have rather paid 30 euro for a good breakfast Eggs were so over done service was slow , Location staff
34470,H tel Duo, We had room 9 on the ground floor which was fine the entrance to the room was outside from the back of the hotel and when retuning at night felt the area was not well lit there was a sensor light but the light outside our room didn t seem to be working Entrance area seemed to be for storage Wifi didn t work in the room except near the door If you were on the bed wifi dropped out Wifi range needs to be improved , Our room was very spacious and the bed very comfortable bathroom also very spacious 
34471,H tel Duo, Breakfast was too expensive so I went to a local caf plenty of local cafes restaurants do breakfast and what they call American breakfast for a reasonable price Across the road where the tabac is does a better breakfast than the caf diagonally opposite it The TV channel listing provided suggested that there were 4 English language channels but there was only 1 CNN so the guide needs updating , What s not to like I had a single room which had a double bed but it was so well designed that even though the size was small I barely noticed I loved having an in room safe and the bed was really comfortable The shower was small but the bathroom was a great size overall The staff were really helpful friendly and efficient The hotel is really easy to find being right behind the Hotel de Ville and close to the Hotel de Ville metro and a short walk to the RER for CDG connections at Chatelet Les Halles I could walk to most things and exploring the Marais was fun there s a strip of patisseries just around the corner that I highly recommend I actually left a bag with the hotel for a few days before my check in and I greatly appreciated them doing that I d love to stay at Hotel Duo again 
34472,H tel Duo, Water pressure in the shower was a bit low, The location couldn t be better for someone who wants to enjoy the nightlife and great food 2 steps from a metro station The bed was by far the best one i ve slept in and the street below is surprisingly quiet at night we booked a Deluxe Double room 
34473,H tel Duo,No Negative, Excellent location in the Marais short walk to Notre Dame Centre Pompidou and reasonable walk to Louvre and other sites a little further Property was nicely decorated and well maintained Overall a tidy hotel My single attic room had plenty of space and was comparable to a micro hotel room 
34474,H tel Duo, I think that the price of 300 for a room per night is a bit much for a room at this hotel , I liked the English speaking and superb service oriented front desk personnel and the location of the hotel 
34475,H tel Duo, The only thing was the size of the shower which was really tiny about 4 sq ft I am a small person but the shower was even too tiny for my comfort , Fantastic location Very clean and modern decor good use of space within a tiny room Quiet at night even though it s on a busy corner of Le Marais amid lots of shops and restaurants Staff was very nice and helpful I d definitely recommend Hotel Duo 
34476,H tel Duo,No Negative, Great location and very helpful staff Bar was closed for all of August but plenty of local bars around Rooms are small but very clean and have all you need
34477,H tel Duo, Bad luck with the waiter on the breakfast Unattended and on the phone not professional , Location It s all about the location Nice refurbished rooms 
34478,H tel Duo, Not a lot of room around the bed Was traveling with my daughter around they kept pushing them together so had to pull them apart each night , The free WiFi was a major plus The staff was super nice expecially the young lady who worked until 7 She gave us good advice on siteseeing spoke great English and had great restaurant recommendation 
34479,H tel Duo,No Negative, I liked the location of the Hotel and also the warmth and friendliness of the receptionist a young French guy with impeccable good English in an American accent he is excellent with people 
34480,H tel Duo, Nothing , Friendly and helpful staff Extermely convenient location to theaters clubs restaurants museums and Notre Dame cathedral Nice room with cool a c during a warm July period 
34481,H tel Duo, The male at reception was deliberately unhelpful which negatively impacted on what would have been a great stay , Location was great room was modern and clean and the young lady at reception was friendly and helpful I was fortunate to receive an upgrade to a double room 
34482,H tel Duo, Wifi is not working very well in bedroom signal keep cutting, Location is very good close to metro attractions shopping and nightlife Stuff is very friendly and helpful
34483,H tel Duo,No Negative, really amazing location i believe it s the best place ever to stay in paris excellent helpful staff that really gave tips and guides around paris and i really enjoyed my stay there
34484,H tel Duo,No Negative, The location is terrific staff all super friendly and helpful all fluent in English with clean modern rooms Prior reviews cited slow wifi but we did not find that to be the case
