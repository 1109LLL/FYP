18445,The Nadler Soho, Hotels in London are extremely expensive compared to other places I have visited Nadler is no different and I know this is not their fault but I would go back to London more often if it wasn t for the cost,No Positive
18446,The Nadler Soho, Air condition needed maintenance and after it was fine You can t open the windows Most room have no views and some of them a little dark, Second stay at the Nadler Soho and still find it to be a fine hotel with excellent staff one of the best I ve met in London Rooms are small simple yet fine and quiet Bed comfortable shower is great and the small kitchen is a nice addition and usually I am not a fan of this feature You get a nearby gym pool access which are very nice All in all a hidden gem if you understand that it s the location and a very good night sleep that you are getting I intend to stay again
18447,The Nadler Soho,No Negative, The design of the room was simply stunning It was cozy and comfortable I really enjoyed the layout of the room as well as the atmosphere What was most impressive was the customised function accessible from the television It really helped with the ambience 
18448,The Nadler Soho, I didn t like that there was no restaurant or bar in the premises I hadn t realised this when I booked and it seemed like a very strange thing especially as there wasn t really facility in the room to eat breakfast for example Did mean that we checked out early not ideal for a 309 00 per night stay ,No Positive
18449,The Nadler Soho, I would have appreciated someone walking towards the main entrance to welcome me and help with my luggage , I am a very demanding traveler with high standards Despite the central location in Soho the Hotel was in a quiet street walking distance to Selfridges Piccadilly and Oxford Street I categorize this Hotel as a boutique serviced residence I liked the clean modern and minimalist style of the Hotel and the spacious room Bed was super comfy and bathroom was modern clean and spacious too Some Coffee and Tea was complementary though they could as a standard provide 1 2 bottles of plain water I had to ask at the reception Breakfast is available on demand They provide a menu from Le Pain au cotidien to choose from and deliver it to your room at the requested time Worked like a charm and I love Pain au cotidien This is a well deserved 4 star hotel In my opinion 5 stars can only be given to establishments like the Four Seasons Shangri la Le Connaught where you are literally treated like royalty 
18450,The Nadler Soho, The toilet bowl seat wasn t clean when we got our room Room wasn t ready till 2 30pm even though we requested an earlier check in if possible and did let them know via a booking com message upon booking that we will be checking out at 5am , Comfy bed great location Lots of good restaurants nearby 
18451,The Nadler Soho, We couldn t get our room dark enough even with the shutters all closed , The rooms were very attractive with contemporary furnishings The kitchenette was a bonus it would be useful on a longer stay The front desk staff was friendly and helpful The wifi worked quite well We were able to walk to the British Museum theaters and the Underground It was easy to get around The neighborhood had many excellent restaurants and pubs 
18452,The Nadler Soho, soft mattress, a great place very attentive staff very clean 2 minor issues room a bit small for 3 but at such location every SqMt costs and mattress a bit soft for my liking but comfortable nonetheless 
18453,The Nadler Soho, Nothing it was very good, The Nadler Soho Hotel is very well located in the heart of Soho close to bars restaurants shops and all there is to do and see in London The staff is amazingly nice and helpful 24 7 The rooms are very convenient not too big but very well adjusted to their size kitchen hidden in the closet for example The amenities are excellent I would highly recommend this hotel for a couple and or friends business trip It is a boutique hotel close to anything you may need in the heart of London 
18454,The Nadler Soho, Staff were ignorant Hotel facilities were poor Overall very underwhelming for the money , The location was excellent Rooms were clean and the bed was very comfortable 
18455,The Nadler Soho, The in room iron is cheap and I scorched my pants using it , Very friendly staff and fantastic location Restaurants bars and shopping were all walking distance away Four different tube stations nearby made it really convenient to base out of for sightseeing 
18456,The Nadler Soho, The room was very small and it was on the ground floor When I opened the shutters in the morning there s a bike parked outside my window while the other had someone making themselves at home on the pavement With people walking by all day and if you re unsure of how good the reflective glass is you feel trapped Which I did , Good location nice helpful staff anda refreshingly unfussy approach to running things 
18457,The Nadler Soho, The housekeeping services were less than thorough There is no restaurant or bar in the hotel which they pitch as a concept as if it were deliberate Some of the staff were a little less than helpful , Super location although on a sketchy block right next door to a gentlemens club Two block walk to Oxford Street shopping great restaurants and pubs everywhere Our room was small but well designed and the beds were comfortable Many of the staff were exceptionally helpful with our questions 
18458,The Nadler Soho,No Negative, Great small hotel Room was very nicely designed Great water pressure Small kitchen just what we needed when traveling with a teenager If you are looking for a full services hotel with room service gyms business center this is not the place If your looking for a cool small hotel in the heart of Soho this is a great choice 
18459,The Nadler Soho, Breakfast selection was difficult for me so I didn t order the night before but I was told after the event that if I had special requirement to let them know before I stayed again and they could try and accommodate The stay was great though staff room and location and I would stay again with no problem , The room and decor Very comfortable bed 
18460,The Nadler Soho,No Negative, Staff was extremely helpful the accommodations were excellent and the location could not have been better for walking to most sights and taking the subway to others 
18461,The Nadler Soho, The sofa bed was not the most comfy bed I have slept on , Accommodation was comfortable and staff were attentive The central location is great within walking distance of many attractions Given its central location the hotel is remarkably quiet 
18462,The Nadler Soho, I wish there had been a bath instead of a shower , The staff were exceptional We had quite stressful journey and booked the wrong dates too on top of that However the hotel staff went above and beyond they were so helpful professional and welcoming I would stay there again in a heartbeat Also loved there is a microwave in the room with a tucked away kitchen unit so you could make your own meals which is great It was neat comfortable and exceeded our expectations 
18463,The Nadler Soho, The Talixo Mozio taxi that I prepaid via booking com as a taxi partner to take my family from the airport to the hotel was a no show they claim they were there but they did seem to have a problem with time differences between London and Berlin Whatever their problem they were not there when we arrived as scheduled prebooked and prepaid After prolonged phone calls and emails an hour and half delay and no remedy offered I had to hire another taxi for the trip and paid twice approx AUD130 prepaid then AUD150 ie 86 for the journey from the airport to the hotel This is not the hotels fault and I am sorry I am including this debacle in association with their good review They suggested that in future I contact them directly to arrange transport the next time I stay as our friends successfully did Although I selected the taxi prebooking from a list provided by booking com as the hotel s booking partners the hotel said this was not who they use just a Booking com list I suggest you avoid booking a taxi with Talixo Mozio which are actually based in Berlin Talixo and the US Mozio This I only discovered when it became necessary to phone them when no taxi was waiting One appears to be the booking agent for the other So each blames the other and leaves you in the lurch and out of pocket , The room ensuite and concealed kitchenette were compact but very well appointed attractive and comfortable Electrical adaptors iron nespresso style coffee machine teapot kettle and microwave were provided in addition to the usual fridge The ensuite had both a rain shower and hand shower adequate shelving and a good light over the mirror The wardrobe had useful shelving as well as hanging space The staff were excellent welcoming helpful and friendly

18466,The Nadler Soho, My only issue was that the rooms were a bit small but that s not unusual for London I d rather have a smaller room in a great location then a big room in a bad one , A small boutique hotel in an excellent location for pub crawls and taking in the sites The staff was superb 
18467,The Nadler Soho,No Negative, Over the past few years I have stayed at The Nadler Soho a number of times The walls carpets bedding and linens continue to be as clean and fresh as they were when the hotel first opened The friendly helpful staff always provides a very high level of customer service I consider the Nadler Soho my West End home 
18468,The Nadler Soho, pillows quite hard seeing as you ask about the bed Lack of facilities is almost laughable particularly when staff suggested that this was because they wanted to interact with local businesses whilst simultaneously telling us that they had breakfast arrangements in place for clients with a Pain Quotidien which was an 8 minute walk away , location second to none in quiet cul de sac yet close to buzzing area of Soho
18469,The Nadler Soho, Mattress in bed was not flat so one side of mattress was not comfortable at all room is very hot so AC is mandatory as you cant open the windows but am not a big fan of AC so I was hot in the room champagne problems to be honest , amazing location in the heart of SOHO but still quiet hotel rooms were very clean very small but very nicely done mini kitchen with fridge and Nespresso machine bathroom was superb room was spotless as well as entire hotel staff discreet but helpful if needed

18477,The Nadler Soho, The size of the room Besides that excellent property , Everything was excellent from the staff to the cleanliness to the service the design the location seriously everything except the size of the rooms Wayyyy too small Depends on what you expect I guess 
18478,The Nadler Soho, I can t say I have anything bad to say about this property Loved it too much , I loved the service at this boutique modern hotel The style and ambiance they create for their guests not only in the lobby but in the rooms are outstanding I stayed at this hotel for 16 nights in March 2017 I even booked a day trip for a tour through the front desk team which I liked I enjoyed being treated well with a bottle of wine on ice in my room and the smart TV that was personalized with my name on it welcoming me to the hotel The interface of the Smart TV was very easy to use and navigate through including a welcome letter for me on the screen explaining all about the property and WIFI password They even had a handwritten card welcoming me to the hotel sitting at the desk in my room The bathroom had the amenities and extras I used and enjoyed throughout my stay The kitchenette was lovely I loved making a cup of Nespresso every morning and because there was a Tesco right next door I would often keep a few drinks or snacks in the fridge as well due to my long stay Every morning I set out to leave the hotel or when I returned the staff would wish me a great day out and then welcome me back at night I slept like a baby in a very quiet room on the second floor even though the hotel is located in the middle of a very busy Soho spot This is what I loved You could be out having fun at a pub one minute with hundreds of others making noises throughout the evening and next minute I would be in solitude in my room I have stayed at other 5 star hotels and am surprised this place is only a 4 star I have to say I enjoyed Nadler Soho more than the 5 star I stayed at last time while in London which I won t mention here I definitely recommend this hotel to any young and old person who enjoys staying in the center of a bustling international city which is no more than 5 to 10 minute walk to Mayfair Oxford st shopping Regent Street Trafalgar Square Stage Shows British Museum and so much more

18551,The Nadler Soho, We did book a small double and it was small the bed was up against the window so the person on that side had to either clamber to the bottom of the bed into a small gap or climb over their partner It was fine for a 2 nights stay I will book a bigger room next time , Room was very well equipped with a mini kitchen even a Brita water filter and a Nespresso machine Lots of attention to detail to help make you feel comfortable but nice and unfussy too Loved the big shower 
18552,The Nadler Soho, The room is small for its price There s not a lot of storage space especially if it is for two people You can t open the windows so you can t get fresh air in the rooms Also the hotel does not have its own restaurant or bar , The location is very good close to all the nice restaurants in Soho and Fitzovia major underground stations such as Oxford Circus Stn and Tottenham Court Road Stn major shopping streets such as Regent St and Oxford St Soho is busy even until late at night so it is safe for travelers until late But hotel is slightly on the side street of the busy street so still is quiet in the rooms 
18553,The Nadler Soho, Would be nice to have 2 chairs for 2 people Also some supporting rail in the bath shower , Lovely location in a very pleasant and friendly area of Soho Welcoming and very helpful staff Lovely comfortable beds 
18554,The Nadler Soho, ONLY real advice need some down or faux down pillows The bed sheets linens towels all super comfortable , The staff was simply TOP NOTCH I was so impressed with the quality of comfort service 
18555,The Nadler Soho, Not anything really but a minor point was that the room did not have earl gray tea bags, The hotel was in a prime location with fantastic rooms The staff were very helpful on arrival providing us with a cup of coffee and showing us to our room
18556,The Nadler Soho, Pillows could be upgraded A C a bit weak , Kitchen very convenient Good security needed room card for hall floor and elevator access Really nice staff 
18557,The Nadler Soho, Gay pride march s impact on the area was terrible noise garbage overcrowding etc, Service every person at the hotel was extremely helpful full marks 
18558,The Nadler Soho,No Negative, Front desk staff were excellent from check in to advice support to check out No restaurant on site but room service option through local cafe bakery Even better Go to the bakery just down the block and eat there Fabulous expanded menu 
18559,The Nadler Soho, Could have done with more nespressos twice the amount and greater choice of breakfast some hot choices , Room very comfy and free champagne on arrival for our anniversary Staff called shortly after we arrived at our room to check we were happy with it and that was an excellent touch Liked coffee maker nespresso and that decaf was available 
18560,The Nadler Soho, I didn t like having to leave and come home , We like to walk and so we used the central SOHO location to see most of central London We walked round trip to and from the Globe Theatre Tate Modern National Portrait Gallery Buckingham Palace Prince of Wales Theatre and the National History Museum We felt safe doing these walks even late in the evening Never used a taxi except for going to Heathrow airport The staff Aru Helen Liliana and the others were FANTASTIC They greeted us every day on the way out and coming back in They helped us score great tickets to Book of Mormon provided a detailed map with perfect guidance and gave us the best restaurant recommendations of course got the bookings with very nice tables The neighborhood really vibrates with lots of folks spilling out of the bars after work and into the evening It was great to see the activity and camaraderie And lastly even with all the action outside our room was quiet For being right in the heart of SOHO and London proper we slept very easily comfortably and without noisy interruption The contemporary room was exceptionally clean and neat Well laid out with a small kitchen inset including sink mini frig coffee expresso maker dishes glasses flatware and importantly a wine bottle opener The bathroom was totally functional with walk in shower and enough shelf space for lots of personal stuff not just one toothbrush There was a warming rake for towels and small laundry items Overall it was a great time for us We were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary with a trip through SW England and our stay at the Nadler was the best way to cap it off We will book the Nadler again 
18561,The Nadler Soho, Booked in advance and i feel i paid well over the odds for the room probably a combination of booking com and bad luck , Room was good with nice branded mod cons the wife likes the GHD hairdryer etc Great bed and TV with good coffee machine in room Staff very pleasant and helpful
18562,The Nadler Soho, Sad there are no bar facilities or better breakfast options , From the moment we arrived the reception staff could not have been more helpful The room and bathroom were immaculate The position of the hotel is wonderful Our room was very quiet and had a little outside terrace Excellent value for money in the Theatre District Very close to Tottenham Court Road tube station 
18563,The Nadler Soho, Nothing, Great location just off Soho Square with loads of places to explore The front of house staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the room excellent I ll definitely stay again 
18564,The Nadler Soho, There wasn t anything we didn t like , The staff were so very friendly and accomodating When we requested ice and extra loo paper we received it promptly and with friendliness When we arrived I wasn t entirely happy with the room location possible noise issues abd size and when I discussed this with the manager he upgraded us for free to a great room with a bath and patio and larger Also very quiet It really was very much appreciated by us The decor was great and very up market and stylish Fantastic location 
18565,The Nadler Soho,No Negative, I have been to a lot of places but this place had the best service ever Just as we arrived the blonde lady was extremely friendly and very helpful Helping us with any of our concerns I generally don t care about the service but having someone so enthusiastic made my day The price is good for the quality you get bed is comfy and you get tons of preloaded videos to watch on tv We didn t have any breakfast there so can t rate it It was also very clean even in some hotels in Japan you could find hairs of the cleaning lady but here not 
18566,The Nadler Soho,No Negative, Great location within walking distance to most locations of interest Very welcoming staff who were also informative about local eateries and directions Would definitely stay again 
18567,The Nadler Soho, Nothing I loved it , The location was excellent so central in Soho but so quiet inside The room was also very cosy I had a single room it just felt like such a luxury Coffee machine was an extra added bonus 
18568,The Nadler Soho, Shower sucks Either arctic cold or burning hot Rather sparsely decorated looked a little stark Computer for printing doesn t work , Location is beyond excellent all my favourite London cafes are just a 2 min walk away Beautiful fluffy robes Comfy bed 
18569,The Nadler Soho, Given that the hotel didn t have a bar restaurant or any other facilities so you are paying for just the room I expected the bedding to be of better quality the sheets themselves were lovely and crisp but the pillows felt fairly cheap and the duvet was a bit stiff It would have been good to have a mirror in the room not just the bathroom so you could dry your hair in front of it I had to guess what I was doing , We stayed in a standard double which was comfortable for two The shower was lovely and the room was immaculately clean Staff were exceptionally polite and attentive Fantastic location Excellent hairdryer GHD straighteners provided
18570,The Nadler Soho, Breakfast only serves until 10 was not to fond of location , Great hotel Excellent staff Comfortable room and wonderful bathroom Staff went above and beyond to help you Even after your checked out they are willing to go the extra mile
18571,The Nadler Soho, The room was very hot and stuffy and the air conditioner could not cool it off The windows did not open We requested an extra fan and it helped a bit but basically we were extremely hot with no fresh air , The staff were wonderful and the room was attractive and convenient 
18572,The Nadler Soho, TV sound was very poor , Staff exceptionally helpful and friendly Room excellent Walk in shower heavenly And the croissants brought to the room in the morning what a great idea Wonderful find in Soho 
18573,The Nadler Soho, Room didn t have movie options on television Bring your own HDMI cable Space is snug No restaurant or bar on site Pillows not very comfortable or plush , Very well appointed modern hotel Clean Comes with a kitchenette dishes teapot coffee machine microwave and fridge Brita water from the sink 
18574,The Nadler Soho, We asked for a quiet room and were placed on ground level with windows out onto busy pedestrian thoroughfare so not quite , Very attentive and helpful staff 
18575,The Nadler Soho, Tea bags were not filled up for the next day sheets were not changed for the second night there was nothing in the mini bar I guess this is the policy It didnt disturb us too much in any case , Bed is comfy great Location and despite being in the middle of Soho it was quiet the amazing Steak Restaurant Zelman Meats is right around the Corner 
18576,The Nadler Soho, Only thing we missed was better blinders on the windows so that it wasn t so bright in the morning , Location is Prime Own coffe machine in the room 
18577,The Nadler Soho, Even on the discount rate and for London I think it was v poor value for money The tiniest of rooms for the money It was smaller than a Hong Kong room I wouldn t recommend for business , Good location and looked stylish 
18578,The Nadler Soho, The room was pretty small However we are talking central London here and the price was very reasonable so it s to be expected , The room had everything I wanted It was clean well decorated had a mini kitchen with all the supplies you might want a nice shower clean bathroom The bed was comfy the room was quiet it had all the tech you would expect The staff were nice and helpful Overall I was very happy with this hotel 
18579,The Nadler Soho,No Negative, Very crispy and clean Nice high quality materials in the room Kitchenette was great and in general the room had everything I needed Great hair dryer super powerful Plush and big towels 
18580,The Nadler Soho, They need better lighting in the rooms The rooms andbeds were lovely and comfortably appointed and had all we could want and more The rooms were esthetically well designed However the decorative lamps gave off NO light and we could barely see into our suitcases so they should fix this issue, The staff at Nadler were there for our every need They were charming and gracious Glad we stayed here over other properties Going to miss Matteo and Francesco and having cappuccino delivered to our door every morning 
18581,The Nadler Soho,No Negative, I was in London for a 3 days business trip with colleagues The location is one of the best in the city and both the rooms and the lobby is very clean nice and comfortable The hotel staff is exstremely helpful and service minded and helped us in all ways before during and after our stay to make the experience perfect Highly reccommended will be back for sure 
18582,The Nadler Soho, Some noise from the plumbing, Excellent location the rooms was small but very comfortable Design is clean warm and inviting The staff is very courteous smiling and nice
18583,The Nadler Soho,No Negative, Was worried when I saw it was next to the Tottenham Court construction site but my room was 100 silent Room felt spacious and well laid out Furnishings modern and chic but not cold 
18584,The Nadler Soho, The room was a little hot in the night we only realised where the thermostat was in the morning so maybe the staff should point it out to guests when they arrive There were 3 of us staying in a twin room with an added bed and they obviously knew this but hadn t provided an extra robe or provisions for the tea coffee facilities so we had to ask it s a minor detail but it could have been avoided , Superb location Lots of shopping eating entertainment on the door step The little kitchenette was great Staff were very friendly 
18585,The Nadler Soho, My fridge didn t work but since I wasn t actually needing it I didn t inform the staff I m sure had I complained about it it would have been fixed instantly , The location was perfect for me since most of my London plans were already located in and around Soho The food places around the Nadler Soho are wonderful and offer a huge variety Mostly the staff was extremely helpful whenever I had any questions I was offered the option to upgrade my room upon arrival and I was more than happy to accept that offer The mini kitchen is very useful and though the room was quite small the arrangement of everything made for a perfect use of space The bed was very comfortable and made for very good rest 
18586,The Nadler Soho, Home produced breakfast would ve been good rather than sourced from a local cafe Nothing else to complain about except the fact that I m telling everyone about it shhh it s our little secret , Great location for theatreland Really helpful and welcoming staff Cosy and discretely located hotel Just what we needed and very convenient for the West End 
18587,The Nadler Soho,No Negative, Great location splendid hotel lobby and greatly decorated rooms Amazing in room breakfast and best of all wonderful friendly staff We ll be back for sure 
18588,The Nadler Soho, Better lighting in the room it was a bit dark , The bed was incredible the upgrade was lovely and the birthday champagne and chocolates were a fabulous surprise 
18589,The Nadler Soho, Booked a classic double room but it turned out to be extremely small As soon as you open the door you hit the bed literally no space to move Staff was also quite rude, The place is in very good location
18590,The Nadler Soho, Nothing the stay was amazing , The hotel had amazing service and the rooms were superb as always The location was ideal for visiting Soho Leicester Square and Oxford Street Great area for young professionals 
18591,The Nadler Soho, Air con pre sets itself to tropical so unless you remember to change it when you come in it gets very hot The wet room makes a mess everywhere just a personal thing though , The room was a greats size staff were very friendly and nothing seemed too much trouble The hotel is perfectly located and it made me fall in love with Soho all the more 
18592,The Nadler Soho, Other guests waking us up at night being sick in the corridor Probably an isolated incident , Ease of check in Great location Very helpful staff Nice room 
18593,The Nadler Soho, Only real negative was an issue with the blinds not shutting We mentioned it to the staff the next morning and they said they would have helped if we had mentioned it on the night however it was late at night and we just wanted to sleep Apart from that it was everything we expected and more , We came here for Valentines weekend and overall the hotel was very impressive The location was ideal with several restaurants and theaters close by It s right next to Oxford Street and it s just a short car journey from London Euston London Marylebone The staff offered to call a taxi for us from the hotel to the train station and were very polite The hotel was very well presented particularly the bathroom Very good value for money considering the location 
18594,The Nadler Soho, Room was small my partner was not keen on the bed being against the wall Harder to climb out fuse the bathroom for older people , The room was very clean and decor contemporary
18595,The Nadler Soho, Would have been nice to have complimentary soft drinks for the non coffee tea drinkers , Everything this hotel offers is perfect For a single nights stay to several nights your needs are catered for Perfect location for exploring London within reasonable walking distance of Covent Garden West End Oxford Street London Eye and Houses of Parliament China Town Great restaurants shops and bakery s nearby Hotel is very secure as you need your room card to access the corridors leading to your room and also to operate the lift 
18596,The Nadler Soho, The rooms could be larger and the price more acessible for us with weaker currencies but the personal and friendly service the unique location and the high level of comfort have more than compensated room size and price , We have loved the exceptional very personal client service rendered by the crew Miguel Jessica and Naomi have by far exceded our expectation on professionalism and kindness They were always smiling and looking really interested on coping with our needs and desires a restaurant recommendation a tea a late check out everything 
18597,The Nadler Soho, Very hard to find fault but although I was a repeat guest we didn t get the personal welcome touches note choccies small token for child that others had enjoyed Very minor point but small touches like this can make a difference , The location is great right in the thick of it really convenient with lots of dining options a few steps away but it s still remarkably peaceful when you re in your room The staff are exceptional and go out of their way to make you feel welcome and help you make the most of your stay Immaculately clean rooms well designed great little kitchenette Reliable free wifi take note 5 hotels of London which charge way more than The Nadler and still try to fleece guests by charging for wifi 
18598,The Nadler Soho, We booked a small room so it was no surprise that in this very central hotel the room really was compact , The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was clean and modern The bed was very comfy with really nice quality linen and it was a nice touch to have a Nespresso machine in the room in the mini kitchenette Its location was brilliant nestled in a quiet street in the middle of soho We d definitely stay again 
18599,The Nadler Soho, No place to have breakfast in house apart from your room but many great bakeries around the corner so ok , The service The bed the location Will be back again 
18600,The Nadler Soho, Standard rooms are a bit on the small sids, Amazing location wonderful friendly staff modern and very clean rooms and the kitchenette is a great bonus 
18601,The Nadler Soho, Would have loved room service or a bar In fairness there are a million restaurants nearby and the front desk picked up and delivered a last minute breakfast for me in about 10 minutes time , Room was super comfy Location was great in the middle of all of the Soho action Staff were helpful in every way Coffee and filtered drinking water in the room was really nice Shower was wonderful 
18602,The Nadler Soho, Smaller room but it was ok as I traveled for business , The hotel is very well looked after friendly stuff and super nice and clean Beds are important for me and the quality of bed in the Nadler was perfect 
18603,The Nadler Soho, I did not like the extemely high charge for baguettes and croissants which are bought in if you opt for breakfast, I loved the style and ambiance of the hotel
18604,The Nadler Soho, Nothing really Only a hot iron in the room but steam ones are available if you ring reception I just didn t realise until too late , Excellent location in heart of Soho Rooms were very clean and cosy Little kitchenette was a nice touch Bathroom and shower very nice Very quiet in the rooms too Slept like a log 
18605,The Nadler Soho,No Negative, Great Location Fantastic Staff especially Matteo Francesco and Miguel who exerted every effort to be helpful and make us feel welcome Excellent hospitality for a truly memorable stay Will definitely return soon 
18606,The Nadler Soho, fire doors are a bit of pain to keep haveing to press a button or swipe a card but this is obviusly a saftey thing brought on by the local officials not the hotel , Beautiful Staff from all over the world Great little ish hotel rooms look small and was the smallest room we stayed in for our whole trip yet it was spacious enough to do what we needed and the area is full of bars comedy clubs and right near all the playhouses so you wont spend much time in there anyway Very clean and comfortable I stayed in a small double and as mentioned it is fine to stay in you do have to climb over your partner to get out of bed if you are against the window but all in all that is not such a bad thing 
18607,The Nadler Soho, windows that don t open are not very nice it was like a travel lodge mentality to the windows and what would happen in a fire doesn t instil confidence its just wrong for the type of hotel you are aspiring to be none of the competition in the soho area would have windows that don t open it was prison like at times imho , almost everything
18608,The Nadler Soho,No Negative, The staff were excellent very helpful and friendly also the location was spot on right near Oxford street and spoilt for choice for restaurants The room was very clean and tidy also liked the little kitchen
18609,The Nadler Soho, Didn t like that we had to say goodbye for now , Friendly and very helpful staff have not seen that level of helpfulness for a long long LONG TIME thank you to all of your staff for a great weekend and to think we just found you by accident

18618,The Nadler Soho, With no bar lounge or restaurant there s no heart to the place The staff are great Super lovely and helpful But it just feels like a one room tiny serviced apartment block Not a hotel As such it felt overpriced , Location is great for soho and good for Covent Garden

18630,The Nadler Soho,No Negative, Very friendly and courteous staff at the desk who were able to assist with all my enquiries I liked the flexibility of being able to use the kitchen facility in the room thereby cutting out the necessity for expensive room service often found in other hotels Fantastic central location with so many restaurants and cafes around for supper and breakfast too

18639,The Nadler Soho, Outside area of Hotel in Carlisle Street we found littered with rubbish and cigarette butts Could be kept cleaned even though it s not hotel rubbish but overflow from corner pub I didn t like that we had to pay 220 while one other person only paid 175 for one night stay st the same time His account mistakenly given to us on checkout , The very welcoming and helpful staff were quick and efficient The entry hallways lifts and rooms were odourless Very fresh and clean and well equipped rooms Location was fantastic Will be back
