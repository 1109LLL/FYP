54717,Ritz Paris, We had one odd moment when an attendant entered the room to check the minibar and did not refrain from coming into the room when asked even though my partner was in the process of getting dressed Created a bit of awkwardness while the attendant carefully inspected the minibar then left and re entered two minutes later without ringing Other than that strange bit everything was perfect , There is not much to stay about the Ritz It s the Ritz Everything was wonderful and our stay was filled with the best of everything Would love to stay here again And if you don t take a visit to the Hemingway Bar for a handful of cocktails when staying here you are missing out on a truly exceptional experience 
54718,Ritz Paris, View may not good Looking to your neighbor For this point they can t not be the No 1 in the world Of course you can pay double or triple Price for a view , Everying is perfect Beautiful hotel very nice receptionist showing the room and treat you like VIP The swimming is beautiful Nice mich down into the water 
54719,Ritz Paris,No Negative, Absolutely amazing hotel Friendly and extraordinarily kind and Afgank personnel special big thanks to Mr Dominic from guest relations who know everything about this special hotel My dream came truth because of those people who love their job and love Ritz hotel Everybody is a star in this hotel 
54720,Ritz Paris, Difficult to get a seat when you feel like going down for some coffee Too many walk ins hotel guests have to wait for walk ins from outside to leave before they get a seat Only when the staff at the restaurant overheard me one night saying to my wife that I don t want to sit in the corridor again did they realise we are hotel guests and made space for us Most peculiar , Everything Service staff superbly trained and discreet Room beautiful and well appointed 
54721,Ritz Paris, Can t find anything , The staff and the property will make you feel like a king Helping in any way they can with a smile and everything is up to perfection 
54722,Ritz Paris, Prices are exorbitant My husband found it all too scrapping he d prefer to ask for help when he needs it rather than have everyone offering to help They do mean it tho always at your service , It s the Ritz in Paris and looks feels and acts like the Ritz in Paris is supposed to behave The staff can t do enough to help you the food is fab and every once in a while they comp you the Bentley outside if it s not in use what s not to like the bathrooms kind of feel like you just walked into an arab potentate s boudoir but for me that was in a good way I kind of can t explain it but my usual yearning for modern sleek and simple vanished and I loved the whole thing so much that this was my second visit in 3 months 
54723,Ritz Paris, In most five star hotels I usually have at least one or two gripes but here there is nothing to say , Stayed to celebrate our first anniversary and it s without doubt the best hotel we ve experienced Everything was faultless and they upgraded our room free of charge The staff were all extremely helpful and friendly the place is immaculate and the views across Place Vend me are stunning Paris in style
