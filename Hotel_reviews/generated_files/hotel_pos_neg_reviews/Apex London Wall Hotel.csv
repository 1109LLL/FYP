233746,Apex London Wall Hotel, I can t think of anything I didn t like about this hotel , Our room was spacious and a comfortable place to relax in after a hard day sightseeing and visiting relatives The staff were exceptional charming helpful and efficient 
233747,Apex London Wall Hotel, It s a little thing but the housekeeping staff let the show down just a little as we found crumbs all over the floor when we moved a chair For a balcony room it was quite small , We had a balcony room that was a welcome relief as the night was quite warm so we opened the balcony doors Comfy bed huge shower Staff were incredibly attentive and friendly so eager to please 
233748,Apex London Wall Hotel, Lack of advice as to how breakfast was served Would rather have had a help yourself situation when choosing the continental style breakfast Being able to select what you want would mean that there was less wastage Ordering for cooked breakfast was fine as you knew exactly what you were ordering , Room was excellent and the staff were friendly especially one lady on reception but unfortunately I didn t get her name 
233749,Apex London Wall Hotel, Nothing, The quality and standard of food was high the presentation and service were excellent The rooms were air conditioned with large very comfortable beds High standard of room exceptionally clean and fresh 
233750,Apex London Wall Hotel, The speaker in the room was quite outdated and didn t fit my phone although an adaptor was provided when I asked but it didn t work V minor gripe though as everything else was lovely , Lovely hotel great staff It s not far from Moorgate tube station although I arrived early and wasn t expecting my room to be ready I was provided a glass of prosecco while I waited and didn t have to wait more than 10 minutes The bed was v comfy great little wet room and elemis toiletries provided We never heard anyone else so the walls must be pretty thick which meant a great nights sleep important after a day trekking round London 
233751,Apex London Wall Hotel, Could do with complimentary slippers The Premium rate room had it but our standard didn t The hotel restaurant was rather pricey but the food was really good though Maybe a bit more choice , All the staff were really helpful friendly always had a smile especially those at the check in desk We really enjoyed our stay in this hotel would definitely stay again as it s very close to Moorgate underground station We stayed over the weekend which meant it was really quiet as it s mostly offices around this area The downside is that shops cafes were mostly shut over the weekend However we did manage to get some that was opened Thank you Apex London Wall 
233752,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, Service was brilliant and the welcoming glass of prosecco on arrival set the tone of our stay The room was very spacious and comfortable and the en suite bathroom had a shower room and bath tub We will be back 
233753,Apex London Wall Hotel, Limited choice from a beer cider perspective at the bar Only one set of shower gel etc in the bathroom for a twin room Not enough milk for more than one cup of tea or coffee , Reception staff were very friendly as were the bar staff Welcome glass of bubbly very nice indeed Little extras like free water is always an added bonus Deep filled pillows which were nice to sleep on 
233754,Apex London Wall Hotel, We stayed here a couple of times already and both times we had room service stumbling into the room almost without knocking early in the morning regardless of the fact it was weekend and we were in bed sleeping Make sure you use the do not disturb sign if you don t want to find yourself trying to make the room service leave which surprisingly often does not work from the first attempt half naked , Good location although one should realize it s the City with all its advantages and drawbacks Completely dead during the weekend with almost no people and many places closed The rooms are clean new and contemporary 
233755,Apex London Wall Hotel, There was nothing to dislike at this hotel we had wanted to add an extra night however the price has rocketed for the Sunday night so we did not extend our stay Another reviewer had said that prices had increased recently which seemed to be the case , Despite arriving very early our room was ready There was some free treats and the room was all we needed The bath was lovely and big and very relaxing as our feet were tired after walking the streets of London We did not eat at the hotel it did have a bar and restaurant however we wanted to visit 20 Fenchurch Street which is nearby and has views from the 36 floor over the Thames and Shard so we had booked a table at this restaurant
233756,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, Nice and quiet location Staff very friendly Room very spacious and clean Lovely bathroom with seperate shower and bath High quality toiletries Nice touch the duck toy for kids and complementary sweeties Really nice big bed
233757,Apex London Wall Hotel, We were there on Friday night just looking for a nice place to get a beer Forget it The instant office hours ended the pubs and restaurants had customers spilling all the way out into the streets Being tired sore and very hungry this was a problem for us which we solved by buying groceries and making our own dinner , The breakfast was good but rather expensive 12 50 each for Continental After the first morning of our three day stay we simply purchased some bakery goods juice and fruit to make a simple breakfast in our room After getting some under cooked fish and chips with the skin left on the fish in a local pub we also bought some groceries and made ourselves simple sandwiches and salads in the evening for the remainder of our stay 
233758,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, Very helpful and courteous staff Room was very large and well presented Considering the proximity to a few pubs there was very little audible noise from the street 
233759,Apex London Wall Hotel, No complaints at all , We like that we can have a balcony as my husband smokes The hotel is close to where our family live as well as being very convenient for central London The staff are always friendly and helpful 
233760,Apex London Wall Hotel, the only down side to this hotel and it s not really a down side is the breakfast although the breakfast is very good you choose from a menu its not buffet which i would prefer but that s just my opinion , The rooms were good had a twin room as i was traveling with my son couldn t fault the staff or the room would stay here again 
233761,Apex London Wall Hotel, Some construction noise in the street outside but no fault of the hotel and work due to complete soon , Great city location for a nearby visit to the Barbican Very clean room lovely bathroom with walk in shower and good sized bathtub Bed extremely comfortable Very friendly and helpful staff Will definitely go back again 
233762,Apex London Wall Hotel, Coffee at breakfast pretty bland although on the second morning I asked for stronger and they made an americano rather than pot , An upgrade on arrival followed by a glass of prosseco in the afternoon 
233763,Apex London Wall Hotel, The TVs in the bar area , Everyone was really friendly and we were made to feel very welcome The room free upgrade was spacious and very comfortable The service in the restaurant at dinner and breakfast was very attentive 
233764,Apex London Wall Hotel, Curtains didn t quite meet the edge of the wall window sunlight streams directly onto bed head , Size of room great size of bed great proper big pillows and feather duvet Bathroom spacious area super quiet until building works started but we had been informed this would happen Staff very friendly I phoned Booking team prior to arrival super friendly lady in Edinburgh booking centre fulfilled both my requests to have a room on a higher story with a nice view and have us a balcony into the bargain at no extra charge thank you 
233765,Apex London Wall Hotel, Couldn t fault the hotel, After staying in several hotels in London this has been the best Lovely quiet location but close enough to everything with the tube station close by The hotel was spotless with very friendly staff We will definitely use this hotel again Thank you for a lovely stay The duck in the bathroom was a pleasant bonus My grandson will love it
233766,Apex London Wall Hotel, I like a cosy lounge to relax and read my papers Your bar area was very busy and noisy but I should have expected that given your central location This is only a personal comment There id nothing really to dislike , Excellent breakfast Service throughout from all staff was first class very comfortable beds and lovely robes I was attending a function in the city so in that respect it was the right choice
233767,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, We received a great welcome from the staff at this hotel which included a complimentary glass of Prosecco The hotel was well appointed comfortable and clean Highly recommended as a City of London hotel which is within a short walk of the Barbican 
233768,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly staff who went the extra mile to make sure everything was right Rooms very well appointed and spotlessly clean Great breakfast menu worth staying for 
233769,Apex London Wall Hotel, Very very minor problems It was a little pricey but it is central London and we did get a more deluxe room than we normally would And the staff were delightful so it didn t feel too expensive given what we got Views of the city from the 6th floor given its location were unsurprisingly just close ups of other tall city buildings but there was a nice balcony area as part of the room and it still feels quite cool to be high up on downtown London , Stayed here on the night of our wedding The hotel was really flexible with check in times we checked in at 1am and as an added extra they decorated our room with rose petals towel swans and love hearts And wrote us a really nice card from the staff And provided chocolates The room itself was great really big comfortable bed massive bathroom with a great shower and bath 
233770,Apex London Wall Hotel, We were in a room 301 and it s right beside the staff room for room cleanings This was quite noisy from early in the morning It s the only fault I had with our stay , Fabulous bathroom Comfy bed Such friendly staff 
233771,Apex London Wall Hotel, There was nothing about the hotel food or staff that could be improved , The staff were excellent Nothing was too much trouble Great location excellent value for money We plan to return soon 
233772,Apex London Wall Hotel, Mix up on checkin with the rate had to wait abit before being sorted but was sorted in the end so thanks, Deluxe room was brilliant Megan on reception was very helpful friendly and a credit to the team
233773,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, I arrived at the hotel 2 hours before check in time but the lady at the front desk let me check in anyways She was an absolute gem The hotel was very nice and clean and the staff were all kind and courteous The restaurant has pretty good food and the bar service was great The Peruvian bartender who I think has since moved on was great and extremely knowledgeable I loved my time at the Apex 
233774,Apex London Wall Hotel, That part of London is rather dead at the weekend shops cafes etc closed even on Saturday afternoon, Extremely helpful and friendly staff calling taxis organising late checkout looking after baggage all done efficiently and without fuss 
233775,Apex London Wall Hotel, Room service food was of acceptable quality but uninspired Generally the place feels more like a high volume tourist hotel than a quality business hotel kind of worn They have everything you really need but none of it is very impressive , If you need to be in the City good location Reasonable business standard For London the price performance was pretty good even if it was not especially fun to stay there 
233776,Apex London Wall Hotel, Nothing, Superb hotel with every facility upgraded room was amazing large and really comfortable Very high quality fittings quiet with really lovely staff Has to be one of the best available 
233777,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly and courteous staff with a lovely touch and special arrangements made for a birthday Ideal location and overall a top class hotel most definitely would stay again and added to the London experience Thank you 
233778,Apex London Wall Hotel, We had food in the hotel restaurant during our stay there were some very rowdy people in the bar shouting etc they were not spoken to by staff The food was overpriced , Beds were extremely comfortable Little Extras like pringles jelly beans were a nice addition Balcony nice 
233779,Apex London Wall Hotel, Couldn t open the windows in the room without calling reception so meant it was a bit stuffy and overheated in winter , Excellent location in Bank with plenty of transport links Easy to find from Moorgate or Bank tubes Large room in a quiet location especially loved the large bathroom with huge tub 
233780,Apex London Wall Hotel, I have stayed at the same Apex Wall hotel before but then the rate was more than double what I paid the last time This considerable variability of which I am not sure whether it is still the case makes it difficult to rely on the hotel as a preferred or default choice, Apex Wall is conveniently located in London City The rooms are new and comfortable Excellent choice for a business trip 
233781,Apex London Wall Hotel, There were a couple of odd stains on the carpet nothing that I would complain about but my companion thought of it as a bit of an issue No other complaints other than that , The shower was excellent like really it was probably one of the best I ve ever had Also many complimentary items which were super helpful Our check in was after 10pm and the receptionist at the time was super nice super helpful and had a great positive attitude which really helped the mood The location was superb also it s relatively quiet at the weekends so you sorta don t feel like you re actually in London until you board the Tube Would happily stay again 
233782,Apex London Wall Hotel, Because the Hotel is situated in the City area there is virtually nothing open over the weekend Nice for the peace and quiet in the evening but a problem if you want to eat outside the hotel , Upon arrival there was a delay with our room so we were given a complementary breakfast and drinks When having breakfast I needed to excuse myself and leave the table waiting staff then covered my food to keep it warm in my absence which was a nice little point 
233783,Apex London Wall Hotel, The breakfast was confusing they offer an all inclusive price but then charged us for each individual item Once we question it they redid the bill and the price dropped over 30 for 6 people , Lovely new hotel convenient to the Liverpool station Rooms and beds were very comfortable and the staff easily accommodated our request for 3 rooms close to each other 
233784,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is very well located for shopping and having a leisurely walk after dinner breakfast is excellent you won t leave hungry staff very nice 
233785,Apex London Wall Hotel, Nothing A great hotel , Really great location Near a number of tube stations Really comfortable room Extremely clean Enjoyed the free pringles and jelly beans Had a great sleep 
233786,Apex London Wall Hotel, Surrounding area was a little too quite nothing was open but it is a business area so would have been heaving in the week the quietness was appreciated Also there was good access to the underground , Can t fault anything about the hotel itself We had the best weekend Room was amazing service was great 
233787,Apex London Wall Hotel, Bed just a little to firm and the space taken up creatkng an in room office Which for me unnecessary, Smallish hotel offering good level of service and in a convenient location

233793,Apex London Wall Hotel, I couldn t understand the breakfast waiter who was eastern European Friendly and helpful though , Rooms are excellent as is the location But the breakfast is just the best Not forgetting the best receptionist EVER in Megan The lovely Irish girl So helpful 
233794,Apex London Wall Hotel, Maybe a tad too pricey but it is london and the overall service was very good , Wonderful location Great survive as we got a brunch delivered to our room and all the facilities are very modern and clean Great views from our balcony too 
233795,Apex London Wall Hotel, the two step process of paying for breakfast designed by a control freak who likes to annoy customers Also quoted price was subject to a spurious extra tax which was not mentioned when booked Pernicious , Shower bed safe wardrobes
233796,Apex London Wall Hotel, Nothing we could fault couldn t have asked for more , Reception staff amazing Went that extra mile Even noticed it was my birthday and left chocolates and card in the room On check out assisted with directions so much so came out of the hotel walked down the road to give clear directions when nearest tube station was closed at the last minute 
233797,Apex London Wall Hotel, The showerdoor didnt close completely But thats a small detail That actually doesn t matter I can t come up with anything else, We arrived in the hotel and they started singing happy birthday We got a free upgrade because it was my moms 60th bday Very beautiful room located in the city of london In the room was a Bose dock to connect your phone with for a high quality music sound Also you can rent blu rays for your room for free Metrostation moorgate and bank are very close Good breakfast for an english hotel One of the best hotels you can get in London Thank you very much 
233798,Apex London Wall Hotel, Cost of breakfast if it wasn t included in your booking , Room was spacious great shower staff very nice and Helpful food in restaurant very good 
233799,Apex London Wall Hotel, Being really picky here as all was great but a couple of coat hooks near the door would have been a bonus , The staff emailed me before our trip as I had said it was a special treat for my son They enquirer about his name and if it was a special celebration A real personal touch We received a treat for Sam my son and an upgraded room which made our trip really special Thank you so much xxx The surrounding area was really quiet at the weekend so no traffic noise or disturbance 
233800,Apex London Wall Hotel, Nothing, The reception staff were lovely especially the young Irish lass very pleasant and made you feel very welcome from the time we arrived she always had a smile on her face and seemed genuinely interested in what we were doing each day

233802,Apex London Wall Hotel, Can t think of anything at all , The service was warm and efficient but not fussy which is just how we like it The room was very well appointed reassuringly clean and comfortable We only dined at breakfast time but these meals were well prepared and delivered promptly 
233803,Apex London Wall Hotel, Nothing negative to say about this hotel , We had a fantastic time at this hotel Can t praise the staff at Apex London Wall enough Guests are made to feel genuinely welcome more like a family run boutique than a hotel chain Special praise has to go to Megan on reception and Carlos on bar They both went above and beyond and seemed to really enjoy their work My husband unbeknown to me had phoned the hotel prior to our arrival arranging for a bottle of wine to be put in our room as it was our wedding anniversary during our stay We were given a complementary upgrade and towels were made into the shape of swans on our bed with rose petals scattered on the bed and round the bath Looked amazing We ate in the restaurant on the first night food was delicious and the service once again was first class With it s close proximity to Bank Moorgate and Liverpool St stations I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London whether for business or leisure Loved every minute of our time at this beautiful friendly hotel We will be back 
233804,Apex London Wall Hotel, Dusty curtains on upper parts Few places to hang clothes towels and bathrobes in the bathroom , Great bathtub spacious entrance area in the room Spacious bathroom as well Friendly welcome with bubbles 
233805,Apex London Wall Hotel, Very hot in lift and corridors Excessively so Was only in the lift for a couple of minutes but was very uncomfortable with the heat I am being very picky though , Huge comfy bed Massive shower and separate bath Free jelly beans bottled water and Pringles We had a balcony overlooking the city which was really nice 
233806,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, it was my wife s birthday and the staff went all out to make it special many thanks to all those involved would definitely come back and breakfast is made to order excellent
233807,Apex London Wall Hotel, The wet room specifically the tiles were a little discoloured and the floor had some rather deep scuff marks but that s being extra picky And having stayed on a Sunday didn t realise this area had very little open we had to grab a tube to get some lunch but on Monday it was bustling with life and there was an abundance of amenities , The staff were absolutely wonderful and so polite and caring Our room was spacious and comfortable and had all of our needs covered The bed and bedding were lovely and comfortable the room was stylish and warm with the dark wooden floors and beautiful turquoise upholstery Wonderful stay 
233808,Apex London Wall Hotel, Breakfast and meals expensive Didn t like the fact that the 10 deduction applied to only one of the bookings we made we treated our son and his wife I d booked one room with Booking com before our son and wife decided to come and I rang the hotel to change the booking Apparently the deduction applied to only one of the rooms because of the Booking com booking I was not told this when I booked the second room I could have cancelled the booking com and booked the two rooms directly and got the 10 reduction , Excellent though pricey room with large balcony right at the top of the hotel Views of the Shard Very quiet location Bed very comfortable All amenities very good 
233809,Apex London Wall Hotel, The hotel is right next to a construction site which means blinds must be down at all times with no views on offer It is in the middle of the business district in London away from the exciting west end which means it does get quite quiet at night and on weekends , Very nice and spacious room especially the bathroom and the little duck 
233810,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, Great hotel if travelling from city airport into Bank station via DLR Quiet area especially at weekend but close to buzz around Shoreditch and all transport 
233811,Apex London Wall Hotel, Was given a lower standard of room than what was paid for until complaining and then received an upgrade Good job I had the booking details in my app to show the receptionist, Springy the duck is great
233812,Apex London Wall Hotel, Nothing we had a fabulous trip , The staff were very help friendly and polite The room was comfy and spacious and the bathroom was modern clean and in good condition 
233813,Apex London Wall Hotel, Places to eat a little sparce on Saturday evening , A quiet beautiful room to relax after a lovely day in the city Fabulous bathroom with great little extras to make it special 
233814,Apex London Wall Hotel, This is the 3rd time we have stayed at this hotel and we were extremely disappointed with the size of the room we were given more like a cupboard Only about 18 inches of room between the bed and the wall each side We did complain but we were told it was full Also at breakfast they tend to bring everything to the table at the same time For example we were eating our cereal and they brought the cooked breakfast which we sent back but instead of re doing the breakfast they kept it warm which meant the eggs went hard , Good location and lovely comfy bed Breakfast is more than adequate They also use high quality products in the bathroom 
233815,Apex London Wall Hotel, We arrived at the hotel at 16 30 but our room was not ready in spite of the information that it would be ready from 14 30 As we had a long journey behind us this was rather annoying , The staff were very friendly and helpful We left behind a jacket in the room and they helped us to get it back 
233816,Apex London Wall Hotel, Can t think of anything everything was OK , The hotel was in a quiet location but was within walking distance to Moorgate Station I shared a room with my Sister and it was very clean and tidy The beds were very comfortable Didn t have breakfast so can t comment on that The reception staff were very friendly Will definitely stay again

233818,Apex London Wall Hotel, Nothing, It was really nice to stay in a hotel that was perfect The staff were so helpful and pleasant and the room was brilliant cannot fault it will definitely use again 
233819,Apex London Wall Hotel, The milk that was provided was close to expiration and in my coffee I got some white flakey bits The hotel is a little out of the way as Bank is more business district so we had to travel far to find some breakfast as it wasn t included in the room However it wouldn t damper my interest to stay at this hotel again and I would definitely recommend , We absolutely loved the balcony and the big bath It s such a luxury to find a good bathroom in London hotels The staff were very friendly and helpful and the rooms were of really good size Room service was really good too 
233820,Apex London Wall Hotel, Nothing , The room was incredible So comfortable and spacious Safe to say I was heartbroken to say goodbye to it The location of the hotel is really interesting Busy during the week but very quiet at the weekend Really relaxing for a weekend stay

233822,Apex London Wall Hotel, Windows couldn t be opened without contacting reception My own flannel was removed from shower and Thrown away staff said it wasn t in the laundry and offered no other explanation , Glass of prossecco on arrival very helpful and charming staff
233823,Apex London Wall Hotel, Nothing really but some may see the distance to entertainment and tourist areas a disadvantage , Close to London City airport about 30 pounds taxi fare Quiet streets at weekend as in the City Excellent restaurant in the hotel which was good as not a lot of eateries on weekends near the hotel that are open Rooms are larger than the usual London hotels 
233824,Apex London Wall Hotel, I ordered quite a bit of room service And the food really wasn t very good Steak was overdone No sauce all I could do is choose ketchup with chips Which were oily I was disappointed to be honest For the price I expected better quality Also The room was not very bright the lighting was very dim At night while I was trying to do paper work The room was not very bright , Great little touch s in the rooms complimentary goodies hit the sweet spot 
233825,Apex London Wall Hotel, It was perfect for us to be honest Could not fault it or the staff , The hotel location was perfect for Smithfields where we were attending an event The hotel was very quiet at the weekend 
233826,Apex London Wall Hotel, Breakfast is waiter service so factor this in if you want an early start , Very friendly helpful staff Got a free upgrade Rooms very well appointed and spotless 
233827,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, The staff were great from the time we arrived to checking out and nothing was too much trouble The location seems quiet but you are a short tube or cab ride away from all the major areas in London with liverpool st a short walk away I would reccomend getting a room with a Balcony
233828,Apex London Wall Hotel, Nothing at all , The hotel was everything I wanted Room was really comfortable with snacks at no additional cost was most surprised The staff were very pleasant and helpful I had a truly great stay and will certainly go back 
233829,Apex London Wall Hotel, Sound insulation is no good can hear the noise from the street There is no holder for the shampoo and shower gel etc inside the shower , Very clean tidy and modern Room is very large according to center London standard 
233830,Apex London Wall Hotel, Both times I have stayed the breakfast staff are very attentive to start with then completely ignore you for the rest of the meal This is a problem when my breakfast has been forgotten about and I don t have anything to eat It was very good when it finally arrived , Very comfortable rooms friendly staff excellent breakfast 
233831,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, Everyone was so lovely The staff offered us a complementary glass of prosecco which was very kind of them The beds oh my the most comfy bed I have ever slept in no exaggeration Lovely place to stay 
233832,Apex London Wall Hotel, It was quite unclear how to call the reception from the room Some amnesties were missing hairdryer room service , Amazing service Really nice staff The facilities were good and the hotel was very conveniently located 
233833,Apex London Wall Hotel, Would have been nice to have fresh milk and access to space in the fridge for own items , Great location with easy access to underground Very quiet over the weekend which was a bonus when returning back for a restful night 
233834,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, Staff were very friendly at desk also in the bar Couldn t fault the room it was gorgeous spotless clean the bed was to die for Highly recommend this hotel 
233835,Apex London Wall Hotel, There is construction going on just outside it does not make too much noise but there is no point to pay for the room with the city view Functionality of the Do not disturb knob is confusing i got left without room cleaning because of that , fabulous room by London standards good a la carte breakfast location is good if you are a banker of some sort coming on business a lot of City s famous banks are one step away
233836,Apex London Wall Hotel, Forgot our morning paper on Saturday and no supplements when we chased the paper , Out of town on the weekend very relaxed with easy access to the attractions by tube bus 
233837,Apex London Wall Hotel, Nothing, So good the staff were excellent with smooth check in by the young lady on reception who was brilliant ensuring we had everything we required as well as providing us with any information she thought we may need A couple of things not working in the room but dealt with promptly and wasn t a problem at all Room was great clean and very comfy with a huge bed and beautiful bathroom We did eat at the restaurant as we had a Taste Card which gives 50 off and the waitress was superb very attentive and friendly and is a credit to the hotel As we are vegans we asked what she would recommend and herself and the Chef were very accommodating cooking food not on the menu so everything was meat and dairy free Pretty unusal for a hotel restaurant from our experience The meal was very nice well cooked and tasty Probably now my hotel of choice in London Well done Apex London Wall 
233838,Apex London Wall Hotel, Room 401 was right at the end of the corridor next to a staff only door The staff door kept banging we could hear them clanking around throughout the night Don t like how they take 30 out your bank account when checking in just incase you use the mini bar This money will take 3 5 days to go back in to the account They should only charge if you ve used anything when checking out I think , We got greeted with Prosecco which was a lovely touch Staff were so friendly and welcoming We got upgraded to a superior room too and it was gorgeous Free jelly beans Pringles tea and coffee 
233839,Apex London Wall Hotel, This is not specific to this hotel but to hotels in UK breakfast is not automatically included into the price You can only order breakfast from menu , It is nice to have the followings in the room for free water tea coffee snacks Ironing machine is available Staff is polite and helpful 
233840,Apex London Wall Hotel, The hotel was well located for a function I attended at the Guildhall but was not well located for much else , Decent room at a fair price Breakfast was good but sitting areas in the public spaces not so good 
233841,Apex London Wall Hotel, Nothing, The Hotel is situated close to Moorgate Tube Station so it never seems like your far from the hotel The staff were exceptional Check in and check out were smooth and every member off staff we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful 
233842,Apex London Wall Hotel, The restaurant which is the same room service menu is lacking in choice and definitely not value for money Eat at any other restaurant and there are a lot around the area , The staff were very helpful and friendly the room was large and comfortable and the gym has great equipment The complimentary toiletries were really good quality products 
233843,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, Loved the complimentary glass of prosecco on arrival and the staff couldn t do enough to help Excellent service There was a fire at the hotel at 4am and we were outside until 6am but the staff were so helpful handing out water foil blankets slippers and coffee They really did try hard to look after us in the circumstances and offered some money back All in all an excellent stay and my room was fantastic and lovely and quiet for London 
233844,Apex London Wall Hotel, Only downside was standing out in the cold for an hour for the fire evacuation We understand that it wasn t the hotels fault , Extremely clean really enjoyed our stay 
233845,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, This hotel is beautifully done with modern and clean bedrooms The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom felt very luxurious with the Elemis products and separate shower and bath Complimentary glass of Prosecco on arrival was a welcome surprise 
233846,Apex London Wall Hotel, Shame about the view , As always Apex are so happy to help and make your stay as enjoyable as they can The staff are excellent and rooms are lovely and comfortable 
233847,Apex London Wall Hotel, When checking out it was with a relatively inexperienced member of staff who had to get help And he promised to email me the receipt because we were in a hurry Still hasn t arrived , We were there over the Easter weekend and the staff left a gift of chocolates and a card wishing us Happy Easter which I thought was lovely Couldn t fault the staff for friendliness and helpfulness 
233848,Apex London Wall Hotel, Getting woken up at 11pm by the room phone ringing to be told by the front desk that the guest who stayed in our room previously thought she had left her coat behind and would we let her come up and look in the room for it We said no because we were in bed and my partner then had to speak to the guest on the phone and proceed to look in every cupboard for the coat which was definitely not there Not once were we told sorry for disturbing you When paying a premium for a central London hotel room I expected at the very least some privacy for the evening and a good nights sleep , The fantastic welcome we got a complimentary glass of prosecco free upgrade to a more spacious room a big bath wonderful Elemis toiletries delicious continental breakfast with the most helpful staff great location 
233849,Apex London Wall Hotel, The location of the hotel is in the business district so it was a bit quiet could also be a positive But it s super close to Moorgate and Bank tube stations and there s always an Uber around anyway Didn t affect us much , Prosecco on arrival was a nice touch and the fact that they upgraded our room and left a note and chocolates for my boyfriend as it was trip away for his birthday The bed was more than comfy and the facilities were clean and had everything you could need The staff were also very friendly and accommodating 
233850,Apex London Wall Hotel, Considering how quiet the hotel was and that the location was not central the cost of the room felt a little excessive , Room was lovely free upgrade was fab and food was excellent Staff were friendly and helpful and location was great 
233851,Apex London Wall Hotel, Could see the builders working in the building next to us but we just had to draw the curtains Not too big of a deal , The staff were really lovely and extremely helpfull Great location and nice and quiet on the weekend 
233852,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, I liked all the extra touches that make your stay that more memorable like the glass of bubbly on arrival the quality Elemis products in the bathroom the fantastic robes the complementary water jelly beans and biscuits plus a cute rubber duck This is a really good hotel in a great location with friendly staff lovely clean room with nice furnishings and great bar 
233853,Apex London Wall Hotel, Couldn t fault anything, The location was perfect for Drapers Hall we asked for quiet rooms and they certainly were the beds were very comfortable and modern facilities the staff were excellent friendly and helpful I would certainly stay again if I needed to be that end of the city
233854,Apex London Wall Hotel, Having travelled to other apex hotels we found the breakfast to be extremely expensive previously we have paid a set price which included ALL continental breakfast items and then we paid a small extra charge to have a cooked breakfast we were most disappointed to find that even though we ordered a cooked breakfast that in fact nothing else not even drinks were included I would have thought that all Apex Hotels should be the same, We were given a free upgrade which was lovely 
233855,Apex London Wall Hotel, A daily check of facilities would have discovered that the plug on the iron was dangerously loose with wiring visible Just needed tightening , Being upgraded At superior room level then the standard rate would be reasonable 
233856,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, Beautiful spacious room very clean great bathroom Great location Nice and quiet at the weekend but walking distance to many tube stations Excellent staff from reception right through to departure friendly and above all PROFESSIONAL Top marks to all Great choice for a weekend in London 
233857,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, Quality of food Beautiful spacious room Personalised card upon arrival Birthday package Wide range of toiletries available excellent quality
233858,Apex London Wall Hotel, Nothing to report , Exactly as advertised Very satisfied Only thing that stopped a full 10 was we would have liked breakfast even a continental breakfast to be included in the price 
233859,Apex London Wall Hotel, Maybe some spa facilities would be nice I like to have a dip in a jacuzzi and a massage when I stay in a nice hotel Otherwise it was great and there was nothing we didn t like , Bed super comfy Toiletries great Clean modern and stylish Love the free duck Great location Nice and quiet at the weekend but walking distance to good places Spitalfields Market Museum of London and we had a short taxi journey to Brick Lane in the evening We were upgraded which was a nice bonus Breakfast was delicious we had it in bed as an extra treat to ourselves Being able to borrow DVDs for free is a really good touch We would definitely stay again 
233860,Apex London Wall Hotel, Nothing, A great served breakfast relaxed not a buffet having to fight for the last sausage friendly staff nice little gym never busy good location comy bed huge bathroom bigger than our bedroom at home 
233861,Apex London Wall Hotel, Funny smell coming from vent maybe , The bath tub was nice staff were very nice we got champagne on arrival The room was covered in rose petals the bed had a 3D heart made out of towels Amazing
233862,Apex London Wall Hotel, Nothing , Staff s attention to detail from stepping through the door was exemplary Complimentary glass of prosecco was a nice touch too The bedroom was a good size very clean and extremely comfortable So glad we found this hotel we ll be back 
233863,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, On the weekend the location is quite but many sights and attractions are easily accessible due to proximity of Moorgate Bank and Liverpool Street underground stations 
233864,Apex London Wall Hotel, If I was being fussy I d like better coffee in the room , Genuinely helpful and friendly staff An early check in that was done without any fuss being made Fantastic breakfast Reasonable price for London 
233865,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, Excellent hotel modern and clean and conveniently located near public transport Went there at weekends when the area is very calm Reaching central London took 20 min by public transport 
233866,Apex London Wall Hotel, Only that I couldn t stay longer , Me and my girlfriend celebrated Valentines day here and boy did they take the extra mile Not only did they offer champagne but also provided rose petals and swan shaped towels with a handwritten letter and business card from the hotel manager welcoming us Staff were so welcoming and fun location is amazing as well as facilities Could not recommend this place more to stay 
233867,Apex London Wall Hotel, Nothing All perfect , The staff were incredible My husband took me to Ldn for night out for my 40th no kids The hotel upgraded us to a supreme room and made a lovely weekend an amazing wonderful weekend 
233868,Apex London Wall Hotel, Nothing at all was all lovely, We got upgraded because it was my partners birthday I thought was lovely The suite was fantastic the staff were lovely friendly and brilliant
233869,Apex London Wall Hotel, Room did overlook office block but with staying at a weekend nobody could see in Blinds are up to use if this was an issue , Attentive staff from checking in to checking out very clean throughout the hotel Facilities excellent and close location to underground station Moorgate circle line 
233870,Apex London Wall Hotel, Being in the City all the local coffee bars were closed the entire weekend Not much ambience in the bar restaurant area Rather functional As we were only there for one night this didn t really matter but had it been nicer we would have had a couple of drinks in the bar , The location with regard to the places we were visiting was excellent Walking distance from Spitalfields and the Barbican short bus ride from round the corner to National Gallery and Covent Garden Very close to Moorgate and Liverpool Street Tube stations Fabulous bathroom 
233871,Apex London Wall Hotel, Charged twice for a two night stay payment taken on arrival and another amended about on checkout When payment taken an additional charge was added without being told for services you may use throughout your stay instead of having a room tab you settle at the end of your stay The lack of information by the check in staff was poor I was dissatisfied with the customer service provided , Good location easy access to the whole of London Rooms clean well presented
233872,Apex London Wall Hotel, Sound proofing is poor Noise from outside the room and nearby restaurants can be heard from Level 5 , Close to underground station Plenty of caf around 
233873,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, Trendy spot in the middle of London City yet not as pricy as some destinations around Certain recommendation for business travellers A la carte breakfast was inclusive and full enough 
233874,Apex London Wall Hotel, More menu choice needs to change more regularly or have specials when you stay here often and use the restaurant , Good location for office Attentive and welcoming staff
233875,Apex London Wall Hotel, the hotel is located in a working district which is very quiet in the weekend all bars and shops in the street are closed , nice room big bathroom clean nice restaurant very helpfull and kind staff
233876,Apex London Wall Hotel, I had to ask twice to request our double room be configurated to a twin as booked and had to ask 3 times for extra pillows In the end we did this ourselves Single beds were tiny when made to twin room layout much smaller than say Hilton or Marriott that we normally stay in when visiting London Breakfast on Sunday was chaotic with a long wait stressed front of house staff and other guests arriving after us served before us Less then we would expect from a Hotel of this standing, Good location for Barbican centre although the area surrounding the hotel was very quiet Hotel well presented and most of staff helpful Granted an extra hour on Sunday to check out which was helpful 
233877,Apex London Wall Hotel, Not related to the hotel but to area between Christmas and new year the many restaurants in the neighborhood were all closed Breakfast outrageously priced ca 37 euros , Nice rooms modern good size in particular for London Close to three tube stations quiet 
233878,Apex London Wall Hotel, Nothing , This is not my first stay with Apex but it is my first stay at London Wall I am most definitely impressed The staff were friendly and always willing to help nothing was too much trouble for them The room was absolutely spotless with the most comfortable bed I ve every slept on and the location is great So quiet at the weekends

233881,Apex London Wall Hotel, There wasn t a great view from my room but this is not a priority for me , Location was perfect for my theatre date at the Barbican a 10 minute easy walk City of London is a fascinating place to visit and has St Pauls Monument Museum of London and more within easy reach Shops and eateries all very close by as were tube and bus stops Super 4 hotel Staff were really helpful and polite No traffic noise Comfy bed and very clean throughout Have rebooked for my next visit to London in June 
233882,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, Really modern and well equipped rooms with amazingly comfortable beds and pillows We had booked 2 rooms for a night out to celebrate my daughter s 21st birthday and they really made it special for her with an upgrade to a suite and prosecco and rose petals on her bed 
233883,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, It was our honeymoon and they left rose petals and chocolates for us to enjoy So very nice We also had a complimentary glass of champagne when we entered The bed was amazing Perfectly soft and supportive and large We were beginning to forget what a real king size bed felt like 
233884,Apex London Wall Hotel, It was a little pricey on the year end And for the hotel being in the banking area there are not many places open around the hotel during the prolonged holidays while on weekdays there were lots of cute pubs and cafes , The location was good easy to walk to tube stops Moorgate or Bank St Paul s cathedral The room is small compared to hotels in the US but the bed was large and long for tall people had nice amenities and was easy to get by The bathroom was very nice with a separate shower and a bathtub The staff was friendly 
233885,Apex London Wall Hotel, The hotel is used by city gents thru the week these gents go home for the weekend the hotel then reduces its rates for the weekend which then allows us mere mortals to enjoy a little luxury at a knock down price this is a good thing obviously except most of the shops cafes and pubs around the hotel have shut up shop on Friday evening and won t be back till Monday morning leaving you with not much more than a macky d s and an m s open in the immediate local , Friendly and helpful staff room was clean and well equipped with mini bar chargeable safe ironing board and iron huge and comfy bed northern line tube just around the corner 
233886,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, Short walk to three different tube stations Bus routes nearby On a quiet street so could have window open at night with little noise Well appointed and spacious room Pleasant and helpful staff

233891,Apex London Wall Hotel, No view even I was on the 4th floor I was upgraded to a suit but the way the suit is designed I really did not use the other room The bathroom is had no space for toiletry bags next to the sink , The staff were great and friendly The room is nice and specious Clean and nice bathroom I was upgraded to a suit which was very nice from them Location to my office is great 
233892,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, Very convenient location for the city and nice contemporary luxurious rooms We had breakfast delivered to our room which was lovely but there is a very trendy cafe style restaurant just off the reception area which is also very nice 
233893,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, Everything good but remember to set do not disturb before you go to bed otherwise you get an early rude awakening by the housekeepers at 8 30 am Not good when you have had a heavy night 
233894,Apex London Wall Hotel, Although it was a large room with a desk and desk light there was nowhere to sit and watch tv except sitting at the desk or lying on the bed Surely most people at home in the evening are able to sit and watch tv from a comfortable armchair and I would like the same in a hotel , I have a lovely room with a bath AND a walk in shower
233895,Apex London Wall Hotel,No Negative, The staff were smartly turned out and extremely helpful The room was superb with an enormous well equipped en suite a massive comfy bed and quality fittings It s very close to Moorgate underground station and being off the main road quiet for London The food was also of a high quality

233901,Apex London Wall Hotel, I didn t know if Id have time for a breakfast on each of the 3 mornings I stayed at the hotel I was informed at check in that Id have to say there and then if I wanted a breakfast for each of the mornings I couldn t just drop down on day 2 for a breakfast and have that charged to my room As it happened I didn t have time for a breakfast on any of the mornings anyway so it didn t matter but I just felt it was a little less accommodating that I have experienced elsewhere However this didn t take from my stay and I would stay again if traveling to London , The location of the Hotel is very good The staff are very friendly and the rooms are lovely and comfortable

233907,Apex London Wall Hotel, An obviously finished with cup of tea left in the room as well as half drank glasses of water Seriously didn t expect to come back to the room and find that NOISY Bars below are obviously busy Could not stay in the room on Friday night so ended up going out and coming back real late when the noise had died down Pricey for what it was , Good geographical location Free pringles jelly beans were a definite hit Ironing board and iron in every room is a bonus Shower and bath are separate ideal Rubbber duck was a nice touch 
233908,Apex London Wall Hotel, Location is on a quiet area and a bit off the beaten path For example we had trouble finding things open at night I always stay in Mayfair and would have done so again but this was a good value especially during the Rugby World Cup , Room was large by European standards as well as clean and fresh Staff friendly and helpful Bar and restaurant were great 
233909,Apex London Wall Hotel, The room was very small only 2 feet gap between the side of the bed and the wall Breakfast was a disappointment but the hotel is aware of why , Very modern with good facilities within the room
233910,Apex London Wall Hotel, Everything was perfect apart from one thing which was a bit disappointing I had booked the hotel and couple months in advanced for my boyfriends birthday and had paid extra for petals and a vanilla birthday cake in the room I was asked a check in time so the cake would be fresh and they were very accommodating to be make it special However when we arrived at the time requested there was neither the cake or petals in the room so the surprise was ruined I explained to reception and they said I should of been specific with the time They then apologised and refunded the petals and brought the cake straight away which was chocolate which my boyfriend isn t a great fan of but was still nice that they brought it so fast Overall we had a lovely stay but this did let it down for me a bit as I had planned it for a surprise but my boyfriend still had a lovely birthday which is what mattered , The room was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable We was greeted with a complimentary glass of prosecco on arrival which was lovely Staff were very friendly
