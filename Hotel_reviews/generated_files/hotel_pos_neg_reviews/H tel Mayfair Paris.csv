137766,H tel Mayfair Paris, Air conditioning in my daughter and grandchildren s room not working It was 95 degrees Asked several times to have it fixed Didnt happen Continental breakfast pricey , My room was spacious and beautifully appointed Wine and fruit basket upon arrival Lovely bathroom Staff very friendly and helpful 
137767,H tel Mayfair Paris, Since it was my third time staying here I was surprised that I was initially placed in a tiny room facing a wall with no space I had expected to have a similar room from previous times which has a balcony and faces the street I requested to be moved to the room that I was familiar with which they did Definitely the first room was not worthy the charges and or did not meet the 4 stars standards Just FYI , I like the location since it is so close to the Louvre Gardens Plus the staff is friendly and the hotel has a nice victorian style decour 
137768,H tel Mayfair Paris, There are no tea coffee making facilities in the room which was surprising It is a little dated but has a certain charm to it I would suggest re grouting the bathrooms The hairdryer was woeful gives you about 30 second bursts Unfortunately one of the towels was very stained We didn t have the breakfast but from what I could see it was in a dark room and quite costly There are lots of little cafes in the area serving breakfasts use those instead , The staff were extremely friendly on check in and even offered us a room upgrade which was a welcome surprise The location is brilliant for tourists and it s very easy to wander to the Louvre Hotel de Ville Champs Elysee etc Rooms were very quiet with dark curtains We had a little Juliet balcony so could open doors 
137769,H tel Mayfair Paris, Noticed a 65 euro charge on bill upon checkout Don t recall taking anything other than bottled water Seems excessive , Front desk staff were affable gracious helpful Breakfast selection was adequate 
137770,H tel Mayfair Paris,No Negative, Staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the room was quite clean The location just on the Tuileries is perfect with excellent shopping restaurants and landmarks nearby 
137771,H tel Mayfair Paris, The room was not cleaned properly One night I came back and saw 2 dirty clothes left by the cleaner on top of the desk It s sub standard for a so called 4 star hotel , The location is great just steps away from the Jardin de Tuileries and high end shopping streets 
137772,H tel Mayfair Paris, Bed in shockingly worn state bath tub chipped in many places air con non existent room heavily outdated Bar not accessible out of hours not even via reception surely this is just not good enough , The staff helpfulness

137775,H tel Mayfair Paris, The breakfast was disappointing with extra having to be paid for eggs etc Very little was provided as part of the basic cost, We were really lucky to be upgraded to a lovely suite which made our stay memorable The hotel was well situated close to areas of interest and good restaurants The staff were helpful in providing information about restaurants and how to get to places we wanted to see

137777,H tel Mayfair Paris, The bar was empty during the evening and food could only be served to my room if I was there for leisure I don t think I would like this Its nice to sit in a lively bar or restaurant The evening reception staff did not know much about the food when I asked about one or two dishes and suggested I went to the restaurant down the road because this is where the food comes from anyway I was really glad I did go to the restaurant rather than eating in my room however it would be nice if staff could be more knowledgeable on the menu , I was upgraded to a bigger room on the ground floor which was very quiet I was working late and up very early for a busy work day so this was important which they acknowledged from the notes on my booking Staff were very friendly and helpful even after I had checked out but returned a few hours later to store my bags and charge my phone for a few hours before my train home Stunning location Restaurant where hotel food comes from was delicious
