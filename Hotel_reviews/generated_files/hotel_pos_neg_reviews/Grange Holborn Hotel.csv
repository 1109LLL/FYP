455605,Grange Holborn Hotel, There was not anything I didn t like about the Hotel, Excellent location within London Public Transport such the Tube and Buses easily accessible Hotel entrance and Lobby pleasing to the eye Staff on hand friendly and very helpful Lifts to all floors Room and bathroom very comfortable and exceptionally clean Pleasant decor throughout the Hotel Spa facilities very good 
455606,Grange Holborn Hotel,No Negative, Great location to meet up with friends and the bedroom and bed very comfy but it was a bit dark as I was on the level where there is a roof and in the corner but as I spent little time in the room it was not a real problem
455607,Grange Holborn Hotel, Bathroom was small The room wasn t big enough for my son s wheelchair We were initially sent to a room with a king size bed despite booking a twin room , Beds were very comfortable Despite being on a busy junction the room was very quiet 
455608,Grange Holborn Hotel, For a 20 breakfast I felt the sausages could have been better quality higher meat content The table layout was a little cramped, The spa facilities were lovely Good range of teas in the bedroom important 
455609,Grange Holborn Hotel, Sadly 2 male guests offensive in behaviour and communication Approaching female groups and trying to enter conversations with crude and over familiar chat My mother daughter and I had wanted to have a quiet post theatre drink before bed in lounge area This incident spoilt what had been a lovely day and evening We were thankful to a gentleman named Ashley to his friends Ash says he is regular guest due to his work He had noticed how these men were behaving and thanks to his sitting and chatting with us the other men became bored by our ignoring them and moved away to another group of females Not a hotel specific issue but did mar an otherwise great stay Not sure if anything could have been done but might be worth noting for lone females to be aware Only other point was roof top bar had closed by time we returned from theatre and this was slight disappointment as had been told would be open until midnight Had closed earlier as insufficient guests to keep it open hence our drinks in lounge bar , From the welcome thoughtfulness of staff ensuring rooms being next to each other comfortability decor the vast breakfast choice the leisure Spa facilities proximity to station and theatre land as mother could not walk too far In fact all round great Will return and this will be my hotel of choice for all future stays when staying in London with expectation of this standard of great service and hotel Toiletries all paraben free wonderful plenty soft towels 
455610,Grange Holborn Hotel, The bathroom was tiny for 4 people making early morning showering chaotic Carpet had a few stains not pretty Breakfast was expensive at 23 , Visited the hotel with my grandchildren for 3 night stay The family room was very spacious and beds were comfortable and clean Breakfast was a fabulous event in the hotel but a little pricey 23 pp Staff throughout the hotel were very attentive helpful and friendly particularly towards the children This made our stay more relaxed 
455611,Grange Holborn Hotel, Nothing , A great stay I had a meeting near Holborn following day so location was perfect I was given an upgrade and had the most glorious views from 9th floor Super friendly staff being greeted with a smile and a have a nice day whether in the lift or corridor or reception It was very clean welcoming big room and big bathroom I d come again I have been to their sister hotel at St Paul s also an excellent stay 
455612,Grange Holborn Hotel, Water was very very slow to go down the bathroom sink , Location of hotel Spacious triple room for 3 adults was very comfortable Great shower Good security on all doors Sainsbury local across the street 
455613,Grange Holborn Hotel, We were given the wrong closing time by reception for the Sky Bar so we didn t end up getting to use it as it was closing just as we arrived Despite telling the staff upon booking that the party of 3 were all celebrating their birthdays I m disappointed to say that there was no little treat in the room for us which is customary at other 5 hotels , Great location for West End and good value overall 
455614,Grange Holborn Hotel,No Negative, Location was fantastic if you are away for a theatre break Staff were very friendly and attentive We used the hotel swimming pool which was very clean and warm 
455615,Grange Holborn Hotel, Our hotel room wasn t up to a five star hotel We have stayed here three times with family and I have been in the past with girlfriends and the furniture is the same as it was in 2005 I thought it had been refurbished but the only thing I noticed differently was the drapes and blinds bedcover and wallpaper The bedside cabinets had the varnish worn away in large patches the bedside cabinet doors were all broken pushed back in on themselves and we didn t like to pull them incase the broke off the leather effect chair at the dressing table desk was bare on one side and the seat was sagging the blinds at the window were poorly made our air conditioning broke but the did fix it Our room had 3 people in it but it was only set up for 2 two bath towels 2 glasses 2 mugs and two of each toiletries and biscuits I did inform the staff and they rectified this The extractor fan in the bathroom didn t work even though when I reported it they said it did but when my granddaughters went in the shower the condensation was so bad we had to leave the bedroom door open which was really bad when the air conditioning broke too That issue wasn t resolved as they held a tissue up to the extractor and they said there was suction Our hairdryer broke after only using it once And the children loved the pool but they put that much chlorine in the water the children s eyes were irritated and red for hours later The iron was old my husband tried to use the steam function and it marked my grandsons top as all this brown stuff came out and our ironing board wouldn t go higher than thigh level I don t know whether the hotel give certain rooms to booking com but when I have booked directly with the hotel in the past the rooms have been of a lot better quality and reading reviews of this hotel I can t understand how some can mark it 5 when our facilities definitely weren t , The view from our windows was the best we ve had in all the times we ve stayed at this hotel The staff are friendly It is clean The beds are very comfortable Location is great The staff are friendly The kids loved the swimming pool Great having air conditioning in the room and an iron and ironing board 
455616,Grange Holborn Hotel, We booked and paid for a triple room While the main bed was comfortable the other bed was a fold down settee not ideal given the age of the guests 2 were in their 70 s The pull out mattress was at a different level to the settee making it awkward and uncomfortable as a double bed , Good location excellent staff
455617,Grange Holborn Hotel, I cannot think of anything , It was very quiet Beds were very comfortable The air conditioning worked very well The staff were very helpful and polite
455618,Grange Holborn Hotel, A bit too fancy for my tastes and a bit expensive for a short one night stay Only booked it because it was in walking distance to a conference I attended , Friendly staff nice view from the 9th floor 
455619,Grange Holborn Hotel, Quite inflexible couldn t secure a complimentary late check out beyond 12pm despite one of our party being taken ill Business like approach but high standards , Gorgeous pool and great location 
455620,Grange Holborn Hotel, It would have been nice to find room slippers and better toiletteries The sauna door did not close properly, Staff friendliness and reliability They were so helpful with everything and very effective The location was superb and I would go there again
455621,Grange Holborn Hotel, We had no bathrobes in our room and wanted to use the pool no one answered the phone when we called house keeping and when we finally got our robes it was too late for our son to use the pool , The front of house staff were very helpful 
455622,Grange Holborn Hotel, Was more expensive when booked through booking com as my nephews did a late booking and got it direct from the hotel website for half the price , Large comfy beds and friendly staff Great location close to West End and walkable from Holborn tube station 
455623,Grange Holborn Hotel, The room really let the hotel down the view was terrible and the decor furniture in the room was very dated, The facilities and amenities were great
455624,Grange Holborn Hotel, I wish they could provide a walk in shower , Although I didn t use the bar on this occasion the lounge is luxurious and there is plenty of space to meet friends and the staff are usually friendly and helpful 
455625,Grange Holborn Hotel, Bed was very creaky and uncomfortable one of those where you roll to the middle Bit of work and new mattress needed Expect more from a hotel of this standard ,No Positive
455626,Grange Holborn Hotel, For a five star hotel there are certain things that you expect that could have made the experience more enjoyable New televisions in the room The ones that are currently there are tired Same with the music player They are suited to the old ipods not newer models Furthermore in one of our storage spaces we had a CD player That was a bit random and looked out of place We had tea during our visit and whilst the cups saucers teapots etc were all decent sizes and good quality the accompanying biscuits were quite clearly out of a supermarket variety pack Whilst this isn t a bad thing it is a bit out of place within a five star hotel I have stayed at four star hotels that have uniform biscuits that make the place look so much more classy These are just little persnickety things Overall my stay was enjoyable The hotel is in a great location and is very clean What more can you ask for really , It was a nice hotel and a good location The staff were friendly and approachable The bed was comfortable and there were some good facilities such as the sky bar 
455627,Grange Holborn Hotel,No Negative, The room was a great size and the bathroom too It was a double room but we had two comfy double beds which was an added bonus and a seating area too Also we had fantastic views as we were on the 8th floor as there was 3 windows and it was nice and airy when we needed it to be I was in London as a present from my husband for my 40th Birthday present and just after we arrived at our room they arrived with 2 slices of gorgeous carrot cake with the inscription happy birthday so that was a really nice touch Overall a lovely hotel very central very near Holborn tube station very near covent garden 5 mins walk for the markets there and the fab restaurants and bars there 
455628,Grange Holborn Hotel, The decoration feels a bit dated , We had two double beds which was nice The breakfast was good tasty coffee Staff were great Can t get much more central 
455629,Grange Holborn Hotel, Dirty stained sheets and uncomfortable bed where you could feel the springs Cramped bathroom Overpriced for the quality Wifi was rubbish and I generally switched it off and relied on 4G instead which was OK in area , The Spa was good massage was excellent The gym was also well equipped Short walks to West End and Euston stations so overall an excellent location Expensive rooftop cocktail bar with amazing views 
455630,Grange Holborn Hotel, Bed and pillows could have been more comfortable Secondary window glazing not fit for purpose as it didn t fit windows properly thus allowing traffic noise in even on 5th floor Door key cards took many attempts to open room door Drinks pricey, Location perfect close to station et al Room was great size Lovely pool area Staff really helpful and friendly Complimentary chocolate cakes and card for birthday celebration which was lovely surprise Food good value
455631,Grange Holborn Hotel, Would love to have an empty shelf in the fridge so I can put some things in without jiggling and being charged for the beverages in there Staff took off charges immediately so not a huge deal , Loved the beautiful and relaxing swimming pool Very nice and helpful staff Location very convenient 
455632,Grange Holborn Hotel, There was some issues with the key cards to the room but the staff were quick to fix this issue as best as they could , The staff were lovely and accommodating Polite and approachable Room was lovely and comfy and everything I needed was done really quickly and well Would stay again Great WiFi as well best I ve experienced in a hotel 
455633,Grange Holborn Hotel, windows are not good Loud air condition from the outside Impossible to sleep That s why I got an upgrade and changed the room to the street site There the beds were old and worn out In winter the air condition inside is used as heating But is so loud that I could not sleep The decor is old and needs renovation For that the room is too old , the location is very good
455634,Grange Holborn Hotel, I booked the room for 4 people however the room was only set up for 2 There were only 2 towels 2 cups 2 tea bags etc I had to make several calls to reception asking for extras of things Also for a 5 hotel I would have expected somebody to offer to take our cases to our room , The location was good and it was a good price a group of 4 adults wanting to share a room 
455635,Grange Holborn Hotel, pool area smelled foisty room had no toilet seat couldn t check in until 2 30 advertise 2 , good location for holborn walkable from kings cross bar near to reception is nice
455636,Grange Holborn Hotel, Rooms are just filled with furniture without any logic Temperature is not controllable there is just a heater that makes air unbreathable if you use it Please clean the grids They are full of dust Mirror is unusable because is on a corner and so the desk is badly located Minibar automatic minibar where you can t even read what is on the bottle that you get billed because it is automatic it is a joke Corridors are horrible you miss the money to change the carpet What about the lights of the pictures on the walls Bathroom is very small and with no ventilation Nightmare Hotel must be refurbished by a professional Italian or French designer with a sense of taste , Personnel is super kind and efficient Roman pool managed by Ajala is also quite good 
455637,Grange Holborn Hotel, Partner found the bed a little too hard , The staff were excellent professional friendly The nice touches for partners 50th were especially appreciated The room 907 was fantastic made for a special stay
455638,Grange Holborn Hotel, The bathroom was small with the door stop positioned just where you stepped out of the bath shower A power socket for recharging a mobile phone next to the bed would have been nice The click in the room was very bright at night , Comfortable clean room Friendly bar area with attentive staff Free WiFi Nice leisure facilities including a pool Easy check in and check out 
455639,Grange Holborn Hotel, OK here we go Heating wasn t working and had to be repaired on the day we arrived not nice in deepest winter Room smelt not sure what of but no pleasant JSTV not working even though it was an advertised provision which was the reason we booked the Grange in the first place Staff didn t seem to care about this we will not be recommending to other Japanese for this reason No suitcase storage in the room at all meaning we had to have them getting in the way all the time Not great for w whole family Totally insufficient clothes storage facilities especially for a family in our family room No bath robes or slippers provided On screen billing info not working Carpets old and dirty Decor scruffy and dated Sink was almost completely blocked Definitely not a 5 star Hotel 4 at best if completely updated and refitted Sorry I cant rate higher but have to be honest , The pool Sauna and steam rooms are superb Complimentary to residents too 
455640,Grange Holborn Hotel, Bathroom was a little small and rooms a bit tired But fabulous value for money , Free upgrade to a king sized room Comfy bed Friendly staff Great location 
455641,Grange Holborn Hotel, Heating was broken on what was a very cold weekend so quite uncomfortable at times Were out and about most of the time so didn t seem worth complaining , Excellent location within walking distance of many of London s attractions Quiet rooms with good facilities Pleasant pool and spa area 
455642,Grange Holborn Hotel, The bed was 2 singles put together the electrics kept flicking room was dusty and had a rubbish view of other guests in the hotel , Breakfast in room was so tasty but at 23 per head was over priced Room was big facilities were good
455643,Grange Holborn Hotel, The hotel looks a bit old and needs some renovation , Nice place near underground Easy access to many highlights by walking distance Very polite staff Quite comfortable room 
455644,Grange Holborn Hotel, Room key cards constantly dropped out which made nights less comfortable having to go up to the top of the building only to find out we need to get back down to reception for a reprint, Great hotel great location
455645,Grange Holborn Hotel, breakfast should always be offered at lower prices than high street coffee shops It is a disappointment to come down in the morning and find out breakfast would cost 20 per person but if you go outside the hotel you could pay 13 to 15 in a breakfast to 2 Good business for the local coffee shops though , location ad staff were superb
455646,Grange Holborn Hotel, Could do with a good toaster in breakfast restaurant Really wanted to visit the Sky bar but it was closed during our stay , Staff were all very helpful and cheerful Rooms very comfortable and warm We were upgraded on arrival which was a bonus Thank you 
455647,Grange Holborn Hotel, Room didn t get cleaned til after we were back in room at 600 so we declined Room booked for four only had two towels and two cups and took two requests to get additional Iron taped and looked dangerous , Pool and steam room a real Plus
455648,Grange Holborn Hotel, Very dated hotel for the price we paid At first been given a small corner room had to swap Wood not choose again not a 5 star for sure , Central location
455649,Grange Holborn Hotel, The toiletries seem to leave a layer of moisture lubricant around the skin causing one to feel like it is never completely cleaned off Either that or there is something wrong with the water that comes from the tap shower It is the same for the bathtub where possibly because of the water or toiletries always feels slippery when it becomes wet This could be a unique experience though Finally it is a pity that bottled waters are not offered in the room though This shortfall is further exacerbated by a leaking kettle , The hotel is easy to locate for a first time London traveller and strategically situated in the moderately quiet location of West London without being too far away from the main shopping district of Oxford The proximity to Holborn Underground was a saving grace because it is a logical alternative should the Heathrow Express fail you such as on Christmas Eve for example Finally the concierge staff are incredibly and consistently helpful when you need support and directions 
455650,Grange Holborn Hotel, Limited menu in Koto restaurant and staff were inflexible on making any changes, Staff were very friendly and courteous at all times Hotel very clean and comfortable
455651,Grange Holborn Hotel, Our room overlooked a back alley with a block of flats behind us we could hear people arguing and fighting in the alley until 3am WiFi was VERY slow 128k ISDN line slow thank God for 4G , It was a 5 minute walk from tube station with plenty of nearby restaurants although I recommend the hotel restaurant on the first floor The food was reasonably priced and we were left satisfied The staff were friendly and helpful Highly recommend using the facilities You won t go wrong if you ask to be moved away from the back 
455652,Grange Holborn Hotel, Dreadful Decor no atmosphere terrible Christmas decorations old dated hotel noisy rooms terrible view and unfriendly uninterested staff working at night time , Location is the only positive point but there are way nicer hotels that have a good location too 
455653,Grange Holborn Hotel, dirty hotel with dust everywhere doesn t look like 5 star hotel need total renovation furniture too old I could not complete my stay as I felt my body got filled with dust toilet too small and the WC is facing the bed feel like you are slapping with the wc , the location close to Covent garden and the metro station
455654,Grange Holborn Hotel, Our room was above a Christmas party and loud music went on to gone 11 There was a long queue to breakfast and the quality of breakfast for 5 star hotel poor Food was cold Decor in bedroom tired and looked like needed refab , The Bed was very comfy and good quality sheets Bathroom good Size of bedroom good Staff helpful charging my phone for me 
455655,Grange Holborn Hotel,No Negative, The whole experience was wonderful from the moment we stepped through the door staff we very friendly and nothing was to much trouble lovely size room very comfortable
455656,Grange Holborn Hotel, Room was not cleaned until after 4pm which meant we did not have tea and coffee making facilities until then and we arrived back at our room just as it was being cleaned , Great family room on eighth floor with superb view of London Spacious and comfortable with two double beds 
455657,Grange Holborn Hotel, I have stayed in this hotel before in previous years and found the bar area less enjoyable The cocktails my friend and I ordered were not that good Overall this is a very good hotel but it does seem a bit overpriced Breakfast most certainly is too expensive to even consider , The rooms in this hotel are always large and very comfortable The bathroom is very large and equipped with everything you will need including free toiletries The staff is always friendly and welcoming 
455658,Grange Holborn Hotel, Ordered a twin room and got a double bed and a sofa bed and could not walk between them very disappointing, Japanese restaurant brilliant and the cocktails were great
455659,Grange Holborn Hotel, This hotel is advertised as a 5 star but sadly more 3 star plus our usual 5 star hotel was fully booked we won t stay at the Grange again A tired dated looking hotel Overpriced for quality A disappointment for our monthly visit, Staff fairly pleasant and big bedroom
455660,Grange Holborn Hotel,No Negative, The bed was very comfy and the view outside the window was very pleasant The room in general was very nice and very clean Enjoyed the early morning swim 
455661,Grange Holborn Hotel, The hotel s decor and facilities are somewhat dated The bath shower was untidy and the shower screen was problematic For a 5 hotel I expected more attention to detail , The location was perfect and our family room was spacious and comfortable 
455662,Grange Holborn Hotel, I didn t like the first room that was given to us there was a lack of attention to detail on the room wall paper ripped and covered with a chair light fixtures broken We were then upgraded to a better room,No Positive
455663,Grange Holborn Hotel, Nothing, The staff and concierge especially There recomendations from I think the Gentleman was called Andreus were superbe I had a problem and the duty Manager was very help full as were reception and resturant staff Rooms spacious and ok I understand maybe bathroms req a touch of attention but in fairness were nice Would I stay again Yes
455664,Grange Holborn Hotel, Roomkeys don t work Breakfast is expensive for what it gives Hasbrowns are dry toast gets black boiled eggs are cold cappuccino is powdery , Placing surrounding Very friendly concierges and restaurant staff Koto is very good Rooms are spacious if you are in a triple 
455665,Grange Holborn Hotel, The Sky Bar we were looking forward to but the staff were not polite unlike the rest in the hotel and the first nigt we were moved on at 10 00 not even being able to finish our drinks and the second night we arrived early at 09 30 and it was closed , Breakfast was great although very expensive Beds comfy Majority of staff very polite and accomodating 
455666,Grange Holborn Hotel, Finding only 2 sets of towels and 2 cups etc when room was booked for 3 adults Also finding rubbish still in bathroom bin After coming back to hotel from theatre which was not late finding we were locked out had to go round back and go through a cloud of smoke to get back into hotel as front door was locked and people were standing outside in the doorway at the back smoking , Size of room was good
455667,Grange Holborn Hotel, Our room was flooded by the upstairs room and the hotel staff did not do anything for 2 1 2 hours We had to ask to be moved it was not offered to us the customer service from reception and duty manager was appalling The flood was not our fault but the staff did not seem bothered about us ,No Positive
455668,Grange Holborn Hotel, The shower leaked all over the bathroom floor meaning a towel had to be placed The screen didn t seal round the bath and screen door The bathroom and bedroom was ridiculously small The place is very dated Only the pool sold this place which we didn t use , The location was ideal
455669,Grange Holborn Hotel, small rather crowded downstairs areas , good location for theater etc hundreds of restaurants within 5 mins walk nice staff i have stayed a few times and it is high on my B list and normally good value 
455670,Grange Holborn Hotel, Staff knocking on the door 3 times within the first hour plus another two times after this refresh minibar fruit bowl check everything is ok , Location is good room was decent
455671,Grange Holborn Hotel, Rated 5 star some way off that Poor hair drier in room Room quite small for quad room Had to ask for bathrobes which in a five star hotel should be there 5 star price but not 5 star quality, Loved location and facilities especially pool

455673,Grange Holborn Hotel,No Negative, I requested a little touch as it was our anniversary and we received a lovely rose embedded between swan towels with a certificate Bottle of champers would have been even nicer 
455674,Grange Holborn Hotel, I emailed and called for an early check in I was assured it would not be a problem over the phone When I arrived in had to deal with rude front staff blank stares and we don t have a room until 3pm if you couldn t accommodate me why didn t you just say it instead of leaving me in the lurch There was nothing about this hotel to like after that , Nothing Maybe the location and the pool
455675,Grange Holborn Hotel, The bed was hard and the bathroom was very small The shower leaked through the screen making the floor wet , The location was excellent close to Holborn tube and an easy walk to Oxford Street Loved the pool and gym facilities Even though we arrived two hours before check in we were able to have our room straight away which was handy 
455676,Grange Holborn Hotel, Despite the fact that we were three people in the room every day we got towels only for two people and had to ask for more towels The staff forgot to clean our room for two days and we had to ask them to do it while we waited in the hall , Great location 
455677,Grange Holborn Hotel, Room are not good sealed you can hear every noise The room was minuscule the bathroom an adventure to use so small and no switches inside The cleaners tried to get inside even I left the sign don t disturb , Very close of everything several places around to visit eat Very nice in reception
455678,Grange Holborn Hotel, The bed was very hard was told all rooms the same but when my daughter arrived later the bed in her room was much softer The breakfast was disappointing we got a better selection in the Travel Lodge the previous week, The gymn is small but well equiped
455679,Grange Holborn Hotel, Should provide an empty fridge with drinks available upon request rather than the move the drink charged immediately system , Very helpful and friendly staff Superb location Spacious room 
455680,Grange Holborn Hotel, We were unable to use the roof bar as there were private functions all weekend Travellers should bare in mind that it is unlikely to be able to use this as we were told that it was not available to hotel guests and mainly for private functions, The room was spacious and clean Well equipped for coffee and tea in room and also good hairdryer important to some 
455681,Grange Holborn Hotel, SOMETIMES YOU COULD HEAR TRAFFIC AT EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING, STAFF ATTENTION TO DETAIL ALWAYS WELCOMING SMILE AND WENT OUT OF THERE WAY TO ASSIST YOU

455683,Grange Holborn Hotel,No Negative, The room was nice and big with facility to the pool The staff was friendly and helpful to us while staying Although we had some problems with the credit card which we had to talk to several people through the main line for the hotels before we were transfer to someone in the actual hotel to help us The beds were ok but could had been more comfortable for a five star hotel The rooms need to be remodeled as well Because of this and the price being expensive I did not feel it was not a good value Although if the issues were addressed then I would say it was excellent The staff was very helpful in getting cabs and holding our luggage 
455684,Grange Holborn Hotel, The doorman was rude and unhelpful, Amazing hotel in the perfect location Staff were friendly and helpful in the hotel The pool was amazing Excellent value for money 
455685,Grange Holborn Hotel, Had booked a twin room which turned out to be a double bed and a pull out sofa bed which left little space for anything else Sofa bed was on 2 levels so was quite uncomfortable for an adult to sleep on , Great location friendly staff room was pleasent with a good bathroom

455691,Grange Holborn Hotel, The double bed there should be two separate matrasses instead of one If a person moves the co sleeper is disturbed , The central location The pool and in particular the policy to limit the access of children to the pool Great

455704,Grange Holborn Hotel, could not get wheelchair into bathroom No advice on fire precautions how would I or my wheelchair exit the 3rd floor if needed in emergency for example Would prefer a softer bigger duvet Had to sleep with bathrobe over bed cover for extra warmth , comfy bed spacious room Staff offered help to car in rain when leaving Might stay again if I can get extra bedding and sort exit care 
455705,Grange Holborn Hotel, The pool was a little cool but nothing to complain about Breakfast wasn t included in our deal and very expensive 23pp to add , The facilities and room were excellent felt very pampered 
455706,Grange Holborn Hotel, Room was really small and dissapointing to the room we had on a previous occasion room service was awful food was undercooked Staff are under trained to deal with food orders and complaints, Location is good beautiful hotel
455707,Grange Holborn Hotel, Room 424 was a little dated maybe Wasn t what I was expecting for a superior room in a 5 star hotel small but was clean and ok for one night Bed was a bit hard but no great problem, Excellent staff beautiful pool great location Would definitely stay here again 
455708,Grange Holborn Hotel, Rooms are really outdated We had triple room but it was very small and bathroom was tiny You can hear the traffic sirens at night even on the 6th floor Did not sleep during the two night stay either due to traffic noise or noisy guest and slamming of the corridor door just outside our room Food service and quality is poor Overall really disappointed and feel that this hotel does not deserve the 5 start title Premium prices for less then Premium inn quality We have stayed in other Grange hotel in London and it was absolutely fabulous from all aspects Will not be recommending Grange Holborn to anyone , Location was good that s about the plus point there is for this hotel 
455709,Grange Holborn Hotel,No Negative, The room was spotless and staff on the desk were very kind by extending our check out time for no charge as it was my husband s birthday Additionally they gave us a beautifully made birthday cake at no extra cost The sauna and steam room areas very tidy and clean Lovely overnight stay
455710,Grange Holborn Hotel, Hotel is not at all something I would go back to, Very tired looking hotel and definitely not 5 star Rooms were clean but actual hotel was very poor for the money paid 
455711,Grange Holborn Hotel, The fact that breakfast was more than a steak dinner and there was no jacuzzi in wellness area as previously stated Directions and access to the Sky bar were misleading , The room was very spacious and clean 
455712,Grange Holborn Hotel, 1 They don t clean the sheets in the rooms you have to ask and this has nothing to do with being green it s just sloppy 2 Reception have no idea what they are doing other than just asking continually for pre authorisations on credit cards 3 Telephone is so bad you can t hear anyone including room service good luck with that I extended my stay out of work necessity this Is NOT a five star though it pretends to be I would certainly not recommend the hotel Oh they also provide no water even in the room other than in the mini bar which is again linked to pre authorisations which mean they suddenly lock the bar when you use this up with no reference to you and you can not get any water at night Really poor product, location they have a reasonable gym and pool area The rest is really poor 
455713,Grange Holborn Hotel, Bathroom was very small too small to be comfortable , The staff were lovely courteous and attentive Great location just 10 min walk from Covent Garden Soho Chinatown

455716,Grange Holborn Hotel, Walls aren t that thick Nothing wrong with hotel just the drunken lot that were singing in next room until early hours, Great location Food was really nice and clean comfy room
455717,Grange Holborn Hotel, Arrived early and asked to come back and check in at 3pm Came back at 5pm and only 1 room ready Disruption in the early hours on both mornings in the outside corridor and on the second occurrence the police were called to deal with the unruly guests staying in the hotel Not what was expected from 5 star hotel , Location of the hotel was very good Decent room sizes 
455718,Grange Holborn Hotel, The pool was quite cool in temperature and there is no hot tub Spent more time in the sauna as a result We didn t have breakfast as it seemed very expensive but maybe we missed out on something amazing , Wonderful room comfy beds lovely touches eg slice of birthday cake delivered to our room on arrival elegant decor and helpful staff 
455719,Grange Holborn Hotel, No tea or coffee facilities in the room, The room was very nice Loved the extra touches for valentines Good location 4 the theatres Staff very friendly and helpful
455720,Grange Holborn Hotel, The duvet seemed like a summer one it was very thin and it was rather cold room was cold and the heater was far too loud to have on while trying to sleep only 1 plug socket near the front door 2 others which were both being used so had to unplug a lamp and their clock radio to use lamp shade was worn and fell off if slightly knocked mini bar was jammed shut so couldn t use if wanted to TV remote needed new batteries , Bed comfy
455721,Grange Holborn Hotel, Not a bad hotel but never 5 in a million years The guy claiming to be the manager on duty at 5 30pm on the 3rd Feb I had my doubts was hopeless I needed to move my booking and was happy to pay the difference but he just kept repeating a script rather than listening He forced me to call booking com the next day who guess what then had to call the hotel to ask them to do what I had asked which they did Complete waste of time The bed and pillows weren t v comfortable either and the room a bit pokey , Good location close to lots of the key central London areas The girls on reception were very helpful 
455722,Grange Holborn Hotel,No Negative, Staff extremely friendly and went the extra mile to make sure all our individual needs wer catered for A perfect base hotel when doing something in London The bathroom was amazingly modern and the dining offered is exquisite 
455723,Grange Holborn Hotel, The welcome was horrible don t know if it was because i was black but i was made to feel watched was put at the very back of hotel horrible, Not much just the shower
455724,Grange Holborn Hotel, Stayed here several times over the last couple of years and usually have a fab time however I was really disappointed with my stay this time 02 01 16 04 01 16 The quad room I had was only made up for 2 and I repeatedly had to call house service for more cups and towels etc each morning they would make the room up and again set up for 2 Found staff very unhelpful reception staff looked bored and un interested Highly unlikely I will be staying here again I have heard from a trusted source that Grange St Pauls leaves Grange Holborn looking like a 3 star hotel , Nice big rooms 
455725,Grange Holborn Hotel, The food from room service was not very good and the menu was out of date What I wanted was no longer available the room smelled I thought it was just musty at first but it was a bad smell The room was too noisy to get a good night s sleep street noise and other guests could be heard as if they were in the same room, The staff were excellent The gym was small but functional The pool was excellent 
455726,Grange Holborn Hotel, A little noise from the lift at night that was a bit irritating and slightly too dark in the pool area that could do with a brighten up , Really lovely hotel a little dated but it doesn t bother you Staff were so so helpful and just has a nice feeling about it The skybar is amazing 
455727,Grange Holborn Hotel, Staff hoovering around is whilst eating breakfast lots of breakfast items unavailable during both days, Very poor service from the time of booking to the time of checking out

455731,Grange Holborn Hotel, It would have been nice to have had a simple coffee and piece of toast included in the price to be honest I was a reasonable price but felt breakfast could have been included in it , Location was excellent and pool was a real treat Very walk able to attractions 
455732,Grange Holborn Hotel, The hotel itself is very dated and in need of modernising The room facilities were obviously old e g the TV looked like something from the 90 s which matched the general d cor , Location was excellent and staff were very friendly The pool and leisure facilities were are very positive
455733,Grange Holborn Hotel, all good, we got to the hotel early staff said that our room wasn t finished but we could use all the other facilities the hotel had to offer which was good to know
455734,Grange Holborn Hotel, Very noisy air con that was either too hot or too cold No door on the bathroom in the room very small tv that was difficult to see from the sofa Lack of power points for the family to charge various devices up with Difficult to understand how this was 5 star rated , Staff dealt with problems quickly and also the room was available 2 hours before formal check in time

455739,Grange Holborn Hotel, Bar staff in roof bar were useless Only four people in the bar and two staff yet we waited 5 mins for table service before going up to bat where both continued to busy themselves by cleaning glasses for a while before I asked to be served A place to hide for lazy staff who made very poor cocktails , Only a couple of blocks from Holbon makes this hotel a great spot for a tourist stay Comfortable room and go for a higher floor as we could see most London landmarks 
455740,Grange Holborn Hotel, As there is no car park the map Given could be improved marking the streets more clearly one could take the person outside the front of the hotel to show them actually how near the car park is and how to walk there when Picking up their vehicle , The staff where e cellent most helpfull

455744,Grange Holborn Hotel, The swimming pool is located in the spa so not meant for children If we had known this we wouldn t have booked this hotel Kids are hard to keep quiet when they want to have fun so signing a form to ensure you keep your children from being noisy is a big turn off , Very clean 
455745,Grange Holborn Hotel, Breakfast for 25 GBP is a bit exaggerated, Very nice hotel in the centre of London to reasonable price and excellent facilities Magnificent indoor pool and jacuzzi All you need in your room

455751,Grange Holborn Hotel, I think while it s all lovely the room I was in was a little dated and showing a little wear and tear as in worn varnish on the chairs etc really not a worry unless you are looking for perfection, I m a wheelchair user but did not book a disabled room as I can walk enough to manage bathrooms and had able bodies with me On arrival the staff made a point to help me with doors and seemed genuinely worried I would struggle during my stay even though there were no issues It showed that they care about the customer experience Plus the water pressure in the bathroom was epic
