280190,H10 Itaca, You couldn t order much room service they always put an obstacle in the way when ordering most types of good weather it was to the room or round the pool almost like they couldn t be botherd, Close to train station easy to find friendly reception staff
280191,H10 Itaca, All the channels on television were in Spanish so my friend and I couldn t really watch tv , The staff is excellent One of the staff member s was extremely helpful and accommodating even though it was way after midnight 
280192,H10 Itaca, Not many bars and resteraunts in walking distance but metro was really easy to use anyway , How close it was to sants metro station 18mins to the airport and 10mins into the centre of town 
280193,H10 Itaca, The first room they gave us had no noise insulation you could hear everything in the neighbouring room But they moved us and gave us free champagne , Walking distance to the transit hub of Barcelona 
280194,H10 Itaca, Breakfast amenities The pool closed at 7pm for no good reason There was no jacuzzi as stated on the listing The elevators were slow If you wanted to order something you needed to push a button even at the bar so no staff around at all times It all felt a bit like it used to be a great hotel , Parking and location was good reception upon arrival was really friendly 
280195,H10 Itaca, Not a huge amount in area surrounding the hotel in regards to restaurants , Nice hotel Close to Barcelona Sants station We also picked up the hop on hop off bus from the station which was a great way to see the city Staff friendly Lovely to sit out on the terrace in the evening Bar food was nice We didn t try the restaurant Shop next door Room and ensuite was a very good size Coffee machine in room 
280196,H10 Itaca, The beds were super hard Restaurant staff neglected to give us our 15 discount , Front of house staff were WONDERFUL Went above and beyond to fix the discount issue
280197,H10 Itaca,No Negative, Excellent location for main train station which we used to travel to Montmelo for the Moto GP Been to this hotel many times always really happy with everything Had an excellent evening meal staff are great x
280198,H10 Itaca, The breakfast fee is little bit expensive for children It s the same for adults They can t eat so much , Comfotable bed and good to sleep Near the Sant Estacio or Tarragona It s easy to access anywhere I want to visit 
280199,H10 Itaca, It seemed like an old property but well maintained , The property was modern and clean The breakfast buffet was worth the price They had a lot of items from which to choose including scrambled eggs a rare thing in Europe 
280200,H10 Itaca,No Negative, The staff were exceptionally helpful and could not have done more to make us feel welcome The breakfast was delicious and there was a great variety of food Definitely something for everyone An excellent base from which to explore Barcelona as the location is great Very close to the main train station which includes the metro service 
280201,H10 Itaca, We had to ask for milk and coffee top ups on a couple of occasions , We booked the hotel last minute and were happy with our choice We chose it because we liked the look of the outside relaxation areas The pool was as described a plunge pool so not deep enough to actually swim and unheated so chilly in April No complaints though we used the sunbeds when we returned from sightseeing and it was warm enough to sit outside just what we wanted We thought the hotel clean and comfortable and the staff generally helpful but not over welcoming The breakfast was good full English was available with fruits cereal pastries cheese and meat so enough to keep you going for most of the day We hired bikes for four days and were able to store them in the car park below the hotel safely behind an automatic gate There is a supermarket next door if you need to pick up any provision and the Sants station five minutes away has lots of food outlets and a tourist information Head to Placa d Osca for authentic tapas frequented by the locals 
280202,H10 Itaca, We were in a brand new room but a few minor things needed attention Our key didnt work the air conditioner wasnt working well , The staff were very friendly and helpful Emanuella was absolutely excellent and nothing was too much trouble 
280203,H10 Itaca, Pool out of action Would have been good to use it in unseasonably warm weather , Located a few minutes walk from Sant station making travel around the city and to outlying areas very easy 
280204,H10 Itaca, Electric tea kettle in the room would be nice there was only a coffe maker and although it was possible to use it as hot water dispenser the water was not enough hot to make a good tea and it had a taste of coffe which I don t like It was a pity that the terrace was closed for reconstruction it looked fantastic and it would be great to have a drink there , Everything was great The rooms are rather small but very comfy The value for money was very good I enjoyed my stay in H10 Itaca very much 
280205,H10 Itaca, Booked rook with double bed but got 2 single beds together which moved all night and had not comfort to sleep with my girlfriend had no beautiful view outside from hotel no pool and for price I paid could find better and closer to beach side, Clean and fresh everywhere
280206,H10 Itaca, We waited half an hour to check in with no apolgy the reception staff were unfriendly unwelcoming The view out of our bedroom window was of a building site The jacuzzi was our of use there was no shower near the sauna We were woken up two mornings one morning at 5am by staff crashing around in the chamber maids cupboard next to our room then guests upstairs running a bath then their alarm going off 6am Just got back to sleep when the chamber maid started banging crashing in the store cupboard second morning in a row Breakfast staff rushed us to finish Bar very cold as gap under the doors from building improvements Drilling noise on arrival departure ,No Positive
280207,H10 Itaca, Fan in bathroom would be appreciated to remove condensation quickly Water temperature regulator needs updating Construction renovation directly under our room We knew patio was closed for construction but unaware of full scale of renovations , Bed was comfortable Staff were very helpful and friendly Dining room service and food was VERY GOOD and prices were excellent Definitely would comeback Look forward to post renovation rooms 
280208,H10 Itaca,No Negative, Bed super comfy and also instead of the usual rubbish coffee sachets in the room H10 Itaca has Nespresso machines and coffee capsules in the rooms very nice
280209,H10 Itaca, There was no working pool but is mentioned on the website The jacuzzi was full of dirt so we didnt get to use any of those facilities We also asked the staff on the day we arrived that the safe has been closed by previous people who were in our room and he mentioned that they will come sort it out but unfortunately wasn t sorted until we left so we couldn t secure our valuables in a safe place , The location and the comfort of the bed was good 
280210,H10 Itaca,No Negative, Nice kind staff Receptionist very kind Room modern clean Perfect location for going to the airport via Sants train train station Walking distance 
280211,H10 Itaca, The pool area doesn t have a lot of sun because of the the building Electric window opener and air conditioner are loud and I could hear evrything that was my impression from the neighbour rooms and a lot of noise from outside even if the window was closed 4 I stayed in better 3 hotels, First impression is great Near the train station and Plaza de Espa a I like the pool area 
280212,H10 Itaca, We arrived at the hotel after a charity bike ride cycling from Manchester We also arrived on our 24th Wedding Anniversary and the hotel were aware of both Nobody acknowledged either I wasn t after flowers or champagne an acknowledgement would have been sufficient In addition my sister arranged for a delivery to our room of cava and beer to be there on our arrival It didn t arrive until she chased it When we checked out the receptionist also divulged how much it cost for the cava beer as our bill was incorrect and had to be recalculated Unprofessional , Didn t have breakfast far too expensive at 15 euros each 
280213,H10 Itaca, Starting to look a little tired, Close enough to the underground and walking if you like walking distance from the centre plus close to the fountains 
280214,H10 Itaca, Pool not as big as it looks online The hotel is located right by a children s play area which was quite noisy when trying to relax , Staff were very helpful and attentive Nearest metro station is is on the L3 line which stops directly on La ramblas the main square and near the port
280215,H10 Itaca, Is not in the historic center Non swimming pool , Tres proprie et comfort Mais il serait chere en ajoutant 30 euros par jour pour la petite dejeuner Le staff est tres gentil et aimable 
280216,H10 Itaca, Bed could have been better, Great breakfast buffet Super friendly staff Nice outdoor space and plunge pool 60cm Cozy outdoor space by the pool in the evening
280217,H10 Itaca, Very noisy air conditioning system Fan was operating on low speed but distracting , Easy access to transport system Close to cafes bars and shops Staff were friendly with excellent customer service 
280218,H10 Itaca, The bathroom is not ergonomic dificult danger to reach the window toilet seat is short and in a weird corner , Excelent breakfast good location near the metro stations the staff is friendly 
280219,H10 Itaca, We were given room 203 which is above the restaurant so in the morning when breakfast is being served 7am 10 30am you can hear the chairs moving on the floor After our first night in this room we asked to be moved and they moved us without any fuss , The reception staff were very friendly and helpful especially Ivan We wanted to go to a local spa and Ivan helped us book it by calling the spa himself and booking it for us Ivan was very helpful in explaining directions to places Breakfast had a wide variety and most of the time had all food topped up They catered to our individual dietary requirements well Very good bar and service 
280220,H10 Itaca, A bit far from the old city by foot but the subway is very close to the hotel , The service is good The staff is very helpful We arrived earlier and they let us to check in at 12 Next day we left our luggage after check out without any problems 
280221,H10 Itaca, The rooms were tiny I mean couldnt even open our suitcase tiny The bed wasnt even a double more like one of those 1 1 2 beds and yet that was so uncomfortable The hotel itself is a short walk to the train station but also situated next to a prison about 30 mins walk into barcelona city centre Limited food places nearby Not what i would call a 4 by any means We didnt bother with the pool which was the main reason why we booked here seen deeper padderling pools Glad we relocated nearer to the city which weirdly has bigger rooms , Lobby was nice Located next to a supermarket which was convinient Modern decore
280222,H10 Itaca, There is no pool just plunge pool and it is not marked on your advertisement only on the hotel website The hotel is old furnichure scratched Bath rusty, Breakfast good enough
280223,H10 Itaca, Only thing that could need improving was the showers were very temperamental When trying to find the right temperature it kept going really hot then really cold , The rooftop jacuzzi was lovely and a brilliant sun trap Prices of drinks were reasonable and came with free crisps 
280224,H10 Itaca,No Negative, Staff at H10 Itaca was extremely helpful especially Ivan They provided us with recommendations and tips for our travels The hotel is located few minutes away from 2 metro stations and Barcelona Sants train station which was very convenient when traveling to Circuit de Barcelona Catalynya to watch F1 We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone Thank you for our lovely stay 
280225,H10 Itaca, Reception staff were rude and uninformative check in took a long time air con in the room wasn t amazing, Room facilities liked the robes and bathroom amenities was good that pool towels were provided and safe was provided
280226,H10 Itaca, The pool was basically a paddling pool you could not swim in it Some staff could have been more pleasant a smile goes a long way , Fantastic breakfast selection Comfy beds and pillows Air conditioning Patio area
280227,H10 Itaca, Had mould in shower over the bath and around the handbasin Yhis should not be in a 4 star hotel Minibar fridge not cold complained to staff told it s not a refrigerator it s a bar fridge too much for us asked for an ice bucket to get a cold drink , Ease of access to railway station and metro Comfortable beds WiFi worked well when needed 
280228,H10 Itaca,No Negative, Room was big bed very comfy in room210 overlooking small pool great nights sleep Staff in hotel were great ate in resturant meal was delicious there were 4 off us all had something different all enjoyed bathrobes and slippers waiting on us in room after having dinner and drinks 
280229,H10 Itaca, The gym is really small and the cardio equipment was either broken or functioned only partly , The breakfast buff was really good with lots of fruits cheeses meats egg in different forms yogurt with extras and also sweet and salty baked goods There is also cava included in the breakfast I appreciated that the personnel found gluten free bread just for me for the breakfast 
280230,H10 Itaca, Bar staff left early at 11 50pm so was unable to get a drink when we arrived back after late dinner Plunge pool is dissapointing, Very friendly and helpful reception staff Excellent complementary toiletries Fantastic location for metro and train 
280231,H10 Itaca,No Negative, The staff was extremely kind and useful The coffee machine nespresseo in the reception desk was a nice surprise Definitely a good place if you need lodging close to Sants 
280232,H10 Itaca, I didn t like the standard room which we initially were given It didn t seem like it should be in a 4 hotel not to mention the bed was creaky and wasn t properly attached to the wall I d recommend if staying here you should opt for the superior room it s very much a 4 bedroom Though perhaps my experience of the standard room isn t what they re all like I m not sure Also there didn t to be much happening in the area around the hotel like bars restaurants etc This made the Sans station nearby so necessary , I liked that the hotel was so close to the Barcelona Sans train station which allowed us to get to wherever in the city pretty fast We had a complaint about our bedroom after the first night as the bed was so creaky which made it difficult to sleep We asked to change rooms the next morning which was ok with the staff We asked if we could pay more for a superior room instead however the hotel upgraded us to one of the superior rooms with no extra cost This was great customer service and made our impressions of the hotel go up a lot The jacuzzi on the rooftop was a nice addition after a long day of sightseeing while the superior room had a huge bed and seemed like a different hotel from the standard bedroom 
280233,H10 Itaca, It would be helpful if comments left when booked hotel room were read and taken into consideration e g we asked for late check in check out and a twin room not double Acoustic of rooms is awful and beds have wheels No chairs no furniture on bathroom Overall price overrated for condition and facilities , Location easy access proximity to train station 8m and underground 5m Walkind distance to attractions Montjuic 15m Sagrada Familia 35m Paseig Gracia 35m Las Ramblas 45m Our room did not have tea coffee facility but we asked for it and the next morning we had it as a compliment Staff always very helpful and friendly 
280234,H10 Itaca, Pricey and minimum for a 4 star Pool waste of time More gym equipment in my cellar Did not get a good night sleep Swapped rooms as the room next to the road you might as well be on the street so noisy Heard everyone else including couples having sex Air con is not really air con and noisy Never been sound proofed rooms Over priced for what it is Hostels are more quiet , Breakfast was good Next to bus stops
280235,H10 Itaca, I was given a wrong bed on arrival and had to exchange On the next morning I was charged for my stay twice and had to run an extra mile to get my money back , Interior and exterior design is awesome location is superb very clean and spacious rooms 
280236,H10 Itaca, More vegetarian options during breakfast the baked beans were in the same tray as the bacon and sausages and other guests were using the same spoon for the beans as well as the meat It would also be nice if a kettle and tea were available in the room , The pillows were very soft and comfortable and the bathroom was spacious and clean 
280237,H10 Itaca, Bathroom fitments were not in great condition and housekeeping average , Good size TV and selection of channels Large wardrobes Free easy to use safe box in room 
280238,H10 Itaca,No Negative, Good location and friendly staff comfy clean rooms Disappointed one night as restaurant shut to guests for private booking and we weren t told so ended up late back in bar with sandwiches if had known would have made better arrangements Also pool area closed with no notification beforehand
280239,H10 Itaca, They took our towels without giving us new ones You could practically hear what the guest on the other side of the wall were talking about , Breakfast was very nice beds were comfortable 
280240,H10 Itaca, Having been to h10 over the years was disappointed in this one Classed as a 4star but I would disagree Having had to change rooms on arrival due to smell safe not working shower taps broken and parts falling off shower door we were given another room The bath was all rusty and mouldy which made me feel very uncomfortable each time I was in there Pool is very shallow and more like a paddling pool , Location and supermarket underneath the hotel 
280241,H10 Itaca, Pool was extremely disappointing and nothing like in the pictures having a pool was the reason we chose this hotel in the first place but it was a way too small and narrow to swim Also only a handful of sunbeds were available so half the people left the pool area or sat on normal chairs which is not too comfortable , Beautiful stylish lobby Friendly reservation staff 
280242,H10 Itaca, A little further out than would have liked 30 40 minute walk into la ramble but only 8 for a taxi so wasnt too bad, Friendly staff air con Is ok but not very strong so asked for a fan which they were kind enough to leave with us all week 
280243,H10 Itaca, No English or German news channel No kettle in a room absolutely ridicules for international standards Small room can t even sit at the desk room number 405, Pool area
280244,H10 Itaca, Could not regulate the airconditioning temperature so either had told switch it offers completely or stayed a big chilly Bed was not as comfortable as it should be No free room tea facilities which is pretty basic and no tissue box, Nice big rooms
280245,H10 Itaca, No variety in the breakfast buffet as we can not eat pork the AC in the room was not working and the maintenance guy ignored us as not much air was coming out They dont clean the room as they replace only the garbage bags and towels The rooms are not soundproof as we can here everything outside the room as if it were happening in ours , The staff ate very friendly and the location was good since it was away from the traffic and tourist crowds 
280246,H10 Itaca, There are no nice restaurants or cafes near by a bit secluded area The hotel is little old and looks a bit different from the photos provided on Booking com page , Overall a nice small city hotel Has everything you need Very close to a metro station and about 25min walk to the city centre We didn t have any meal so we cannot comment on that 
280247,H10 Itaca,No Negative, All of the staff were very helpful throughout our stay We always need to look out for places that can help with gluten free diets We had no concerns about the hotel in this regard The breakfast buffet had a good number of choices with gluten free bread and cereals
