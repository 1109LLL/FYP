300412,Pestana Arena Barcelona,No Negative, Nice and clean hotel with comfy bed Close to Plaza Espana there are shops reataurants bars fast food nearby Sauna is nice however a relax room would be great 
300413,Pestana Arena Barcelona, There was no hot water on the second day of our stay No coffee maker in the room , Great location close to Magic Fountains with easy access to public transport shopping and downtown core
300414,Pestana Arena Barcelona,No Negative, The location is good Although it s not in the center of the city it s very close to metro station with multiple lines It s also close to train station Sants and airport shuttle 
300415,Pestana Arena Barcelona, Fragrance used by hotel for its public areas didnt smell nice We booked in february for stay in late apr early May and full credit payment was immediately effected in february ,No Positive
300416,Pestana Arena Barcelona,No Negative, Staff are friendly and helpful Hotel is clean and quiet Loved the fact they noticed there was a birthday card in my room and left me a treat and voucher for complimentary drinks 
300417,Pestana Arena Barcelona, Nothing or maybe the breakfast menu could be more varied , The best thing its location within walking distance to the main attractions subway bus station airport shuttle are nearby 
300418,Pestana Arena Barcelona, Fire alarm going off at midnight Christmas day Went off for ages and when we got downstairs were told false alarm Same suite booked as last time but this room appeared smaller than the room next door which we stayed in last time , Great location Room was nice and clean Good view out on the balcony stayed in hot tub suite Different lady at reception this time from last and she was friendly and accommodating 
300419,Pestana Arena Barcelona,No Negative, Staying 2d time everything is perfect just would be better if complimentary breakfast added If you need slippers just ask reception or housekeeping Bed is very large and comfortable Internet is ok location perfect metros buses inc airport front desk is 24h
300420,Pestana Arena Barcelona, Our Jacuzzi ended up getting a lot of expanding foam pumped into it I assume due to a leak we weren t aware of Being expanding foam it expanded quite a bit and was a bit of a trip hazard as it was right before the steps A note or something to let us know this had been carried out it was still soft when we got back to the room in the evening as we weren t sure if we should use it still would have been appreciated , Our room was really comfortable and clean lots of extra pillows and the walk in wardrobe area was a really nice extra Breakfast was really nice they had gluten free options bread baguette which needed 10 mins to defrost heat up lemon madeleines and biscuits pastries fruit bacon etc which were all very tasty Jacuzzi was great after a long day of walking around and sight seeing and the balcony was nice to sit out on It was definitely worth upgrading the room to get the extra space balcony and Jacuzzi Staff were lovely and very helpful throughout our stay 
300421,Pestana Arena Barcelona, Rather minor but the gym is just 3 ellipticals in a room , Good location close to a metro station The room was quite spacious and the bed was very comfortable The wifi also worked well and the staff was helpful 
300422,Pestana Arena Barcelona, There was a tiny bit of tile grout repair that could be done in the shower but other than that it was perfect , I stayed in room 301 interior for 2 nights and it was just perfect I had a window overlooking the courtyard which isn t normally what I like but it was nice I usually prefer an exterior room so I can people watch They staff felt this would be better this time and in the morning I found out why There was quite a bit of street construction going on which I could not hear it at all in my room My friends had an exterior room and even with the window closed they could hear it So I am thankful for the interior room Of course noise like that is out of the control of the hotel but it was nice of them to consider my sleep The rooms were very well appointed and modern I love having the coat hooks as you walk into the room and the lobby is very nice as well The staff was always friendly The location was great it is just 5 min walk from Plaza Espana with the arena shopping and the metro The night time fountain show is great up near the museums and it was a safe area to walk around at night I also liked that the Airport bus A1 or A2 was 26 min direct from airport to Plaza Espana for only 10 20euro return from there it was just a few blocks walk to the hotel 
300423,Pestana Arena Barcelona, Woman at reception was very miserable We understood we couldn t get room right away as we arrived early but she could have been nicer about it It was no issue on our side Room wasn t cleaned on 2nd day and didn t get a phone call until late in evening apologising for this , We stayed in the room with hot tub and this was a great room I did worry with hot tub being on balcony rather than in room but actually was better this way got to see the sky at night while in it View was also very nice Would stay here again In good location not far from Fountains 
300424,Pestana Arena Barcelona, The light controls were a little tricky One side of the bed was stuck and all buttons were lit in my face all night Lights also flickered every few minutes Bed had a bit of an impression on one side Wall behind the bed was a bit thin and shook a bit every time somebody in the other room closed a drawer, Staff went out of their way to help us Plenty of patience for many questions Room was very clean
300425,Pestana Arena Barcelona, Room small, Spotless room comfortable bed excellent staff very helpful and pleasant staff Excellent location for Sants train station and Placa Espanya for airport both 5 10 mins between Tarragona Espanya metro 3 5 minstes perfect for an overnight stay
300426,Pestana Arena Barcelona, The bar closed quiet early and we couldn t enjoy our welcome drink so not really anything to bother about , We got a free upgrade The room had two separate bathrooms a Nespresso machine desk and nice and modern furniture The breakfast was good and the staff was nice 
300427,Pestana Arena Barcelona, Everything was great , Excellent location short walk to train Close to Arena mall shops and restaurants Also close to subway station to Monserrat Staff friendly and helpful 
300428,Pestana Arena Barcelona, The room was completely chilled when we came in it was less than 30 degrees outside an a max of half of it in the room so we seriously had to think about heating as opening the window was not really efficient Annonying the light concept They dont have individual switches for the lights you just can pick out of a couple of moods so if you just want to have lets say the bedlight turned on and a small light in the bathroom nope , Quite a nice area with a couple of restaurants and shops around 
300429,Pestana Arena Barcelona, Ummm nothing, Friendly and helpful staff and great location to see rest of the city as close to metro stations Stayed in 702 suite with spa bath on terrace which made it super comfortable for some rest and relaxation after visiting all the sites 
300430,Pestana Arena Barcelona, Bath in room 212 need to be sort I ask for iron and bring me old iron water was leaked make my tshirt wet and dirty, Very nice hotel close to metro and plaza espania 
300431,Pestana Arena Barcelona, Breakfast to expensive for the quality and quantity in the city s have hundred of choices for take a really good one for the half price , Good position near to the main train station and subway
300432,Pestana Arena Barcelona,No Negative, Very clean room friendly and helpful reception staff and night staff and good location Would most definitely stay here again complimentary sweets are definitely a plus 
300433,Pestana Arena Barcelona, The air conditioning wasn t always cool enough on the very hot evenings , Brilliant location close to at least 3 metro stops within walking distance We walked down the road each morning for a lovely breakfast of coffee fresh orange juice and a fresh pastry very cheap next to a big food market The metro was able to get us to all the places we wished to see quick and easy buy the 10 trip card for 10euro great value Had a great view of monument a colon from our room window 
300434,Pestana Arena Barcelona, My wife injured herself getting out of the shower bath as it is rounded with sloped sides and there is nothing to hold on to Take care , Pleasant hotel very close to Parc Montjuic and Arenas shopping long walk via Ave Paralel to the port but I knew that Bus from airport to Placa D Espana os very cheap and take 2 minutes to walk to the hotel 
300435,Pestana Arena Barcelona, No complaints Here s to my next stay , Brilliant location Extremely helpful staff Car park is a bonus for such an excellent location Ask about where the entry door is before you travel to make things easier for yourself If you miss it it s a bit of a mission round the one way traffic stream to get back to it 
300436,Pestana Arena Barcelona,No Negative, We stayed only one night so I don t have much to say but during our stay we had no problems at all All our requests were fulfilled adjoining rooms beds as we wished parking No complaines at all 
300437,Pestana Arena Barcelona, Location is not the best if your plan is to visit main touristic attractions For that price breakfast should be included, It is a modern hotel and very clean They allowed me to do a late check out with no issue Staff is very friendly and helpful
300438,Pestana Arena Barcelona, Didn t like the fact the room was so dull and dark facing not attractive street No mirror apart from bathroom making getting ready in the awkward lighting No ironing equipment available at all annoying as clothes crease in the case Unsure how they have 4 star rating if no basics such as these, The location is slightly hidden but easy to access all around The hotel decor throughout is quite dark which is quite off putting In bedroom walk way areas Plaza Espanya is a few minutes walk to get anywhere Good location to the shopping centre with great roof top restaurants and to Sant montjuic Did not eat or drink at the hotel cannot comment Kindly gave cava for our honeymoon trip 
300439,Pestana Arena Barcelona, Nothing , Excellent clean modern hotel Stayed in the suite with the hot tub which was worth the extra money Staff very friendly and helpful Metro station just around the corner four stops and we were in the centre of Barcelona Would recommend and defo stay here again 
300440,Pestana Arena Barcelona,No Negative, The location was perfect for us it was a short walk from Barcelona Sants station and the hop on hop off stations train station and the one bear the hostefrancs market The neighborhood was quiet and it was near the Parc Joan Miro 
300441,Pestana Arena Barcelona,No Negative, The staff and their willingness to work with you for a solution Very helpful indeed and very welcoming warm and friendly The manager even gave me an awesome free coffee on check in The bar and reception staff were just awesome pretty much how it goes in many of the hotels I ve stayed in throughout Spain Truly great country and people Just down the road from the best thai restaurant I have ever been to Thai Siam 
300442,Pestana Arena Barcelona, The room was glum and in side road position No tea or coffee facilities The meal in the restaurant was disgusting when we asked where the mushroom sauce was for the steak the waitress just said we have not any she could have mentioned it before we chose the dish We paid well over the price for two nights on y because if the worlds largest mobile congress we were inky going in a cruise so needed accommodation we felt totally ripped off , Nothing 
300443,Pestana Arena Barcelona, Nothing I was unhappy about, Found this hotel on booking com at a terrific price and due to it s close proximity to Sants train station 5 minutes walk we went ahead and booked it and we were so glad we did Check in was quick and easy and even though we arrived at 11am our room was ready for us The room was beautiful and spacious and the free Wi Fi was very reliable The bed was so comfortable Location wise It s a 2 minute walk to Tarragona metro station and 4 minutes to Plaza de Espana metro station Jump on a train and you re at Pl Catalunya in 4 stops 5 minutes Hotel was so handy for our early morning train out of Sants to Valencia Flying in to Barcelona this hotel is so convenient as there is a direct train from the Airport to Sants R2 trains Highly recommend this beautiful hotel

300448,Pestana Arena Barcelona, The room are clean even if not spotless Breakfast if not included is a bit expensive compared with all the cafeterias you can find nearby , The Pestana hotel is very close to plaza de Espana a two minutes walk to the airport shuttle stop The staff is kind and speaks a very good English The hotel has 4 bikes to rent for 10 a day Barcelona has lots of bicycle paths cycling from place to place in a warm day is a very nice way to enjoy the city 
300449,Pestana Arena Barcelona, Very hard to get a drink at bar at times but this wasn t a major problem Staff always came to need Bar closes very early so if planning on having a few drinks before you go off to bed then make sure it s early , Location was great and a nice quite area of barcelona 
300450,Pestana Arena Barcelona, Bathtub drain was blocked and it was not fixed until check out Black mold in every corner of the bathroom Too small room for 3 beds managed to move in the room , Location
300451,Pestana Arena Barcelona, Corridors are not ventilated or air conditioned Room service needs upgrading we arrived from a long late flight so placed an order There was confusion over prices what was on the menu and didn t get what we ordered just what was available Shower area could use some maintenance , A few minutes walk to Placa Espanya restaurants and the Arena Shopping Centre Walking distance to the National Museum of Art Our triple room was comfortable and the bathroom was enormous 
300452,Pestana Arena Barcelona, Reception desk and dining room staff however were not courteous When we asked for dinner we were told by dinning room staff that food cannot be provided as kitchen staff was busy with a large group dinner service Not the response expected from a 4 star hotel In addition reception was not very well versed with transport to key sights in Barcelona Would not like to stay in such place again as service makes all the difference in the hotel industry, Rooms are lovely and spacious Bathrooms are also very nice and clean 
300453,Pestana Arena Barcelona, The maid s walked in on our room without knocking which was a little embarrassing Some of the bed linens also had old stains on them , The hotel is modern and clean Room size was ok The staff were very nice and helpful I think for the price I was expecting a little more luxury but overall the hotel is good 
300454,Pestana Arena Barcelona, The refrigerator was very bad It does not work well I want to stay at spa But it has time imited between 10 A m and 8 P m , Friendly staffs and comfortable room They prepared early check in room and stored my luggages 
300455,Pestana Arena Barcelona, There were no air conditionin in elevators or corridors But I understand if there is a policy in Catalunia of not wasteing energy , Near Plaza Espa a I had a terrace with a Jacuzzi excellent for sunbath 
300456,Pestana Arena Barcelona, After 17 hours we arrived having missed a night s sleep The hotel does not seem to allow early check in at all as we were not the only guests falling asleep in the lobby Exactly at the stated check in we were given keys to our room We had asked if they could clean our room first but they seemed uninterested in doing so I won t stay here again , This is a very stylish clean hotel in an excellent location 
300457,Pestana Arena Barcelona, No complaints whatsoever , Modern quiet and clean hotel Excellent rooms Friendly staff Close to Placa Espanya and Sants station two major transport hubs in Barcelona 
300458,Pestana Arena Barcelona, I could hear all the noise coming from the side guest room The have changd me next day to an upgraded room which was great but had strong cigarrete smell from previous guest It was a nice try to solve the situation anyways , Location bed friendly staff
300459,Pestana Arena Barcelona, The bakery down the road was shut Had to walk 2 minutes further down the road , The staff and cocktails And because it s away from beach it s quiet at night Also a walk in the opposite direction is amazing Prices are cheaper and quality is better

300461,Pestana Arena Barcelona, Cleaners were getting lazy We asked the room to be cleaned every second day First week towels and bedclothes were changed every time but in the last 4 days they were not changed at all , The room was generally clean and comfortable 
300462,Pestana Arena Barcelona, Maybe its nit picking but the mini fridge at the room wasnt really up to the task in the smouldering Barcelona summer , This is a very well located and modern hotel within walking distance from Plaza de Espanya where you can arrive by airport shuttle and Sants station Friendly and welcoming staff offered us a deluxe suite upgrade at no cost Amazing room very spacious huge bathroom closet with a private terrace and external jacuzzi Great buffet breakfast served at internal patio Lots of restaurants and shopping options around Wholly recommended
