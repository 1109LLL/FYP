2008,The Park Grand London Paddington, The first night we were given an extremely small room with the bathroom door broken Next morning when we made a complaint they gave us a perfect room , The size of the room
2009,The Park Grand London Paddington, They stolen 800 from my money from the safe box at my room I couldn t report to police because shortage of time to reach my flight back They can watch the cameras and identify easily the staff who entered my room and return back my money , Nothing special
2010,The Park Grand London Paddington, The room was appalling I had originally requested a room with a balcony as a special request and I understand that may not always be possible In saying that they gave me a room in the basement Supposedly it was a bonus gift from them as it was a bigger room to what I had originally booked Which made me think how small could my room have been if this so called bigger room was this small There was a window with three magnificent view of the buildings pipe work There was a constant noise out the window from a machine of some sort There was not much room to hang clothes or put things away There was a tiny built in wardrobe which could barely fit a handful of tops but the room was for 2 I will not be staying here again , The front desk and entrance was very nice and the staff were helpful 
2011,The Park Grand London Paddington, The change of hotel story it repeated with every gusts so I have reviewed some of gust comments before and I faced the same If you booked a room for three adult which is queen bed and sofa beds you will stay in the basement which I will not recommend So the only room fit 3 adult is in the basement otherwise they move you up in room with extra bed for non adult The room pic dose not match the reality , they transfer me to The Park Grand London Kensington due to maintance work at The Park Grand London Paddington they offer me a free ride to Kensington a soft drink while im i watting the taxi and includ the breakfast in my stay which that im not applied for it Park Grand London Kensington newer and bigger than Park Grand London Paddington Underground station 3 mins walk People at reception and generally everyone I interacted with was super friendly and helpful which makes a difference the handy phone that comes with the room The bathroom is clean with all required supplies There is a microwave and small separate room for cloths and iron 
2012,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, This is my second time staying at this Hotel The first time I was on business This time it was for mini holiday The bed is very comfortable The room and bathroom very clean and spacious The location is very convenient Very good selection at breakfast 
2013,The Park Grand London Paddington, Our room seemed hidden away in the bowels of the hotel It did have a large frosted window but when examined it clearly looked out on to a manky neglected ourdoor light shaft , Very handy location to Paddington Station and Heathrow Express and in the pretty Paddington area This hotel is clean and comfortable if a little dated The staff are wonderful thank you And the English breakfast was excellent Not a fancy and extensive breakfast buffet but a tasty and well cooked meal Equally food on the room service menu was tasty and fresh Good Indian and European cuisine 
2014,The Park Grand London Paddington, Noisy air con , The room was small but we knew that before arrival I just didn t think that paying an extra 40 for a room that I wasn t going to spend much time in warranted it The wardrobe didn t mark sense as it was so thin you couldn t actually hang anything in it The hairdryer was in the wardrobe and the mirror on the back of the door that didn t open wide enough to look in to blow dry your hair Parking was a nightmare as you have to park 10 minutes away and trudge back with your luggage This wasn t mentioned before booking I wish the hotel would have had a link to booking which is under Waitrose and was 40 for two night The price wasn t that bad it was just the nightmare of walking back and forth with luggage The location was good close to Paddington and Lancaster Gate we walked to oxford street as it was so close and the weather was fab 
2015,The Park Grand London Paddington, Our first room had water leaking from the ceiling room above dripping down into our room We had to change rooms and the staff refused to give a monetary refund discount for the inconvenience I asked to speak with the manager about my disatisfaction and for 7 days was put off Additionally the ac was very loud did not work well and I was always hot The junior suite was too small for 3 people The sheets were not changed for 7 days Choose a different hotel , The free breakfast every morning that came with the stay The staff in the restaurant were wonderful 
2016,The Park Grand London Paddington, Our rooms were in underground floor it s nothing specifically bad but was not mentioned during booking Unstable wi fi signal in the room but still working The worst part is tiny bathroom It combines toilet and shower on a very small patch and if you are not alone after one person takes a shower everything around like floor toilet is absolutely wet , Hyde Park and public transport are in close proximity we used Bayswater station everyday Staff is really helpful supported us in printing boarding passes The pub across the street is great The room is small but probably good for value because of price and location 
2017,The Park Grand London Paddington, Very small rooms Bed was uncomfortable Shower flooded the bathroom No bath Carpet and mattress were stained Expensive compared to other hotels we could have booked in the area that would have offered the same standard , The drinks at the bar were very reasonably priced
2018,The Park Grand London Paddington, The photos of the compact room do it show how small it really is This room will only just have enough room for you luggage , Great transport system nearby especially from the airport LHR Customer service is excellent
2019,The Park Grand London Paddington, It s very close to another hotel with almost the same name so we went to the wrong one first not really their fault Checking in was very chaotic it was very busy Some people had been double booked Also when we went to check in at 2 15pm one of the rooms wasn t ready as they had a late check out which I didn t think was a very good excuse The hotel was OK but it was expensive for what you got it s the location you re paying for , Location shower
2020,The Park Grand London Paddington, Run down needs new furniture and painting Not clean enough and when cleaner comes with just polish and a rag then you know it s not being cleaned good enough , Good Aircon Comfy bed Brilliant shower

2024,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, The space is good for a family of 4 The bathroom is clean with all required supplies There is a microwave and small separate room for cloths and iron 
2025,The Park Grand London Paddington, The A C control in the room did not work We notified the issue the day we checked in but it was never fixed We needed to call the counter for them to change the room temperature The furnishings in the lobby need attention they look old and beat , The hotel location is excellent It is super close to the Paddington train and tube stations It is near to places to eat food stores and pharmacy You walk three streets south and you are next to the Hyde Park Kensington Gardens gate I had breakfast at their restaurant two days in a row and the food was good and a good selection of items My room did not have an iron and ironing board in it but it was made available by the staff right away 
2026,The Park Grand London Paddington, Room was extremely small with very strange walk in wardrobe space I feel the layout of the room and the dark wood did not help Not good if you are claustrophobic Also as we were in an internal room we were unable to open the windows Bathroom tiny but adequate with a fantastic shower Anyone of a larger build would struggle to move around in there I would suggest a taxi from the station or underground if you have any luggage as its approx a 7 10 minute walk and there are a few junctions to negotiate , Very friendly helpful staff Room was cleaned well Beautiful building in a quiet area of Paddington with good facilities nearby
2027,The Park Grand London Paddington, We couldn t see out of our window there wasn t much of a view , The room was very modern and clean Staff were also very friendly and made our stay extra special 
2028,The Park Grand London Paddington, Wifi is slow as it seems to be in most London hotels breakfast is buffet no a la carte available, Convenient location very clean and modern good coffee helpful staff

2030,The Park Grand London Paddington, Tiny rooms v small shower cramped space for suitcase, I expected a budget room to be small but this really was v small cramped Not enough space for suitcase shower area adequate Hidden wardrobe drop down desk useful Bed however very comfortable indeed Staff exceptionally helpful which made up for the minute sized room 
2031,The Park Grand London Paddington, More space Just my wife and I packed in room On website rooms appeared much more spacious Staff was nice but very difficult to communicate with , Rooms way to small bathrooms also small

2033,The Park Grand London Paddington, The restaurant is quite cramped and seemed to be a bit chaotic at breakfast I waited a long time for my pot of tea Then when I asked when it was coming I was given someone else s pot of tea whom had also been waiting for a long time ,No Positive
2034,The Park Grand London Paddington, Underfloor heating in bathroom was on even though there was a heat wave , A great hotel in a beautiful old terrace building We had a club room which was modern and spacious with large windows Bed was amazingly comfortable Walking distance to Paddngton Station and Heathrow Express 
2035,The Park Grand London Paddington, The mattress was a little crunchy , Very helpful and accomodating staff Lovely to have a valet to carry my bag to and from my room and get me a cab The concierge desk was very helpful Was given free breakfast each day after having to be moved to their sister hotel just a short distance down the street due to a broken boiler in my booked hotel 
2036,The Park Grand London Paddington, Rooms are a bit small with not much space to store clothes But the beds are big , Short walk from Kensington Gardens and Paddington Station Lots of coffee shops and restaurants in the vicinity Helpful friendly staff at reception Especially the lady from Armenia Was first put into a small rooftop room but then given a bigger room on lower floor with huge ceilings 
2037,The Park Grand London Paddington, This is a noisy overpriced hotel When I arrived they put me in a ground floor room next to the road really right next to it When I tried to go to sleep all I could hear were people outside and the television upstairs I requested a move and was given a new room Some where in the room was a boiler unit in the wall that would turn on every now and then and sound like a small jet engine In the morning I could here the person above me taking a shower and flushing the toilet ,No Positive
2038,The Park Grand London Paddington, Although it wasn t an issue for me as it wasn t vital there was no instruction to operate the TV and the provided Handy device , Good location within 10 minutes walk of Paddington Quiet location with great facilities and pleasant staff Easy access to travel points and only 5 minutes from Kensington Gardens 
2039,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, I booked a triple room The room is quiet large and has a balcony The location is really nice Near the paddinton station just about 5 minutes walk and hyde park The staff are very very friendly and they will try to meet all your need I order two room services and the food is really delicious breakfast is also very nice I will definitely choose this hotel again when I go to London next time 
2040,The Park Grand London Paddington, Nothing A nice hotel in a very convenient area with excellent staff , The friendliness of the staff was exceptional They wanted our visit to be the best and my daughter who was 6 months pregnant received special treatment Breakfast was very good 
2041,The Park Grand London Paddington, Very tiny space no room to walk at all Shower is super small I am tiny myself but I didn t have room to turn around , The bed is super comfortable I could close the curtains and make it very dark make tea in the morning in teapot there And of course it is very clean 
2042,The Park Grand London Paddington, The loo hadn t been cleaned and had been well used , A compact but well furnished room with a very comfortable bed good lights and an excellent shower 
2043,The Park Grand London Paddington, The room was a bit small but still very good for London standards I was at first disappointed that there was no proper shower it was the floor of the toilet bathroom which you don t expect from such a hotel but in the end it was ok and the water had good pressure , A nice hotel in a very convenient location Very clean People at reception and generally everyone I interacted with was super friendly and helpful which makes a difference I also appreciated the welcome plate of fruits as well as the handy phone that comes with the room Very convenient especially when your own phone is behaving weird in other countries All this made up for the price which I initally thought a bit too much and I still booked an offer that was supposed to be largely discounted 120 a night for a compact room If I paid the full amount I would think it is overpriced but I guess that s London in the summer 
2044,The Park Grand London Paddington, The design of the toilet bath area will get the whole floor to be wet Would be better if there is a segregation The tap of the basin seems to be old and it was very tight , The club room is comfortable for 2 Clean and bright The room seems to be newly furbished The toilet is spacious too 
2045,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, OMG What a tiny tiny room You could not walk around the bed without walking sideways No room for anything No barfridge Appalling really when they tout themselves as being boutique 
2046,The Park Grand London Paddington, Room was advertised as twin bed but was only 1 bed Not very appropriate as I was travelling with my mother 75yrs and had to share it No reception for my phone in the room,No Positive
2047,The Park Grand London Paddington, N A, The staff were friendly and polite The location was ideal for commuting in and out of the centre of London easily There were ample places to go for a meal within walking distance 
2048,The Park Grand London Paddington, we could not close the door to the main room door without having to lift our bed up and the bathroom was just a wet room that was so small it made the whole bathroom wet stright away, the hotel was close to the underground and some nice resturants
2049,The Park Grand London Paddington, The staff here are indifferent and the hotel didn t respond to communication in the lead up to my stay I arrived 4 hours prior to check in time and had emailed twice in the week leading up to staying to ask for an early check in even offering to pay for it after a 30 hour journey from Australia I didn t receive a response and my room was not ready until 2 hours after their advertised check in time I was offered a toilet off reception to use to change and told they would store my bags The toilet floor was covered in urine It was a disgusting and disappointing start to my trip that coloured my view of the hotel , The rooms have been renovated to look quite nice and are representative of the photos but they re not at all functional to stay in They ve placed extra furniture items in the room in an attempt to correct this but that just makes the spaces cluttered and not all of the additional items are functional either i e additional robe placed in dark entrance mostly filled up by the ironing board hard to see into damp smell emanating from it and makes accessing room awkward I ended up checking out after one night as I was there for 5 days and had work commitments so ease of use with the room was important to me 
2050,The Park Grand London Paddington, There was water dripping from the ceiling in the bathroom in the morning which I thought was odd There was also no plug near a mirror to do my hair , The room was huge and very quiet
2051,The Park Grand London Paddington, Seat cover in dining room badly ripped which detracted from the ambience a little , A mostly very young staff were very helpful and added to the stay 
2052,The Park Grand London Paddington, Very restricted in bathroom too small and did not like the overhead shower , Staff in Restaurant were very helpful at Breakfast with Gluten Free Diet Selection of food was very good 
2053,The Park Grand London Paddington, First night I was put in a basement room with no signal not ideal when you re trying to work in the evening They moved me for the 2nd night and the TV didn t work for the majority of the evening , Friendly staff and easy to walk to the tube clean rooms
2054,The Park Grand London Paddington, Shower screen could have been a little wider so less water splash but we sorted it very quickly as it was , We actually stayed at Grand Royal Hyde Park as there was a problem with the boiler at Paddington one To make up for transfer they gave us free drinks while we waited for the taxi they gave us and gave us free breakfasts at the Hyde Park It was a beautiful hotel ornate turned wood stained glass windows beautiful painted ceilings like being in Rome the staff were polite happy to help and give us information looked after our bag on checkout day until we left London at 7pm Breakfast was in a beautiful large room plentiful full cooked or continental fresh croissants anything you could possibly want The room was very comfortable complete with kettle and fridge and wardrobe View wasn t great overlooked an alley but it was light and quiet no street noise All manner of shops and cafes and the tube just around the corner And Hyde park 50 metres away I would definitely recommend this to others 
2055,The Park Grand London Paddington, Bathroom needed a bit of renovation, Paddington is a beautiful suburb and unbelievably quiet for London Rooms are a reasonable size for London and the window could actually be opened which makes a nice change Complimentary fruit water was also a nice touch Definitely would return to this hotel
2056,The Park Grand London Paddington, The bed was very uncomfortable and too small The room was smaller than expected and it was a luxury room , The location of the hotel was brilliant the area felt safe and there were shops and cafes with friendly staff Hyde Parks a stones throw away was perfect and a short power walk to Oxford Street instead of public transport The hotel was accessible friendly staff and had good amenities 
2057,The Park Grand London Paddington, Nothing Everything exceeded my expectations , Location of the propert was fantastic and near the tube stations Staff was fantastic and even the breakfast seemed over staffed Rooms are modern clean and even presented a complimentary coffee as we waited for our room Luxurious and well price for central London 
2058,The Park Grand London Paddington, I did not stay long enough to spot any flaws I thoroughly enjoyed the experience , very comfortable room and excellent staff They welcomed us at the hotel with smiles and upgraded our room to a club room for the night for no extra money we ordered room service and the food was absolutely amazing with no exceptions we had salad soup and two main courses all of which we couldnt finish because of the plentiful portions It was not expensive either I am definitely planning on staying at this hotel again or one of others in their chain of hotels Theres plenty of room to keep clothes in built in closets and the shower is great as well Overall an excellent and cozy experience 
2059,The Park Grand London Paddington, I stayed for 5 days in the hotel First of all the room was very small and not like in the picture very small Then the A C controller was not working in the room so each time I had to call the reception to change the temperature of the room And the door of my room was in the front of the lift and because it is very old lift there was noise from the lift They told me they will change the room but they didn t ,No Positive
2060,The Park Grand London Paddington, Room very small and air con didn t work but biggest problem was the position of the toilet as the wet room shower glass door was way too close to front of toilet so had to sit sideways and even then easy to hit your head when sitting standing, Modern room good location helpful staff 
2061,The Park Grand London Paddington, Our room was very small and in a basement That I did not expect The was no space to unpack things from suitcase Not much daylight no view , I am very fond of Bayswater location Breakfast was ok and serving and cleaning tables was quick 
2062,The Park Grand London Paddington, Room was tight bed was so close to wall you could not walk around it Made getting into bed a challenge for one partner , The hotel offered guest a cell wifi mobile app with map and gps 
2063,The Park Grand London Paddington, For the hold on my credit card they took a physical impression on carbon paper Can t prove this is related but that same evening I had a fraudulent charge on my card for 0 99 on iTunes The hotel was great but I don t think I will allow anyone to take an impression of my card again ,No Positive
2064,The Park Grand London Paddington, No fridge and only plug sockets were far away other than that the room was faultless , Everything had a nice feel to it The staff were friendly and were always smiling and laughing 
2065,The Park Grand London Paddington, Booked a Club room when we arrived the room was under the Main Street and didn t even have any windows Hardly 4 Star and what you expect from a Club Room then we asked to be moved in the second room we didn t receive the complimentary Dressing Gowns 2 Bottles of Wine or fruit platter that you were suppose to get with a Club Room Also when going to shower ready for the theatre at 1600 there was no hot water which meant us having to have a freezing cold shower The Club Room Bar they advertise is actually the only bar and the same as everyone else you just go through a different door to get to it with the label Club Lounge on it and we got charged for everything we had in there so don t see the point in having it or the difference in what you get for paying for a better room Tottlag a waste of good money spent , The Porter staff were very friendly the receptionists didn t seem to care 
2066,The Park Grand London Paddington, The hotel is fine and well run but the rooms are small But that is the luck of the draw , The Hotel is in walking distance from Paddington Station and so to Heathrow That s my reason for using this hotel 
2067,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, The hotel was perfect for a short stay in the heart of London very conveniently located for Paddington station and the Heathrow Express Highly recommended 
2068,The Park Grand London Paddington, paying at arrival cause when something goes wrong like there was no hot water next morning you cant just move somewhere else quickly , location is nice and surrounding is also pretty comfortable to find aynthing
2069,The Park Grand London Paddington, There was no hot water the day we checked out ended up travelling without a proper bath shave and while checking out not a word of apology either, The property is conveniently located near Paddington station It was very easy to get to the airport by Heathrow express 
2070,The Park Grand London Paddington, Having to share a double bed instead of twin as advertised, When we arrived at the hotel we were told that there were problems with the boiler so we would have to stay in another hotel of the chain London Grand Paddington Court We were offered a complimentary breakfast for noth days The following review is of the hotel where we ended up staying which was the London Grand Paddington Court Instead of the twin beds our room had a double Everything else was as advertised good shower tea and coffee ironing facilites We did enjoy our stay but having to share a bed was an inconvience The breakfast was delicious 
2071,The Park Grand London Paddington, Our room was far too small and with hindsight we should have asked to be moved One had to negotiate around the bed with hardly any wardrobe space and certainly nowhere one would want to sit comfortably , Really good location Very friendly staff and very helpful We were meeting our son whose birthday it had been recently and we wanted to surprise him with a cake and candles We asked if we could do this in the hotel bar and they not only agreed but also whisked the cake away lit the candles and brought it out to surprise him once we were seated in the bar Excellent 
2072,The Park Grand London Paddington, I didn t like the restaurant which was effectively the bar There was a single member of staff who had to do everything run the bar take food orders clear tables and take payments The food was just ok It wasn t a great experience , The location was great being close to Paddington station The rooms are really nice and very comfortable 
2073,The Park Grand London Paddington, Shabby room facilities Poor wifi Poor TV options terrible interface and charging for movies Poor shower no screen no hands free attachment to wall bits falling off not very nice shampoo shower gel Long hallways with sloping floors Not very clever use of space awkward placement of wardrobe and desk May have been fine 10 years ago but not when compared to modern hotels who offer much more comfort for less or equal price , Convenient location and friendly staff
2074,The Park Grand London Paddington, The rooms were well appointed however somewhat small for two friends Perhaps with a partner they would have been alright We stayed in a Club room , Breakfast was delicious The staff were so attentive to our needs The heated floor was divine

2076,The Park Grand London Paddington, The room was too hot and noisy We could not get the temperature down The carpets in the corridors were old giving a bad first impression The shower very small not normal for this price The bar was more like a waiting room , The location close to Paddington
2077,The Park Grand London Paddington, Not electricity in room after card was put into place Fortunately arrived late and left early but struggled the next day to get to work with low battery life , Bed was comfortable 
2078,The Park Grand London Paddington, they dont have separate bed base for twin room but mattress are separate shower is small and i can hear upper room shower, the bed is comfurtable room is quite large compared to other hotels location is amazing between paddington hyde park and queensway
2079,The Park Grand London Paddington, Nothing, The room had a fridge which is so handy with a nice bottle of cold water waiting for me when I arrived Also a plate of fruit was delivered to my room before I had even got there Left luggage was also available which is so handy There is a free mobile phone in the room where you can browse the internet and make free calls from I think its called IHandy Staff were courteous and helpful Great location 10 min walk to Paddington Station and about half an hour to Oxford St Will be using this hotel again Customer satisfaction stands out as a priority in this hotel 
2080,The Park Grand London Paddington, Don t be deceived by the pictures of the bedrooms Booked a Double Delux Room but when we got to the room it now seems we actually had a Compact Double Room though reception confirmed we had a Delux after we complained about the room size however now re looking at photos of a Compact Double Room that is what we had Very small double single bed with no real cupboard space enough for 2 shirts on either side of the bed some drawer space no room to put anything even your suitcase Bathroom was a wet room Did not pay for expensive breakfast and instead had breakfast on the way out in a cheaper cafe which are close by , It was clean and staff were friendly and very central Nice to have complimentary fruit and water in the room no wine as someone else mentioned 
2081,The Park Grand London Paddington, I could not easily control the temperature in the room Instructions on the wall would help , The bed is the best I have ever slept on The buffet breakfast was very accommodating tasty and value for money 
2082,The Park Grand London Paddington, The shower had limescale on the floor the bed was dirty initially and room furniture was a little tattered but was all rectified when I was moved rooms twice, The staff were very helpful The room was big and English breakfast was lovely
2083,The Park Grand London Paddington, Reading lights over the bed should be individual Impossible for one person to read without lighting up the whole room Safe difficult to set and in strange position Hairdryer difficult to use because of position inside a wardrobe , Size of room and bathroom Staff porters excellent Kettle 
2084,The Park Grand London Paddington, Avoid basement rooms No windows We had for one night and staff offered us room change to upper floors for remaining three days when we requested , Great location Walking distance from Paddington Station and lots of dining options nearby Safe and secure area Few mins walk to Hop on Hop off busses Hyde Park is 15 mins walk away Staff were all helpful

2088,The Park Grand London Paddington, Bed was a bit small and air conditioning had a noise problem at some point was fixed quickly but recurred a few times, Good value and central location
2089,The Park Grand London Paddington, Cleanliness Awful There were two pair of dirty underwear behind a desk chair Obviously housekeeping dies the bare minimum I was revolted Bed No mattress pad Gross Itchy sheets Because of my discovery of the underwear when I moved the chair to the desk I was obviously creepiest out fir the rest if my stay Staff Unfriendly and unhelpful , Location to train station

2092,The Park Grand London Paddington, Nothing, Quiet location very close to Paddington station and Hyde Park Our room was comfortable and had tea coffee making facilities Staff were helpful I would stay here again 
2093,The Park Grand London Paddington, We booked a trip with 2 rooms and in one room children of 16 and 14 however when we arrived they were given a double bed when I asked for a twin room as the boys didnt want to share a bed we had to pay a considerable amount extra for the twin room which we should have been told upon booking , The hotel was well situated for a visit to the center of London and was very comfortable I believe the hotel has had a refurb because the rooms are somewhat like a spaceship with wooden panels hiding the walls but it Works The staff were friendly Its a hotel for visitng a city where the room is to relax and sleep but the hotel offers little else other than a coffee and thats what we wanted 
2094,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, Our room was clean cosy and quiet excellent powerful shower and added bonus of under floor heating The breakfast buffet was amazing very polite and helpful staff We will definitely be returning on our next visit

2096,The Park Grand London Paddington, This hotel needs maintenance or may be even renovation Bad hygiene I have never seen a four star hotel with a dirty lift elevator before Rubbish litter thrown in the left no body would bother to clean it Dirty bed sheets cannot be justified no matter how nice the staff were , The staff tried to help not necessarily that they succeeded in that Stay here only if you were desperate for a room in London More like for a bed only Good for an urgent stay

2099,The Park Grand London Paddington, Room had been made smaller what it should havebin Not enough room for clothes No bedside cabinets not much room to pass at the bottom of bed Not very good for 4 star, Location was good
2100,The Park Grand London Paddington, The bathroom I didn t so much mind its smallness since I was travelling alone but what I resented was the fact that as soon as you ran water for a shower the bathroom turned into a swimming pool , The bed was good Heating and or air conditioning were easy to use 
2101,The Park Grand London Paddington, The ventilation system worked throughout the night and was very loud even after turning the controller off Didn t get much sleep as a result , The staff was excellent and very friendly 
2102,The Park Grand London Paddington, On arrival at Paddington Hotel we were told that there was no hot water and that we were being transferred to another sister hotel The Hotel was the same and was a nice hotel however as we had chosen the hotel due to its close location for all our planned activities being transferred to earls court south kensington was very inconvienient and distrupted our plans to the point that we were unable to make several visits that we had planned as we were unable to walk to the locations we had booked and had to spend extra monies and time using the tube taxis We received a voice mail from the hotel in the morning advising us of this fact but as we had already left for London we did not receive it ,No Positive

2122,The Park Grand London Paddington, The mirror arrangements in the room were awkward to use for my wife The room One of the hidden wardrobes could have had shelves in it for extra storage The lack of double glazing meant we had to use the supplementary heater each evening Only one comfy chair made TV watching awkward and difficult We did not take breakfast as we considered the room rate should have been inclusive of b fast , We liked the space in the room and the bed was comfortable The welcome pack and instructions could be more prominent and make clear whether the wine and water was complimentary or not As we weren t sure we avoided using it

2194,The Park Grand London Paddington, I booked a deluxe double room there was nothing deluxe about it The room was tiny Literally the smallest box room I have ever stayed in The bathroom towels were dirty and we had to request new ones be provided The shower curtain did nothing to prevent the water covering the entire bathroom floor Which meant there was nowhere to then stand at the sink without getting wet There were no plugs near mirrors which made getting ready difficult I resorted to using the TV to see my reflection as I blow dryed my hair The room quickly got condensation due to it being so small however no windows could be opened Altogether an awful experience and I will not be staying there again The pictures were completely disieving and the cost was ridiculous based on what we actually got Very very disappointing , 10instead walk to Paddington station therefore good access to all tubest etc

2231,The Park Grand London Paddington, The only thing I d say that could have been slightly better was the friendliness of the hotel staff they were OK but maybe need a bit more chat to there customers Also as I am a genius booking com member I had free late check out but I wasn t able to find out whether I could have this or not until the morning we were leaving which left us a bit uncertain with our day plans , I stayed here with my other half for one night in December I put down a special request on my booking as we were celebrating our one year anniversary we arrived slightly early at the hotel at 13 30 but check in was 14 00 unfortunately the room wasn t ready yet but they held our bags for us and we went out As planned and checked in a bit later on Once we arrived in our room later on it was beautifully decorated with 2 Swan Towel s on the bed with real roses all round the bed Little things like this go a very long way so thank you very much 
2232,The Park Grand London Paddington, Our double bed was two twins pushed together and I kept falling into the gap Bathroom was a wet room door kept catching on the shower rail door was damaged due to the damp nowhere to put toiletries or toothbrushes loo roll almost on the floor so got damp room was dark small had no mirror furniture was a bit worn looking I prepaid for our room 5 months ago on an old bank card when we arrived at the hotel they wanted a copy of the card I paid on I no longer had this The staff member insisted that I paid again on a bank card that I had on me and that she would refund the original amount paid onto the old card I was very annoyed about this as there was no mention of having to bring the card I paid on After paying again on my only debit card it left me 150 short for my husband s birthday weekend refund will take 4 working days I had prepaid so far in advance so that I could forget about it and splash out a bit whilst in london My husband and I very rarely get a weekend without our children or the money to enjoy ourselves so this dampened the Weekend for us , Location was great only a 20 minute walk from Oxford street The breakfast was good The reception was welcoming
2233,The Park Grand London Paddington, No satelite tv No parking at the hotel closest parking was 5 10 minute walk away in a pay display carpark, Shower was very spacious Breakfast was good Plenty of free hot drinks in your room Was located close to hyde park 10minute walk away
2234,The Park Grand London Paddington, I made the booking on behalf of my 18 year old son I am concerned that having booked in advance and paid in full for the room on my visa debit card at check in my son was asked to re pay on his card and that I was to be refunded This practice is unacceptable as it is only by chance that my son has a card and also as a student there was enough money in his account to pay for the room Having to make this unexpected payment caused limitations and cash flow issues for my son I had purposefully booked and paid in advance to avoid any complications In my mind there was to be nothing for my son to do except check in and enjoy his room prior to handing to Heathrow airport the following morning Please advise why this occurred and why this process is employed The reimbursement of my original payment is exceedingly slow It should be instant as monies being held for a period of time from both my son and myself is inadmissible Helen Jackson,No Positive

2264,The Park Grand London Paddington, Rooms were uncomfortable not properly cleaned very little space for clothing no shower curtain in bathroom so the entire floor got wet , Convenient location to Paddington Station
2265,The Park Grand London Paddington, My only small issue was I thought room service could go on a little later as it s a chain hotel but not a huge deal, Excellent location Easy walk from Paddington Station even with bags Quiet for central London Staff particulary friendly and helpful I had a free upgrade to a junior suite which was very spacious and comfy

2272,The Park Grand London Paddington, I had a bad experience with this hotel During check in the woman in front desk told me that they have problem in water heating system and they cannot accommodate me in this hotel due to this reason and they booked other hotel for me I felt uncomfortable by this offer since the second hotel was far away around 2 miles and the hotel was full of guests and no one of them was talking about heating system So I decided to to turn the table against them so I request from woman in front desk to show me the room For testing the water heating system by my self Suddenly her supervisor came I forget to take her name and it became clear that they have overbooking in this hotel It clearly proven they try to handel this problem by laying to the guests During that an European guest came for check in and the process for check in goes smothly I start shotting to the hotel staff by saying this hotel treat guests beased on nationality What a shame So the decided to give my room which was non refundable but they give me a very bad room with bad location Later they change the room I will never book again in this hotel ,No Positive

2275,The Park Grand London Paddington, The hotel reserves the fee of your first night from your account but doesn t use that money when you pay for the room so you have an additional amount of money out of your account which isn t helpful when you want to use it for spending money You then have to wait for your bank to refund the money to use again so make sure your account has enough in it , The room was a good size and the location was central but quiet The staff were very friendly and welcoming and let us borrow an umbrella when the rain was really bad

2279,The Park Grand London Paddington, Room was far too small window was so cold and drafty that we were all awake most of the night I ve never complained about a hotel before but it was awful The only place the cot would fit was in the window and the baby was genuinely freezing cold We had another young child so couldn t move rooms in the middle of the night Consequently we all had no sleep It really wasn t acceptable The room was too small really drafty and the curtains didn t actually meet so the youngest child was up at the crack of dawn too Really marred our holiday Hotel offered 50 back on the room but this really wasn t enough based on such a terrible night Such a shame because this place could be really great , Spotless hotel modern features great extras in the room dressing gowns wine bath products fresh fruit and a lovely breakfast 
2280,The Park Grand London Paddington, See above, Bed was wonderful breakfast eggs were a watery disaster the shower in the deluxe double was a drain in the floor shared with the loo the bathroom tile grout needed serious scrubbing gross and when I needed change for a smaller money denomination was told that was not possible by a blonde trainee But very quiet room with great view and close to Paddington and Harrods also the rest of the in house staff went the extra mile

2304,The Park Grand London Paddington, What s with the breakfast confusion Can t British hoteliers just run a restaurant if they want to charge for breakfasts It was one price if booked the day before A higher price that morning Oops you re not on the list blah blah blah North American hotels have no problems dealing with this Put it on your room or pay on the spot No dual pricing So easy Please break the UK mode and make it easy , Reasonably close to Paddington Station so you can take the Heathrow Express Train and walk Good continental breakfast once you got past the convoluted sign up process and pricing

2314,The Park Grand London Paddington, Size of the bedrooms were small Had to phone each time for a ironing board Breakfast was mediocre No comfort in the bar Each time upstairs flushed the toilet or had a shower you could hear the water flushing down the pipes in our bathroom , The staff were friendly The day are holiday ended 
2315,The Park Grand London Paddington, deluxe double room significantly smaller than advertised Just a bed with a small ring of floor space around it closet and desk folded off the wall hotel also offers a compact double room that is not that different would only book deluxe double if you are a solo traveller Bathroom so small that there was a tiny drain in the center of it without separate shower so the bathroom got completely soaked with every shower , Room clean modern and made decent use of small space
2316,The Park Grand London Paddington, It wasn t mentioned that the room was a basement room and it was very different from the photographs on booking com The room was extremely dusty and we ended up constantly sneezing whilst in the room After we changed rooms we found the hairdryer not working It took a long time to deal with this in the evening The showers were weak in both rooms One day the keycard for our room stopped working and we had to get it changed Overall too many problems , Good location 
2317,The Park Grand London Paddington, The automated room was a bit hard to understand for non frequent travellers Staff should try to explain system or ask if the guest is familiar Was moved from one hotel to a sister hotel and offered free breakfast in recompense But no one told the sister hotel and no one told me how I could go about getting it , The bathroom was very nice and rain shower was great to have Staff was friendly and courteous but more knowledge about places to eat or see around the hotel would be nice 
2318,The Park Grand London Paddington, Deluxe double was tiny My partner is 6ft and hanging off the bed We were next to an elevator so loud noises all night Shower was dirty had mould all over it and no pressure TV was on a weird angle so you couldn t see it properly If u have big suit cases very crowded and pillows and bed were uncomfortable But saying that we spent hardly anytime in the room so location was great for us , Good location for us Quiet street very Nice area Right near Kensington gardens which means u can walk straight through to Hyde park and get to Harrods ect Also walking distance to 2 tubes which was handy And they give u a mobile so u can use to find ur way around London which was very handy it was quite slow and frustrating at times but still a really nice touch that I haven t had before 
2319,The Park Grand London Paddington, Very poor value for money Very poor room despite it being what was classed as a deluxe Bed against window so had to scramble down the bed to get out Very disappointed and first time I ve had a poor hotel from Booking com, The staff were friendly 
2320,The Park Grand London Paddington, The breakfast Bleak and poor for that price Even the pictures of it were faded and didn t give you a good impression of what was offered Should have been included in the price of the room if that is all they can serve , The welcoming atmosphere the friendly straff that made us feel special They even surprised us with a nice handwritten birthdaycard cake and fruit on my daughter s birthday A hotel worth four stars with a great and quiet location close to Kensington park and Paddington station 
2321,The Park Grand London Paddington, The room was very noisy we could hear a fan of some sort outside the bedroom which came on periodically and was very loud Every time someone in a room next door above or close to us flushed the loo or had a shower we could hear the water running through the bathrooms open drain The room was very small only one arm chair so when we had room service in the evening one of us had to sit on the bed to eat There is only enough wardrobe space for about 5 things to hang in When I asked why I hadn t got any complementary water I was told it was because I booked through you I made a fuss and did get it in the end but I felt like a cheap skate even though it cost me over 350 for the two nights , The food was excellent
2322,The Park Grand London Paddington, Room was tiny and dark I got moved around to a different property one block away because Park Grand had hot water issues Then when I checked into the second location they moved me across the street to a hard location Too much money for such a small room , Staff were helpful and patient Room was quiet and clean 
2323,The Park Grand London Paddington, The main mattress for the bed is too soft Feel painful for the back after sleep overnight The mattress for the sofa bed is too weak I still can feel the springs They can be good if you can choose the medium firm mattresses , The location is excellent Close to so many underground stations such as Paddington Lancaster Gate central red line Bayswater dark blue line Queensway red line Also close to the Kensington Garden 
2324,The Park Grand London Paddington, Due to it s location its decor the the lounge bar area was not very comfortable to sit relax in It was the walkpath to go to all the rooms , The staff were extremely professional friendly helpful The mobile phone hotel property that was given to guests during their stay was very useful Small touches like having a basket of apples a box of tissues at reception gave a welcoming feel Also the extra amenities that were provided in the room upon arrival were appreciated 
2325,The Park Grand London Paddington, Room was too small for 2 people A double bed with 2 mattresses does not pass as a twin Overpaid for what I got , Staff were friendly and efficient Room was clean Nearby facilities were reasonable 
2326,The Park Grand London Paddington, The double room was so small there was no room to store bags Two people were unable to dress at the same time The walk in wet room was so small that when you turned on the shower it would completely soak the whole bathroom so no one else was able to use Friends staying in a suit were meant to of received complimentary soft drinks fruit and dressing gowns which were not provided The gym smelt as if it was being used as a smoking room Very disappointed in what appeared to be a lovely hotel with reasonable star rating , The only plus was the location being fairly central 
2327,The Park Grand London Paddington, The shower water is hard I couldn t get the soapy feeling off even after washing for a while Also on arrival at the airport I called the the telephone given to me at booking which took so long to answer I also found the direction address given to me unhelpful In fact a lady on the line directed me to apparently another branch of the hotel that the one I booked for was under renovation I turned up at the place I booked and found no renovation going on and busy and I got the room I booked for Perhaps it was a mixup , The breakfast was good The bed is firm just as I liked The environment is quite and just a short distance from good restaurants and the underground and train station 
2328,The Park Grand London Paddington, The bathroom was not only small but the shower and toilet seem to be in the same position On showering there was water flooding the whole bathroom area The bathroom tiles were poorly put together with the grating sealant coming off quite easily It was just awful I will not book this hotel ever again in this Paddington area of London , The bed and carpet were most comfortable 
2329,The Park Grand London Paddington, Everything else you don t expect big and lavish rooms while staying in Central London however a room which has just 18 inches of space around the bed Washroom was also a disaster 140 plus per night is deserves more , Location is good walking distance from Paddington station
2330,The Park Grand London Paddington, One of us mobility impaired wish it were a little closer to Underground station, Close to restaurants and shopping for travel needs A bit of a walk from Paddington so took a short taxi ride with the bags Quiet nice breakfast and very friendly staff 
2331,The Park Grand London Paddington, the bathroom wasn t really hotel standard No counters to do makeup or blow dry hair The room was too close to the stuff pantry noisy all through the night Hotel stuff didn t bother to replenish towels or make beds properly Carpet in the room was dirty from the day we checked in, The bed was comfy and the use of hotel was a lovely touch for first timers in London Staff at the reception very friendly and helpful 
2332,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, Hotel that I originally booked had a problem with the room so they asked if I would mind being upgraded and transferred to another one of their group hotels I agreed and they provided free transportation refreshments in the bar whilst waiting and a great new location Will stay there again 
2333,The Park Grand London Paddington, We arrived in the early hours to check in after paying a taxi to take us to front door we were asked to walk to their sister hotel down the street where they then tried to check us in again and charge us again Then headed down to our room where the key card didn t work so headed back to reception they then came down with us and it still didn t work so told us to wait at the room They then returned and manually opened our door and said it couldn t be fixed until the next day It then soon dawned on us that we wouldn t be able to go for breakfast as we wouldn t be able to get back in our room The bed clearly hadn t been changed as there were other peoples hairs in the sheets and pillows my bedside table also had what I can only describe as orange zest all over it This was at 02 30 am so we decided to grin and bare as we were shattered Then the morning came our wake up call of a fire alarm at 09 00 wasn t exactly pleasant followed by the cleaners ringing the door bell several times and getting us out of bed even though we had until 12 00 to check out We left and couldn t get out fast enough after a very bad experience we found ourselves on a street we hadn t planned to be on with no idea which way to head hopefully we wont stumble across this hotel again It really was a shame as it looked as if the place was actually run by someone who cares it could have been lovely But at the tune of 173 00 for less than 10 hours we wont ever be going back , The room did look that when built was a high standard 
2334,The Park Grand London Paddington, The hotel operators are cheats liars and thieves I booked a Double and even after calling them on the night of my check in to say that I was checking in late there was NO room for me when I showed up at midnight There was also a family with a toddler asleep on the couch in their lobby who had experienced the same thing They moved me down the street into a SINGLE and then were totally unreasonable about offering me a discounted rate refund on the lousy room BOOO Don t just walk run away from these crooks ,No Positive
2335,The Park Grand London Paddington, Room a bit small , Our room was much more stylish than most hotels in the Paddington area We were moved from a hotel down the street because of problems with the hot water but the alternative was great The staff at the hotel was amazing and we really felt welcome and we would definitely recommend a stay here 
2336,The Park Grand London Paddington, The room had a terrible view of a scruffy building and the windows were disgusting Lack of parking and staff said it would be OK to park where we did Ended up with a parking fine Ruined a birthday suprise I had planned for months for my partner Wouldn t stay again , The bed was so comfortable Thumbs up 
2337,The Park Grand London Paddington, Fairly newly renovated looks great but bathroom plumbing isn t The space is small and okay if you re travelling solo , Highly attentive and polite service without being intrusive This hotel is one of three in the collection all within a five minute walk of each other and Paddington station 
2338,The Park Grand London Paddington, We were not give the size of room we paid for first night we had to complained Web mentions complimentary fresh fruit and water in rooms this did not happen Wardrobe space nonexistence even for one person let alone a couple The rooms were too compact Wash area needs care and attending to seals around basins and tiles, some of the staff were very friendly and helpful Breakfast was very good
2339,The Park Grand London Paddington, Delayed checking despite not arriving till 7pm 3 bed was child size and like a camp bed towels for 3 provided but not cups glasses toiletries they were all for 2 Breakfast time was crowded in a small area meaning staff could not keep up with demand despite their best efforts No where near a 4 star more like 2 We don t understand how the AA rated as a 4 star Definitely not worth the discounted cost, The staff are all the property has going for it 
2340,The Park Grand London Paddington, Small room at basement floor, Great location as in Paddington Super staff Offer bigger room at high floor since second day Value for money when cinder London 
2341,The Park Grand London Paddington, Room very small but spotlessly clean , The room was spotless but very small I would have liked it to be a larger room for the rate The Hilton up the road was a similar rate for a much larger room The staff were vet friendly and helpful 
2342,The Park Grand London Paddington, no refrigerator in the room you can ask the staff to put your food in the kitchen refrigerator Very small room I think the bedsheets were not changed everyday, close to underground station staff was nice and helpful free printing which was useful free wifi free 3G phone in room you can use Google maps

2345,The Park Grand London Paddington, Would like to have had a bit longer for check out but this didn t really cause us too much of a problem , The location for us could not have been any better the breakfast and staff were also excellent Complimentary wine was perfect after a very hard day 
2346,The Park Grand London Paddington, The chairs in the breakfast room had no padding Towels need to be bigger as I m a average sized person and they didn t go around me , Staff were friendly and helpful Liked the iPhone for use in the room 
2347,The Park Grand London Paddington, The room we have been given was not as I saw in the picture at and the bed was too small and the room was too small No places to hang my clothes, The location

2349,The Park Grand London Paddington, we booked twin room but when we arrived they gave us double rooom Anyway the other day they offered me the Twin room , The hotel has air conditioner in all the rooms and the rooms were clean and tidy everyday The stuff were really nice And the location wasnt that far
2350,The Park Grand London Paddington, Breakfast wasn t great our hotel had maintenance probs taken to Hyde Park grand hotel instead room was okay some parts a bit tired looking had discount online nights stay would have been a little disappointed if paid full price, Staff were very nice and hotel close to station
2351,The Park Grand London Paddington, When we checked in at the given time of 2pm our room was unavailable and would be told we would have to wait in another smaller room for 1 hour 3 hours later our room was still unavailable Due to having plans my husband 20 year old daughter and I had to get ready and prepared for our night out in a very small room We then had to leave our belongings with the staff who said they would put our things in our room when it was available Fair enough our belongings were in our booked room when we returned to the hotel 4 hours later however we found this very unsettling There was no sofa double bed pull out in the room like there was shown in photos there was a tiny bed set up with a very thin mattress which my daughter said was uncomfortable , the room was clean and comfortable Also the free english breakfast was lovely Location was great 10 minute walk from underground station 
2352,The Park Grand London Paddington, A single room allocated on first night for two persons was not acceptable The price of breakfast was too high as we did not have the cooked meal , A quiet location 
2353,The Park Grand London Paddington, Not the hotel I booked room too small to swing a cat in inflexible cancellation policies, Clean relatively comfortable breakfast fine close to station
2354,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, Hi room was quite small plus we weren t offered a room to have a relaxing bath in It was advertised as a deluxe room what on earth they mean by that i don t know

2359,The Park Grand London Paddington, Small bed rooms some in basement with no views like a dungeon could only hang 4 items of clothing up in cupboard Very crushed dining room no room between tables , Location of hotel
2360,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, Enjoyed our stay here it was nice and clean the staff were very friendly Great hospitality would definitely recommend this to family and friends The location is great too easy to get around to other tourist attractions parks shopping places 
2361,The Park Grand London Paddington, More than 450 yards from tube station and my partner struggled to walk Bed up against window Couldn t get cold water from tap , Adequate for our needs Breakfast was good 
2362,The Park Grand London Paddington, Wet room bathroom meant whole floor would be wet after a shower personally prefer a separate shower otherwise great , Very clean and tidy modern room bed was comfortable staff were friendly great location under 10 minute walk to Paddington station first time to London and would return to this hotel 
2363,The Park Grand London Paddington, One of the two matress was very soft Maybe the variety of breakfast is a bit short for a stay longer than a week , Club room type was really nice Thanks to the staff for upgrading our booking after no room available of our own pick at our arrival Really quiet area Two different Tube stations to choose from at a 5 7min walk distance Friendly and helpful staff 
2364,The Park Grand London Paddington, Eventually when I returned there was only one room left Probably the worst in the hotel Some staff were poorly trained gave misinformation , The hotel overbooked tried to palm me off to an inferior hotel This wasted 2 hours of my time which caused me to change my dinner plans Not a good start 
2365,The Park Grand London Paddington, The small bed, The hotel is very clean The double bed was very small It is a bad and a half in a double luxury room Room had micro fridge and tea coffe but it is a very small room
2366,The Park Grand London Paddington, There was no iron or ironing board available within the room which is only a minor complaint , Situation of hotel was in a quiet area Location was not the closest to Paddington Station for Heathrow Express but it was still within reasonable walking distance The staff in the lobby were excellent and very customer oriented 
2367,The Park Grand London Paddington, The air conditioning in the room did not work well , The staff were excellent particularly the Night Manager who handled a breakdown in our bathroom really well in the end relocating us to a different hotel with the same chain and providing complimentary airport transfers Very pleased with the service 
2368,The Park Grand London Paddington, One Bed was broken room 801 triple room Breakfast was average everyday is the same breakfast The toilet location is very bad no space for the other leg, Acceptable room
2369,The Park Grand London Paddington, Wish we could have stayed a bit longer , During a rare London Heat Wave in July the air conditioning EXCEPTIONALLY good Newly renovated rooms with spa bathrooms Breakfast was the best offering we had 
2370,The Park Grand London Paddington, The mattress could have been better didn t have a good night sleep , I had a very good stay here with my young children we had a lovely good sized room not small staff are very friendly Would recommend this hotel to families 
2371,The Park Grand London Paddington, The Club Room was located in the basement with virtually no natural light The cafe restaurant was right next door to the room with grease odours permeating throughout the room The tiny room was decorated in dark stained chipboard and it looked as if it hadn t been decorated in years The room they moved us to the next day was better only as it was lighter Don t believe the pictures on the website The staff were clearly not trained in basic customer service as they had little knowledge of solving even the basic of issues and found it difficult to hide their annoyance when I had the ordacity to complain , The Italian restaurant up the street from the hotel which we had to use as the hotel restaurant bar and room service all closed by the time we checked in at 10 30 
2372,The Park Grand London Paddington, Not unusual in London some rooms are small we upgraded to a bigger room for not much more money all the rooms look very newly refurbished and very well fitted out , I can recommend this hotel friendly staff comfortable beds and a nicer location in a very quiet area lots nice restaurants nearby close to Lancaster gate tube station or Paddington station where the Heathrow express arrives bike hire outside you can ride around Hyde Park the hop on hop off bus passes nearby which we found a great way to get around the breakfast was exceptionally good
2373,The Park Grand London Paddington, The room was great for a solo traveller however space and wardrobe would have been a challenge for 2 of us especially if you needed to hang formal clothes The rainhead shower was awesome and the hand held option good If I had a full head of hair maybe a challenge if not wishing to wash it The UNenclosed shower great if you do not need to use the toilet or brush your teeth after in socks as the floor gets wet Again if 2 sharing would need back up of floor mats slippers etc , Overall staff were excellent Quality of food was superior to most hotel restaurants with good price points Wraps etc freshly prepared so able to accommodate changes Room service curry very good Handy phone was an unexpected bonus as it included free calls to the USA allowing me to resolve issues with AT T not properly applying international adjustments Room had excellent soundproofing and air conditioning especially in this heat wave Bed very comfortable and bedding great Reception staff very helpful graciously coordinated an early check in Shower was awesome with superb water pressure and nice no water shortage compared to US so no need to recycle towels etc House keeping did a great job too The door staff could not do enough to assist guests very attentive and friendly 
2374,The Park Grand London Paddington, Sofa bed uncomfortable Very unhelpful concierge refused to allow customers to contact alternative staff who could make decisions, Good location Good price Friendly check in staff
2375,The Park Grand London Paddington, After hauling 4 suitcases across London we were informed there was a boiler problem and we had to be moved After my initial reservations the sister hotel just around the corner exceeded our expectations The staff are truly amazing and went out of their way to ensure a great stay, Location was really close to train station and tube good restaurants nearby Staff are fabulous
2376,The Park Grand London Paddington, Hotel was just a bit quiet for what we had wanted Ideally it would have had more of an atmosphere around the bar or something in the evenings , The hotel offered a free smartphone in every room that you could take out around the city Ideal for looking up places to eat find your way on google maps or call to make a reservation 
2377,The Park Grand London Paddington, Bathroom sink backed up when very little water was run Black mold on shower floor floor draining shower Rooms a little cramped for space Travelling with 5 people could have used more help with luggage on arrival , Good location Restaurant a little cramped 
2378,The Park Grand London Paddington, The meat in the breakfast was pork so we couldn t eat it during our whole stay since we are muslims , The staff was so helpful and they allowed us to early check in

2380,The Park Grand London Paddington, The facilities are not that much there is no refrigerator or iron I reserve a room with 2 single beds but there are no rooms with single beds in the hotel , Very friendly and helpful staff The area is so quite The room was well air conditioning The location is not so far from the center
2381,The Park Grand London Paddington, On arrival we were given a basement room where there was no mobile phone reception and wifi also poor because it was underground and attitude of reception staff was v rood and not helpfull at all despite I was with family no adjoining rooms were not allocated even after the request reception staff flatly refused and they always refers to talk to booking com However we were given 2 rooms on second day due to pressure Most dissapointing part was the attitude of staff male and female both were rood Sujith, Location breakfast 
2382,The Park Grand London Paddington, Small room bathroom spaces, In love with the way staff treat me food is very tasty and wide variety for a breakfast Room is always being cleaned Good internet service on higher floors 
2383,The Park Grand London Paddington, The underfloor heating in the bathroom was a bit hot but better than none There was only 1 bedside table , We had a basement room which seemed a bit strange at first but it was SO QUIET and that allowed us to rest 
2384,The Park Grand London Paddington, I think some bedrooms are quiet small but if only stay for one or two days is OK , The air condition is very good Clean and tidy room The staff are friendly and helpful Lots of Italian restaurants around and I found 3 local shops nearby 
2385,The Park Grand London Paddington, Felt the staff could be friendlier accent was hard to understand hotel is a little tatty and our deluxe double was tiny no wardrobe space except to hang 3 shirts nothing for dresses etc also was my birthday and my boyfriend proposed staff had been informed and nothing was supplied as a congratulations , The bed was very comfortable no noise and a short walk to the tube shower was lovely and powerful 
2386,The Park Grand London Paddington, The fact that I wanted to extend the stay which they were unable to do where as when I rang them before leaving I was told I could So then I had no choice but to pay extra I felt the staff was useless , I liked the area and location I was in
2387,The Park Grand London Paddington, The staff at the bar was not really qualified WE ordered a bottle of Prosecco but instead of pouring the first glass as one would expect the just left informing us 10 minutes later that WE would need to pay as they are closing We got a room in the basement which is considering the price I would have liked to know prior to my stay ,No Positive
2388,The Park Grand London Paddington, Not sure it was the problem of the hotel or booking com The triple room I booked was canceled due to inefficient credit card I provided However the card is totally fine when I checked in to the hotel This cost a great trouble during our first night in the hotel , The English breakfast is good and the Junior suite is quite big and on the upper floor My parents and I had a really great time in London 
2389,The Park Grand London Paddington, As mentioned staff have no authority to help the guest always they have to back the main office, 3 times I have problem one time gave room in basement then transfer me to anthor hotel one they cancel my booking before 18 then transfer another hotel one tome we spent full night without ac ang evening team can not do any thing staff nice but no authority every thing the have to back to central
2390,The Park Grand London Paddington, they gave us a room in the basement then when we wanted to change we had to wait more than one hour we were there at 8 pm don t know they did this because was a late arrival But it was a very bad beginning and not easy to get over because the second room provided had a window over a climatisation area and was very noisy 24 hour , very close to tube this was practical 
2391,The Park Grand London Paddington, The first girl on reception was a bit over the top the rest of the staff were lovely I was over charged for two extra nights I just emailed hoping to get a refund, Value for money
2392,The Park Grand London Paddington, First room 802 was under the dining room and was extremely noisy scrapping of chairs on the floors woke Up by the noise Did complain and the staff who were very very helpful moved us to a room that was smaller but quieter so we had a very nice sleep, Breakfast was lovely xxxxxx
2393,The Park Grand London Paddington, The gym is in the basement floor at the end of a long corridor Not so encouraging to use because of its location , Excellent location and friendly staff 
2394,The Park Grand London Paddington, Bedroom was like a walk in wardrobe Staff had very limited English Wasn t asked if I slept well on either nights Room had a loud running water noise all night Premier inn hotels are x20s better, Nothing much likeable about this place
2395,The Park Grand London Paddington, the room was at the back of the hotel and the window was looking at another guests window poor light ng was coming through it was like a dungeon , the bathroom was quite big location was very convenient
2396,The Park Grand London Paddington, Nothing , The staff were all exceptionally pleasant polite helpful and attentive The hotel was sparkling clean and stylishly decorated throughout The Handy device is a great idea 
2397,The Park Grand London Paddington, The room was very small for the price and the wet room toilet was very very small so if you had a shower it would get the whole floor wet The room was hot and we could only open the windows about 2 inches , We were going to the hyde Park British summer time festival so this hotel was in a good location and very close to tube station Staff were very polite and helpful On our first day we were up and out too early for breakfast so the hotel did provide us with a take away breakfast which was good enough and on the Sunday we had breakfast in the hotel it was lovely good variety 
2398,The Park Grand London Paddington, The staff in room service over the phone were rude the bathroom was a wet room which flooded everytime you had a shower as the plug was blocked the room was very small just big enough for a double bed ,No Positive
2399,The Park Grand London Paddington, Bathroom was ridiculously small and tight Shower sprayed all over the small floor making it slippery as did the tiny sink The rooms are faded and dated and didn t strike me as very clean Would not book here again , Easy access to Paddington Station and Kensington Park Off main roads in residential area 
2400,The Park Grand London Paddington, Maybe some better refreshments in the room instead of wine but other than that couldn t fault it , Great staff friendly and helpful good size room for location
2401,The Park Grand London Paddington, Didn t appreciate the small room originally allocated given I was staying 7 nights Had issues with the bathroom of the new room allocated as well but friendly staff sorted it out , The fresh flakey pastries each morning were great 
2402,The Park Grand London Paddington, I hated the fact that there was no Lip on the shower the entire bathroom was wet after one of us had a shower never saw this in a hotel before The room was very small for a so called deluxe double The hair conditioner was never replaced ,No Positive
2403,The Park Grand London Paddington, Check in seemed unnecessarily fussy in terms of things that needed a signature I ve checked in to other hotels through bookings com before and hardly needed to sign anything on arrival Also although I didn t go in to the club room it didn t look anything special through the windows and certainly nothing worth upgrading your room to have access to I didn t see the point of it , We were upgraded to Junior Suite
2404,The Park Grand London Paddington, All good nothing to dislike , Stall were all very friendly and couldn t do enough to please Excellent service all round Room was clean and well presented and everything you require was at hand 
2405,The Park Grand London Paddington, We were given a twin beds pushed together that kept separating whenever someone went near the middle and also were given a room in the basement had a frosted window so there was some natural light but not able to open it or have a view Asked for both things to be fixed and the staff were unable to do anything except put a sheet over the two beds Staff were generally unhelpful and snooty no information given at check in, Very clean nice facilities
2406,The Park Grand London Paddington, As a family of three we needed the fold out bed which was really uncomfortable The head lower than feet and a metal bar could felt across back , Breakfast was good and hotel short walk from tube and many sites 
2407,The Park Grand London Paddington, there was no plug beside the bed for charging my phone , i loved how the rooms were designed i can say it was the most hotel room i ever liked i was amazed by the bathroom floor as it was heated so your feet won t feel cold they provide for each room a cell phone with free internet national calls and international calls for selected countries near by most attractions friendly staff 
2408,The Park Grand London Paddington, I requested a tomato soup in the evening from the bar The service was very bad the place was empty but they took ages to bring the soup It was awaful soup the worse I ever tried just a red color with heavy layer of fat with no taste disgusting For dinner eat outside the hotel there are acceptable resturants around the area , I asked for gluten free bread and felt happy that it was available The location was good specially to paddington station if you want to use heathrow express

2447,The Park Grand London Paddington, My bag was stolen from the hotel lobby and that speaks a lot on poor management and lack of security It took the hotel half an hour to view the cctv footage and i think the response from the management was atrocious I lost a lot of money and as a traveler it was a nightmare to be in an alien city without any help from the management The management did not even apologies for what has happened I would advise Booking com to withdraw the hotel from their system and also advise travellers to not to stay at this hotel Imagine a bag being stolen from the lobby of the hotel Very poor attitude and shockingly unbelievable behaviour , I liked the staff in the restaurant very warm and efficient 
2448,The Park Grand London Paddington, The staff is unorganised I ve booked the hotel through booking com and I ve paid for the room in advanced The staff kept on letting me put in my card again and again thinking that I haven t pay yet Which made me late for the meeting Also I ve arrived an hour later than the time they set for the check in and my room is still not ready , Bed is comfy and the room is clean The ac is adjustable which is very good

2450,The Park Grand London Paddington, The room was slightly cramped There was an unnecessary mix up with the registration which resulted in our getting a smaller room but had free breakfast thrown in instead , Good location and the free use of a mobile handy with maps underground free int and local calls fantastic 
2451,The Park Grand London Paddington, The hotel good location and clean but some staff very badly with me really I surprised from them They should be more professional and helper all coustmers they need more study and qualify in field hotel business Bcz the price increasing more that 150 that not accepted in any hotels and countries special in UK we like UK Thanks, The hotel good location and clean but some staff very badly with me really I surprised from them They should be more professional and helper all coustmers they need more study and qualify in field hotel business Bcz the price increasing more that 150 that not accepted in any hotels and countries special in UK we like UK Thanks

2453,The Park Grand London Paddington, The breakfast area seemed to be too small to accommodate all the guests Every time we came there was a waiting time to be seated However well managed by the staff , Due to some technical problems at the Park Grand hotel we were rebooked to a neighboring property Paddington Court hotel We were very much impressed by the very helpful and friendly staff at the front desk the bar the restaurant and the concierge Special thanks to Sara at the front desk for helping with all the transportation arrangements that we needed 
2454,The Park Grand London Paddington, Maybe a little nicer view For 2 nights though no grumbles , Bed was ridiculously comfy I wanted to take it home Friendly staff Just a little outside of the centre but nothing a tube ride can t fix Also they gave us a free upgrade to a twin queen room

2458,The Park Grand London Paddington, Bathroom was small and with few shelves or places where to put personal stuff such as combs cream shaver etc Room lights were poor no night lights for raeding Hair dryer inside a wardrobe not accessible from the bathroom only to be used from the bed Furniture in wood needed maintenance , The bed was very comfortable Room was quite big with enough space to move around It was also very silent no noise from outside or other rooms Location was fabulous very nice area and near two metro stations very close to the park for daily morning exercise
2459,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, I picked this as a stop over for the Heathrow Express as reasonably close to Paddington and the Underground Quiet and comfortable and much better ambiance and value than the converted properties in Bloomsbury around the BM where I stayed before Good choice Lots of wonderful eateries nearby

2470,The Park Grand London Paddington, The room was overall filthy i doubt if the bed sheets were changed before my arrival and the toilet cleaned found human hair in both The corridor smelled burned cooking oil from the kitchen It was one of the most disgusting hotels I ve stayed at It certainly didn t worth the amount of money i paid for it ,No Positive
2471,The Park Grand London Paddington, The breakfast buffet was ample but not high quality products I would suggest going elsewhere for a good English breakfast , I was actually moved to the Paddington Court location a block away from the London Paddington still Park Grand chain I appreciated a modern comfortable well designed room that met all my needs even though it was tiny that s just London Short walk to either Paddington or Lancaster Gate stations in a very nice neighbourhood away from the tacky side of Paddington I would definitely return here in the future 
2472,The Park Grand London Paddington, We were there for 5 days it would be nice to have something different for breakfast not the exact same thing everyday There was only one elevator so sometimes it was a bit of a wait , The staff was excellent each and every one of them

2481,The Park Grand London Paddington, The room was very difficult to access within the building which consists of townhouses that have been remodeled as a hotel We had to go up an elevator up some stairs down some others and it was confusing long and very difficult to handle with our heavy bags Thankfully the staff is attentive and responsive and there to help with luggage Another issue was that while the bed and room was clean the window was very dirty The window was also small due to the location of the room within the building , The room was very good for the price considering the quality of the linens and comfort of the bed Also the cost of the breakfast was included and it was very copious with all the coffee we could possibly want and a very good selection of fruits yoghurt cereals breads pasties eggs among other offerings all included in the cost I booked on this site and got a very good rate for a triple room as we were traveling with a child Very good location near the train station we were leaving the next day and overall good value for the money 
2482,The Park Grand London Paddington, The people behind the desk really ought to be able to read the details of a booking properly to avoid guests being misdirected to a considerably smaller room This took too much time to correct , When my daughter and her friend finally were given the correct room the one that I had reserved and paid for that was a relief 
2483,The Park Grand London Paddington, Bed was hard as a rock Worst nights sleep ever Bedroom was squashed was tiny no need for the word deluxe far from it No breakfast included and already paid 141 pound to stay Never staying again , Nothing Not a good hotel The one next to it looked better and well maintained

2489,The Park Grand London Paddington, Nothing springs to mind I didn t take advantage of the breakfast deal Portobello Market was waiting so couldn t rate that , Extra friendly staff and a free room upgrade Best room I ve had in London Wish I could have stayed a week Location works well in a tidy and upmarket area Would recommend

2501,The Park Grand London Paddington, Room was a bit tired the air unit or heater or whatever buzzed all night which was very annoying and storage closet space was limited London itself has become a tarpit foul air congestion and everything and I mean everything is so grossly overpriced The city probably tainted my view on the hotel somewhat but I will never visit London again other than perhaps in transit to somewhere more pleasant , The area was quiet safe and easy to get to from Paddington Station Beds were comfortable

2524,The Park Grand London Paddington, Silly question nothing , I have never stayed in this hotel before It was easy to get yourself lost in Westminster Borough and so had rang the hotel reception for directions and had the whole time to hold the phone on me till I have eventually have found the destination It made my life so much easier as I ve never been around in this part of London before When I walked in to the main entrance I was nicely greeted by the doorman and had immediately carried my luggage all the way to my room My club room was BEAUTIFUL but the only disadvantage was it didn t had a big window as expected as shown on the gallery It didn t fuss me much though The cleanliness of the room was at such high standards and was very impressed with the size of the shower head as it was ENORMOUS I had no problem with the room and had provided me with a plateful of fresh fruit wrapped in clingfilm and two bottles of Merlot Never to late to drink on your arrival why not The best part of the hotel was the breakfast I didn t like the breakfast I absolutely LOVED it as it was the BEST breakfast EVER Everything was cooked to perfection nicely smoked the juices were freshly pressed and a big thank you to the chef for all of his cooking efforts The restaurant staff had welcomed me with a very cheery attitude and had made me felt at home They were so lovely and I felt very accomplished To half of those negative reviewers coming up with such sad enthusiastic comments think again because from my point of view this hotel deserves more than a four star Well done to all and be prepared for my next visit Xx

2606,The Park Grand London Paddington, I booked a double room but it turned out to be 2 single beds pushed together We found it very uncomfortable Also the beds had seperate single bed sheets on them so no effort was made to even make it appear like a double bed double sheets at least would have been a start Breakfast instead of new unpealed potatoes chips would be better The sausages were undercooked and the beans were cheap I WAS REALLY DISSAPOINTED when we returned back from breakfast we noticed that someone had came into our room and stolen a mars bar that was on the bedside cabinet It made it worse by the fact it was a double mars bar so someone had torn it open and taken half then just left the other half in the torn wrapper and left it on the table I reported this incident to the duty manager she said she would look into it I really do not expect this kind of thing to happen especially in a reputable place like this It s not the item itself that i m concerned about but it s rather the value of principle , I found staff friendly and a pleasing atmosphere in the building I thought overall the facilities were nice and clean

2610,The Park Grand London Paddington, To all weary travellers I booked a four night stay at The Park Grand hotel in London Paddington Having just arrived from a long journey and I checked into my room and went straight to bed Not long after drifting off to the land of nod I awoke to a burning sensation severe itchiness to my upper torso neck hands and arms Upon further inspection I soon discovered the bed was riddled with bedbugs and these free loaders I counted in the double digits After contacting reception I was greeted by the hotel manager and an assistant to assess the extent of the infestation By this time my bites had swollen to a collection of bright red bump The manager and equally his assistant were shocked at the state of the bed and they moved me to the room down the hallway The following morning I spoke to another manager to request a full refund for the previous night as well as requested relocation to a lower floor just in case my new friends decided to pay me another visit The manager advised me that a full refund was not practical and that the best they could do for me at the time was to give a 20 discount on the room which I did not accept for the previous evening and wash my clothes to prevent any stowaways At one point throughout the discussion the manager even intimated that I may be responsible for the infestation and that he would investigate the situation adding insult to injury This certainly did put me at ease and I did not feel like a valued customer Instead of giving the hotel the benefit of the doubt and continuing my stay I requested that my room be cancelled and to refund the remaining nights As anticipated I was told that I should give 24 hours notice in order to cancel so I had to stay one more night before leaving to a neighbouring hotel I short the attitude of the hotel was woeful and the manner in which they dealt with their customers albeit the general staff was pleasant and helpful ,No Positive
2611,The Park Grand London Paddington, Everything was suburb I would consider myself a regular at the hotel and every time I go it is always great service, I love the guys for room service as well as the doormen Really friendly and helpful
2612,The Park Grand London Paddington, The gym was good but I would have appreciated a yoga mat pilates ball and some more weights, Really nice staff at the reception The location was great with walking distance to 3 different subway stations and also it was very close to Hyde park and Kensington Gardens 
2613,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, Well located between tube stops for many different lines The room is tiny but well thought out to be well equipped The staff were really friendly Pleasant surprise considering the very good price 
2614,The Park Grand London Paddington, Bathroom was teeny tiny but very functional clean so not really a didn t like more an observation, I was upgraded to a Club Room told at reception it was a bigger room it was very nice room I must admit but not sure what a standard room size looked like to compare
2615,The Park Grand London Paddington, Poor Wi Fi connection We missed a cosy lounge There was no where to hang our winter coats in the room Bathroom had not enough room for our toiletries and no toilet brush For a Dane the bread at breakfast was not satisfactory only white and dry , Very nice and helpful staff Though very small the room and bathroom were very nice Good value for money 
2616,The Park Grand London Paddington, the bathroom was a mess 4 star hotel with no shower cabine just a shower head and curtain that if you were not carefull flooded the whole room also our room was in the basement ,No Positive
2617,The Park Grand London Paddington, Smallest room I ve seen in a long time I booked a double deluxe room and it appeared to be one of the smallest rooms looking at the fire escape floor plan Far from impressed , Location was good and convenient for me
2618,The Park Grand London Paddington, Our room was in some sort of basement therefore the view was rather disappointing The window showed some kind of patio where the hotel staff walked through to get to the other rooms We had to keep the curtains closed for privacy this was not a really big issue , I came here for a romantic weekend with my boyfriend We were welcomed very warmly by the receptionist The room was really nice a little bit on the small side but very clean and comfortable 
2619,The Park Grand London Paddington, So called deluxe double room is claustrophobic It is overpriced but what isn t in London In addition on the web site breakfast was included in reality it s not , Location Good Lebanese restaurant nearby 
2620,The Park Grand London Paddington, I was very dissapointed with this property our daughter booked and paid for this as a birthday present we had hassle checking in the receptionist wanted a copy of the card for security as this wasnt our card we didnt have it we offered our own card to use and they wanted to refund our daughters card which would take 10 days and take the money for the room from us there was no reason to do this and was a bad start to our trip Also the pictures are very misleading the rooms were tiny I wouldnt return here but would definitely return to the area, The location
2621,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, Great location with friendly staff Rooms are clean and modern but small as usual in London hotels Lots of different restaurants in the area such as Lebanese Malaysia Indian Italian Malaysia pubs 
2622,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, Located conveniently close to Paddington and not too far from Lancaster Gate Comfortable bed room size was really small as stated but ok for 2 days Would visit again 
2623,The Park Grand London Paddington, Rooms are much smaller than they look in website Booked a double room for a couple up on check in into room found only one set of things in the room one towel one coffee cup etc Two calls to reception with 20 min wait to get things sorted ,No Positive
2624,The Park Grand London Paddington, A bath in the suite is the only thing that would have made it better The hotel was further from Paddington than we d expected, Excellent value for money we were upgraded to a suite free of charge so found ourselves in a very comfortable modern and exceptionally clean 4 suite for just over 100 Staff were very helpful organising a cake for my partner s birthday and although we didn t eat at the hotel the Indian food in the bar smelt delicious Room service was very reasonably priced too 
2625,The Park Grand London Paddington, Unfortunately the room was too hot to sleep and the air conditioning could not cope with the heat , Clean smart room with a comfortable mattress Friendly staff and an excellent location 
2626,The Park Grand London Paddington, There are two of the same franchise in the same street so watch out for that this is the one at the corner of Queens Gardens, The hotel was conveniently located between two major tube stations We were due to check for in at 2pm but they let us check in when we arrived at 11am We really only used the hotel as a base we weren t there very much so I can t comment on the facilities or breakfast But I was very satisfied with what we got for what I paid 
2627,The Park Grand London Paddington, Room too small with tiniest bathroom Very lengthy check in procedure which involved taking photocopies of my id and credit card For security and other reasons I was not happy about this and it doesn t happen at other hotels , Close to Paddington Could easily walk to Hyde Park tube etc Restaurants shops and great cafes for breakfast close by Clean but tiny room everything you needed but cramped and my husband and I are small Would be fine for a single traveler Great wifi 
2628,The Park Grand London Paddington, Bit strange being asked for photo ID to check in I hadn t seen that when booking and just by luck I had my driving licence with me , Getting a proper sized room with a real window at a good price just a few steps from Paddington
2629,The Park Grand London Paddington, Room very nice but unfortunately the bed was quite dirty I know this is not the standard of this hotel but I had this unpleasant surprise on my last staying I m sure it won t happen again , Nice hotel near Paddington station
2630,The Park Grand London Paddington, No milk in room and called to say late check in and told at check in that my booking was about to be cancelled if any later , Clean great room ground floor and bright
2631,The Park Grand London Paddington, Breakfast was poor and uninspiring with limited selection wouldn t bother with it next time Also more expensive to buy it on booking com than at the hotel, Good hotel Modern stylish decor and spacious room Very friendly and helpful staff Would definitely revisit 
2632,The Park Grand London Paddington, The only down side to the hotel is the beds and pillows First the pillows are like bricks I recommend taking your own pillow if you have to you wake up with sore red ears off them Also the beds are not too comfy could be better I didn t want to think what our room would of been like without the free upgrade But overall for the price I paid which was 153 it wasn t bad as that included breakfast for 2 You can pay a lot more in London for the same service , Staff are very polite and helpful Gave us a free upgrade without asking which was nice Pretty central and not to far on the tube for attractions like Buckingham Palace probably about 15 min train ride Staff also gave us a late check out without charging us which we was made up with as we wasn t leaving London until 7pm Overall good experience
2633,The Park Grand London Paddington, This particular hotel has a chain of 3 buildings all in close proximity to each so was not sure if hotel we stayed in was one advertised Also room given to us was on ground floor and curtains covered what was the old main entrance to building no double glazing so extremely noisey, Location was ideal only short walk to Paddington train station and restaurants
2634,The Park Grand London Paddington, There was no hot water in the hotel so they moved us to another sister hotel down the road This hotel had tiny rooms noisy setup itchy sheets and in the middle of night a couple walked in on me as the reception gave them a key to my room Didn t sleep well Will not stay again, Despite the massive problems the staff are very polite and tried to solve the problems 
2635,The Park Grand London Paddington, second time i ve visited this hotel First time my husband and i were bumped This time when told they were moving me i stood my ground and insisted they gave me the room i d booked Don t trust them no consideration for woman travelling alone You can imagine my shook and horror as 2 gentlemen came to check in next to me and were given rooms without hesitation or treat o f being moved My checking in experience was so upsetting i did not bother asking for help when my rooms heating wasn t working So I froze all night didn t sleep and felt totally upset when asked on checking out if i d had a good stay i said no and explained why Oh sorry to hear that Bye was the response i recieved from the polite but obviously not empowered reception staff Beware of the dubious checking in policy ,No Positive
2636,The Park Grand London Paddington, Disappointed that the front desk could not accept a franked letter for posting One front desk person sent me to post box at Paddington while the next day I was directed to a post box just down the street A seemingly insignificant thing but not when one is a visitor to a foreign land , Nice hotel convenient distance from Paddington Station Staff were very friendly and accommodating Room was small but well equipped and comfortable Only stayed here one night but will consider when back in London 
2637,The Park Grand London Paddington, We booked this through a third party booking Com Previously to that I had spoken to reservations of shatsbury hotels which indicated to me you have made a perfect choice for the location and purpose of your special occasion surprise to your partners birthday They also stated this is a wonderful boutique hotel and which would meet your needs for this occasion The lady also stated you can book through our selves or the third party If you decided you wish to book through us you will be offered breakfast included in the price How ever I decided to book through third part as the price was a better rate for our selves I had been in contact with the hotel manager and discussed possible arrangements and touches for my partners surprise On arrival all seemed okay had a coffee in bar why waiting for room to be handed over When entering the junior suite room I was astounded in how poor quality and damage of furnishings also dust and extremely cold as well as the cold feel to the room I unfortunately broke down to my partner and had to apologise I had been let down We then went down to reception and spoke with the manager Sophia and explained our concerns of the room Sophia said I can show you another room but it will be smaller and same quality as we re currently going a new refurbishment as of last week I explained I wish I had been told this before How ever Sophia said I will get you moved to the hotel you stayed at before which is Kensington park grande She spoke to reservations to find out and sort out Thinking everything was under full control sadly it turned in to a disaster of a night mare I then took things in to my control by phoning reservations cut the long story short 2 hrs later still got know where really and by now my partner is currently not good health due to waiting for brain surgery has now got stressed and feeling dizzy and sick We went down to reception and finally the gm Natish took us in to club lounge and spoke to us , Location of hotel and not far from station
2638,The Park Grand London Paddington, The air conditioner seems not to work because although I adjust it to 32 degrees but actually I felt less than 20 degrees and it was cold during night Also I booked for a double bed but initially it was 2 single beds next to each other Once I asked for a double bed they just put something like mattress protector to cover the gap between the 2 single mattresses , The staff were friendly the room was clean and the bathroom was clean too The breakfast was really good but the restaurant size compared to the number if guests was quite small and everyone was packed to each other 
2639,The Park Grand London Paddington, I was dissatisfied with the fact that the shower floor was not sectioned off from the main bathroom floor There was no difference between the shower floor and bathroom floor so to speak , Location and nice view from the room 
2640,The Park Grand London Paddington, Poor room service staff reception should be much more pleasant disappointed of their welcome guys try to smile even if the client can t speak english well Room service worst one ever Changing bed and putting same dirty pillows Come on that s not a good service for london, L emplacement le quartier
2641,The Park Grand London Paddington, This hotel is supposed to be a 4 accommodation However given our experience it can be said it s no more than 2 We booked a deluxe twin room with 2 twin beds When we arrived there we got a twin room with one bed We told the front desk about this They reacted very customer unfriendly and told us there was no such thing like a twin room with two twin beds They also said that this was not their responsibility and that we should have booked from their own site and not with booking com because the information on their own site is supposedly correct We were very upset about their reaction and wanted to cancel the booking but the booking was already paid for and they said that we were free to go but they would not give our money back First they offered us to look for a room type we wanted in one of their other Park hotels When we asked them to do this they took a step back and said that they would charge us extra for this So we had to accept the room anyhow They also said that they were fully booked and there was no other room available however on every online hotel site there was the possibility to book an room on the same day More interestingly we made the booking in Euros and were charged more than 20 Euros more than our initial booking without any explanation When we were settled in the room it seemed to us the room was very cold and that the heater did not work The heater was blowing cold air even that we set it on maximum heat temperature Remarkably we discovered an electrical heating unit in the closet When we called the reception that the heater did not work they first said it was working OK and that we would have to wait to heat up That did not happen the room was only getting colder because the blower just blew cold air Mid januari in London that is not nice We called again and finally somebody came and said there was indeed a malfunction However they told us not being able to repair it until next day , Absolutely nothing 
2642,The Park Grand London Paddington, Poor level of cleanliness in my room particularly around the bed and in the frame area of the bed Cooked breakfast was also half cold and not very good , Reasonable sized club room
2643,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, Staff very polite and helpful Much better approach to customer service than their Heathrow Hotel Would Definitely Recommend 5 10 10 Experience I used to visit Park Grand Heathrow But No More After Staying At The Paddington Hotel
2644,The Park Grand London Paddington, When we got there they told us no room left and try to send us to another unknown hotel and also asking pay first Even tho we book one week ago there s no advance notice or apology explaination I basically stood next to the front desk and watch people check out so eventually got a room With tinny window and on the grand floor hearing people walk passing by , If you wanna stay near paddington in a buget This s good idea But to be honest I wish I just book Hilton instead 
2645,The Park Grand London Paddington, We were told at 9pm to keep quiet which was annoying as it was still early and then we got told we could use the club lounge and two minutes later got asked to go back to our room it was just annoying but I wouldn t say it s a place to go with a group of friends if you are planning a night out as it didn t suit us even when being quiet , Location and Value for money
2646,The Park Grand London Paddington, Room bed was a bit worn and windows allowed some street noise in so sleeping in was not really an option, Great location near Paddington very friendly staff Good simple breakfast Excellent value for the price 
2647,The Park Grand London Paddington, N A, For the price paid 1 2 normal rate I thought this was a good value hotel Plate of fruit was a nice touch as were the pack of jammy dodgers with the tea and coffee making facilities The room was smallish but well laid out I stayed for one night The location is great and if you re visiting London for the first time this hotel is easily accessible from the train station and tube at Paddington 
2648,The Park Grand London Paddington, It would have been useful to have more plug sockets in the room to charge phones etc , The hotel was in a nice quiet location just 5 mins walk from Paddington station The staff were lovely and allowed us to check out very early for our flight at 7am The room was a decent size and very modern with a comfortable bed 
2649,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, Excelllent view out to Cleveland Square quiet extremely helpful staff at all times of day and evening good furnishings of room 317 Good magazine supply Nice atmosphere in lounge bar Above all the excellent room and its fittings Mind the ingenuity of the designer in fitting so much into the space of 317 made it a very different experience than staying in one of the larger upgraded room suites of my last stay there Both are fine just radically different 
2650,The Park Grand London Paddington, The size of the room was very small No cupboard to put away clothing etc There wasn t any dressing table not enough room in the bathroom to display any toiletries , The staff were really friendly especially Sara We would definitely come and stay here again because of her 
2651,The Park Grand London Paddington, Curtains as mentioned above , Great staff and value for money Hotel was lovely although there were a few stains on the curtains This did not bother me that much however other guests may not be so forgiving 
2652,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, Ideal location for Paddington station and the parks And only a good walk to the west end weather permitting Greeting from the reception was friendly and welcoming Rooms were small but well appointed Lack of bath in rooms was a little disappointing but shower was good No public space to relax Apart from a sofa in reception and a very small bar We didn t eat breakfast But the food we saw looked very good The staff in all departments were polite knowledgeable and helpful as well as looking smart and sharp We as a family enjoyed our time here
2653,The Park Grand London Paddington, For the first timers the location would be confusing as there were many hotels in the same name of Park Grand in around the same location Its hard to find your way back by walking if you forget the landmarks The Bathroom is very small congested , Best Value for Money in a Hotel in London within a walkable distance to Oxford street The Reception staff were excellent the boys were probably the best in UK as they handled our luggage all the way during check in checkout Room is small but good 
2654,The Park Grand London Paddington, I didnt had a bad experience, I like the quality of service room decoration staff was friendly Moreover they provided me storage option which was very comfortable specially if you have trains to heathrow Overall i had a great experience staying there 
2655,The Park Grand London Paddington, Very bad and small rooms Payment sistem in hotel didn t accept visa electron card But before that when I booked room they accept , Noting Just location 
2656,The Park Grand London Paddington, Noise from everywhere in the hotel even uf someone walk un the upper floor or flush water in toilet breakfas is not good they gave us differen building becouse we whete told there is no water in the hotel well not stat again, Nothing
2657,The Park Grand London Paddington, Extra charge of 45 on leaving as they made a mistake when giving me price for room and breakfast a nice way to make extra money Noisy water pipes no ear plugs at hotel reception, Clean
2658,The Park Grand London Paddington, Air con was very noisy in the night even when switched off Could hear tv in the room next door, Lovely room open and bright Very clean and appreciated complimentary wine water fruit Staff were lovely and friendly Lovely warm dressing gowns Great location Well deserved 4 hotel Would definitely stay here again
2659,The Park Grand London Paddington, Very compact room Dark decor made room appear smaller Location of hair dryer strange , Location good Staff friendly helpful Facilities in room good
2660,The Park Grand London Paddington, There was a double and single bed in our room for 3 adults There were no rooms with three single beds so two of my friends had to share which was uncomfortable for them , The staff were friendly and helpful 
2661,The Park Grand London Paddington, The room was uncomfortably small When showering the water came through the bathroom door and got the carpet wet causing a bad smell, Staff and breakfast were excellent
2662,The Park Grand London Paddington, Air conditioning wasn t great Where the hairdryer was situated in our room was convenient for the mirror You had to perch at the top of the bed to dry your hair as you couldn t detach the hairdryer to move it to a more convenient plug The mirror pulled out an angle to the bed The mattress was 2 smaller ones pushed together and this meant there was more bed stead than mattress and you found yourself walking into the sides of the bed all the time The shower door only opened half way which meant you had to manoeuvre between that and the towel rail on the right hand side which didn t leave much room Whilst the style of the room was very nice the dark wood was very dark Didn t like the fact I had to hand over photo ID and the Receptionist was unable to answer why when I asked only that it was hotel policy which is fine but why She took my credit card to confirm I was the one that made the booking my partner wasn t asked to show any ID and what if I didn t have ID would I not be allowed to check in despite me having pre paid the room Not happy about this information being available hence why I requested the copy back on departure Small Bar facilities at the hotel with very limited choice of draught beverages , I loved the location staff were friendly and hotel was really nice 
2663,The Park Grand London Paddington, At first the room that was given to us was not the luxury double that was booked It was a very small room But the staff kindly moved us into a bigger room and apologised for the inconvenience ,No Positive
2664,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, Excellent Quiet modern rooms air con great shower room service friendly staff and 12pm checkout All for a good price Will definitely be staying here again 
2665,The Park Grand London Paddington, The second room for our family was not as close as we would have liked despite requesting rooms together Staff were perfunctory and showed no interest whatsoever in us or in enhancing our stay in London When asked to call a taxi they arranged an Uber car and the driver did not know how to get to the destination a tube station so my husband had to use his own phone to navigate Expensive for what we got , Comfortable and clean Walking distance from train stations 
2666,The Park Grand London Paddington, My partner dropped a new earring in the bathroom sink and it could apparently not be retrieved without a plumber This would have cost us more than it was worth so it stayed in the u bend I believe it could have been accessed without much difficulty using a Phillips screwdriver but who carries one , Comfortable well fitted room with particularly nice bathroom and shower Comfortable bed Quiet room and very friendly staff 
2667,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, We stayed here before and found the location to be excellent for getting about central London Central line tube and bus stop only a 4 5 min walk and plenty of places to eat and drink in all directions Considering the location it is pretty quiet at night This time we opted for a club room which was pretty large and well worth the relatively small extra cost We have stayed in lots of places in London but will definitely stay here again 
2668,The Park Grand London Paddington, Nothing, I enjoyed my time in the hotel everything were perfect and great breakfast was very well the staff very kindly especially tina and diana I will stay more and more in that hotel again 
2669,The Park Grand London Paddington, The staff wasn t friendly when I was checking in She didn t even smile After that someone else was given the same room as us after we checked in Then we cannot get into our room with the key , Even though our room was at the basement the room was open and spacious enough for two people It wasn t an incovenience at all We were given complimentary drinks for the room key incident 
2670,The Park Grand London Paddington, The fact that we were transfered to another building 5 minutes away because of maintenance issues The room and bathroom are very small in size The shower box is literally the size of a single cupboard , Fairly clean rooms 
2671,The Park Grand London Paddington, The evening receptionist Desmond on the night of the 8th to the 9th of December handled a situation very badly when his colleagues earlier on in the day had given us permission to use the lounge room until pick up by shuttle to the airport at 4am he came to inform us that we could not stay in the hotel unless we book a room He apologized after upsetting us but it was a bit too late , The shower and the door men
2672,The Park Grand London Paddington, Disappointed that I couldn t cancel my breakfast but was offered a take away Although I didn t have time for it I did take out an excellent coffee , Great location for an early Heathrow Express train 
2673,The Park Grand London Paddington, I stayed twice so far each time in the standard double room Once was in an attic and that room was a lot more tight for space than the other Both fairly usually small for an inner city hotel room The Attic room lights were bright with no lamp but the other room had better mood lighting , Located close to Paddington station but on a quiet street clean and comfy decent bed decent bathroom friendly staff 
2674,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, The hotel was lovely clean modern and comfortable Despite a problem with the water they moved us to their sister hotel which was only a stones throw away and gave us complimentary breakfast for the entire stay to say sorry We also had our rooms upgraded and following another misunderstanding with the room booking the staff could not do enough for us to make it right The customer service was superb During our stay our pregnant friend was really ill and the hotel manager Lizzie personally cared for her and the hotel driver escorted her to back and to to the nearest hospital The customer service here was first class and I would highly recommend it I can t thank them enough for how well they looked after us I would defo stay here again 
2675,The Park Grand London Paddington, No bottle of water was available the hotel provide the tea and coffee without water no purpose , Overall stay was very good modern room and friendly staff Good location close to Lancaster tube
2676,The Park Grand London Paddington, Pretty much everything the Dulux room isn t very Dulux at all I could hardly walk around the bed that room is that small there no storage space for your bags etc they have one cupboard wide enough to fit a couple shirts it s about 5inch deep There s was stains all over the curtains and carpet The bathroom is a tiny wet room where you have no space to actually move around , Nothing
2677,The Park Grand London Paddington, Too far from City central if you didn t know you have to have an Oyster card for buses and your friend won t go on the tube No plug socket near a mirror , Lovely hotel helpful staff comfy bed 
2678,The Park Grand London Paddington, I didnt like the way a staff member handled my cancellation of one night as I had to cut my trip short because of a death in the family Trainees should be taught to escalate more sensitive matters if they are not equipped to handle them , Clean room good location Minutes away from shops and tube stations 
2679,The Park Grand London Paddington, triple room is small Not enough space for big luggages You have to squeeze in to fit and not enough variety of food in the breakfast lounge, Great staffs clean hotel and just a few minutes walk to hyde park
2680,The Park Grand London Paddington, The first night I was booked to a tiny double bedroom 033 on the ground floor and unfortunately you could hear all night cars driving and pedestrians walking by Also the room wasn t very good isolated and you could see the light from the corridor outside and the corridor door opening and shut Also the housekeeping team must have had nearby their cleaning cupboards so from 07 00am you heard loud voices and the vacuum cleaner going on The bathroom in this room was designed for a disabled wheel chair person which is ok but I felt it was a bit small and the shower was not warming up and the water pressures was low so it took ages to wash off soap etc however after i complained to the front staff about the noise and the water they put me in one of their club rooms which was better and the water pressure in the shower was good Overall I stayed in the hotel for three nights and it was a good experience, Executives club rooms were modern furnished clean and beds are comfortable 
2681,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, The fresh fruit and real flowers in the room on our arrival was really wellcoming Very good breakfast and once again real flowers on table at breakfast really nice Staff all very helpful and friendly 
2682,The Park Grand London Paddington, Letter of complaint already written Small room with nowhere to work No shower as such just a wet room and you could not open bathroom door to get in there, Convenience of location
2683,The Park Grand London Paddington, Nothing except the fact that room service is closing at 12am , I ve had a wonderful time at this hotel the room i was assigned was amazing and made me feel like home I absolutely loved it Staff was helpful and happy I did not want to leave 
2684,The Park Grand London Paddington, It s true that they give booking com customers the worst rooms right by reception The bathroom was tiny not enough plug sockets and the shower wouldn t stop dripping The room was also freezing and had to ask for a heater , Good location 
2685,The Park Grand London Paddington, The rooms are very small and also booking com is VERY misleading the room did not have all of the listed items in the room the room was spose to be a deluxe but was more like a standard very disappointing and very misleading description of the room from booking com, The staff were polite
2686,The Park Grand London Paddington, The only thing missing was there was no bath only a shower but it was a great shower The rooms were a little too cosey small , The staff were efficient and friendly The hotel was spotless The rooms were modern and had all the necessities It was a five minute walk to the tube station which was convenient 
2687,The Park Grand London Paddington, Breakfast was disappointing would of been upset if I had to pay for it, When we arrived we were told we would have to stay at there sister hotel the park grand as they were having work done but they gave us free breakfast on both nights when we checked in we were given an upgrade as we were on our minimoon overall this was a great stay
2688,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, Very clean and updated good London equivalent of a US business hotel chain Staff was friendly and always very helpful Location is central with Paddington Station Underground stops and food within walking distance 
2689,The Park Grand London Paddington, The rooms were extremely small and overpriced We asked to be moved from the first room as it was in the basement off the main corridor and what felt like a storage area Very disappointed for the price being charged The second room was an improvement however still very small ,No Positive
2690,The Park Grand London Paddington, The room I was saying was directly under the stairs and I could hear every footstep I didn t sleep very well as there was a constant disturbance I would suggest insulating that particular room to prevent the noise thudding through , The staff were extremely helpful and the hotel was very nice and well maintained 
2691,The Park Grand London Paddington, at my arrival I didn t find the room even if the late arrival was written they just offer me a taxi for another hotel but I had to look for it they didn t suggest me anything ,No Positive
2692,The Park Grand London Paddington, The rooms are very very small we only had 2 small suitcases and there was no room for them The breakfast isn t great we were given it complementary but would have been very disappointed if I d paid for it , Staff are so friendly and welcoming the hotel itself is lovely and quite grand Loved the big TV on the wall in the room 
2693,The Park Grand London Paddington, absolutely noisy air condition they booked a deposit of one night that has not been resolved again upon payment mini bathroom not possible to shower without getting everything wet no wardrobe at all, location
2694,The Park Grand London Paddington, Dreadful staff who would not help despite their booking process being unclear They need the card you book the room under to be present at check in which is useless for corporate bookings They will not take card payment over the phone or web because of fraud but would be happy to take a payment from the same card if you didn t turn up Happy to leave two guests waiting in reception with no access to room whilst this was resolved Really bad experience won t be booking again They also want to photocopy your driving license and bank card and try to tell you that you have to sign up to their loyalty club , Rooms comfortable and clean Good facilities Good location
2695,The Park Grand London Paddington, Stairs our room is located between the ground and the 1st floor so no direct lift access We had to carry our big suitcases from stairs Gladly the hotel staffs were really helpful with our luggages The room was a bit narrow but perfectly acceptable given the price and being in London , Location is the best being close to the Paddington Station makes everything a lot easier The room is perfectly clean staffs were friendly and helpful Great breakfast 
2696,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, Everything was fantastic The staff was friendly the room was amazing and comfortable and quiet Breakfast was the best with a good selection of hot and cold It s the best hotel my fianc and I have ever stayed at and will stay there again when next we go to London

2699,The Park Grand London Paddington, We felt the location was a bit far out from the main attractions however the price of the room was very reasonable which compensated for the taxi fares , Lovely quiet hotel comfortable with friendly staff 
2700,The Park Grand London Paddington, The heater didn t work in the room called reception 4 times nothing done about it The toilet was also blocked in our room called reception to be told there WA no one that could help us until tomorrow morning so had to use the toilets in the hallway , Nice hotel staff

2703,The Park Grand London Paddington, The double room I was in was extremely small The bathroom was as well There is no possible way that more than one person could possibly stay in that room Now I was there for business and I literally just slept showered and dressed there so there was no real issue but just understand what you are getting , The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful The hotel and the room was very clean Best of all the location near Paddington Station allowed easy access to Heathrow and pretty much anything in London via the tube 
2704,The Park Grand London Paddington, Everything were good only the bathroom is to small and the shower water doesn t go to the drainage straight away so it is wet everywhere and the cupboard is not functional hard to reach , The location is close to the underground nice neighbourhood the receptionist was very friendly and helpful Good value for money

2707,The Park Grand London Paddington, The rooms were small and the bathroom was a wet room which wasn t great especially as it was unexpected Also not entirely sure we were given the deluxe double room we paid for , The location was good and the staff were very friendly 
2708,The Park Grand London Paddington, Uuufhh Where do I even start The rooms have no space you feel confined in them You can hear the person next door through the walls The hotel is a long walk from the nearest station The housekeeping lady kept coming into my room without knocking on my door she came 4 times between 11 and 12 noon her excuse she wanted to clean the room even though I told her not come in again The hotel should be 2 star and I don t know how they were rated 4 star Perhaps it is self acclaimed I wouldn t advise anyone to go there you ll regret it and wish you hadn t A word they say is enough for the wise but these are alot of words , The porter was the only good in the hotel He was so helpful and courteous I even gave him a tip 
2709,The Park Grand London Paddington, Look at the curtains looks like blood stains all over even though it may be chemicals I hope Also you pulled money ahead of time which I wasnt informed of as it stood that the full amount would be paid at the property , Location 
2710,The Park Grand London Paddington, The first night we were allocated a basement room found this claustrophobic The staff who were excellent throughout moved us on the second night to a much better room on level3, Good friendly and professional staff in all areas Cosy little bar with good service Cleanliness in bedrooms and throughout the hotel was to a high standard Convenient for Paddington Station and thus Heathrow Express 
2711,The Park Grand London Paddington, Lovely bedroom but no space to walk round my bed , I was given complementary breakfast as there was a problem with the room that I booked and had to be moved 
2712,The Park Grand London Paddington, Steps leading from pavement to Reception were awkward for a pushchair Price of the breakfast Lots of cafes within 5 minutes walking distance charging only 5 6 for a full English breakfast , Friendliness and enthusiasm of Reception staff incl porters Always helpful when it came to helping lift the pushchair up down the steps Great room service 
2713,The Park Grand London Paddington, Room was not as described it was tiny in basement looked out to old ladders dirty curtains Shower flooded floor soaking hazardous wet all round wc and whb this was not a deluxe room Diningroom very pokey claustrophobic, staff very good and helpful good location
2714,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, Location The staff was very polite and cheerful especially some of the evening people with whom we chatted several times about the changing character of London They included Shalaka Cristina and Rohan 
2715,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, Nice Clean modern hotel Staff good pleasant and helpful Good location close to Paddington underground and station Room was a good size for family of 4 Had to wait 10 Minutes for the room due to last minute booking booked 5 minutes before turning up at the hotel Was offered complimentary drinks whilst waited for room to be prepared 
2716,The Park Grand London Paddington, The room was small and gloomy with dark panelling and inconvenient lighting It looked out into a tiny well and was badly overlooked by another room so I had to keep the curtains closed more gloom I assume I was given the room because I was travelling alone but I booked for 2 people and I was paying the same as 2 people I don t appreciate being treated as a 2nd class citizen , I liked the location the star were efficient but not particularly friendly and lacked the personal approach except the barman 
2717,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, fab boutique hotel gr8 location very near hyde park paddington tube station very helpful staff also the reservations rep Mandeep really looked after my stay room upgrade plus wine beverages fruits in my room

2719,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, I ve stayed in some 500 hotels in my life This one stands out due the hospitality of the staff We felt truly welcome and it made our stay so nice 
2720,The Park Grand London Paddington, The double deluxe room was not like the picture it s very small and I felt like I was in a prison cell when I complained the staff did their best to upgrade me to a bigger room however I did feel like it was false advertising to begin with we requested one of the rooms to have 2 single beds they called this a twin room and made us pay 50 more for 2 nights however it was still a double bed or as they call it 2 single beds on one base not sure what the point of that is ,No Positive
2721,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, well looked after by the staff nothing was to much trouble Room was good except bathroom a bit small but hey who spends all there time in the loo would deff stay again
2722,The Park Grand London Paddington, Got to the hotel we booked and needed to be moved elsewhere We were not happy with the hotel we were moved to as a group and this review reflects that hotel the Montcalm ,No Positive
2723,The Park Grand London Paddington, The location is far away in terms of walking to marble arch oxford and regent street There is a hotel almost have the same name with one word different in the end of the road which makes the taxis some times lost and confused Not enough electric socket and not close to bed for phone charging The room is too small comparing to other hotels with the same class Not recommended to families due to small rooms Check there official website before book via booking com as some times you will find it cheaper and comes with breakfast , Friendly Staff fast internet without password and very close to paddington station
2724,The Park Grand London Paddington, We had a problem at reception when we arrived which was never resolved to our satisfaction , Despite our room being in the basement a new concept for us it was large and comfortable
2725,The Park Grand London Paddington, Room was tiny marginally bigger than the bed and more importantly there was no where to put anything be it my bag or even just a hair brush The bathroom is what is euphemistically known as a wet room meaning everything gets soaked when you have a shower You therefore have to plan your morning routine carefully unless you don t mind cleaning your teeth while standing in a puddle , The bed was comfortable enough 
2726,The Park Grand London Paddington, The bathroom If it can be called that even Honestly it is just a cubicle with no demarcation for the shower just a shower curtain that you pull across but that certainly does not help as for sure there is water everywhere on the floor when you shower We had to put down 3 towels to soak it all up as it s a mess they could surely have increased the size by cutting down on the seating area of the room It was really very tiny though we were in the Club Room , 1 It is really convenient to get on the Paddington Express from Heathrow walk down to the hotel It is just under 10mins 2 It s in a peaceful street with very friendly efficient staff quick to meet our requests 3 Lots of shops restaurants close by so convenient 4 comfortable bed pillows fluffy quilts very clean free wi fi 5 the bikkies everyday are a nice touch though if they had provided botlled water that too would have been good not so expensive for them 
2727,The Park Grand London Paddington, I didn t like that it took 2 other bad experiences in Paddington before we found this one , Situated in a quiet relaxing part of Paddington Great service staff friendly and helpful Comfortable modern and luxurious decor Smaller hotel Hope to return Great location 
2728,The Park Grand London Paddington, I was setting in the Reception Reception staff they are not respecting the customer they are saying to some customer at 2 clock you can get the key and other giving them the key When I spoke to her she said we have categories I told her I know you have categories when first customer came I kept quite because they are 2 but when you allow for other single customer to get the key that mean there is no management and no respect for customer and that not fair she didn t give me any answer just said wait 15 min it will reach 2 and you will get the key after 5 min asking me to get the they how she arranged they faster The reception is the front of the hotel if the employee s behavior is abusive the owner will be looses My evidence hotel camera ,No Positive
2729,The Park Grand London Paddington, An unpleasant smell in bathrooms due to style of plumbing and in some rooms wet room means that bathroom floor can be rather wet , Position next to Paddington Station Breakfast is excellent Evening meals are available 
2730,The Park Grand London Paddington, Very big problems with payment by bank transfer Problems with extension our stay at hotel Shame because hotel is ok , Good location and nice standard 
2731,The Park Grand London Paddington, The wardrobe and the hair dryer were a slightly inconvenient to use But it s manageable for a few days stay , Staff were very friendly and helpful The room was very clean and quiet Location on the whole was convenient

2733,The Park Grand London Paddington, got a basement room with no natural light Tiny room tiny wadrobe inside a wall and they could do smth with unused space from the entrance to the room , good location good breakfast
2734,The Park Grand London Paddington, The size of a double deluxe room was small and I had rather claustrophobic impression No fulfilment of my preliminary request The bathroom floor gets totally flooded One chair only in a double room The same foods served in breakfast evryday and poor choice , The location of the hotel is great 
2735,The Park Grand London Paddington, There was nothing to complain about , My wife had to recover from hip surgery before returning to our country This hotel was perfect for that the staff great and helpful I particularly acknowledge great assistance from Tania at the reception desk 
2736,The Park Grand London Paddington, Toilet seat had hair on it the two rooms were not very close together and they were rather cramped , It was a short overnight stop so the rooms were adequate
2737,The Park Grand London Paddington, The room was tiny To put this into perspective we are two 30 yr old females who have travelled quite a bit and have used various standards of accomadation from hostels upwards so it s not like we re accustomed to luxury I ve also been in London a number of times so I understand hotel rooms are small in general Knowing this we paid a bit extra for a deluxe double as it was supposed to have more room but the bed was a standard double in size and there was only bare walking room on one side and at the end and you could just about stand on the other side of it We actually found it massively amusing trying to figure out what was deluxe about the room , The location was good close to two tube stations one of them being Paddington so easy to get around The shower was fantastic The area was quiet very little street noise Spotlessly clean 
2738,The Park Grand London Paddington, We had to change rooms as the ac did not work and they did not fix it Staff could hardly understand English and I thought I was in London but English is not the language ,No Positive
2739,The Park Grand London Paddington, Reception staff very poor service not friendly not helpful I feel we got fooled with a few things only because the staff in the reception didn t inform us about things like if you prebook your breakfast at the reception the day before is only 9 not more as we got charged when we went down in the restaurant if you ask them to call you a cab they call you a private kind of a chauffeur service which is more expensive then the usual London cabs etc We booked a room for 3 people in a small room there was a double bed and a very uncomfortable sofa one of us had to sleep on that on the sofa Also had a few issues with the charges on my credit card in the hotel they were not helpful they didn t give me any explanation they gave me an email to email them I wouldn t trust them again with my credit card , It was a lovely hotel very small from the photos looks bigger 5 minutes from the underground station 
2740,The Park Grand London Paddington, Wish the rooms were a bit bigger We booked a triple room They gave us the one facing the back of the hotel which was very claustrophobic It was so bad we were going to leave the hotel but then they showed us their other triple room which faces the front street of the hotel and that was much better But generally very claustrophobic rooms My teenage kids didn t like it as they need their space , The rooms are small yet fully equipped with everything we needed Service excellent staff very friendly and helpful rooms are clean
2741,The Park Grand London Paddington, The room was too small bathroom sink was clogged and electrical sockets did not work so I could not charge by mobile phone I changed my hotel to Grand Park Court around the block , Location of the hotel 
2742,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, The quiet street central location beautiful boutique hotel room friendly staff excellent housekeeping who reacted quickly to requests for extra milk for the coffee very good value price for a hotel in such a location and only 10 minutes walk from Paddington and the Heathrow Express The hotel also helped me to organise a surprise for my new husband in our room which was decorated with petals and roses The service is very personal and was very very much appreciated by us both 
2743,The Park Grand London Paddington, TINY room and I mean tiny Literally just enough room for a bed Lipstick on wine glasses 4 days in a row so not cleaned properly air con has one setting only Arctic and loud , Within 10 minutes walk of Paddington station which has the underground availability 
2744,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, Excellent location staff were very warm welcoming helpful Was pleasantly surprised at the room size very spacious for a city hotel tea coffee facilities fridge in room Would highly recommend definitely return 
2745,The Park Grand London Paddington, Terrible Gym Kitchen people smoking right outside this tiny Gym with windows open into gym and terrible smell of cigarette Very expensive for what you get and also not on par with other 4 stars , Nice location 
2746,The Park Grand London Paddington, had to ask for complimentary items that should have been included in our room hairdryer situation was poor couldn t see in a mirror without being a contortionist no explanation of facilities and their location, The location to Hyde Park
2747,The Park Grand London Paddington, Extremely small rooms though not surprising for Central London you can barely move within the ground floor rooms Either misleading pictures on booking com or the hotel gave us their smallest rooms knowing we re travelling with children , Location is very convenient
2748,The Park Grand London Paddington, 1 The steep steps leading to my room 2 THe lack of a cloth to cover the bread stick as you cut it thus your hand and anyonelses was placed on the end of the bread to steady it as you cut , FRiendly efficient staff Immaculate facilities with top quality linens etc The position of the hotel in relation to public transport 
2749,The Park Grand London Paddington, Upon check in I was asked to move to a sister property Apparently my room was under rennivation the sister property room was a shoebox size They miraculously found a room for me at the first hotel and the room was extremely small Incredibly dirty I will not be back I checked out after one night and paid a penalty fee I will not be back , Front desk Staff were very nice and attentive 
2750,The Park Grand London Paddington, I booked a double deluxe room here online but when I got there they gave me a small room the size of a closet because it was available first even though I had paid the price point for a double deluxe room 450 pounds a night They then transferred me to a slightly bigger room that still wasn t a double deluxe and looked nothing like in the pictures Staff were rude and reluctant to help whenever spoken to and at one point in the lounge area we witnessed one of the staff giving a young hotel guest a loud and stern lecture about payment the whole exchange was very uncomfortable and unprofessional For 450 pounds night 800 Canadian dollars we would have gotten a spacious room in other countries with wonderful service but here I felt like I had thrown a bunch of money down the drain , The place was nicely furnished in a compact way 
2751,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, The staff were all polite helpful and friendly We stayed in a Junior Suite and the room was everything you would want if away from all home comforts really comfortable and in a quiet location considering it s London The breakfast was excellent plentiful and tasty Would definitely stay there again 
2752,The Park Grand London Paddington, They changed us two times from one hotel to another when we arrived They offered us complimentary breakfast The drawback is that the bathroom was very small and it smells bad sometimes , Good locaci n near several underground stations Easy to arrive to tourist places 
2753,The Park Grand London Paddington, Deluxe double was a small room Interior was back to the 70s TV was small and hardly viewable Front line staff were great but the managers appeared as honest as Arthur Daley No room for luggage Bathroom too small, 5 mins walk to Paddington station and tube lines Plenty of shops and resturants nearby Rooms were clean good wifi
2754,The Park Grand London Paddington, Reception was a nightmare When we arrived they put into a room which NOT what we ordered and they were more concerned with taking our money than providing a service Treated us like B grade guests because we had booked using Booking com We asked them to book a taxi for us on departure and they booked a cab for the wrong time Would not stay there again , Room was clean when we asked them to move us to the room we had reserved they agreed after a debate 
2755,The Park Grand London Paddington, The room and bathroom shower was very small and quite claustrophobic , Pleased with the complimentary breakfasts probably should be included for the price 
2756,The Park Grand London Paddington, rooms are slightly small so if you have a big luggage hard to move and no space to unpack some of the stuff had an attitude i had a big window in the room but looking to back side of the street so no nice view , very neat and clean good wifi easy access to subway station 5 to 7 minutes by walk breakfast was ok hotel is on a quiet street some of the stuff was helpful and smiling 
2757,The Park Grand London Paddington, The room was a Club It was ridiculously small in that it was a struggle to walk round the end of the bed Anyone more than 6ft 3 tall would be struggling with the low ceiling height The bathroom was a toilet basin with a shower which had a curtain ridiculously small it is not a wet room The mattress dipped in the middle so an uncomfortable 2 nights sleep Overall we felt that we had been charged a lot more than it was worth As a regular genius booker with booking com we ware disappointed not to have been alerted to these problems as we would have stayed elsewhere , Location 
2758,The Park Grand London Paddington, We had asked for a nice room as we were celebrating our 6 month wedding anniversary but we were given a room down in basement level which obviously meant no view Then the bed consisted of two single mattresses pushed together on a wooden base which was far too big for purpose The room was smaller than we expected to get for the 436 we paid for the two nights Also the shower tray is pretty much on the same level as the bathroom floor so if you re in the shower any longer than a couple of minutes the bathroom floor gets totally flooded All in all definitely not worth the money we paid , The location is good everything is nice and handy to get to from this Hotel which is it s only saving grace in my opinion 
2759,The Park Grand London Paddington, Unfortunately there was not enough storage space in our room One small hanging space and two small bedside drawers is not enough for a stay of three nights It meant that we were not even able to partially unpack our cases I would have liked more space for our personal toiletries in the bathroom as well , We were very impressed with the hotel and staff We were in London for our son s university graduation and were allowed a late check out for his room so that he could come back afterwards to change clothes and rest The gesture was much appreciated 
2760,The Park Grand London Paddington, NOT the room type we ordered and paid for Two very single mattress made up individually on a king size wooden bed base does not equal a double bed Room was nice but not in our opinion a deluxe , Location to Paddington station hotel is quick and easy to get to but still in a quiet street Breakfast hot tasty and plentiful ALL staff we met were friendly and helpful 
2761,The Park Grand London Paddington, Rooms are too small not enough or to be correct almost no wardrobe space and a useless entry space without even a few hooks that area could be used at least to hang your coat hat or a few stuff,No Positive
2762,The Park Grand London Paddington, A room with a broken and leaking shower should not be given to guests Neither the reservation system nor the receptionists do understand that a female guest s family name can consist of two parts like maiden name plus husband s name while the respective husband has just one name This lead to the problem that an important parcel has not been accepted for which my husband was eagerly waiting Instead it was sent back by the receptionist , We had the benefit of being upgraded because of a broken shower in the room originally booked Excellent indian restaurant very friendly and normally helpful staff good continental breakfast for a good price Large number of staff Lot of storage room due to clever use of space 
2763,The Park Grand London Paddington,No Negative, The staff made us feel welcome and valued immediately Were given upgrade and complementary breakfasts due to maintenance work Room was immaculate and very comfortable Very close to underground and Hyde Park Would stay here again

2768,The Park Grand London Paddington, The toilet was very small On the day we checked in the walk in price was less than what we paid on booking com I would definitely call the hotel to check the price before booking , we had a junior suite which had a luggage room in it which was excellent The bed was comfortable and the room was neat and clean 
2769,The Park Grand London Paddington, The room was awful Too small very claustrophobic awful view, Reception is lovely but very deceptive as rooms do not measure up We stayed room 328 very dusty carpet coming up near door Bathroom shower not clean Bathroom so small you could hardly get out of shower Would not stay again 
2770,The Park Grand London Paddington, Rooms were not as advertised Although clean and well maintained rooms were a bit run down Rooms were very small for the price Hardly room to dwing a cat Management were not responsive to requests for change Had the feeling of being conned , Location was only 10 mins from Paddington station Good and free wifi

2774,The Park Grand London Paddington, The size of the room is definitely smaller than the description Befor arriving they informed us that the room we booked had something wrong so they will transfer us to their sister hotel which is two minutes walk We rejected and the first night they arranged us to a room at basement floor which was horriable I think it is because of overbook The hotel is not very clean And at the 7th day the toilet flush button also didn t work well , The location 10 mins walk from rail station and tube station and the Hilton hotel Two tips our booking is not free cancelled one so the hotel charged all the fee before arriving No slippers The shower is good 
2775,The Park Grand London Paddington, The room we had was in basement so no phone signal which was a pain, Location for paddington station excellent the room had everything you could need for a quiet stay in london and easy access to central london perfect stay for a 2 night break
2776,The Park Grand London Paddington, The walk in shower as the floor was always flooded , Friendly receptionist showed me how to get to the harry potter studios Bell boy also just as helpful The breakfast was good 
2777,The Park Grand London Paddington, There was absolutely no insolation between the room and corridor I was woken constantly through the night especially with people coming back in the early hours of the morning and arguing for several hours I travel extensively and this is the worst hotel I ve stayed at due to the noise factor , Location

2780,The Park Grand London Paddington, Initially we were provided with two very poor rooms Neither had curtains only blinds which did not close properly The compact room was extremely small and had a musty smell The deluxe double could in no way be described as deluxe Among other things the carpet at the entrance of the shower room was very wet , Upon complaining via Booking com we were invited to look at two other rooms The staff dealt with this very professionally As we were staying for only one night we decided to remain at the hotel and moved rooms Both of these were much more acceptable 
2781,The Park Grand London Paddington, The rooms were incredibly small and cramped We struggled to even get through the door to our room The rooms were not clean there were very big brown stains on the carpet The hotel is dated and the fixtures including the thermostat were falling off the wall in some cases , The location is very good and is only a five minute walk from Paddimgton Station and is also very close to shops and restaurants
