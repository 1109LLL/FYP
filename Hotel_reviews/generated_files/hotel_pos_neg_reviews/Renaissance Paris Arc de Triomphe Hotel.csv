170389,Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel, We wait about more than half hour to check in It was 1130pm Its not look like 5 star hotel The room in the picture on booking look different than we get , Center spot
170390,Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel, The restaurant Oh my then need to work on that part Our first experience was dinner the first evening Very odd starter even more odd main course and we skipped the dessert Starter was a really odd mix of toast bread egg odd herbs and oil For main course we had a steak that was clearly boiled and didn t taste of anything Also medium is not well done Served with bearnaise tasting only of lemon and so much butter that the it would melt on the meat Next morning we had just about the same experience at the breakfast Bread seemed to be bake off croissants were soft as they were a day old Second morning was nothing different except there were almost no bread and no service as we waited really long for an omelette and almost gave up Room service was plain odd Ordered a late night dessert of ice We choose brownie out of a selection of cookie brownie and Oreo and for some reason they managed to bring ice with Oreo and a cookie on the side That was quite funny When it comes to wifi it is extremely slow Really We gave up on it at several occations At check in the receptionist told us that wifi would be free despite it would charge us upon connecting which led to quite a discussion when checking out At the moment they are carrying out some general maintaince on the wood finish doors walls etc which means you will have the full experience of a man scratching on your door like a desperate cat at eight in the morning on a Sunday That I really didn t need , Very nice location and friendly staff You live around 200 meters from Arc du Triomphe which is about as central as you get thinking as a tourist that is Nice room great bed great facilities No bathtub despite description said so Parkering is great and maintained by staff They are very quick to assist when you need your car 
170391,Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel, I was very disappointed that the hotel management could not refund one nights room rental because I needed to leave a day early due to train to Bordeaux not leaving early enough for me to catch my flight home I booked through Booking com and I was told that hotel management had the discretion to refund the night As a Marriott rewards member I expected better service from the hotel and I will factor their decision in when I make future hotel reservations , Excellent location so near to many great restaurants great shopping and wonderful coffee shops 
170392,Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel, The room could have been cleaner for a 5 star hotel there were marks on the walls and our first room had the bath tap hanging out the wall we were upgraded to a room with a wall to ceiling window overlooking the street but you couldn t really see out as the windows were so dirty and there were 2 cupboard doors hanging off when you opened the cupboard , The location was excellent right in the heart of the city Hotel staff were extremely helpful The food was exceptional 
170393,Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Only that free wifi is not available in all rooms , A lovely hotel from nearly all aspects be it location style friendliness of staff room size cleanliness etc 
170394,Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Room cleaning lady not attentive shoddy if at all turndiwn service I always struggle to be allocated a room with a Bathtub always gave to fight for it , Location a short walk to Champs Eylesee girgeous views of Arc De Triomphe from room Window friendly concierge staff
170395,Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel, The internet issue kept dropping every 10 minutes and the keyboard in business center it took 1 hour to do 15 minutes work , The amenities location and the helpful staff Special thanks to the navigator concierge who made exploring Paris a breeze and was very helpful even when I mixed up the ticket price he was courteous and assured me he didn t mind 
170396,Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel, the room maintenance especially the shower and toilet are not 5 star hotel maybe 3 also breakfast can be much better for this price, Great location huge room comparing to paris hotels very nice staff 
170397,Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Information regarding the charge of 100 per night for room service and wifi etc Didn t know until check in that this was a thing , Location of building was super great access to public transport Rooms were clean and the little extras on an evening added to the experience of the hotel 
170398,Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel,No Negative, The Concierge Navigator desk was extremely helpful We misplaced some items at the airport when we landed in Paris They helped coordinated with the airline airport and helped retrieve the items promptly Their recommendations of restaurants bars was nice and they organised immediate reservations at the venues We could also pickup tickets from them directly and avoid queueing up at some of the tourist spots The Front Desk was very pleasant and welcoming 
170399,Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel, One of the two elevators were broken It was still ok , The check in was excellent I believe her name was Frankie she was simply amazing as she greeted us with most welcoming remarks and even gave us the nougat for our kids who were not even with us She noticed that I was munching on them from the check in counter and commenting how good it was Basically after that moment everything seemed good at the hotel Generally the staffs were very well trained and little notes inside the elevator post it notes inside your rooms was simply great marketing hospitality ideas implemented well 
170400,Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Quite a large hold per night was taken I have been back from the hotel for 3 nights now and still haven t received the hold money back This is has unfortunately left a negative image in my head after a lovely trip , Excellent location and a lovely hotel Staff were very friendly and helpful Would stay again 
170401,Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel, My only gripe was that the hotel had a function on our last night which involved extremely loud music until midnight we may as well have been there ourselves it was so loud Not good when trying to get to sleep the night before a 30 hour flight home But when I complained the next morning we were compensated by way of a 4pm check out for free The hotel s response was outstanding , The staff could not have been any more obliging and helpful The location was excellent and great places to eat nearby the hotel s recommendation of a local authentic French restaurant was spot on and we had a fabulous meal out The room was huge for Paris and really well appointed Even though it was on a main road it was quiet even with the door to the balcony open 
170402,Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe Hotel, Room service didn t clean very well they left the used tissues at their places Carpet in the room is not clean and looks ugly with bad colors blue and beige Room service not English speakers Over priced rooms The front desk people need to be more kind and take care of guests Need to improve for decorations in the room I can hear an echo when i speak because it is empty, Modern style Good location near metro 1 minutes walking Good windows at front street
