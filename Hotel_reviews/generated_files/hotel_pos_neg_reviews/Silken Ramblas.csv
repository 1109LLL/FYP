411149,Silken Ramblas, Could have been a soap dish we were left one large towel short after the first day Poor bar service one evening , The pool the room the helpful staff the food 
411150,Silken Ramblas, We awoke to find a dead cockroach in our room that started to come round and had to be disposed of by myself and a maid ugh Reception were apologetic and offered to change rooms And I appreciate that this can occur in city hotels We did ask for a later check out and where told to ask upon the day of our check out where upon we were told it was not possible though had been already given to 5 other guests We were offered the shower facilities next to the gym sauna These are in an open plan area so not suitable if you wish to have privacy , breakfast good selection Swimming Pool was a nice extra to have
411151,Silken Ramblas, That not all rooms where renovated so be careful when you book I had to change rooms first time Not good with sound proofing walls so some parts of the day and evening it s a bit noisy with kids running and door slamming and water running from other rooms above , The position was great as it was just off the busy rambla and in the street where a lot of hidden small boutiques variety of vegetarian and vegan foods Reception staff was nice very clean great shower 
411152,Silken Ramblas, The hotel is outdated and in serious need of renovation The room was very datk and incredibly noisy We woke up several times a night The bathroom was dirty mold and the light makes you look like you re seriously sick The breakfast is overpriced and in an unatractive basement Staff is uninterested and not helpfull , The location is very nice and the pool is a delight Also the waiters by the pool are very friendly and helpfull 
411153,Silken Ramblas, Staff were not very friendly Room smelt of smoke No one greeted us at breakfast had to find our own table cutlery and eventually found a staff member to give our room number to , Excellent location close to the Metro Gothic Quarter and Marina Enjoyed the pool Really liked the room 115 Great wifi Breakfast was good 
411154,Silken Ramblas, Didn t get any info on arrival off the reception staff i e Breakfast served at the pool is told us our case would come to the room but never turned up so went to collect it myself Just felt that they thought we knew our way around the hotel 1st visit and was left to get on with it ,No Positive
411155,Silken Ramblas, The room was very dark with a small window toward inside covert yiard also very dark , The location one minute from Rambla The breakfast is good diverse the staff is friendly 
411156,Silken Ramblas, I was initially allocated room 223 which is dark and there is nothing pleasurable about the room I would say it has yet to be renovated as other rooms have been I think the hotel should provide drinking water without charge The location in a side street off La Rambla was central and easy for walking around the city , I asked to move from my allocated room and the request was dealt with professionally efficiently and without any hesitation The second room 403 was bright and very pleasant The staff are friendly helpful and professional The roof terrace and pool is a bonus in the city 
411157,Silken Ramblas, The room setup is strange with the sink in the room Also little mold here small cheap repairings and dirty white walls mamaged to ruin the excelence of the hotel , Great position and services Personnel very kind and helpfull at all the times 
411158,Silken Ramblas, The noise from neighbouring bedrooms and from the corridors , Bed comfortable Bedroom walls paper thin Sound proofing would be an advantage Didn t book breakfast as the price of 18 90 per person per morning was too expensive Lovely breakfast for less than half the price nearby in small restaurants 
411159,Silken Ramblas,No Negative, Location was fabulous Very central but not noisy Booked a family room and stayed in 2 generous sized rooms with 2 bathrooms and a large patio area Much more than we expected 
411160,Silken Ramblas, Need more hangers in wardrobes Would have liked to know all the toiletries provided before hand as would ve saved some packing , Excellent hotel great location reception staff were very helpful Rooms have a handy safe air con very comfy beds are very spacious we had a family room so enough room for 4 comfortably Just need more hangers in the wardrobes Plenty of toiletries provided would have been handy to know before hand what was provided Would definitely stay again 
411161,Silken Ramblas, The room s decor was dated lots of dark wood which was scuffed etc which then didn t really make me feel like I was in a four star bedroom We had a power cut too which meant I couldn t use the jacuzzi No iron in the room which was a shame My bed was a double but unfortunately was in fact two singles put together one of which was very lopsided Check out took a long time and there was a queue behind me as only one member of staff was there My entry card for my room kept failing which was really annoying as they re apparently affected by being stored near a phone or bank card Rooms were quite noisy could hear other guests talking and their tv , A 30 second walk to La Rambla which was ideal a big selling point Hotel was very clean Breakfast room was nice with lots of tasty choices Room was upgraded so had a nice sun terrace with loungers and a jacuzzi Good hair dryer in the room well stocked mini bar safe and espresso machine General decor in hotel was modern Staff were helpful Also had a rooftop terrace and pool which looked nice plus a gym and sauna 12pm check out is always good too 
411162,Silken Ramblas, We had a 1st floor room which was very noisy in hindsite we should have asked to be moved to a higher floor which I m sure would not have been an issue , A good location just off La Ramblas taxi ranks just outside bus metro a 5 minute walk The staff were 1st rate large room with a powerful hot shower comfortable beds the a c worked a treat the food was 1st class the rooftop pool was a godsend in the heat 
411163,Silken Ramblas,No Negative, Amazing location especially handy if you are new to Barcelona and wanting to be close to everything and get your bearings quickly Staff couldn t have been more helpful and friendly Hotel isn t as modern as some people may like but if you re going to Barcelona why would you want to be in the hotel all the time Comfy beds and our room was upgraded on arrival I would definitely return
411164,Silken Ramblas, Room very tired bathroom in need of total refurbishment bath had no enamel left on and the surface was rough all over I even rubbed the skin off my elbow on it Room had no view could see only the side of a building , Staff very good Excellent position
411165,Silken Ramblas, it is not even 4 star hotel Bad staff and customer services Not clean and not clean The staff not smiling Check in and out took an ages, Nothing
411166,Silken Ramblas, Room was too noisy , Perfect location easy to get there from the airport aerobus in between the metro Plaza Catalunya where all city tours depart from and the Gothic neighborhood where you can easily enjoy yourself around on foot and find great restaurants and caf s Also walking distance from the beach 
411167,Silken Ramblas, Having a swimming pool is a very very big plus but it was absolutely ice cold water Consolation is that there is a very nice sauna to warm yourself in afterwards , Location was awesome Front counter staff were always very helpful with always at least 2 people available to deal with all kinds of queries and questions Breakfast was very good and the hotel itself was very nice and comfortable too 
411168,Silken Ramblas, The only complaint is that the bathroom is slightly dim but otherwise no complaints , The location was great Just slightly away from the noisy ramblas but still in the heart of the city The staff were helpful and friendly The facilities were good It was an enjoyable stay 
411169,Silken Ramblas, The walls are very thin and you can hear everything you neighbours are doing Every time they knocked on one of the doors near by I had to check if it was mine , The location The staff we super friendly too 
411170,Silken Ramblas, The size of the room Had 2 rooms as no family room triple room was tiny 3 single beds squished beside each other very little space in the room The view was onto the brick wall with graffiti so dark and dinghy Door was right beside the door of the lift so a lot of trafic and noise and no privacy , I loved the hotel great location Only negative for us was the rooms 
411171,Silken Ramblas, The hotel is poor I hated everything there the place so old and dirty we found a cockroach in the room The place inside and the furniture are way too different that the pictures here I booked for ten nights but I left the hotel from the first night ,No Positive
411172,Silken Ramblas, unclean rooms smelly corridors really noisy broken furniture in rooms, Breakfast was the one good thing about this hotel other than that this hotel isn t coming close to being a 4 star hotel its more suitable to be title cheap motel with a 4star hotel breakfast
411173,Silken Ramblas, Cleanness no complaints The only thing is smelling in the bathroom ventilation is working only with light on so we needed to hold on lighting there constantly Facilities in the hotel swimming pool is open air on the roof terrace so not in use for March vacation Sauna didn t go hot after one hour heating minimalism in the room, Location actually the best Central and on the side street 2 min from Ramblas 5 min from metro Noise we were on the very quiet back side but the front side shouldn t be noisy as well it is narrow side street Room our 419 was 25 27 sq m l chose this hotel also for its rooms of 24 m to compare with some others where rooms are 16 18 m Facilities in the room all that s needed fridge minibar kettle but coffee machine is missing Breakfast Excellent fabulous every word is suitable Salmon several kinds of pastrami sausages cold hot cheeses side dishes many fruits deserts etc I don t remember 5 hotel with such breakfast Service staff very helpful for various requests Silvia if I remember right the name on her badge spent 10 min to find the info I needed about restaurant BTW one of her recommendations 4GATS really worth a try 
411174,Silken Ramblas, The room was cold Spring March We were given a mobile heater to use as room only had air con no heating system despite it being cold and rainy weather The walls were thin and noise could be heard Lighting was very poor in room A light over the mirror would have helped The room was adequate bathroom in need of refurbishment The bar area was cold to sit in too cold for air con Weather needs to be gaged for correct room temperature , This hotel was recommended to us for its location The staff were excellent and quick to put things right ie when lights went out maintenance arrived speedily The lobby bar smelt and looked good I believe the hotel has already began refurbishing rooms Once all rooms have had a make over I am sure this hotel will be in much demand Very courteous staff 
411175,Silken Ramblas, Stayed for 3 days and only cleaned room once Hotel is a bit tired Staff made you feel like they were doing you a favour by just showing up If wanted a drink at the bar you literally had to search for someone to serve you and when you found them let s just say it wasn t service with a smile Disappointed , Location of the property was excellent 
411176,Silken Ramblas, It appears some rooms had been refurbished Our room was a good standard clean and well equipped with good beds and bedding but in need of refurbishment overall especially in the bathroom, Superb location Good breakfast
411177,Silken Ramblas, Blood stains on sheets room not cleaned with dirt and dust in most places Window was not closing proberly so noise was an issue And walls were paper thin where we could hear the conversations of our neighbors Very disappointed would not recommend this hotel,No Positive
411178,Silken Ramblas, could do with a little up dating in the rooms and walls very thin could hear a lot from other rooms hallway, bed was comfy and reception area and bar really nice
411179,Silken Ramblas, The hotel is unloved Cleaning once away from reception is at best superficial There were ingrained stains on the bathroom floor room 102 Bath water etc from floors above flows down pipes boxed into the room At time it s like camping by a waterfall The single beds are on casters and sit on hard floors when turning over in ones sleep demonstrates the for every action there is a opposite reaction resulting in the beds colliding When booking I did not realise it was the same hotel I stayed in about 10 years ago The above except the water fall we were on a higher floor comments suit either Shame all it need is determined management Harry Streets, The location car parking good value 
411180,Silken Ramblas, Cleaners walked into our room when my boyfriend was getting changed When we told the reception to avoid it happening again they barely replied Just an embarrassing moment ,No Positive
411181,Silken Ramblas,No Negative, Can t thank the staff enough x had an incident on holiday and they were so caring and helped my hubby so well early hours of morning went to the trouble of writing an incident report So clean and great size bed for extra comfort Thankyou all the Silken
411182,Silken Ramblas, The hotel is far to overpriced the rooms are average at best the hotel is in need of upgrade in decor This is the first hotel that I have ever stayed in that has no iron for the guest But they do have an ironing service that is a complete rip off the mini bar is ridiculous for example a small pack of Pringles 4 80 the hall ways carpets are filthy When bookin this hotel the pictures looked amazing it gives u the impression that there a swimming pool and roof terrace only to find out that the swimming pool is at another hotel over all this hotel is at best a 3 , Location of hotel is good 
411183,Silken Ramblas, Although I enquired with reception about how I could control the temperature in the room as I had read the instructions in the in room guide to set the temperature and fan speed The member of staff said this did not work in any room and the room temperature was set centrally I asked how I should keep comfortable He says the appliance should be switched off even though it was hot I said before I switched it on But next night though switched off and window open only slightly as had a security chain on it the temperature was still excessive Third and final night the staff member said it should be cooler as the outside temperature was going to be cooler 13 C felt like 23 C we had window open as before Didn t sleep PLUSthe noise from the corridor after 12 midnight and from out side all in all created a bad night yet again The member of staff said I could fill in an opinion form to get things changed But this didn t help ME A big shame as could have changed the three night break for the better Great city good tourist attractions and food shopping Luzia son same street was outstanding, The bed was comfortable and the room was adequate the location great and entrance impressive BUT the temperature in the room in February was so hot we were sweating all night The noise from the corridor felt like the walls were paper thin There was understandably noise from outside also as we Had to have the window open to get a little relief from temperature in the room but this was not ideal
411184,Silken Ramblas, All family rooms have no outlooking windows They are dark and badly ventilated This is not a cheap hotel but the family room is really not good for this price I have been told smaller rooms are better though , Good location close to major attractions subway and shopping However be aware that Rambla street is not for families after midnight 
411185,Silken Ramblas, Unable to maintain room temperature Thermostat didn t work room was very warm First told to leave window open which was a safety concern then hotel provided a fan which helped , Location excellent Breakfast was good
411186,Silken Ramblas, This year we were given a room that it windows was on other rooms in the hotel I don t know what its called and some of the guests were noisy and really made lots of sounds some even said hi from there window to me , This was our second year staying at this hotel The main reason we chose the hotel again was it proximity to LaRamblas and accessibility There plenty of other hotel around that area but for a 4 star hotel with that rate I think it was a great offer 
411187,Silken Ramblas, One thing i find with many European Hotels is that during winter the rooms can be a little over warm and stuffy The room i stayed in had a balcony and i slept with the door open to have some air movement, Location is very good 
411188,Silken Ramblas, When they didn t see I requested for double bed and upper storey But it got fixed when I pointed it out, The big double bed So comfortable My room was amazing 
411189,Silken Ramblas, Room was a little too warm Beds shift a lot, Great location Close enough to Las Ramblas to be part of the experience but far enough to avoid the loud streets at night Friendly staff Modern decor that is well maintained
411190,Silken Ramblas, Sometimes was noisy in the hotel the doors are noisy to lock and open , The location of the hotel was excellent Very hepful staff good clean rooms and services comfortable beds 
411191,Silken Ramblas, Isolation isn t great loud cleaning staff making noise early in the morning loud calling and so forth I could hear everything that was going on outside my door and in other rooms A cleaner entered my room while I was sleeping not OK Also you constantly hear doors slamming from other rooms TV didn t work , Great front desk employees helpful and kind Great location 
411192,Silken Ramblas, We stayed in room 114 and very noisy from out side and opposite the cleaning store room lots of banging and shouting, The hotel is very clean and looks lovely
411193,Silken Ramblas, Noise from other guests in halls and other rooms , Great location one block off Las Ramblas within easy walking distance of many major sights not to mention taxi stands and subways stations for more distant destinations Nice comfortable facilities at a very reasonable price 
411194,Silken Ramblas, No negatives No issues, Excellent location for las ramblas and 2 metro stations friendly professional staff Good choice at breakfast standard bedroom very big for a city centre hotel Very clean Would recommend this hotel to all travellers
411195,Silken Ramblas, This hotel is out of date and overpriced like every hotel staff there are the ones that go out of their way to please the guest then there are the ones that couldn t be bothered to do anything This hotel had the same Location is perfect but sometimes comfort and hospitality are more important , The location and breakfast was superb
411196,Silken Ramblas, Cleanliness could be better Rooms are not being mobbed only changing sheets Wifi is pathetic you have to connect every time and a lot of times we were cut off with no reason Size of room is good but we can hear every single thing happening in the next room , Staff were very friendly and helpful Location is amazing Restaurant and food were good Rooms are spacious 
411197,Silken Ramblas, very noisy inside doors a lot of bad customers no education no quietness no respect for the other guests and outside not even strengthened window glass protection in such area consequently very bad value for money, location staff
411198,Silken Ramblas, Receptionist were ok but didn t go out of their way Air conditioning was very poor happy I went in December not the summer Room was next to lift so at times very noisy but not a big issue Wifi did work most of the time but had to sign back in everytime , Great location Bathroom was very big clean Room was nice a small fridge safe were very useful TV with a few English speaking channels was a bonus Comfortable bed 
411199,Silken Ramblas, The walls are paper thin so you can hear everything from the room next door, The fabulous location comfortable rooms excellent breakfast extra touches e g toothbrush tissues in the bathroom
411200,Silken Ramblas,No Negative, Friendly happy staff always willing to help huge beds staff went way beyond to help great buffet breakfast gluten free selection clean quite rooms right in the middle of every thing

411202,Silken Ramblas, Old fashion and untidy hotel Rooms had strange smell and a lot of furniture decor were broken , Breakfast was really good and the location is great 
411203,Silken Ramblas, Room was shabby in urgent need of a facelift The sauna was closed when we wanted to use it and no towels available The information sent via email before we left said that the pool would be closed for maintenance but then found it was open The first morning I went to make a cup of tea and the milk had gone off which put me off making anymore Liptons breakfast teabags would have been nice Our friends complained about their room when they arrived and were upgraded to a larger suite and still paid the same money as us , The beds were comfortable and the location was good Staff were pleasant and the sweets were a good added touch 
411204,Silken Ramblas, The rooms were very dark and uninviting with no views and the sound proofing between guest rooms was appalling as you could hear everything , The location was excellent and the quality and variety of food for breakfast was supberb
411205,Silken Ramblas, The Hotel was very noisy during the day because of the renovation that takes place on the 4 th floor Obviously it is needed but in all such cases the travellers should be warned prior to the booking And the Hotel was even more noisy during the night because of the shutting noises of the doors The wifi is not secured The sauna should be refurbished just like the fittness area At this point Silken Ramblas is rather a 3 star hotel , Location of the Silken Ramblas is excellent Well furnished lobby and nice staff at the Reception The Roof Terrace is fantastic 
411206,Silken Ramblas, The room was smelly It looked out onto a wall There was building going on Drilling Hammering So not at all restful The hotel room was just worn out Old There were stains on the lampshades even chunks missing from the doors The place needs an upgrade I was quite disappointed ,No Positive
411207,Silken Ramblas, Tiles around pool area were a bit loose, Very modern hotel in convenient location to get around in Barcelona Also has a pool with sunloungers fab to chill at after a hard day sightseeing
411208,Silken Ramblas, We had trouble with the toilets 1st room had a toilet with a very bad smell 2nd room we were moved to had a sink that flooded , Perfect location Simple nice and comfortable Helpful staff Good value for money 
411209,Silken Ramblas, Could hear everything in next rooms Doors slam when closing which wakes you up Could hear people in the next room talking having a shower etc etc Everything Not good when you have children with you Some staff at reception were not helpful at all Told us to look at the leaflets near the entrance and when we said there wasn t one for that particular attraction there he just looked and walked away , Large room Comfy beds Great location

411212,Silken Ramblas, The room was very noisy with building work going on next door which no apologies were made also we could hear the people in the gym next door the telly didn t work the coffee machine was broken we asked for a kettle which was extremely dangers as the plug didn t detached and burnt ourselves on several occasions trying to unplug it the bath was very old and stained and thats what we had paid a lot more for and again dangerous even to fill it as the plug was positioned over the far side of the bath THE staff were not very helpful waited over half hour for a drink at the bar never went again Breakfast was not very inviting cold eggs and coffee bland never went again got better quality and service on the rambles , The location
411213,Silken Ramblas, Extremely overpriced for the quality of hotel Was given an old musty room and had to request to be moved to a renovated room same price as we paid Food very poor , Location
411214,Silken Ramblas, The hotel room was rather sad and worn Dark colours The key system wasn t working throughout the hotel which meant we had to be escorted to our room every time We sometimes had to wait up to 10 mins Not acceptable for a 4 hotel , The bed was very big and comfortable 
411215,Silken Ramblas, Room was right beside lift so quite noisy Disappointed roof top bar not open I have stayed at another hotel in Barcelona at the same time of year and the rooftop bar was open , Comfy beds Friendly staff Great location

411219,Silken Ramblas, The room service and mini bar were expensive If it was more reasonably priced we would have used it , Clean modern and in a great location Staff were helpful and took care of out luggage while we explored The bed was huge Q
411220,Silken Ramblas, Overpriced for what it is but that is Barcelona Staff were rather unfriendly which we haven t experienced before in Spain Overall this hotel was ok , Good location easy access to all you would want to see either on foot or via metro 
411221,Silken Ramblas, Attitude of receptionist Carmen who refused to acknowledge the rooms were dirty especially bathrooms We had five rooms in our group four were dirty , The general manager was amazing who resolved issues her name was Isabelle lovely lady and receptionist Jean Louis Nice reception area and great location 
411222,Silken Ramblas, outside of the communal part of the hotel everything was very shabby and no where near 4 stars the bathrooms were very dated and not very clean towels were stained everthing was very cheap and poor quality the price was outrageous, location was very central
411223,Silken Ramblas, Dated rooms without character decent reception area promises more than it delivers make sure you dont get a room near the lifts, Great location close to metro bus marina
411224,Silken Ramblas, Room was a glorified box no day light entrance door opened straight onto the bed shower and bath cramped Stayed in a lot better places for a lot less ,No Positive
411225,Silken Ramblas, Noise from the elevators was loud at times Having a small bath with a Shower inside was a bit akward Also seemed to be some inconsistency in the rooms across my group Was as if all other rooms had been renovated except ours , Having a pool was good Beds were comfortable 
411226,Silken Ramblas, Family with young child given a smoking room not a nice odour we were given another room without a problem , Excellant location for short trip Staff were Excellant
411227,Silken Ramblas, The hotel does not have double beds despite what they say it s 2 single beds pushed together which creates a gap through the night that someone falls in Pool towels can only be obtained from reception on the ground floor not at the pool on level 5 You have to leave a 10euro deposit for a towel cash only how ridiculous ,No Positive
411228,Silken Ramblas, The rooms could have been more clean furniture was bit outdated and bathroom could have been cleaner, Located in an area where it was vibrant From food restaurants to clubs beach is close by The hotel first views was vey clean and luxurious Rooftop with swimming pool and small bar 
411229,Silken Ramblas, Stayed here in October found staff not very friendly Rooms not ready 5 rooms family vacation Needs some maintenance and repairs in the rooms , Location was perfect
411230,Silken Ramblas, Our rooms were cramped and the window didnt close easily Heard a lot of street noise when we were trying to sleep Beds were very uncomfortable There was always a faint smell of sewer in the building Did not like the darken hallways Rooms with children were next to impossible to get a good nights sleep Walls very thin and could not filter out peoples conversations and activities, The staff was great They worked well together 
411231,Silken Ramblas, The poor guy who was trying to serve in the dining room and the outside bar was run off his feet he was likeable and I felt as though I should jump up and help him , Reception Manager very friendly and helpful 
411232,Silken Ramblas, More towels by the pool twice we went for a late swim and there were no towels left, Lovely cool room to return to after sightseeing in the scorching sun

411239,Silken Ramblas, Bathroom bedroom furniture looking a bit tired , Staff were extremely helpful pool area ideal after a hot day sight seeing location perfect Comfortable beds clean sheets every day blackout curtains all contributed to lots of good sleep 
411240,Silken Ramblas, Thin walls, The beds are firm but very comfortable The location is excellent with Las Ramblas and El Raval on the door step and El Bourn and the Harbour only 10 mins walk away The location lends itself to being noisy at night and yes the walls a thin but ear plugs and the black out blinds will have you sleeping like a teenager 
411241,Silken Ramblas, the room furniture was older than me and the cleaners and handyman need a lesson or two to say the least Just needed a bed to crash on but I d expect more for the price I paid bearing the stars it s been given, location
411242,Silken Ramblas,No Negative, Everything was excellent aside from our room was without a balcony so was no natural light As it was a short stay i didnt ask to chamge but definetly would of it i was staying longer Room 221 a very noisey vent outside window aswell 
411243,Silken Ramblas, We really hated being so close to the street in our room as every morning around 6am we were woken by delivery drivers unloading boxes deliveries being wheeled in and out and the sound of glass bottles being emptied into a truck It was unbearably noisy I wish we had complained but we just put up with it as we thought it was a one off but it happened each morning , Daily maid clean Friendly and helpful reception staff Fantastic location Contemporary d cor Easy to find so close to Pla a Catalu a it was literally around the corner Bar Lobo was an excellent place on the corner for food and drink Comfy beds and a spacious room Great safe
411244,Silken Ramblas, No atmosphere about the hotel the restaurant always empty the bar was empty and poorly stocked the rooms and in particular the bathrooms were outdated and very poor The swimming pool was always deserted Generally the hotel is not worthy of its 4 star status,No Positive
411245,Silken Ramblas, On this occasion the view from my hotel was non existent a brick wall seemed to be the inside of the hotel Saying that the hotel was on a street off la rambla and we were never going to have a view to die for anyway, The location was perfect Lovely hotel and very friendly staff Would definitely consider staying at the same place if I was to ever visit Barcelona again It was also nice and quiet and the roof top pool was very nice
411246,Silken Ramblas, The doors into the room where heavy and you could hear everyone coming into their rooms att night and banging the doors to close them You could here everyone in their rooms and also everyone that was walking in the corridor The cleaning of the room was so so Also bad that they didn t open in the morning until 10 at the gym if you wanted to do some exercise on the roof terrass after jogging you couldn t get up there , Location very good Beds ok Breakfast good
411247,Silken Ramblas, The AC in the room was not the best, Excellent location and a good standard Very nice to be welcommed with acomplimentary drink at the roof top bar Very quiet room which is good after a day in the buzz of BCN
411248,Silken Ramblas, As already mentioned we liked NOTHING The hotel is NOT CLEAN IS NOT QUIET EVERYTHING IS OLD THE TOWELS ARE GREY THE BATHROOM STINKS THE CLEANING LADIES BOUNCED ALL DOORS EVERY MORNING ETC THE RECEPTIONER when we checked in was very unpolite She didn t care that we wanted a double room and a QUIET one She lied to us In a nutshell it was the most terrible holiday because of this hotel An advice for you booking com please do not cheat with these perfect conditions and for the travelers choose another hotel , We liked NOTHING It is not a 4 hotel Only the fare is 4 nothing else Booking com disappointed us this time because you sold it as a 4 perfect hotel It is not true We were already in Barcelona 3 times but we have never stayed in such an old grey terrible hotel SO for the future please do not offer wrong information about such hotels 
411249,Silken Ramblas, Cleanliness of room was disappointing Lots of hairs left from previous guest Generally the hotel is tired and needs a refurbishment , Really comfy bed free room upgrade to suite on arrival 
411250,Silken Ramblas, I wished I could have stayed longer , The bed was huge the staff wonderfully helpful even organising trips The breakfast was superb with different options for different budgets and tastes
411251,Silken Ramblas, very noisy could hear couple in next room noisy road outside woken by revellers bin wagon garage doors suitcases dragged along , comfy bed good staff
411252,Silken Ramblas, My room 421 was not cleaned for one day When I booked I asked for a quiet room and was given an upgraded room overlooking the street but fortunately I was able to change room later The door of room 421 does not close properly Breakfast start time is too late at week ends 08 00 , Very good location good breakfast helpful and polite staff 
411253,Silken Ramblas, The sundeck pool area probably depending upon who was on duty occasionally had loud awful music from a radio with extremely irritating DJ very reminiscent of Benidorm, Just a very good hotel with friendly and helpful staff The sun deck in the middle of a very busy city very useful to recharge one s batteries in between great sight seeing
411254,Silken Ramblas, Room a little cleaner but were otherwise excellent , Location was brilliant Breakfast was excellent just a shame we didn t get back to try the evening meal Staff were pleasant and helpful and overall the hotel we would recommend 
411255,Silken Ramblas, Rooms could do with better soundproofing could hear the adjacent room occupants too clearly , Prime location Staff very friendly and helpful Very clean Good breakfast selection 
411256,Silken Ramblas, The rooms were quite dark due to the long thin nature of the building this allowed little natural light into the room , Very large and comfortable beds 
411257,Silken Ramblas, Silken Ramblas is a self proclaimed Luxury Hotel which could not be further from the truth Every morning you can hear the cleaners chatting loudly and laughing at unacceptable times Furthermore there are constant building work and you can hear drilling and doors slamming from 8AM until at least midday would not return , Fair size for a party of 3
411258,Silken Ramblas, We booked a room with king size bed we received two joined beds that slipped aside so first night was unpleasant We asked to change the room and we was moved in a better one In both rooms the bathroom floor was not so clean , Excelent location near Placa Catalunya and Boqueria Good and frendly staff 
411259,Silken Ramblas,No Negative, Very nice hotel in a perfect location the staff is very friendly and helpful the breakfast is very good and plenty of it had the Ramblas breakfast every day and could not finish it the noise from the streets didn t bother me people enjoy their life 
411260,Silken Ramblas, The shower had no power in the morning I mentioned it to desk at check out, Very friendly staff who upgraded our room because we indicated we were newly wed Location is simply perfect Good hotel 
411261,Silken Ramblas, Overall a bit old hotel although one can see some improvements have been made recently Some noise at night on the back street but I think this might be usual on the Ramblas area Breakfast very expensive so I took it in a cafeteria just in front of the hotel, Very near the Ramblas I was upgraded to a very spacious and well equipped junior suite
411262,Silken Ramblas, Paper thin walls made it noisy in next room Handbook not up to date with instructions on safe and telephone numbers for reception etc, Breakfast Staff diligent
411263,Silken Ramblas, Very noisy corridor doors and could hear people in next room because of location which was great we had night time noise like bins being emptied at 2 30 am, Very clean and modern and staff more than helpful
411264,Silken Ramblas, Very Noisy neighbours thin walls grumpy bar staff Bar shut at 12 midnight on Saturday Could and should be cleaner needs a bit of an uplift , The breakfast Close to las Ramblas 
411265,Silken Ramblas, room was dirty the bathroom was awful for a 4 star hotel Dirty towels Broken shower No toilet roll stayed s couple of nights as a family of 3 Their was soooooooo much noise from the rooms next door children running in the hallways up until late kept disturbing my 5 month old bedding wasn t fresh bed was awful to sleep on cramped room room service was a minimum 40 minute wait rude staff at the reception tried overcharging a couple of times until I showed them the recipet as proof I had paid car parking charge very pricey room dirty wouldn t stay here again, The only thing I liked about this hotel was that it was literally 30 seconds away from la ramblas Perfect location 
411266,Silken Ramblas, Neither room had air conditioning Whilst it was only March we had three lovel days and the room was very warm Our room was also right next to the lifts which made it noisy but nothing too bad , Great location and the staff were great Happily provided an adaptor plug as we had forgotten and have lots of helpful advice 
411267,Silken Ramblas,No Negative, The hotel is in a fantastic location less than 5 minutes walk from the Plaza Catalunya and just metres away from Las Ramblas yet still quiet inside The public areas of the hotel were modern and stylish but the guest bedrooms were a little dated but perfectly adequate Staff were very pleasant and eager to help It wasn t warm enough to use the swimming pool during my visit but would envisage it being great during the summer Would happily recommend the hotel and would certainly stay there again 
411268,Silken Ramblas, We re in room 502 walls must be paper thin were kept awake on 2 nights out of three by noise from room 501 Had to ring reception on night two to get some sleep even normal conversation came through loud and clear , Staff were attentive and friendly
411269,Silken Ramblas, 1 there is no AC 2 there no privacy I can hear the sound and movement of nearest room 3 the internet connection very very slowley, Nothing at all
411270,Silken Ramblas, Thought it strange that when we ordered the Ramblas breakfast at 12 50 we were told it was a large breakfast which might be too much for us and it was suggested we try the 18 50 Buffet breakfast and then could choose exactly what we wanted As we couldn t eat all the 12 50 breakfast was surprised as to the logic of serving yourself for more money and less food , Disappointed we didn t get requested double bed but the beds were very comfortable and breakfast food plentiful Service throughout stay excellent 
411271,Silken Ramblas, Some of the facilities did not work like the air conditioning and the extract fan from the bathroom but as it was early spring this was not much of a problem However it would have been had it been warmer weather Also with the window open there was a lot of noise from the nearby streets until the early hours of the morning which was a bit of a problem for some of our party , The location was great for a short city break The hotel is just off La Ramblas and it was perfect for walking to both the old city and the new as well as the Marina Metro stations were nearby and so were taxi ranks 
411272,Silken Ramblas, The rooms we had to change two times was ok as such but there was no working fan The walls were like paper you could hear almost everything from closest neighbour , The location of the hotel was excellent The service from the staff and the rich breakfast was very good 
411273,Silken Ramblas, I got the most expensive room in the hotel with a big balcony but the balcony had wires coming out of the wall cheap furnitures like a plastic table and chairs and everything was very dirty as if they hadn t cleaned them for a week at least The AC was off in the whole hotel because of the winter but I could not sleep because it was simply too hot I tried to contact them but they said I should just leave the window open I woke up every day very early sweating an absurd for a 150 euros a night room The furniture on the room was old and completely minimal If I had paid around 70 euros I would gladly review it positively but the best thing should have been the balcony and that was dirty and not comfy at all a waste of money Not to mention the facilities at the hotel as the elevators Panels broken with buttons falling off entrance hall and all that were simply too old Not worth at all as there are other hotels even cheaper that are way better Would NEVER recommend, Location was very good very close to Las Ramblas The staff was friendly 
411274,Silken Ramblas, The rooms smelt of sewage We advised the reception who indicated there had been a problem They said they would inspect the room and deal with the problem When we returned to the hotel at midnight the rooms still stunk of raw sewage Unhappy There was a view from both rooms onto a concrete wall painted with childlike images No VIEW whatsoever The area in front of the bedroom Windows was strewn with cigarette ends These rooms were not as advertised on Booking com site I am very unhappy and will not use Booking com until this matter is resolved in full, Nothing
411275,Silken Ramblas, The hotel room doors are on a spring and all day and night as people came and went the doors slam that hard that they wake you up , The hotel was in a great position to explore the city of Barcelona the staff were helpful and friendly and the room was very quiet and clean We have stayed in this hotel before and enjoyed our second stay as much as our first 
411276,Silken Ramblas, Room 223 has a door connecting this room with next one without any isolation I wake up at the night because neighbours coming home late and so that happens for two consecutive nights Sound of flashing water in the toilet coming from the other floors have been so loud that seems floating is starting , Location and breakfast
411277,Silken Ramblas, I have stayed in many 4 stars hotel around Europe i think this hotel needs to do lot of extra work to live up to 4 star hotel I would not personally rate this hotel as 4 but rather 3 The breakfast for theee days was the same and didnt change , The hotels location is in the heart of the la rambla street which is central to many other attractions 
411278,Silken Ramblas,No Negative, All excellent staff were very friendly and helpful Rooms were spacious and very clean Cannot fault it in any way We were travelling with our disabled son and they went out of their way to make our stay a good one 
411279,Silken Ramblas,No Negative, Lovely staff with a perfect location for sight seeing Great sized room with king bed even though had only booked for a double the gentleman on the check in desk gave us the option for free 
411280,Silken Ramblas, The fixtures in the room were very shabby The door was hanging off the mini fridge also the drawer was broken on the bedside locker Also the cover at the end of the bed had small stains all over it , The location is excellent
411281,Silken Ramblas, Nothing, We stayed here after a cruise as the hotel the cruise company had booked was awful so we didn t stay and I booked this two hours before arriving Located in a side street off Las Ramblas the location is fantastic The room was large with a huge comfy bed Fully equipped bathroom and plenty of storage space We are retuning in October with family This is a gem of a hotel 
411282,Silken Ramblas, Loud outside noise during the night Sound proof of the room could have been better , Very convenient location to start exploring Barcelona Really helpful and kind personnel 
411283,Silken Ramblas, Air condition in the room was not adjustable too hot noice from the street during the night was terrible , Perfect location friendly staff clean and modern hotel 
411284,Silken Ramblas, Paper thin walls you could hear everything from both rooms either side and tha traffic noise was unbearable This was offered as a 4 hotel but was a 2 in our opinion we have stayed all over the world in many hotels and this wasn t the worst just poor value for money and certainly not as advertised , It was a good location
411285,Silken Ramblas, Bathrooms a tad grubby Works going on next door when we stayed so sometimes noisy , Excellent location Comfortable Room Staff friendly and helpful 
411286,Silken Ramblas, Nothing really, Central location great hotel Staff excellent Little noisy at time but when you consider the location it wasn t too bad Definitely go for the breakfast well worth it 
411287,Silken Ramblas, For a rather expensive hotel I found the amenities a bit sparse There was for instance no shower cap maybe a trivial thing but nevertheless The breakfast buffet was rather expensive some 18 euro A big cup of cappuccino and a croissant at Starbuck s just around the corner cost only 5 euro less than 3 if you go to one of the local caf s , The hotel is situated within easy reach of La Rambla Barric Gothic the old town and various other highlights the Metro and the airport bus The hotel itself is very spacious and modern as was my double room very comfy 
411288,Silken Ramblas, Breakfast was expensive We got charged the highest rate of 3 and were given no choice in the matter , We were upgraded to a larger room on arrival Good garage facilities 
411289,Silken Ramblas, Nothing, Excellent hotel Excellent location close to all the major sights the staff were kind and helpful to every question and excellent service room spacious and equipped with all you need They upgraded the room to Junior Suite which added greatly to our comfort Our room had a coffee maker we asked for tea kettle within 10 minutes we received Very good breakfast with a wide selection of items Special thanks to Mr Hector Garcia for excellent service always helpful very polite Sure we will return to this hotel our next visit in Barcelona
411290,Silken Ramblas, Beds were a bit bad for back The noise of doors closing and toilets flushing etc of other rooms were a bit loud , Location was good hotel was clean Staff were nice 
411291,Silken Ramblas, Overrated as 4 star probably a 3 star in comparison to current 4 star hotels Facilities in the room are primitive This hotel may have been a 4 star when it started in the 90 s , Friendly and helpful staff who catered to all our needs 
411292,Silken Ramblas, Noise from the streets Tight bathroom Museums Gaudi and other major attractions were a bit far if you prefer walking , Close to Las Rambla and many good choices restaurants Underground parking at the hotel Close to public transportations 
411293,Silken Ramblas,No Negative, Location is excellent Hotel facilities and room were very good Roof top pool would be fantastic in summer Breakfast was also very good vast selection 
411294,Silken Ramblas, The smell the whole hotel seems to be full of some kind of intense room spray perfume It starts as soon as you walk into reception Probably to cover up the slight drainage smell that is lingering in the background I had to ask them not to spray my room after they clean because it was so strong and giving me a headache You pay for the location although it is too much for what you get and doesn t meet up to the four stars Electric sockets that are very loose hence the light switch on one side of bed also not working I had to body push the door every time I wanted to open and close it window was facing to a building site with very little light and a lot of noise coming in the walls seem paper thin you can hear people talking snoring flushing toilets any of the 4 elevators beeping everytime somebody arrives on your floor Even a seam of light at night along the wall above the wardrobe when my room is dark and the light is on in the room next door Also the coat hangers in the wardrobe couldn t hold anything heavier than a shirt without falling off I kept finding my coat on the floor , The location is good if you want to be close to the busy Ramblas The staff is very friendly Breakfast is great Except the coffee but there are plenty good cafe s around the corner 
411295,Silken Ramblas, Not a cosy place to stay with only a small bar in the reception area Breakfast and breakfast area was acceptballe and no more than that , location
411296,Silken Ramblas, Not a bad experience but soundproofing of rooms poor Could hear next door room conversations, Excellent location and in quiet street off main street Helpful staff special mention for Hector 
411297,Silken Ramblas, taxi to airport running meter while we were in fact waiting in lobby and did not know he was there Charged us for 8 10 minutes we never used , I love the location staff were helpful too 
411298,Silken Ramblas, The only thing to ruin completely my stay was how incredibly thin the walls between the guest rooms are I could hear literally every conversation in every single room directly adjacent to my own with astounding clarity Alongside with the enormous bang that accompanies every door after closing in the hallway These factors let down The Silken Ramblas a lovely hotel it itself with so many other positive attributes For these reasons I would choose to stay elsewhere on my next trip to Barcelona , Every member of staff that I encountered was friendly courteous and extremely helpful The room was very clean and the beds comfortable Breakfast was fabulous 
411299,Silken Ramblas, The second floor room is a disgrace to 4 stars hotel It looks like a jail The sofa is merely scrap and Facing The door Wall The available space is suitable for store and not hotel room Luckly I managed to move to the 3rd floor with window view facing a wall The size is the same but internal arrangements is better , I liked the location only 
411300,Silken Ramblas, 7 days we couldnt sleep from the noise inside the room you can hear everything its so noisy very very noisy unbelievably noisy Bed are moving while sleeping it has wheels Ice for money the lighting in the room its so dark and very white annoying we waited till the morning to get our bags ready because we couldnt see in the night our stuff its so dark the door for our room is too heavy we need to push our bodies to open it only the location and the heater and the staff and i will never be back for sure for same hotel , Location and the Staff they are very nice and English speakers
411301,Silken Ramblas, Sound isolation between the rooms and espcially the bathrooms poor No hair conditioner in the bathroom , Location great Nice breakfast Good size rooms 
411302,Silken Ramblas, The reall not as expected picture completely different room small not convenient not clean we hear everything from room close to us noisy The electricity twice off I will never expect its 4 star hotel It deserve 2 3 star, Location
411303,Silken Ramblas, Bad sound insolation you hear what your neighbours next room are talking about The room was a bit devastated most wardrobes not able to close a lot of stuff broken Some renovation would be nice , Spacious room No street noise at all even with open window 
411304,Silken Ramblas, The Gym was badly equipped I think the space could be put to better use There is no way it could be described as a Gym , The Hotel was well located It had a swimming pool which was lovely to cool down in after spending the day sightseeing 
411305,Silken Ramblas, Nothing , Great value for Money Huge comfy beds and the rooftop pool is a real bonus I am a regular visitor to Barcelona and after finding this hotel last year I came back this year and will definitely stay here on my next visit 
411306,Silken Ramblas, The bed was too springy you could actually feel the springs Also the room smelled like smoke The elevator needs to be serviced , The location is right in the heart of things Easy walk to get to main tourist areas The staff was friendly helpful 
411307,Silken Ramblas, Everything would have been at home held together with Tennessee chrome duct tape It was shabby noisy broken the sheets had holes in as did the net curtain The wardrobe hanging rail was broken off the door didn t dead lock as broken the safe was by way of magnetic card which is not secure unlike a key code safe you program yourself the battery s inside had no lid closure on the casing I would hazard a guess judging by the rest of it not been recently changed what happens if the lose charge all of your safely or un safely as it may be possessions like passport were inaccessible The one size fits sm all weren t big enough the towels had pulled threads looked worn old The shower over the bath didn t work well as the bath was surrounded by a lower level which acted as a water catcher allowed it flood onto floor the tiles in bathroom were cracked brown bath sealant had been liberally used along all the surfaces were the said water could penetrate everything was a bodge cans in mini bar were greasy to touch , Not a lot
411308,Silken Ramblas, Unfortunately the bedroom doors are very heavy and loud when closing and don t have a soft close so can keep you awake when there are late or early check ins outs shame people aren t more considerate when leaving their rooms, Good quiet location in side street
411309,Silken Ramblas,No Negative, We were upgraded to a suite with a jacuzzi bath and a private patio just below the rooftop pool Along with the excellent location and helpful staff this was one of the best hotels I have stayed in 
411310,Silken Ramblas, The beds where to soft and the pillows to high The main switch of the lamps wasn t working properly and I found out that there where the enough plugs near the bed to recharge the mobile , The position of the hotel in the center and the staff was very nice 
411311,Silken Ramblas, the noisiest hotel I ve ever stayed in we were on the top floor the pool area rooftop garden were above us Loud noise from 8 00am till 11 30 pm even though pool shut at 10pm staff still cleaning up Doors slammed all day night Walls are paper thin Would never ever stay their again, the staff facilities were great 
411312,Silken Ramblas, Kids jumping into pool repeatedly complaint is against the parents , Ideally located being only 5 minutes walk from Aerobus terminus Super breakfast and wonderful to have the pool on the roof Hidden gem is the restaurant which apart from us was empty Excellent 3 course meal a drink for 17
