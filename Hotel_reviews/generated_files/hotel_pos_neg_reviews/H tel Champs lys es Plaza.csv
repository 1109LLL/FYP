159888,H tel Champs lys es Plaza, I wished I had more time Another 2 days would have been much better , The room was absolutely beautiful I wished with all my heart I could have stayed a little longer Service was a little slow but I think it was because Americans are accustomed to rushing Once I relaxed and let go and took the time to look at all the pretty little details and listen to the music and just be in the moment the service and the friendliness was perfect 
159889,H tel Champs lys es Plaza, My watch was taken from the room Our laundry was placed inside our suitcase which concerns me why the housekeeping staff opened it when it was closed , The room was very nice

159893,H tel Champs lys es Plaza, The tariff , This is a beautiful hotel close to Champs Elysees Ihave stayed here many times since 2006 It is very expensive and I now do not order room service or breakfast The desk is very helpful but the hotel has in my opinion become tired and not quite what it was I had the feeling that it was cutting costs perhaps due to the economic downturn like most of the hotels I revisited on my recent visit Where were the Godiver chocolates It has very high ceilings with beautiful silk curtains and a French bathroom A truly French experience and worth it if you can find a good deal All very lovely but a very expensive hotel I keep returning for past memories 
159894,H tel Champs lys es Plaza, Nothing at all , Me and my wife both newlyweds stayed here for 2 nights for a quick break after the wedding The bed was fantastic very large and comfortable for a great nights sleep The staff were very accommodating to even the smallest of requests The hotel was clean and very romantic from the old lift to the fancy lamps to the classy seats I m definitely staying here again to make use of the spa facilities which are complementary if you stay at the hotel
