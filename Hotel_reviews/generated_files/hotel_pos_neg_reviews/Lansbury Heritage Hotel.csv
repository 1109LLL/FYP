37337,Lansbury Heritage Hotel, Its noisy I had a door between my room and neigbours and i had very loud ones day and night Also the window wasnt thick since it was street side and ground floor it was noise coming from there too Surrounded by noise pretty much from every side I dont hear it once i am asleep but for people who do it would be a problem, I liked everything about property First of all it is easy to find located behind Poplar dlr and close to canary wharf Hotel is luxurious Staff was friendly especially Alexandra The room has everything tea coffee sencor lights phone u can take away w free calls and internet Internet works well Loved everything I got it for great price and value is top
37338,Lansbury Heritage Hotel, On arrival we was advised there would be a 50 holding deposit which would be returned up to 6 hours after check out but I advised staff on reception that there was nowhere on Booking com that states this I was then told from a gentleman sitting in the reception area on his laptop that in fact it does state this I later found out this man was the general manger he didn t introduce himself he was abrupt and arrogant which I felt was disappointing for such high class of hotel I was told the next day by the very helpful man on reception that he had checked Booking com and I was right it didn t state this on there So I suggest the rather rude ignorant general manager checks things out before giving incorrect information Maybe a course on customer service would be of benefit to the General Manager , Good location to canary wharf and DLR Hotel itself is lovely amazing building and rooms are to a very high standard Staff on reception were very helpful and polite 
37339,Lansbury Heritage Hotel,No Negative, Lovely hotel and the staff couldn t be nicer Room was beautiful and spotless Easy walking distance to Canary Wharf with lovely bars and restaurants Would defiantly recommend a stay here
37340,Lansbury Heritage Hotel,No Negative, I loved everything about this property from the helpfulness of the staff to how clean and fresh the facilities smell Of all the hotels I stayed at as I traveled through Amsterdam Germany Paris and Spain this property ranks as the best I have ever stayed in in Europe I will most certainly be staying there again if I ever return to London 
37341,Lansbury Heritage Hotel, Only drawback was a lack of power outlets in the bath or near a mirror to plug a hair dryer Ladies may struggle with doing their hair in the morning , Beautiful charming boutique hotel within a 10 minute walk from Canary Wharf Large contemporary comfortable rooms with high ceilings crown molding chandeliers large screen TV lots of sunlight and friendly staff A great alternative to standard corporate lodging for those with business in the area 
37342,Lansbury Heritage Hotel, There was nothing not to like about this hotel , The hotel has only recently opened and is decorated to an extremely high standard with many period features A jewel close close to Canary Wharf Staff were great too Faultless 
37343,Lansbury Heritage Hotel,No Negative, Really interesting building the room we stayed in had a mezzanine floor and would have originally formed part of the old town hall The whole hotel was decorated to a high standard The reception staff were really friendly and helped us with directions to our concert venue as the DLR was part closed Our bed was really comfortable and we had a lovely chat over breakfast with one of the owners I assumed he s a nice guy and told us loads about the building and area Breakfast was lovely and they could do more for us The horrible events of the 3rd shocked ourselves other guests and the staff and we did discuss this over breakfast which was much needed Our thoughts are with those who were affected I d like to say thank you to all members of staff who we had the pleasure of meeting and we wish you all well We look forward to returning 
37344,Lansbury Heritage Hotel, Toiletries in the bathroom were lacking no soap and air conditioning was mediocre , Very clean modern and efficient Five minute walk to the DLR was a plus The front desk was very helpful with directions and coordinating transport for guests 
37345,Lansbury Heritage Hotel, No shower cap in the bathroom Although the breakfast was nice for 12 50 I expected better and have had better Apart from that it was a very pleasant hotel and would stay again, The staff were lovely made us feel very welcome The room was very nice all mod cons and beautifully decorated and the bed was very comfy
37346,Lansbury Heritage Hotel, Room was very hot even with air con Unit was below the bed on the mezzanine so no cool air in bed at all Also could do with some info in the room everything is digital so could be confusing for some, Very friendly staff spotlessly clean beautiful hotel
37347,Lansbury Heritage Hotel, No bottle opener in room for mini bar but as soon as we asked for one the staff member brought one to our room Very happy with the service , We didn t use the restaurant so can t comment The staff at the hotel were very helpful friendly The hotel was immaculate Our room was lovely A very nice outside seating area Also we were offered free use of the sauna steam room We ll be booking to stay here again in the future 
37348,Lansbury Heritage Hotel, Didn t like the fact that the price given on booking com wasn t the price we paid as the room rate is flexible , The luxury of the rooms and the friendliness of the staff arrived early and was allowed to book in before the check in time 
37349,Lansbury Heritage Hotel, Unfortunately a faulty fire alarm was going off from 0655 am Had to go to reception to check all was ok and safe to remain unfortunate early start to a Sunday morning , Beautiful decor quiet location so close to station 
37350,Lansbury Heritage Hotel, The breakfast buffet was an odd selection of items but it tasted nice , The hotel used to be a town hall and it shows The hallways and rooms are huge and very regal looking The fixtures and fittings are so clean and shiny and look so pretty All the lights and the air conditioning are touch controlled The bed was so comfortable 
37351,Lansbury Heritage Hotel, nothing it was amazing, excellent staff very welcoming and they went over and above to accommodate our needs I was very impressed with the Handy device in the bedroom and honestly could not compliment the mattress more if I tried extremely comfortable Absolutely loved it and will be back I am always extremely picky about the shower provided at hotels and this was top notch 
37352,Lansbury Heritage Hotel, You have to use the rather complicated footbridge DLR Poplar station to reach hotel from Canary Wharf, Brand new boutique hotel 10 minutes walk from Canary Wharf Hotel had been open only 2 weeks when I stayed there It was without a doubt the most comfortable and well equipped hotel I stayed at in Canary Wharf area at a very reasonable price 
37353,Lansbury Heritage Hotel, As the place is still so new the restaurant wasnt open but the quality of the rest of the hotel and staff were fantastic so didnt really mind too much , Fantastic rooms Friendly staff 
37354,Lansbury Heritage Hotel, The location is a bit sketchy but that cannot be helped The bed was rock hard and the pillows overly stuffed Maybe because it s so new but our night of sleep wasn t great Our room was quite small even by London standards , The property was really unique and new The decor was quite tasteful The towels and robe were a very soft cotton The staff was wonderful in trying to accommodate our wishes 
37355,Lansbury Heritage Hotel, Nothing to add , Excelent hotel fantastic rooms and wonderful staff very helpful Very tasty breakfast Excelent price quality relation 100 recommended 100 will come back
37356,Lansbury Heritage Hotel, I didn t like the location No do not disturb sign to put on the door No mini bar price list The bathroom was very cold Could not put the shower on hot enough also No hair conditioner The restaurant was not open The room did not seem as big as it should have been think the bathroom may have been included in dimensions , The hotel was new and clean Spa area looked nice Dinning and bar area great The bedding was very good Liked the lighting and fittings of the hotel The staff were very nice and helpful 
37357,Lansbury Heritage Hotel, that early breakfast was not possible yet that was included in my stay Would be good if there was a possibility to cater for early breakfast especially for those travellers who have an early flight have to check out early , Bed and bathroom facilities excellent 
37358,Lansbury Heritage Hotel, Please put more teabags in the room , Brilliant all round Loved it Attentive staff
