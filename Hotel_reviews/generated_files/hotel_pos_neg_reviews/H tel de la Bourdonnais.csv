35442,H tel de la Bourdonnais, There is nothing that I didn t like other than Water pressure isn t enough at top floors Room size tiny Carpets needs changing Only single lift No onsite restaurant Only bed and breakfast Above is a the list of lack of facilities at the hotel not that I didn t like , Location location location location Next to eiffel tower just 5 minutes walking distance Well connected from underground Posh area Can even walk around middle of night fear free Room very clean and amenities of 5 star level Very helpful and accommodating staff 24 hour reception desk Supermarket next door So much good about this hotel Really enjoyed my stay
35443,H tel de la Bourdonnais, Nothing We liked everything , The staff were very accommodating The room was very clean I loved the fact that we were given a cell phone to use while we were registered guests This was a great tool to have while we were travelling It was nice to have access to the mini bar fridge in the room 
35444,H tel de la Bourdonnais, Going to hotel parking was a bit cumbersome especially when there s no temporary parking space in front of hotel But in general it was really good to have the parking Otherwise it would have been a lot problematic Construction of adjacent restaurant etc made the entrance to look a bit messy As a result breakfast was also served in a meeting room but breakfast was good though , Small boutique hotel just 500m from Eiffel tower Really well kept and with good service Room was really big junior suite and bathroom amenities best what we saw in our travel our of ten different hotels Overall really nice hotel 
35445,H tel de la Bourdonnais, Stayed here after cycling L2P At checkin was upgraded and told minibar was complimentary After that it became very disappointing The hotel is undergoing refurbishment of the bar restaurant As a result the hotel is completely dry the mini bar had only 4 soft drinks in it and you cannot order any alcoholic beverages not great when you were after a celebratory beer Room service is via an online system the hotel has arrangements to have food ordered in nothing is made onsite After ordering Italian the 45 minute guaranteed order time came and went After 55 minutes reception agreed to chase the order up 10 minutes later we were advised that due to inclement weather it would be a further 1 2 hours wait Not at all great at now 11pm Sunday night Breakfast was nice very hungry by this time albeit it was in a small cramped room with more low chairs and coffee tables rather than proper tables and chairs I presume another casualty of the refurb I suspect this is a nice hotel when fully operational but it was an expensive disappointment for us We were not aware of the refurb when booking via booking dot com if so we would have stopped elsewhere ,No Positive
35446,H tel de la Bourdonnais, The elevator shut down for almost half a day and they should have had a back up plan especially if we needed to be at our room that very moment to freshen up for another occasion , Just didn t get my free airport shuttle after checking out but they were efficient in handling transpo matters everything was on time and staff were very helpful 
35447,H tel de la Bourdonnais, carpet in the room could be cleaner, Perfect location 5 mins from the eiffel tower and 20 mins from Champs Elysee we walked everywhere in Paris and this hotel was the perfect base We were lucky to get a room on the 5th floor with a balcony facing the Eiffel Tower this made our stay so special
35448,H tel de la Bourdonnais, Bed was too hard for my liking but it was the same everywhere we stayed so must be a Europe thing, Great breakfast In a really good area that is five minutes walk to the Eiffel Tower two minutes to the Metro Found an amazing patisserie go right out the main door and I think second street on the right We also got a mobile with our room that had a city mapper app so we found our way everywhere really easily 
35449,H tel de la Bourdonnais, Need to change the carpet urgently Also more professional printed materials most paper signage ex wifi password phone signage etc was printed in house on normal paper , Great location Staff were fantastic
35450,H tel de la Bourdonnais,No Negative, The hotel is in a great location only a few minutes walk from cole Militaire Metro and a short distance to the Eiffel Tower and Les Invalides There is a supermarket next door to the hotel which was great for buying water etc Despite its location the hotel was peaceful and quiet The hotel is also in a good location for restaurants make you way to Rue Cler for a really enjoyable evening The hotel itself is pleasant We had two Executive Double Rooms which were an adequate size one room was smaller than the other but had a very large bathroom The rooms were clean and comfortable Breakfast was lovely Everything was fresh and there was a good selection All the staff from the front desk to the cleaners were a credit to the hotel very pleasant and helpful Overall we had a really lovely stay and I wouldn t hesitate in recommending this hotel or staying at it again 
35451,H tel de la Bourdonnais, Parking The hotel doesnt have its own parking so have to park nearby which is expensive , This is walking distance from Eiffle Tower Staff is very helping and always respectful Always ready to help and guide 
35452,H tel de la Bourdonnais, Coffee machine was broken in our room and was not fixed for the duration of our stay the did however offer us coffee in the lobby instead , The breakfast was fantastic The room was a good size for us and the aircon was great 
35453,H tel de la Bourdonnais, We booked a Junior Suite for quite an expensive rate and got a small dark room 1sr floor looking to the trash in the back yard We then complaint and got the same room in the sixt floor I just booked this hotel due to the great reports on booking com but having been there people must have been crazy or stayed another hotel I would not go there again there are many more hotels in Paris with a better offer , Nothing 
35454,H tel de la Bourdonnais, For the class of hotel the breakfast could be better or provide more options , Beautiful rooms great location great facilities friendly staff and close to Eiffel Tower 
35455,H tel de la Bourdonnais, Bed wasn t comfortable felt like sleeping on the floor The fridge in the room didn t keep the drinks cold don t think it worked, Location
35456,H tel de la Bourdonnais, We booked a room for two adults and a four years old child Arrived and were told at the reception we had to book a different room because the law does not allow a child to sleep with us What The room was changed without additional charges but I suspect they chose the worst room in the hotel instead it was the first floor windows had bars and practically no light inside Outside was a dirty place with lots of garbage bottles wrappings and cigarette butts tons of them We decided not to have a look thru the windows as we were not going to stay in the hotel all time but after the first night we left It was really bad experience seemed the room was dirty and we felt uncomfortable then we waked up because of a smell of food it s likely some kitchen were under the room Never again , Location only
35457,H tel de la Bourdonnais, The only complaint was the bathroom was freezing cold We had to run the shower so the steam would help heat it up , Located Ina great neighbourhood about a 5 10 minutes walk from the hop on hop off bus stops or a 20 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower There are a few gift shops a few massage parlours and a bank located on that street 
35458,H tel de la Bourdonnais, Nothing, Beautiful boutique hotel Very friendly staff who speak English There are is also a grocery store next door where you can buy groceries if you don t want to eat out Eiffel Tower could be viewed from room Had a cot in the room for a child and it was very comfortable

35460,H tel de la Bourdonnais, Breakfast is expensive for what is offered but it is served by staff who is very accommodating The room was freshened up every day by cleaning staff but we noticed that toiletries were not refreshed every day and glasses not replaced , We stay at this hotel every time we come to Paris as its location is excellent for both practical and tourist options It is close to a metro stop that is on a good line for taking you anywhere Also can easily find cash machines two grocery stores next door plenty of shopping and restaurants and the Eiffel Tower is a 5 minute walk The hotel has been very recently remodeled in a tasteful decor and the front desk staff is very helpful and friendly It is located on a busy street but the windows are extremely sound proof so it feels very quiet Plenty of lounging space in the bar breakfast area We would get a bottle wine at the grocery store next door and relax in the lounge area and have some wine before dinner the staff was very nice to bring us wine glasses on request and even uncork it for us Also recommend Booking com for reservations best pricing and reservation options we have found 
35461,H tel de la Bourdonnais,No Negative, So far this is my favourite hotel in Paris it well priced considering the location close to Eiffel Tower metro station around the corner Street full of great restaurants cafe s and next to a supermarkets that closed late not mentioning room larg size hard to find in Paris and wonderful stuff The most important things to me are the cleanness and safety even the bread crumbs under the chair got cleaned and the metro station and streets to the hotel at night was crowded lighted and alive
35462,H tel de la Bourdonnais, The room we got has a separate toilet from the shower which i find weird But that did not bother me so much at all because the experience was overall wonderful , It is the best hotel we have stayed in Paris so far The location the cleanliness of the room and the property proximity to metro grocery and Eiffel Tower the staff Everything and everyone was so lovely

35465,H tel de la Bourdonnais, This is not about the hotel The female receptionist recommended us Le Terrasse which is just across the street but it was not good at all , The breakfast was really nice

35469,H tel de la Bourdonnais, The hotel rooms need some decorating They look a little worn out The double sofa bed is not comfortable at all there was a great big dip in the middle The A C in our room was not working which meant we couldn t turn the heating up We were told it was working fine but couldn t feel any heat hence the request for extra blankets , The service of the hotel was excellent offered drinks on arrival we requested extra blankets which was given immediately Tea facilities and coffee machine bathrobe slippers hermes toiletries mini bar and free phone to use out and about which was excellent staff were very friendly and helpful fulfilling our every request The location is brilliant a few mins away from eiffel tower Metro and bus stop literally 2 mins away A supermarket right next door to hotel

35480,H tel de la Bourdonnais, Room was small for an executive room bed throw was badly creased and alarm went off at 1 00 waking us after a very long day Tea and coffee only had 1 milk , The bed was comfortable and the bathroom lovely
35481,H tel de la Bourdonnais, The only minor thing was I could not heat up my room late in the night It was really cold There was rather warm than hot water in shower after midnight Luckily this was not an issue in the morning , One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at The staff during check in was professional polite and very welcoming I had booked a classic room but was given a junior suite due to hotel being fully booked You get coffee tea amenities plus coffee machine you find Hermes in the bathroom and you are given a smartphone with mobile data which you can carry with you around the city This was pretty much handy when looking for public transport and points of interest The mattress was super firm I got to sleep very well here Breakfast was delicous staff professional as well The elevator was super quick Location is perfect ten minutes to the Eiffel Tower Overall when you enter the hotel there is such a calm ambience spa like scent and you feel happy instantly

35486,H tel de la Bourdonnais, The price of the room declared on the website is not what you are going to pay I booked my room for two nights for 465 and prepaid it online but really was charged about 490 It turned out that the hotel before charging converted the EUR amount at which I booked a room into the USD at a much higher exchange rate than the real one Then they charged my EUR bank account with an increased USD amount When I wrote to them asking to reimburse the difference they refused to do it Apparently they consider that each customer is an idiot and will not notice that or they make you pay for the commission charged by their bank or payment system even though 6 is too much of a charge It is not even for the money but the attitude which is astonishing Never came across such a hotel In my country that would be called a fraud and would make a case for the police A customer should not be cheated like that I can only image how they fool people if they do it with everyone paying online Really for a 4 star hotel that charges 230 per night that is a shame ,No Positive

35492,H tel de la Bourdonnais, Noise of children running and jumping could be heard from the floor above ours until around 3 am Although the breakfast is a very nice offering and the food was good they were out of main courses and we had to wait for more to be prepared on more than one morning , Within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower Room was larger with two twin beds and had updated decor There was an espresso machine in the room and we enjoyed the coffee

35540,H tel de la Bourdonnais, room was clean and functional but nothing amazing It felt a bit overpriced for what it is I suppose on account of its location Our room overlooked the inner court I think a street view would be much better, excellent location Staff was very friendly Was very quiet not sure if there were few guests or if sound proofing is really good 
35541,H tel de la Bourdonnais, The sound isolation is very bad we can clearly hear the traffic noise on the street Room is small , Very friendly staffs and nice service Location of the hotel is very good very safe district 10 minutes walk to Eiffel Tower next to M8 subway line so it is convenient for travels to go to sight seeings Clean room

35546,H tel de la Bourdonnais, There was no hotel parking so had to park in a parking area Thankfully just 50 yards from the hotel but cost 100 for two nights and two and a half days , Could not have asked for a more helpful accomadating and pleasant staff The hotel is located two blocks from a park where you can walk right up to the Eiffle Tower roughly 300 yards away Our hotel even has a view of the top of the Eiffle Tower The hotel had the metro entrance just a block up the street as well as was located right near the army museum

35558,H tel de la Bourdonnais, No drawer space whatsoever We had to live out of our suitcases We had to sit on the luggage rack to be able to use the table TV ridiculously large for the room Housekeeper forgot to prepare our room on the first day So we had to make our own beds Complained and reception staff appalled never happened again, The location was excellent close to Ecole Militaire and Les Invalides Metro stop and buses close to hotel and plenty of cafes restaurants and brasseries nearby Bathroom large and very well appointed Hotel very clean and comfortable WiFi excellent Attractive bedroom and comfortable bed Delightfully quiet everywhere in the hotel Air conditioning wonderfully quiet and very effective Staff very helpful Breakfast looked and smelt delicious but too pricey for us Tea offered in the room Incredible for France

35570,H tel de la Bourdonnais, After reading many reviews of free upgrades to a suite with a tower view we decided to book a suite Sadly this was at the back of the hotel and although the staff looked into moving us it was not possible The rear rooms overlook a courtyard which was the only disappointment to our stay , The location was fantastic and right by the Metro The staff went above and beyond to help Great breakfast tidy and nicely finished hotel The bed was very comfortable Also loved the free soft drinks in the mini bar and coffee machine

35584,H tel de la Bourdonnais, My only criticism would be they don t top up bathroom products and only one soap between shower bath and hand basins otherwise it was very good , We were upgraded to a junior suite which just meant we had more room in the bedroom but it was very comfortable The staff were very helpful 
35585,H tel de la Bourdonnais, AC were not working but they fixed it Rooms are small This is a 4 Stars hotel ONLY for its location and nothing else So don t expect any 4 Stars luxury when you check in , Friendly and helpful staff Location walking distance from the Eiffel Tower and the metro station cole Militaire Neighborhood is safe and very nice with a lot of really good restaurants There are a couple of restaurants next to the metro station that are open till 2 AM for late food There is a grocery store next to the hotel where you can buy water snacks and other stuff from there

35593,H tel de la Bourdonnais, Wifi kept failing Room looking out onto internal courtyard not what expecting Would have been nice to have a view over the Eiffel Tower, Location fabulous Staff friendly and very helpful Comfortable quiet room Location to metro and Eiffel Tower amazing 
35594,H tel de la Bourdonnais, The odor in the hallway and the room was terrible It was like staying in a smoking room although the staff said it s a non smoking hotel I bought an freshener but it didn t help the odor was too strong I should have chosen a slightly expensive hotel than La Bourdonnais Won t stay again and won t recommend unless you mind the odor , Location was good enough as it is close to the Eiffel Tower Modern furnitures and fixtures by Paris hotel standards
