221668,H tel Regent s Garden, We had water dripping from the ceiling in the bathroom the whole floor was wet I was fixed but we had to complain twice And the size of the room and the breakfast buffet did not justify a price of 350 a night As well as the mini bar that was included in the price which had a small coke some ornage juice and water in it Not really the minibar ur expecting when you re booking the room They also turned on the AC everday and cooled down to 15 degrees C even though we turned it off again every day , It was clean and the staff was friendly 
221669,H tel Regent s Garden, it s okay if there s no gym but partnering with a local gym for discount day passes or something similar would be welcomed service , location and staff and great reliable wifi
221670,H tel Regent s Garden,No Negative, This was a great stay for us and our 2 year old The rooms were spacious and clean The staff was very friendly and helpful The breakfast was good and the garden behind the property was a very nice place to relax and play with our child It s about 10 minutes walking distance from the Arc de Triomphe which marks one end of Champs Elysees with all its shopping and dining options The hotel is also close to the metro though we were unable to utilize it as none of the metro entrances have disabled elevator access a bit shameful for Paris so taking our stroller in wasn t an option 
221671,H tel Regent s Garden, I ve got a terrible room It was smelled from the sewer Room was under the roof and I was not able to sleep because of some sounds from the roof sewer during the night It was very audible and so annoying , The receptionist and overall the staff was very helpful and kind 
221672,H tel Regent s Garden, Stayed here 10 years ago and it was a slightly old fashioned hotel with moody staff They have since refurbished many of the rooms and wrecked the old charm of the hotel It s still got the moody staff very unhelpful never even showed us to our room just said it was on the 2nd floor Breakfast was 21 per person for a croissant and coffee so we skipped that there are plenty of excellent cafes nearby where you can get better for 6 On leaving the hotel we walked out having paid without so much as a goodbye from the staff All very odd , good location
221673,H tel Regent s Garden, Nothing, Amazing location Very clean large rooms Excellent staff very friendly Would definitely recommend to anyone Absolutely loved it Going again next year
221674,H tel Regent s Garden, Curtain only at entrance to bathroom Tiny toilet cubicle , Great staff excellent breakfast in gorgeous breakfast room or gardens Loved the cheese selection Quiet at night despite the central location
221675,H tel Regent s Garden, Nothing , A charming Villa located remotely in a quiet little garden Well maintained comfortable rooms and spacious by Paris measures Very friendly and helpful staff Free softdrinks in minibar In room iPad and well functioning fast Wifi In my opinion excellent value for money 
221676,H tel Regent s Garden, Pure vegetables for breakfast mini elevator , Hotel situated 5 min walk from Porte maillot bus station Breakfast was very tasty many kind of cheeses breads fruits quiet sleeping bed comfortable garden view

221678,H tel Regent s Garden, We can t think of anything Perhaps just the heating in the room we couldn t seem to get it to a hot temperature But that s about it , We didn t take breakfast at the hotel Everything else was great we loved it 
221679,H tel Regent s Garden, , The service was very good The front desk staff are ever so helpful and the staff manning the breakfast are very pleasant A special thanks to Filip I also loved the room it was spacious Really appreciated the fact that they provided complimentary soft drinks in the minibar everyday The garden was lovely and the location of the hotel is fantastic It is walkable from two metro stations the Palais de Congress and some nice restaurants too There is also a good bakery across the street as well as a supermarket The best part is that the hotel is located behind the main street which means that it is quiet What else can one ask for 
221680,H tel Regent s Garden,No Negative, Great location updated spacious rooms lovely bathroom Staff was very friendly and helpful Breakfast was lovely Great place to stay while in a Paris 
221681,H tel Regent s Garden, the cleanness of the room was not good At the first day felt down a hair bobble on the floor and for the next three days no one put it on a desk thus I understand that no one clean our room , the bed was perfect the location also 
221682,H tel Regent s Garden, The receptionist attitude when I went back to collect my bag she was surly and quite frankly not bothered she let them down badly As the hotel is small you can hear the movements on the staircase which can disturb sleep if you are a light sleeper , The Hotel is boutique and is very pretty Upon arrival the reception staff were very friendly and welcoming and helpful and would have scored an excellent The location is very good nearer to metro would have made it great Romantic setting lovely garden 
221683,H tel Regent s Garden, night room service limited, the human scale of things the staff very friendly the rooms spacey the minibar extras at disposal compensated for the lack of night room dining service
221684,H tel Regent s Garden, Our receptionist suggested we upgrade to a larger room with a view of the garden for a fee When we got to the room it was one of the smallest rooms according to the floor plan and so far to the side we saw a building wall instead of the garden I felt deceived , The decor is lovely recently done The staff was helpful with requests Ok location 10 minute walk to Arc de Triumph and trains 
221685,H tel Regent s Garden, Room on the ground floor was a bit odd as it faced into the car park so felt I couldn t open the windows, Beautiful breakfast garden breakfast was very good continental ipad in the room was a nice touch

221693,H tel Regent s Garden, The room was very small and had no ability to control the environment We were very hot each night and had difficulty sleeping There is no bathroom fan either so the room became not only hot but humid , Nice breakfast each morning and the hotel is well maintained clean and in a nice neighborhood 
221694,H tel Regent s Garden, The only demerit I would give is that the bathroom was about as small as it could have been and still be functional , This hotel is a hidden gem and we had a very nicely appointed room for a very reasonable rate The room was very nicely decorated very modern and had a sweet romantic flavor to it with a canopy over the bed
