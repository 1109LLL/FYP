170082,Dorset Square Hotel, Although I appreciate this is a 4 star and not a 5 star it is nowhere near the standard of the other Firmdale hotels we have stayed at Room we had looked over a busy road not the leafy garden square and had just a shower no bath , Very friendly staff good cocktails in bar 
170083,Dorset Square Hotel, A night time bottle of water on the second night or something similar , Beautiful furnishings comfortable bed gorgeous view of Dorset Square very pleasant staff 
170084,Dorset Square Hotel, Our room was very small and had no view Tea and coffee facilities in the room would be an added bonus , The hotel is beautifully decorated The staff was very friendly and accommodating The restaurant had a good breakfast selection I can definitely recommend the hotel to anybody who would like a boutique hotel experience The hotel is within walking distance from Lords cricket grounds The mini bar is well stocked 
170085,Dorset Square Hotel, The bed was a bit small and short given that we are rather tall people Even though we thoroughly enjoyed breakfast the selection could have benefitted from also some more savoury items next to the egg varieties such as some cheese cold cuts , Nothing really to find fault with Overall a very well maintained property Beautiful room although a bit small with a nice view of the square Equally beautiful common areas Cosy sitting room and breakfast room Did not have dinner at the property but breakfast was marvellous as it was largely a served breakfast as opposed to only a buffet Staff was extremely friendly and accommodating Location is great as the immediate surroundings are away from the hectic traffic and still very close to the centre Just a few minutes away from either Baker Street or Marylebone tube stations 
170086,Dorset Square Hotel, We didnt like our first room but the staff traded our room when we asked They were as helpful as they could be while being totally booked up , We loved the location as well as the staff Lorenzo and Sarah from the front desk were incredibly helpful as well as Virgil and all the others we had a wonderful time 
170087,Dorset Square Hotel, Nothing , Superb staff Nice accomodating personal as the entire hotel sooo personal And the small little things like no extra charge for coffee on the room in the morning a tube of hand cream on the bedding table at night etc 
170088,Dorset Square Hotel, No complaints, Very pleasant boutique hotel close to Marylebone and Baker Street I chose a single room which was small normal in London but perfectly OK for a short stay for one person The bed was super comfy and I had a great nights sleep The room was nicely decorated with some nice touches Not much of a view but never mind Staff were very friendly and helpful There is a nice lounge and a bar and restaurant on site Has the feel of a top class hotel but at an affordable for London price Look forward to my next staff well done the owners and the staff 
170089,Dorset Square Hotel, Our first room had the generators outside the window the hum of the noise disturbed us We were moved quickly once we complained The rooms are small but beautifully appointed and invently decorated If you have mobility issues this could be an issue though there is an elevator , Dorset Square feels like a home away from home A small beautifully decorated property overlooking a private square that you can have a key to visit A restuarant on site serves breakfast lunch high tea dinner The first of the Firmdale group of hotels it has been refurbished in 2012 in Kit s charming and colourful style Eye candy at every turn from art work beautifully framed to cosy sofas and inventive colour combinations Staff is attentive and helpful Regent park a street away Marylebone and Baker Street underground stations within 1 2 a block making connections to other parts of London easy 
170090,Dorset Square Hotel, It was a comfortable room but small and expensive Service and decor were top notch though It is good for a short stay , Very homey feel Meticulously decorated with textiles very British Centrally located very clean Staff were all very friendly and helpful 
170091,Dorset Square Hotel, Rooms not the largest and no tea coffee making in the room I m being very picky here , The staff are excellent here and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable The rooms are smaller than those you d get with a big chain hotel but are very comfortable and decorated fitted out to a class above the normal Very Quiet location for central London
170092,Dorset Square Hotel,No Negative, The staff are just so friendly Such a beautiful hotel clean breakfast was delecious On another note never been to a hotel where towels smelt good 
170093,Dorset Square Hotel, Too expensive Very poor value for money Very small 5sqm room See attached picture Not included breakfast in such a high price is a crime , Central location suitable for my meeting venue
170094,Dorset Square Hotel, The staff was not the warmest or nicest and didn t really complete the charm of the hotel The waiters at breakfast were rude and disorganised as for the front desk not very attentive , The finishing and maintenance of the rooms are of high quality The bed is really comfortable The hotel is charming The breakfast is really generous with a lot to choose from and excellent eggs 
170095,Dorset Square Hotel, Not much had a slight issue with waiting to long to be served at dinner but it was all sorted to our satisfaction , The Dorset Square Hotel is a delightful small hotel The staff make it They are so friendly The hotel itself is superbly located close to Regent s Park and the delightful Marylebone High Street and environs plus easy access to the rest of central London The rooms are beautiful and comfortable The bar and restaurant is a great place to eat and drink The cricket memorabilia and theme is quirky and fun and liked by non cricketing enthusiasts like the rest of my family and friends Thomas Lord s first cricket ground was the garden in the Square 
170096,Dorset Square Hotel, No complain at all , Wonderful hotel well renovated tastefully decorated close to everything extremely helpful stuff It was a true pleasure to stay there next time in London I definately stay here again 
170097,Dorset Square Hotel, The elevator broke and we were on the 4th floor But the help from staff covered this Another thing is that even though we emailed the facility and confirm the total rate including taxes or any extras we have not been informed that we needed to pay 200 GBP deposit per night We were on a business trip and didn t have that amount of money with us The reception was not very helpful on this matter but after a long discussion we managed to lower the deposit 100 GBP per night , The location and the staff is great The room was very clean and quiet It is a very nice alternative if you want to stay in a small and well decorated hotel in the centre of London 
170098,Dorset Square Hotel, In our room there was no teapot So we had to ask to hotel reception But It was not big deal Hotel staff brought teapot and cups to our room Thank you again , location was qutie good We took goldetour bus to Harry potter studio Which is just 1 minute from the hotel And it is very close to main shopping centre Hotel facillity was very unique and clean Staffs were very helpful 
170099,Dorset Square Hotel,No Negative, Small comfort details like nicer quality toiletries warmed towels and Tivoli radios at a few points just add to the already lovely vibe of the hotel It s impeccably clean and well appointed The breakfast was also excellent for a hotel 
170100,Dorset Square Hotel, Cannot fault, I really enjoyed my stay felt very homely All staff were so lovely and helpful I had a single room i loved looking out over the park extremely comfy bed beautifully decorated very tasteful I thoroughly enjoyed my room service breakfast each morning with newspaper I ate in the restaurant one evening and the food was delicious 
170101,Dorset Square Hotel, The range of drinks in the Honour Bar is mediocre and over priced , Bedrooms while small are delightful Beds are super and little extra touches sleep enhancer a nice tube of shaving cream are lovely Staff are friendly and welcoming At breakfast the staff remember what one likes Overall an outstanding townhouse hotel 
170102,Dorset Square Hotel, I really cannot think of anything Just wish my stay had been longer and that I had not had such an early start which meant I had very little time at the hotel, Fabulous warm and friendly welcome Offer of a free glass of fizz as soon as I arrived Fabulous bed with a bar of chocolate on the bedside table Small and personal hotel
170103,Dorset Square Hotel, Breakfast was very expensive a continental breakfast does not even include coffee which was charged extra as was orange juice , Comfortable though small room 
170104,Dorset Square Hotel, A larger fridge would be more helpful A kittle or coffee maker would be perfect , We were given a really warm welcome the staff were really extra friendly and nice Room service was fast and delicious don t miss the beef burger We stayed in the suite in the ground floor was surprisingly very quiet throughout day and night Excellent location very close to Sherlock Holms Museum and Marylebone Station if you re into outlet malls it has a shuttle service to Bicester Village Various choices of restaurants very close on Baker St 
170105,Dorset Square Hotel, The beds are cheaply constructed and I suffered terrible neck and upper back pain Eventually a board had to be placed under the mattress Apparently this has happened to other guests as the staff was not certain a board would be available at the given time or day as it may already have been in use I waited three nights before complaining because I don t like to complain The rooms are far too small for the cost One cannot open a suitcase and the bathroom door at the same time We were cramped in every position other than on the bed but then awoke from pain due to the mattress Dirty tea cups were left in the room each day and not replaced with clean ones until we requested them in the evening upon returning to the room Housekeeping did not once even remove used cups or saucers during the eight days we were guests They were not careful about billing we were charged for two persons at breakfast everyday when only one of us ate breakfast in the hotel After checking with management it was agreed to correct the error which should not have been made in the first place A room for two has no place to sit other than a bed a half size chair I m not sure how this hotel received a five star rating This is my first review of a hotel after many years of bookings in major cities throughout the world , The staff was very nice and respectful and responded politely to our requests We were greeted with special politeness 
170106,Dorset Square Hotel, We arrived at almost 14 00 and our room wasn t ready So we were told we were to be upgraded to a luxury room The room was a shoe box with sloping walls making it smaller with absolutely no view a brick wall and large air con units right outside the window 2m away This shouldn t have been a hotel room at all but a store room The noise from these units is like the drone of an aircraft and we both had terrible nights sleep The photos are not tricks this was our view Have a look at the luxury rooms on the website something is not quite right After we complained were given money off the bill however we felt completely let down by staff trying to tell us rooms are only categorised by their sqft not by their features i e brick wall view The photograph of our room was used as a description for a superior room So much for luxury We ve stayed at the sister hotel The Soho Hotel far better with large standard rooms Check out is at 11am on Sundays boo We won t be going back , Nice restaurant bar area Pleasant decor Bathroom decor
170107,Dorset Square Hotel, The room wasn t as booked with a double bed rather than king size it was small with very little natural light The hairdryer was broken the shower leaked and created a lake in the ensuite We were woken early by workmen drilling and hammering Overall not good value for money There are much nicer rooms overlooking the garden in Dorset Square make sure you request one of these , Dinner was lovely Very tasty food and great service although we ate in the bar as less crowded Within walking distance of Lords cricket ground 
170108,Dorset Square Hotel, Poor value for money as everything you wanted was an added cost Small room and bathroom for the amount of money Stayed in a similar hotel in central London earlier in the year much better value, Pleasant staff
170109,Dorset Square Hotel, we arrived at 5pm but the room was not ready as the carpets had been cleaned they were still damp when we used the room We had booked a suite and expected this to be spacious but it was more a junior suite and the bathroom was tiny There were builders next door and there was an incessant hammer drill , decor of the room and the hotel and good location
170110,Dorset Square Hotel, I didn t enjoy the omelette Too much cheese , The service was good The yogurts were wonderful I liked the breakfast room The bedroom was lovely The bed was really comfortable God bright and airy room 
170111,Dorset Square Hotel, The room was fairly small but bearing in mind the excellent location we didn t spend too much time there , The hotel staff could not do enough for us to make our stay even more enjoyable 
170112,Dorset Square Hotel,No Negative, Very comfortable beds standard rooms are a bit on the small side but they are beautifully decorated well kept and spotless Staff is very friendly professional and welcoming Breakfast is very good
170113,Dorset Square Hotel,No Negative, The design is absolutely amazing Loved the wall coverings the flooring the small details and all of the cricket memorabilia Plus the staff was very friendly and helpful Wish I could have stayed longer 
170114,Dorset Square Hotel, Well that is still in negotiation, Friendly staff excellent concierge service timely room service and aesthetically beautiful as per all your firm dale hotels
170115,Dorset Square Hotel, A little overpriced probably if I look at the size of the room and the rest of the building, Attention to detail and welcome card Minibar selection Bathroom s equipment and bed s comfort
170116,Dorset Square Hotel, Nothing, Easy check in personal service fabulous room frette towels bathroom products and complimentary spa gift cleanliness bar well trained staff
170117,Dorset Square Hotel, The decor No chipped paint no grubby soft furnishings Perfection where ever you look , Like all the Firmdale hotels I have stayed in the attention to detail and the wonderful staff give it the edge The warmth of welcome the spotless interiors and the whole atmosphere make them pure pleasure
170118,Dorset Square Hotel, Didn t get a welcome drink as promised on the booking Property didn t know about this , Rooms were very clean Excellent location and friendly staff 
170119,Dorset Square Hotel,No Negative, A welcome alternative to a large chain hotel Beautifully furnished down to the finest detail Spotlessly clean Gorgeous outlook over Dorset Square Very special indeed
170120,Dorset Square Hotel, the bathroom is only shower The room should have bathtub with this luxury price , The single room is really small but the room is lovely and cozy Amenities are also nice The hotel is easy access from marylebone 
170121,Dorset Square Hotel, Nothing not to like but potential guests should be aware that at least some rooms are on the small side , The hotel is exceptionally comfortable and impeccably maintained The location near the baker st underground station makes travel anywhere in London simple The staff is friendly and helpful It is a model boutique hotel We loved it and hope to return soon 
170122,Dorset Square Hotel,No Negative, Love ALL of Kit Kemp s properties The Dorset is tucked away but close to the tube for added convenience The restaurant is simple and delicious I m a fan of anything Kit does 
170123,Dorset Square Hotel,No Negative, Service in the restaurant at breakfast excellent quality of food very good Reception staff helpful and welcoming Room very comfortable and quality you expect for boutique hotel 
170124,Dorset Square Hotel, Nothing to complain about , Very cosy well designed and nice boutique hotel Perfectly located to Baker Street and Marylebone tube station Friendly and forthsoming staff
170125,Dorset Square Hotel, Noise from the tube line we stayed on lower ground floor so it was even louder The line goes right below the building and the trains can be heard clearly but it was actually less troublesome to sleep than what we expected , It s a really small and cozy hotel Location Baker St station is 2 mins away Staff very helpful and caring
170126,Dorset Square Hotel,No Negative, The Dorset Hotel is a boutique hotel that is intimate in size I found the staff very helpful in regard to navigating London I was there twice the first time I was on the 2nd floor and could hear the rumblings of the train station below The second time I was on the 4th floor and it was very peaceful 
170127,Dorset Square Hotel, We rejected the first two rooms we were presented with as the first was in the basement and was very gloomy with next to no natural light while the second was on ground level and boasted an awful view of the service ally behind the hotel although the windows were large all that could be seen was the industrial plant for the air conditioning system We were honestly about to cancel and go to a different hotel but ended up downgrading our room type for a smaller room they all seemed small anyway which in the end did the job I ve stayed in other Firmdale hotels and generally like them however I don t think I d stay in the Dorset Square Hotel again as frankly it felt overpriced for what it was , The hotel staff were friendly and helpful and the building itself is warm and inviting with updated decor and rooms 
170128,Dorset Square Hotel, The only complaint I have is that the property resides so close to the Baker Street station that if you are on the second floor which I was you can hear and feel the tube If you are a heavy sleeper it is not a problem I also had a room on the 4th floor and did not hear a thing , This boutique hotel had all the amenities of a larger hotel but with the intimacy and privacy you would expect from a smaller property The service in the hotel dining room was exceptional and friendly as well 
170129,Dorset Square Hotel, Service was very slow in the restaurant on one of the two evenings I ate there Apart from that the food is good and the restaurant has a very relaxed good atmosphere for someone dining alone It would be good to have tea and coffee facilities in the room , All the staff but especially the reception staff are excellent and go to great lengths to ensure that you are happy The room was very comfortable especially the bed 
170130,Dorset Square Hotel,No Negative, Lovely helpful staff Rooms were just like the pictures decorative friendly bathroom spotless Breakfast menu delicious Made a wonderful cup of tea Thankyou
