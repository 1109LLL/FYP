85180,H tel Ad le Jules, We were offered an upgrade to a Deluxe room booked a superior at an additional 25 Euros per night with a balcony and coffee machine But the balcony was so small only one person could sit on it and no coffee was supplied for the machine we asked on 3 occasions for coffee pods and ended up buying them at a super market The extra charge was not justified we could have bought a coffee machine for that we stayed 6 nights We wish we have stuck with original booking and saved the money This has definitely affected our review of the Hotel and had they taken that extra charge off we would have given more smiles Very small breakfast area on 1 morning there was no where to sit on another morning there was no food left and no one seemed interested in helping put any out so we went out We had a great breakfast for the same price elsewhere 15 Euros , Good location very close to Metro and plenty of good restaurants close by
85181,H tel Ad le Jules, The room was small for two people with big suitcases but it wasn t unbearable , A lovely hotel with friendly staff We had a basic room which was quite small but very nice The bed was very comfortable A short walk to the metro and a big variety of restaurants Good wifi 
85182,H tel Ad le Jules, The main entrance is not easy to find and it s separated into 2 buildings The conceiage is a very small counter The room and lobby are all very small with a old building smell Poor facilities All the pictures on site are taken in wide angle It s not cost for money and there should be lots of choice is more convenience location with much better services facilities and environment I m very disappointed ,No Positive
85183,H tel Ad le Jules, Our room was by the front door and although the hotel is situated on a side street guests leaving early can be heard clattering their cases and talking , Bed was fab 
85184,H tel Ad le Jules, Strange bathroom arrangement with shower and toilet next to each other and shower head getting all the floor very wet , Very comfortable room beautifully decorated Very quiet 
85185,H tel Ad le Jules, Walls are a little thin you can hear people talking in nearby rooms but not enough that you can make out their conversation , The beds are very comfortable the air conditioning works well everything seems new Happy hour from 4 6 is a big plus The bathrooms and shower are large and comfortable by Parisian standards Staff are very helpful One block from the metro so you can get everywhere quickly and easily Our room had a wonderful view of the private street 
85186,H tel Ad le Jules, n a it was a lovely experience , the hotel is very pretty and beautifully located The staff was kind and helpful It was a business trip and I booked a suite for me and my colleague The staff helped us with sleeping arrangements 
85187,H tel Ad le Jules, The breakfast runs out very quickly so rather embarrassingly you re having to ask for more eggs more ham more bread I had a coffee machine in the room but only got 3 pods for the whole stay which were used rather quickly , very friendly staff great room
85188,H tel Ad le Jules, Beds are way too small The double room was too small and the beds were way too small , The staff was friendly and the place was kept clean The location was excellent 
85189,H tel Ad le Jules,No Negative, Great location Not too far from everything and tucked into its own little nook in the city The room we originally booked was not ready because we arrived a few hours early but they upgraded us and found a room that was ready 
85190,H tel Ad le Jules, The bathroom was so pretty but using the shower proved to be a challenge at first as the shower curtain is perhaps not adequate to contain the water or the fall of the bathroom floor is not enough Once we figured out how best to use it it was fine , Bed was comfy and room pretty and fresh with big windows looking out to the closed off street Staff were super friendly and helpful and overall it was a very pleasant experience 
85191,H tel Ad le Jules,No Negative, fantastic staff friendly and accommodating the balcony was unexpected and a really nice addition quiet street elegant decor clean room and bathroom honesty bar did I mention the really nice people at the reception 
85192,H tel Ad le Jules, Room was a bit small Cleaning staff was knocking at the door very early , Nicely appointed rooms and very clean and quiet The staff was very friendly We were able to leave our luggage after checkout and were offered a snack when we picked it up 
85193,H tel Ad le Jules,No Negative, Beautifully decorated wonderful staff comfy bed Attractive lounge for snacks and breakfast Rooms very small but typical for Paris so not surprising 
85194,H tel Ad le Jules, Overpriced for what it offers Services were not up to the price level elevator was not working you had to call to get the towels back gym is a small room in the basement and is equipped to allow the hotel to say it has a gym but it lacks functionality, Its placed in a very good area of Paris 
85195,H tel Ad le Jules, The shower plug was blocked so the tub filled up when we showered but this really didn t detract from our great stay , I loved how quiet the hotel is because it s down a tiny road that cars don t travel down I loved the honesty bar and the spotlessly clean rooms The staff were very helpful 
85196,H tel Ad le Jules,No Negative, Excellent small hotel with great location surrounded with great restaurants and other attractions Our room was significantly larger than the average parisian hotel room It was clean modern and very comfortable The staff was nice and helpful Will go back whenever in Paris again 
85197,H tel Ad le Jules, There wasn t anything to dislike , The location and everything was excellent about the hotel The staff were extremely helpful and kind One member of staff even booked all our tickets for the various tourist sites which helped us a lot 
85198,H tel Ad le Jules,No Negative, The location is perfect in the heart of Montmarte Walking within the hotel is a breeze We walked to Sacre Coeur and Notre Dame Taking a cab to go to Louvre Champs lys es and Eiffel is ok because it is just near There are good cafes and restaurants within the area The receptionists and staff are very nice and helpful They welcomeed us to Paris warmly and talked about the city with pride They know the city very well and give good suggestions on where to eat where to shop and go Our room is beautiful and very comfortable The wifi connection is very reliable 
85199,H tel Ad le Jules,No Negative, Great location two blocks from the Metro Wonderfully decorated clean room with a terrace Great English speaking staff Nice restaurants nearby 
85200,H tel Ad le Jules, Rooms were a little tighter that I had imagined from the photos We did however get upgraded perhaps because I had mentioned in an earlier corespondence that it was my wife s birthday to a Deluxe room which gave us a balcony very nice indeed , Very nice comfortable bed great coffee in the rooms
85201,H tel Ad le Jules, Not having tea and coffee facilities in room or fridge expected this for the price of the room Being charge 5 Euro for a cup of tea is exorbitant , Staff very friendly room decor and cleanliness great
85202,H tel Ad le Jules, Small things While there is a nice Nespresso machine and water cooker only first day you have coffee capsule and thee bagg Other days they don t give you new during room cleaning You always have to ask it on reception Breackfast is a little over priced, Very nice coozy hotel in a perfect location Hotel is also located in a dead ending quiet street 
85203,H tel Ad le Jules, Nothing really, Everything Especially small details like plugs near bedtable to charge your phone quality toiletry good size and silence of the room friendly staff proximity of the tube and the fact that there is an express breakfast option and late check in 
85204,H tel Ad le Jules, Nothing, It was Parisian perfection the hotel was as it says boutique friendly helpful clean comfortable great location attention to detail was spot on no faults at all 
85205,H tel Ad le Jules, Some of house keeper don t understand any english , This hotel was amazing They upgrade for suite room and employers are so kind to everthing Awesome 
85206,H tel Ad le Jules, Our room was on the 6th Floor A problem with the lift doors meant we had to get out on the 5th floor and walk up to the next floor Needed a hot bath shower at 5 00pm after a days sightseeing when I got soaked by the rain Unfortunately the water was only warm My wife had to boil kettles of water to put in the bath , Location and Service was excellent as was the comfort of the room 
85207,H tel Ad le Jules, They tried already at check in to sell us an upgrade at 60 night we should stay 4 nights The reason why they did was that the room we have booked had a very bad smell from the zink which learned when we came to the room It would have been good service if they have offered us the upgrade free Now we got at room in groundfloor with at lot of noise from road construction starting 7am This situation could have handled more professional, Situated in good area with both restaurant and bars in the neighbourhood And a quite new hotel which is not easy to find in Paris
85208,H tel Ad le Jules, A bit tiny room superior double room No bath only shower , The stuff was very friendly Our daughter needed gluten free and they immediately went out and buy her gluten free bread and cereal Although we did not notify them ahead This was very nice And any advise we needed they happily helped Great location in 9 arrondissement Good restaurants around and close by metro 
85209,H tel Ad le Jules, Scrumbled eggs and sausages at breakfast were always cold since they did not switch on the plate, Very quiet and cosy complementary snacks in the afternoon 
85210,H tel Ad le Jules, The room temperature was a little too hot for me but that is down to personal preference , The service was excellent and I was made to feel so welcome throughout my entire stay with my fianc If I needed any help with organising something even before my stay they were instantly responsive and wasn t left in the dark or having to wait more than a day to receive a response especially as this was a surprise for my fianc The staff were always polite and accomodating In all honesty the best decision I made to introduce my other half to Paris for his first time stay 
85211,H tel Ad le Jules, very little , I felt immediately relaxed and happy when entering the hotel Rooms we re quite spacious and beautifully decorated I loved the lounge honesty bar with unlimited toblerones 
85212,H tel Ad le Jules, The breakfast space was quite small and we wanted to enjoy the atmosphere of Paris on the Grand Boulevard instead Our room was compact but very nicely arranged , The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful The d cor very agreeable indeed Our room was very peaceful and the bed very comfortable 
85213,H tel Ad le Jules, Poached eggs at breakfast would be nice but it s just because I m English , Great design World s most helpful receptionist Great attention to detail Wonderful shower Very quiet room despite central location 
85214,H tel Ad le Jules, Hair on the bathroom floor when we arrived and toilets not totally clean But other than that cleanliness was totally fine Milk for hot chocolate at breakfast time not hot enough , We booked two bedrooms which were located totally out of the way in a corridor of their own this made our stay very comfortable because quiet Mattress was just the right level of firmness bed was very comfy 
85215,H tel Ad le Jules,No Negative, I ve been to Paris several times and I m used to the quality and size of the hotels there but this time I was super impressed The hotel opened less than a year ago and everything from service to cleanliness to decoration is simply AMAZING Staff was super nice and well informed Also the hotel is located in a lively area and close to the 2nd 3rd and 4ths arr where you ll find the most interesting shops restaurants and in the city

85228,H tel Ad le Jules, We were asked to leave our key with reception when leaving the hotel in an evening only to find out that pretty much anyone could ve walked in and picked up our key since the night porter had no idea who I was nor required any proof that I was the guest of the room I claimed to be 100 was taken from my card upon arrival with no prior warning and despite being told the card would be swiped as a mere guarantee Given there is no minibar I cannot understand why this was necessary No tea coffee making facilities in the room and we were given just one bottle of water between two people for two nights ,No Positive
