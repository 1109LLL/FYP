471986,Camperio House Suites Apartments,No Negative, We had an apartment no 35 and it has a largest terrace in the hotel View is to EY company building but even though there is a space for privacy Breakfast was ok not too big but enough Very good coffee Personal was a perfect 
471987,Camperio House Suites Apartments, Although we had been provided with cooking facilities we never self catered because we hadn t got a car and the nearest shop that sold food was a 30minutes walk away Also due to its position and the rather difficult wardrobe doors the safe was difficult to get at , We had booked a room but when we arrived we discovered to our pleasure that we had been up graded to an apartment The hotel was very conveniently situated but at the same time very quiet We enjoyed the breakfasts including the cooked option 
471988,Camperio House Suites Apartments, There was no outdoor sign to identify the hotel We actually stood in the entry way to get protection from the rain that was coming down as we searched for our hotel We wandered around a two block area before realizing we had been right outside it The room configuration was a bit unusual but that is a minor issue , Location was really close to the historic sites that we were walking to Staff spoke multiple languages and were quick to recommend restaurants and shopping in the area Nice clean place 
471989,Camperio House Suites Apartments, Lighting was a little more mood than practical everywhere except the bathroom where it was excellent Breakfast not as good as many others in Italy we weren t even asked if we would like coffee on our first morning , Loved the storage magnifying makeup mirror my wife and the washing machine and dryer available free of charge on our floor Lovely modern apartment kitchen would be adequate for making simple meals if you wished to cook Also a few lovely restaurants near by

471993,Camperio House Suites Apartments, The only thing that wasn t perfect was that the room was a little too warm , Loved the location we were off in a quiet side street halfway between the duomo and the castle The bed was extremely comfortable and staff were all very welcoming Breakfast was lovely with a large selection of food and great coffee

471997,Camperio House Suites Apartments, Although there is parking available for a price the parking lot is a short distance from the property and because of the narrow street where the property is located there is no possibility of dropping off luggage before parking The staff however is helpful in managing the luggage Tip get clear instructions directions to find the parking lot There was difficulty in getting a SUV into the parking lot because of the number of motorbikes and vehicles parked along the outside of the parking lot , The friendly and accommodating staff and the terrific location of the property We also liked our room so did our cat
