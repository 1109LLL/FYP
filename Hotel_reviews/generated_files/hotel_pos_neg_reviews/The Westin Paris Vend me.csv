137058,The Westin Paris Vend me, I think due to the location this hotel thinks that service is second when it should be first Each time I stay here it becomes worst in terms of service The housekeeping and porters are nice The restaurant members dont look like they want to be bothered However the front desk and concierge people could not be any more rude As a SPG gold member I expect more Overall this is the worst service I have ever had in Paris , Location 
137059,The Westin Paris Vend me, New guests entered our room while we were still in bed at about 7 00 a m with their own card keys we tried ours and it no longer worked our check out time was not till noon of that day Soon enough we got a call from the hotel apologizing for the mistake and they did not charge us for our breakfast that morning as a gesture of recompense but we didn t care about that It was still unacceptable such an error could have led to a number of worse situations we were just glad that it did not ,No Positive
137060,The Westin Paris Vend me,No Negative, The spectacular view over the Jardin des Tuileries and to the Tour Eifel and Louvre the nice garden inside the hotel with the Bar Restaurant
137061,The Westin Paris Vend me, Quite a run down property lighting not really good With a price like what we pay there are more place better However locat ion and convenient great, Location
137062,The Westin Paris Vend me, Room size a bit below expectation compared to other westin in Asia The hall a bit messy Tidy but would need a good architect to re lay out the whole thing, The location is great 
137063,The Westin Paris Vend me,No Negative, The staff were very helpful I had travelled to the hotel for work and this was booked through my company with the weekend covered through Booking com When I checked in the staff couldn t have been more helpful to make sure we had the same room for the whole duration of our trip and also made sure my wife could access the room the following day when she arrived During our stay I was recovering from leg surgery and the staff couldn t have been more helpful in assisting us The breakfast was great and the location was perfect for exploring all the normal locations in Paris 
137064,The Westin Paris Vend me, all went very well, concierge and staffs were very helpful receptionist as well i requested a larger room and was given a very nice one with the help of the receptionist 
137065,The Westin Paris Vend me, The bathroom showers needed fixing The toilets are old and yellow The carpets needed changing The whole room needed to be gutted out, I love this hotel I stay here every time I m in Paris However this time I upgraded my family to a suit and it was such a bad idea The quality of the room was horrible and I would not recommend it The location and view are awesome but the room and facility were poor 
137066,The Westin Paris Vend me, We were a little cold the first night as the bedding was quite light and there wasn t an extra in the wardrobe We turned on the heating and asked for an extra blanket for the 2nd night and we were toasty TV remote didn t work very well frustrating at times but I m sure if we d raised it as an issue it would have been rectified we were in and out a lot so didn t bother , The location was awesome really central Can walk most places and it is very close to bus train batobus Taxi to Gare de Nord under Euro 10 Taxi from Eiffel Tower to hotel at 11pm under Euro 10 We were upgraded to a Royal Palais Suite on 2nd floor It was wonderful and has views over the Eiffel Tower the Ferris wheel the finger of Paris Tulieries gardens and Louvre Check in Checkout was easy Staff really pleasant to interface with and breakfast was nom nom nom nom i e yummy with lots of choice 
137067,The Westin Paris Vend me, Very tired and dated property in a grand building From the dirty wood behind reception to the scruffy false grass in the courtyard and corridors that smelt like an old one star hotel The glass tables in the old fashioned restaurant are so scratched they should have been replaced years ago But I suppose for a Vendome hotel the price is towards the lower end , Location
137068,The Westin Paris Vend me, Bed is not comfortable sheets are dirty the bed cover is flat you have to ask for the fillings I had the worst checkout experience ever They charged me for everything even for the complementary water i had to double check everything in the bill be aware the concierge is not free We are in 2017 and they dont have free internet , just the location
137069,The Westin Paris Vend me, The service express line was not manned Twice I phoned to ask for some information and the call was unanswered eventually I just went down to concierge and reception to ask my questions I heard several people complaining about this also , Beautiful room and hotel in a great location 
137070,The Westin Paris Vend me, I asked for a twin room when booking but they assigned a double room I think there is a lack of communication between booking website and hotel , The bed was comfortable Great location Quite pricey If you are tall do not ask for a room with a view The dormer roof is quite low 
137071,The Westin Paris Vend me, Room size is small i booked a room with a balcony and view and it was extremely small that i had to change to another bigger room without any view, The location was just perfect 
137072,The Westin Paris Vend me, Showers are a bit outdated Cleaning a bit patchy but still good overall Nothing else , Fantastic location near the Louvre and Tuileries gardens Staff were outstanding as was the food Good fast wifi connection through the hotel
137073,The Westin Paris Vend me, 1 Rude and non organized staff at the Breakfast We had to queue in the morning to get the breakfast while 10 12 table were empty The excuse given is the following you need to wait until we clean them and it is taking time because we do not have enough staff to do it Not what do you expect from a hotel at EUR 400 night 2 Room is small to be fair I knew that and it is not an issue for me The big issue is that it was full of dust complained about it to the reception 3 Most outrageous thing that happened during my stay was at the lobby We asked for some water and a diet coke the staff apologized saying that the hotel policy is to not serve drinks food in the lobby I was fine with that until 10 minutes later when a famous CEO arrived with his staff and been served all the drinks and food he wanted Complained about it and even took a picture They did not care to reply I am not a millionaire but I expect to be treated as any other customer , Location is great
137074,The Westin Paris Vend me, We were in Room 4097 there was noise from water pipes from bathrooms in other rooms which was a disturbance The breakfast was not very good we have stayed here twice before and this year was the worst The coffee was watery the buffet porridge was tasteless and the fresh fruit kiwi was just on the turn on two mornings of our stay , Great location for exploring Paris restaurants shops are all around and the museums and gardens are close by Staff in the hotel are generally very good and attentive particularly the breakfast shift 
137075,The Westin Paris Vend me, Overall quality of service was below average in terms of 1 responsiveness of housekeeping and 2 attitude of concierge desk Wifi was extremely slow and cable network was mostly unstable during the stay , Good location
137076,The Westin Paris Vend me, Check in took far too long We waited for nearly 20minutes before being seen at reception and then nearly missed dinner reservations, Gorgeous hotel in a beautiful location Big comfy bed good size rooms Great food in the resturant
137077,The Westin Paris Vend me, The auto enrollment to the spg but no biggie , The staff were very helpful and courteous from entrance all the way Room was small but had ultra amazing views of the park and the eifel tower fantastic location Great breakfast 
137078,The Westin Paris Vend me, Breakfast not included No Beauty kit in the room No slippers in the room The room is only cleaned one time they don t come to prepare the bed for the night and change towels Only one soap and shampoo for two guests In the room was quite cold in the night and there was no extra blanket provided in the room The charge 8 eur per night from minibar which I didn t use I was in a hurry and I didn t say anything at the reception Around 11am it is impossible to check out too much people and only two desks open For the cost paid and from an hotel like this I was expecting much more I travel a lot and I see 4 stars hotel with much more quality than this , Great location
137079,The Westin Paris Vend me, Room was quiet dark and a old Could do with being modernised Wi Fi wasn t free Advertised as smoking perferred option but it wasn t smoking they said they would change it Gym was decent , Grand hotel in good location Room was large bed was comfy 
137080,The Westin Paris Vend me, Only area for improvement I found was the gym Decent size with reasonable facilities but not as many machines as would be optimal Also it is located in the basement floor so no outside view while working out , Superb service overall and extremely helpful concierge Room was nice and excellent feeling of being in France despite Westin chain Location was also fabulous 
137081,The Westin Paris Vend me, Check out was too slow I had to leave the keys without making the check out I have waited more than 30 minutes and after I had to leave to take my flight Breakfast not included too expensive, location
137082,The Westin Paris Vend me, the price no breakfast just the room nearly 400 is expensive, The bed was amazing i never sleep well in a hotel bed regardless of grade but this bed was amazing must of released scents of chloroform to keep me asleep at night 
137083,The Westin Paris Vend me, The service is poor but most places are in France There was no doorman to help with luggage The hotel is a little dirty Tv did not work properly Buffet breakfast was not up to standard for a high star hotel , The location is great
137084,The Westin Paris Vend me,No Negative, Got a free upgrade to a suite really nice Love the Ceasar w salmon Staff is nice and supportive Helped retrieve my daughter s balloon which flew to the ceilings Good job 
137085,The Westin Paris Vend me, A little bit old fashioned but it s a classic french style hotel , The hotel itself is located in a very convenient but yet secluded and safe area In addition the staff have excellent customer service and has exceeded my expectations The front desk representative Pierre has helped me and family booked a room that s perfect for us in a reasonable price Although the room wasn t ready and we had to wait much longer for it they sent us complimentary fruits and wine in which we appreciate a lot Every staff that we encounter is very responsive to our needs We appreciate the great service and we believe that this is crucial for a tourist like us to have a good impression of not only Westin but the whole Paris France 
137086,The Westin Paris Vend me, Check in took a very long time I arrived around 4pm and the room was still not ready I had to wait about an hour and when I asked for a grace period for checkout they refused , I liked the location of the hotel close to the park and shopping 
137087,The Westin Paris Vend me,No Negative, Staff are really friendly and very helpful They welcomed us and gave the children balloons that made them happy A staff walked us the time we entered the hotel to the check in then to our suites They located 4 suites next to each other which is not easy to find in hotels 
137088,The Westin Paris Vend me, Room was very old and very noisy at night Reception offer me a room with a view twin beds I request the twin bed on booking com and at the check in So I asked for the twin bed twice but i suprised that the room is very small and its queen bed and when i go back to reception she told me between 6pm to 7pm they will seprate the bed to be twin I came back at 9 30pm and it was still queen bed Very slow and un accepted service Sadly Not the westin i used to stay in ,No Positive
137089,The Westin Paris Vend me,No Negative, My stay was during the Terrorist attacks November 13 15 The hotel sent out a letter to all guests to outline the extra security measures that were put into place immediately security guards at the entrance and waiver of early check out fees if guests opted to leave The entire staff was very accommodating during that horrible event and helped me get in touch with the embassy which was very close to the hotel The hotel is in a great location and walking distance to most points of interest couple blocks Place dela Concorde Louvre etc 
137090,The Westin Paris Vend me, But I had very bad experiance with the hotel when they transfare calls from people pretinding they are police and they want us to go out at 12 am I told them to block the calls and transfer us with our kids to one suite Because i dont know who is calling and if they thrilling my life and my kids life It was scary I have traveled all over Europe but never have like this experience So i cancel all my plans and i went back home , The hotel is so beautiful and the stuff very helpfull
137091,The Westin Paris Vend me, There was a fair happening in the park across from the hotel The rides obscured our view of the Eiffel Tower The room was small and in need of renovation The hotel bar was horrible like something out of an Old western movie Staff were rude and unhelpful Not worth the price tag , The location was great close to a metro station and a short walk to the main shopping districts
