186831,Trinit Haussmann, The Pigalle is not my favourite part of Paris so we tended to take taxis home but the quality of room that Trinite Haussman offers would be impossible at this price in any other part of the city, This was a clean and very comfortable hotel room the room was big for Paris where hotel rooms tend to be so small you can barely move around This room was a good size and well decorated and cozy I would definitely stay again 
186832,Trinit Haussmann, wifi not straightforward to use connect from instructions given parking can be difficult to find in Paris in general not realy reflection on hotel but would like to see suggestions to parking on hotel website rather than parking is possible in local ,No Positive
186833,Trinit Haussmann, It would have been better to be off the ground floor We had to keep out curtains closed the entire stay , The rooms were clean and very comfortable Definitely value for money Great location 
186834,Trinit Haussmann, Reception personnel was not very attentive And this place has an unusual policy of having to leave your room keycard with the receptionist There is nothing wrong with that just that the receptionist was not always present which had us end up in front of the hotel door unable to enter or even leave The hotel This is not convenient and even unsafe as we ended up being locked in early in the morning when we should have taken our cab , Cute hotel in a very convenient location Close to Montmartre but not in a noisy environment The hotel is very nicely renovated and unlike in many other renovated buildings which often are noisy my room was incredibly quiet And this despite being right next to the elevator I have seldomly experienced such good soundproofing in hotel room doors Other than this the rooms are well decorated and the bathroom was brilliant Please keep in mind that hotel rooms in central Paris tend to be on the small side This also applies to this facility 
186835,Trinit Haussmann,No Negative, The room was clean and the bed was comfy which is exactly what I needed after traveling for 30 hours Rooms were small but that was expected Bathroom was super clean too I liked how accomidating the staff was They were quite helpful with any questions we had about our stay All in all I d stay there again 
186836,Trinit Haussmann, the wifi is painful to be connected we didn t have wifi for 3 days And they double charged our breakfast now waiting for refund not sure whether they will rerund it ,No Positive
186837,Trinit Haussmann, Prefer Tea coffee cups to be in china as it was hard to hold on to the paper cups with hot tea or coffee in them, Staff were friendly and accomodating
186838,Trinit Haussmann, We didn t like having to hand back the room key every time we went in and out This delayed us especially when there were other people at the desk , Very quiet street for a good nights sleep
186839,Trinit Haussmann, Parking was only possible at a public parkhouse around 150 meters away and it was also expensive ar around 35 day , The room was very nicely suited for our 2 2 family and very clean Also the personal was very helpfull and open to our wishes 
186840,Trinit Haussmann, The structure of the double bed was simply two single beds pushed together hence a bit uncomfortable in the middle On booking com there s a big tick next to Breakfast in the What s included section however upon arrival we found that it wasn t actually included Our room was on the ground floor and it was quite loud so we were woken up a few times in the night Also a bit stingy with the coffees teas etc in the room, The interior was nicely furnished and very clean
186841,Trinit Haussmann, Nothing , The property was in a convenient location and the immediate area was pretty cool a lot of trendy bars and bistros Room was huge compared to most of the others I ve stayed at in Paris and seemed to have been decorated fairly recently The bed was particularly comfortable Staff were all very friendly and helpful Secure bag storage 
186842,Trinit Haussmann, The hotel itself looks good new and well renovated but the service is not the best We left the dirty towels on the floor expecting them to change it but instead they just hang them up and did not change it Also we got back to our hotel around 4 pm and the rooms wasn t made we had to ask them to do it ,No Positive
186843,Trinit Haussmann, The room we got was much smaller than the room that was advertised in the pics but still a lovely room very clean , Location was great staff very lovely so clean would definitely stay here again 
186844,Trinit Haussmann, The sleeper couch was not comfortable Mattress sunk in the middle Had to ask for coffee cups and coffee There were no nespresso capsules available for the machine in the room We even asked if we could buy them Breakfast both mornings were a disappointment First morning there was minimal eggs and sausages Second morning there was no bread to be toasted even after asking for bread We asked for sausages and was given 6 little sausages for 4 adults , Room was clean and bathroom was clean Staff was friendly 
186845,Trinit Haussmann, I know the maid came in and made the bed and cleaned the bathroom but the room was never swept mopped or vacuumed not sure how you clean the floors the dust and hair was never cleaned up and there were never any extra towels in the bathroom like I requested in my reservation I also did not like the fact that the iron and ironing board had to go back every time I finished there should be one in each room and I did not like that I had to leave my room key every time I left , The breakfast was very nice and the bed was really comfy The location of the hotel was easily accessed by foot but did not seem so by taxi the area was clean and safe to walk 
186846,Trinit Haussmann, Not a problem but like everywhere we ve traveled in Europe the internet was a bit weak in room Some phones clicked in easily other older ones didn t It was nice to stay off screens anyway and enjoy the neighborhood , The BEST neighborhood I ve been to Paris many times it s my favorite neighborhood in addition to the Marais Lovely quiet street charming view from our balcony Very near two metros Straight shot from Montparnasse on metro from our main train Short walk to Montmartre Tons of cafes restaurants grocery stores a few steps away I was with my 3 small kids and it s very safe and fun coming and going Beds were SUPER comfortable Excellent shower The hotel is beautifully decorated and staff is super friendly and helpful We were a bit shocked at great quality for our budget where usually rooms are not half as nice Lovely soap and shampoos We didn t want to leave and we ll be back The kids wanted a hotel breakfast I caved even though there are millions of bakeries near by And it was a GREAT breakfast Worth the price and charming dining room 
186847,Trinit Haussmann, There is absolutely zero variety in the breakfast at this hotel Every day there is the same breakfast with mini croissants juice jam and eggs and one bowl of sliced fruits and a couple of bowls with cereals Also this has been the first hotel in my entire life where you had to boil your eggs yourself For a four star hotel this type of breakfast is really far below average The elevator is this hotel is quite small and it s impossible to fit more than 2 persons including luggage inside of it During breakfast hours the elevator can become quite crowded My room had water damage at the ceilings and walls and the bathroom had some minor damage which this hotel should fix The staff in general wasn t too helpfull during checkin and in explaining things about the hotel and or Paris , The room service was nice The housekeeping did a good job the room was clean The location of this hotel is near a couple of metro stations and or bus stops Also sightseeing such as Basilique du Sacr C ur and Moulin rouse are in walking distance 
186848,Trinit Haussmann, A bit loud at night but that is to be expected in Paris , Exceptional staff Clean nice location with great shops and restaraunts in the area Close to Metro and Moulin Rouge 
186849,Trinit Haussmann, The breakfast is expensive even for Paris standard Rooms are little and hot water broke for 2 days , The hotel is located in a non usual location from Paris great to stay here 
186850,Trinit Haussmann, During our stay there was a problem with the hot water system It was over a weeekend and unable to be sorted quickly so not hot water But the hotel went above and beyond to make it up to us free complimentary breakfasts both days and one nights refund , Brilliant location Close to metro Comfortable and beautiful rooms Friendly and professional staff
186851,Trinit Haussmann,No Negative, Good location old building modernized on the inside Good breakfast and you get a discount if you purchase breakfast in advance versus buying it on the day itself 5 minutes walk from a metro
186852,Trinit Haussmann, nothing, we were staying in the suite of this hotel and it was really clean and spacious i know how hard it is for us to find a big enough space in Paris but this hotel was just perfect bed was super comfy room was clean and stylish 
186853,Trinit Haussmann, Super horrible check in reception staff We were sent an email to invite us to upgrade to a suite from the hotel Corp site directly after my booking com confirmation upon check in reception staff said there is no such thing and refuse to look into his system nor look at my email confirmation from their Corp website He said on his booking com paper there is no such info I am very upset and since I checked in at 11 30pm it s too late and don t want to argue and just took what ever they had available Another thing is don t understand why we need to drop our hotel room card key at the reception Feel so unsafe Especially after shopping don t want to leave our purchases in the room , Location Super close to moulin rouge Near subway station too Super clean and beautiful brand new bathroom A bit small though but acceptable 
186854,Trinit Haussmann, Breakfast was sufficient but proper sized croissants would ve been a bonus , Best nights sleep in ages We had a fantastic stay for 3 nights The rooms are beautifully presented and designed with excellent quality fittings Nice finishing touches such as the wireless speakers and White Company toiletries 
186855,Trinit Haussmann, I thought it missed alot of the extras that I would expect in a 4 star hotel Bathroom was poorly equipped no body cream no cotton wool plastic cup instead of glasses Not even a shower cap We had to change room the second night as we had a ground floor room and it was noisy , New decor is attractive and smart
186856,Trinit Haussmann, I booked the hotel as a double room for my partner and I on what was supposed to be our engagement weekend When we arrived we were put in a twin room with two small single beds pushed together There was no attempt to tell us that we weren t in a double room When I went to the reception to inform them that we had been put in a twin room by mistake I was told by the lady at reception that they did not have any double rooms as apparently the toilet was broken in the double room which I was sceptical about When I asked politely if there was anything that could be done she rudely replied that s not my problem and then turned away from me I couldn t believe how rude she was I was stunned Another couple overheard as they went past and told me that they had the exact same experience My suspicions that the hotel lied about the broken toilet were confirmed when I e mailed them and they replied with a different excuse that they had overbooked They added that they would compensate me with a free breakfast This is basically a scam where a hotel makes you pay for a double room knowing that they do not have one they have squeezed two uncomfortable single beds together in the hope that they will get away with it They do not care remotely about your comfort so please do not anticipate that they will do anything to make your stay more comfortable I honestly am not a demanding customer in most cicumstances and rarely make any form of complaint but feel it necessary to warn people that even though I can accept that this hotel s rooms are small not well ventilated and a little uncomfortable but they do not provide rooms to the specificity they claim and are incredibly rude with little to no customer service There are vastly better options all around Paris Do not trust this hotel as more reviews become available at this relatively new hotel you will discover that this is far from a legitimate and respectable four star hotel , Being able to leave this review so others dont make the same mistake that I did 
186857,Trinit Haussmann, The wifi was very bad in the rooms located on the left side of the hotel We had to go down to the lobby every night to check our emails and talk to our families But it was fun anyway The breakfast could have been better maybe an add of some vegetables like tomatoes cucumbers some olives would ve been great , The hotel is located in a calm area the staff are very helpful cooperative and kind The room is modern decorated and clean the bed is comfy and the shower is very nice 
186858,Trinit Haussmann, Blocked drains in sink and shower Caused a smell Sink fixed Shower still did not drain well Cleaning staff should be encouraged to report these things before guests arrive as it was a real shame Our second bedroom also had bad basin drainage and a smell Staff very efficient and professional in dealing with it , Excellent friendly and helpful staff Comfy beds
186859,Trinit Haussmann, The rooms are quite small for a 4 stars hotel Cleaning services could be better Heating was not working in our room , Helpful staff 5mn walking from metro station 
186860,Trinit Haussmann, The breakfast is not that good no real coffee machine Very stuffy in the breakfast room In the mornings a terrible smell of sewage comes out of the bathroom in the room ,No Positive
186861,Trinit Haussmann, Not working air conditioner No english tv channels we didnt spend much time in the rooms however just one tv channel would have been nice to wind down to before bed , The bed was very comfortable and the rooms clean Liked the window however the air conditioning didnt work for my room in October Aside from that its a pleasant hotel with very accomodating receptionist who booked us in way before time I really appreciated that 
186862,Trinit Haussmann, Poor tea and coffee services Sugar was not replaced at all over our three night stay Also not enough milk to have a tea or coffee Staff also failed to replace our toilet paper WiFi was available but the connection was very poor , Reception Staff were very friendly and helpful Rooms were very clean 
186863,Trinit Haussmann, Only small issue was parking there isnt any at the hotel There is a carpark about 2min walk away but it was 30 euros a day Would be good if you could get a discount if you are staying at the hotel but otherwise no complaints at all , Brilliant hotel Ignore any negative reviews the whole place was renovated this year and it s amazing Exactly as pictures staff were all super friendly breakfast was really nice beds were the comfiest ever the room was really quiet and the Aircon was a lifesaver as it was 30 degrees in Paris whilst we were there The location was great as well about 20min walk to everything Would absolutely recommend 
186864,Trinit Haussmann, Reception a little overstretched on the morning of our departure, Close to St Georges metro station Pigalle and Montmartre Bright and welcoming foyer Well equipped though rather small room and en suite 24hour Reception we didn t arrive until nearly 1am Swift straightforward check in Efficient left luggage service 
186865,Trinit Haussmann, The only lift was tiny Although it claims it can take four we struggled to fit comfortably as a trio with one piece of hang luggage each Breakfast was a big disappointment For 15 I expected better service There is the typical breads meat sausage and cereal but when we explained we don t eat wet scrambled eggs we were informed eggs could not be ordered So we ate elsewhere for 8 each and made to order eggs Only blip in our stay To be honest I m not surprised we didn t see anyone at breakfast , The hotel is located on a quiet street near the Moulin Rouge if you re not paying attention you might miss it The reception area although small is lovely We arrived around 10pm and were informed we d been upgraded from a triple room into a double and twin free of charge which was lovely for my mum as it was her first time in Paris and she didn t have to share a small room The double was massive Only let down was some damage to the bathroom wall under the sink The beds were insanely comfortable the AC perfect There was a safe in both rooms tv lovely mirrors and a nice shower Our twin was small but we loved it Didn t need anything bigger but we re 20 somethings and it was a short stay If you re planning to spend a lot of time in the room or bringing a lot of luggage a bigger toom is probably necessary The hotel was wonderful and I would definitely stay here again
