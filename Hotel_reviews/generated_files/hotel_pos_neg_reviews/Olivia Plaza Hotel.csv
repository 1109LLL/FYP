414395,Olivia Plaza Hotel,No Negative, We were upgraded to a penthouse room with a spectacular view huge soaker tub lovely bathroom overall Amazing location just steps from the Ramblas and an easy walk to the Gaud sites or the Barri Gotic We had dinner at the restaurant and though expensive it was lovely delicious low key and we were able to take our drinks back to the room Very relaxing The doormen were exceptionally pleasant and knowledgeable 
414396,Olivia Plaza Hotel, We didn t eat at the hotel Not much menu information and dining area looked a little gloomy , Great central location Excellent staff with quiet comfortable room Staff were helpful and considerate 
414397,Olivia Plaza Hotel, It s a very minor issue Our room had a nice rain shower which worked very well but the shower base was a bit slippery and was too flat to effectively drain the water away fast enough Water tended to flow under the shower door onto the floor in the area of the toilet The bathroom is sort of open plan and is right in front of you as soon as you enter the room This didn t bother us at all but it is a somewhat strange layout , Superb unbeatable location absolutely fantastic Very friendly helpful staff Excellent facilities we were lucky enough to have a big room with a lovely balcony on the 9th floor We had a view right over Plaza del Catalunya We LOVED it and will go back there if we ever return to Barcelona Wifi was excellent full strength signal in our room Possibly not fast enough to stream HD video but it was great for normal browsing Lovely breakfast if a bit expensive 
414398,Olivia Plaza Hotel,No Negative, The staff greeted us with campaign and quick service The staff spoke multiple languages and were very helpful The bathroom was the best we have experienced in Europe A few feet from pubic transportation La Rambla and Catalunya Square was perfect for enjoying a great city 
414399,Olivia Plaza Hotel, The buffet was very assorted and tasty but in a small place , We stayed at the Olivia Plaza Hotel and it was perfect The staff was very nice and always available If you want to be at the center of Barcelona this is the perfect Hotel the subway bus and taxi are 20 meters away The decoration is beautiful and they treat us very well 
414400,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Nothing even when we mentioned there could be more English breakfast tea bags they arrived a plenty , We were there for our anniversary and the staff could not have made it more special from an upgrade to a suite and complimentary bottles of cava The most comfortable bed and a stunning view over the city although as soon as you closed the door to the terrace that hustle and bustle noise disappeared behind a sound proof doors 
414401,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Nothing all was perfect, The staff were so kind specially at check in time the location is great the view from rooms in the 9th floor is more than amazing 
414402,Olivia Plaza Hotel,No Negative, Everything was perfect from the moment we came until the moment we left We got royal treatment the hole time great hospitality from the staff treats and Cava and then the final bonus was that we got to keep our room until the evening as we had a late flight back home I will recommend this hotel to everyone and will definitely be back Thank you for making our stay in Barcelona so pleasant 
414403,Olivia Plaza Hotel, NOTHING, One of the best hotel I been they very helpful good service clean room always they even upgraded me for my anniversary highly recommend This hotel
414404,Olivia Plaza Hotel,No Negative, Me and my husband stopped for 5 nights at the amazing hotel On arrival we were upgraded to a suite and given a bottle of bubbly with strawberries dipped in chocolate made our stay even more special Location was perfect Close to everything and allowed us to walk the Ramblas everyday As the hotel is located near the ramblas there is alot of choices for food Everything is located close by so we walked everywhere The hotel was always clean i admit i am very picky but i couldnt fault the hotel and we never had any issues Very helpful at reception also Would definately come back to the hotel again 
414405,Olivia Plaza Hotel, The curtains were not closing completely so light was entering the room No posibility to open the windows therefore no fresh air , The location si good the hotel is great and the staff is very nice 
414406,Olivia Plaza Hotel, For the cost of the hotel I was bit surprised at the amount of dust in the room I was also surprised to hear doors slamming from the hallway while in my room sleeping , The location of the hotel was great The staff was helpful with dining recommendations They also did a great job of seeking feedback during my stay as opposed to waiting until I left When I checked in the staff provided me with a room upgrade and my view of the area was spectacular 
414407,Olivia Plaza Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was so close to everything from food entertainment nightlife and banking The staff was exceptional and very helpful The rooms were posh private and spotless The hotel although located in the hustle and bustle of Gothic Square was private and quiet The room had plenty of space I had a really great time and will return to this hotel again when I come back to Barcelona 
414408,Olivia Plaza Hotel,No Negative, Wonderful view of Plaza Catalyuna from the huge window Staff were very helpful Security was good very important in such a high traffic location Didn t use the restaurant but it looked lovely There was a cafe right next door which was good for a fast breakfast or snack 
414409,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Night trip to bathroom light lights the bed area disturbing spouse Less table space no dress drawers tiny wash basin area , Location cleanlyness view
414410,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Slow Wifi Safe was placed above the fridge and was red hot Couldn t leave electronics in it Pillows were awful Could perhaps include U K TV channels Rather expensive for what you get, Staff are fantastic Size of room location bed size and breakfast
414411,Olivia Plaza Hotel, The lifts one was broken for 2 days and it took forever to wait for the other one 9 floor hotel on a weekend but the stairs were open and clean , The room upgrade i was given on arrival was great We had enough space in our twin room The view of Barcelona was amazing The staff were all so friendly and helpful Everything was clean i would stay here again It s central Barcelona and everything is in Walking distance to trains buses sites and shopping is right at your door 
414412,Olivia Plaza Hotel, There is nothing i didnt like but would like to suggest if they could provide Hot Kettle Iron and bottle of waters in the room like all other hotels do Nevertheless it was still amazing and we were served on request, Very good Hospitality and location of the Hotel
414413,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Nothing at all Everything is amazing , It s an amazing hotel with very wonderful and friendly stuff So clean very well designed rooms and its location is in the center and a few steps away from subway and bus station Breakfast is quiet satisfying When we got there they provided us a room with a view of the pla a and sent our room two bottles of champagne which was a very kind gesture I will definitely stay here whenever I go to Barcelona and I advise it to all my friends 
414414,Olivia Plaza Hotel, The Internet on the eighth floor could have been faster maybe invest in another router for the top floors Room would benefit from minor refurbishment work , The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful with a great upgrade to our room to a complimentary bottle of wine upon our arrival and departure to the usefulness of the staff Hotel conveniently located 15 30 minute walk from all major landmarks minutes away from the shopping district taxis easily available and metro opposite the hotel 
414415,Olivia Plaza Hotel,No Negative, I loved everything about this hotel It was perfectly located and the room was huge with a great rain shower a comfortable and large bed Modern d cor with a great view of the plaza We were given champagne on arrival and there was a bottle waiting for us in our room They gave us another bottle the next night Staff was super friendly rooms were kept spotless by the housekeeping staff We would definitely stay here again 
414416,Olivia Plaza Hotel, VERY busy congested area in the center of town very crowded Didn t care for the few people permanently camping out in front of the building with their dogs Not as prominent by other higher end hotels in the area Wifi not very good but this is typical for many European hotels , The location was very good Easy access to transportation shopping restaurants The staff was excellent Very accommodating personable We were left champagne on two separate occasions in our room Very nice gesture 
414417,Olivia Plaza Hotel, The layout of the room and bathroom was not what I expected from a 4 star property But this was overshadowed by the quality of the staff at the hotel , This hotel has a great location in the heart of the city Plaza Catalunya That tops everything Else The staff are extremely courteous and friendly and that is another plus 
414418,Olivia Plaza Hotel, For once I can t find anything that could have been better , The room was great with a good view of Placa Catalunya location just perfect Staff extremely helpful and friendly Breakfast was all you wish for and lunch too Definitely a place to go back to 
414419,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Small breakfast area and selection of food , Great location Very friendly and helpful staff Great rooms with incredible view Take the room with the view It worth it I wholeheartly recommend this hotel We had great time there 
414420,Olivia Plaza Hotel, nothing it was a positive experience, The staff were fantastic endlessly helpful charming and always smiling The hotel is centrally located but the noise of the busy plaza never penetrates the hotel 
414421,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Although we were upgraded to a suite it was lacking storage drawers The room was fantastic but I guess they expect you to only have hanging clothes and live our of your suite case , The staff makes this hotel shine Plus the location across from the Catalonia Plaza makes it ideal for getting to most tourist attractions in Barcelona Many of the excursions tour buses and city buses are stopping right in front of the hotel The Hard Rock restaurant is next door and that s normally the pickup point for many tours that are booked The staff couldn t have been nicer and we were greeted by name any time we stopped to ask a question or directions 
414422,Olivia Plaza Hotel,No Negative, The staff were friendly and the front desk manager markos was very helpful and gave us a free upgrade Location was great and room had a great view Near the VAT tax refund counter as well for shopaholics 
414423,Olivia Plaza Hotel, I cannot fault them The room staff kept the room spotless and all services were very friendly , We received an unexpected upgrade and had a beautiful view over the Placa Catalunya really delighted The staff were truly honestly helpful and generous with bonus bottles of Cava and special deals for the breakfast buffet I believe their advice about local restaurants was honest Nothing was ever any trouble 
414424,Olivia Plaza Hotel, During checkout they asked me to return the 3 plug which I borrowed I never borrowed any They also said I drank some beer I don t drink They didn t insist but I left feeling a bit uneasy I didn t do those things then who did them and did the staff believe me , They gave us an upgrade
414425,Olivia Plaza Hotel,No Negative, The Staff was super friendly and helpful They gave us a free room upgrade and a bottle of champagne on arrival They gave us ideas and directions for sightseeing and tapas bars The Location was in the heart of everything with public transportation right there in the plaza 
414426,Olivia Plaza Hotel,No Negative, The location of the property was convenient for shopping dining and public transport Our room was at very high floor so it was pretty quiet All staff at the hotel were friendly and most accommodating with our requests for restaurant recommendations bookings etc 
414427,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Toaster was hopeless No draws and not much storage, Bed and pillows very comfortable Only had breakfasts in Hotel so couldnt rate other meals On busy road but no night noise We had lovelly view from our room Also hotel had good security
414428,Olivia Plaza Hotel,No Negative, Great service by the team very pleasant and helpful We got an upgraded room that was facing Plaza Catalonya which was great We got a late checkout option with no extra charge 
414429,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Nothing it was excellent, We were upgraded to a suite as it was our silver wedding anniversary and the staff were superb making us feel special all the time Thank you so much
414430,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Glass door on bathroom I doubt the architect ever tried using the bathroom , Breakfast was lovely great choice and well presented Staff on reception desk very helpful and friendly The location was probably the best part as you had the Barri Gothi behind the hotel and the magnificent Placa de Catalyna in front with the Passeig de Garcia directly above The bonus was its close proximity the the aerobus 
414431,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Breakfast was bad Coffee and cappuccino not drinkable at all the quality of the food was ok but not consistent with the price , Excellent Location service comfort 
414432,Olivia Plaza Hotel, The hotel menu was very limited in its choice and not very enticing it was also very expensive Drinks both non alcoholic and alcoholic were also very expensive The shower toilet shared a sliding glass door that was very hard to close from inside especially with wet hands there were no handles to use and the glass door was very heavy to move , The staff were really friendly and couldn t do enough for us The location was excellent The hotel was very appealing in its design layout 
414433,Olivia Plaza Hotel,No Negative, Lovely Breakfast and quite a variety too Food was fresh everyday Excellent service from every member of staff Couldn t get a better location impeccable service and very clean Couldn t fault it 
414434,Olivia Plaza Hotel, I could not pick fault with this place or it s staff and is local for all your needs, This place has everything you need for a break With lovely friendly staff nice food and is in a super location for all your needs 
414435,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Someone wrote soundproof well its not really so but there is no noise from the other rooms and from outside just police cars or if there is a band playing just in front of the hotel but really quite at night, Extra nice if they have availability they let you check out late this gave us an extra half day to spend in the city
414436,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Nothing at all this hotel was perfect for our stay , The staff were fantastic very helpful The location was great you could not find a better location in Barcelona for the price Rooms were very comfortable and clean 
414437,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Nothing, Very good location in front of placa catalunya near to aerobus stop Barcelona tour bus la rambla pasage de Gracia others tourist attraction the room is awesome we got the view to placa catalunya 
414438,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Breakfast could have been less expensive 18 euros per person for a small breakfast buffet was way too much , Best Hotel Everything from the front desk staff s recommendations for a great tapas restaurant help with a local tour company for a missed tour etc Doormen congenial helpful and efficient room was fabulous and unbelievable location Located on Plaza de catalunya just a block from Las ramblas and directly across the street from both Hop On Hop Off tour companies buses as well as the Aerobus that takes you directly to the airport Could not have asked for better 
414439,Olivia Plaza Hotel, About olivia nothing that we didn t like, Olivia plaza is very centrally located at the la ramblas The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful All the time smiling Oscar the manager Eli Michael Sam all of them are wonderful Thanks for the surprise upgrade But must tell you about these 2 restaurant around the restaurants namely Nuria extremely arrogant and bad behaved staff Don t know common courtesy and manners with young girls Another restaurant by name la Pomel they served us us tiramisu which was hardly like tiramisu On telling the server the same instead of being polite he was rude and spoke to us very arrongantly
414440,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Not being there longer , Really great surprise arrived and upgraded for free Room overlooking the Plaza Great touch was free glass of Cava on arrival and then a further bottle delivered to the room compliments of the house Great hotel great room great location fantastic staff 
414441,Olivia Plaza Hotel, The lobby bar restaurant area is not very welcoming in the evening A good sound system or live music would probably draw more people in to make use of the beautiful area , Location was excellent but this is not an easy drive up to Hotel Be prepared to walk in from a Plaza area Staff are available to help you with your bags to get back to the curb for a taxi pick up Very central location for sightseeing tours buses and the subway 
414442,Olivia Plaza Hotel, This was covered above , The room was modern but beginning to see wear and tear The materials used when they updated the room was not as good as quality as I am sure they would expected The location was superb Breakfast was available but no menu only buffet at a very high cost we felt So we elected to search for best places to eat and try a different one each day This was a lot more fun 
414443,Olivia Plaza Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is located in a good position on the Pla a Catalunya which is at the end of Las Ramblas The staff were very attentive and accommodating at all times the room was very comfortable and we had a great view of the square from our window There are plenty of Restaurants and shops nearby and the Hop on Hop off tourist bus route begin from the square I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anybody visiting Barcelona 
414444,Olivia Plaza Hotel, WiFi is free at the hotel for 5 users But it was one of the worst I have ever seen Sometimes I had to use GSM data line even for the e mail traffic , The best thing about this hotel is the staff They were polite and helpful Stayed in the suite with a sofa converted into a bed for our son It was a spacious and well designed room with enough privacy for the families with senior children The room and the bathroom were very clean It is located in the center of Barcelona in the middle of La Rambla and Passeig de Gracia Strongly recommended 
414445,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Wifi was very weak They said it s about to change so , Great location very clean and beautiful room the staff was very welcoming and kind breakfast was good Will definitly come back 
414446,Olivia Plaza Hotel, I would have liked if the hotel has a leisure centre although I know we had access to a swimming pool and gym at another location We had great air con too but as we were situated so high up our room had a large floor to ceiling picture window but this did not for safety reasons open , We booked a Superior Double Room with a view We were upgraded to a top floor Superior Room with a Super King Sized bed and tremendous views out of Placa de Catalunya and over the city The room was large and bright with a large dual shower and a lovely wet room Decor was tasteful and very modern 
414447,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Nil, We only stayed one night unfortunately and couldn t stay longer as the hotel was booked out but found the hotel to be good value for money and well located
414448,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Nothing just perfect Perfect place to stay in Barcelona , Perfect hotel on Plaza Catalunya next to Hard Rock Cafe the location is perfect Aerobus from airport stops just in front of the hotel Metro buses and taxi are also available in front of hotel Very clean staff is very helpfull the upgraded us into a suite for free with a view just on the Plaza Free welcome drink and complimentary bottle of sparkling wine in our room in the afternoon very goo wifi 
414449,Olivia Plaza Hotel, The pullout couch bed was horrible but I guess there is no such thing as real triple room in Europe Wireless is very bad , Great service at reception very attentive people Location is excellent for exploring the city hotel is clean smells great and rooms are nicely appointed Breakfast is ok 
414450,Olivia Plaza Hotel, The food served at the breakfast wasn t that great This is only because we stayed at quite a few places before this so we had something to compare this by , The Service is just excellent
414451,Olivia Plaza Hotel, In the bathroom facilities there is a build up of moisture and dust where the glass meets the floor this needs a brush, The personalised interaction is unheard of in hotels these days and so it came as a very pleasant surprise the food at breakfast was fresh well laid out and a good variety was offered being connected to the gothic quarter was a bonus the reception service amazed me as did the door attendants 
414452,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Personally we didn t like the bath in the bedroom itself with no privacy , Every member of staff was considerate and professional The manager took a personal interest in our visit and made recommendations for the next part of our trip The breakfast was good catering especially well for a gluten free diet The room was very clean and well resourced 
414453,Olivia Plaza Hotel, wifi was very weak and intermittent The layout of the room was contemporary and modern but not user friendly for families with kids particularly bathroom and WC , The staff particularly Mario and Oscar were very helpful Everyone in the hotel was very helpful and courteous The service was excellent and everyone was ready to help The location of the hotel is excellent everything is on the doorstep Breakfast was very good I can t default service or staff 
414454,Olivia Plaza Hotel, room facilities were bizarre no bathroom as such small sink behind a wall plus two small cubicles for WC and shower respectively sharing a sliding door no doors on the wardrobe It s a pity because it somewhat tarnishes an otherwise perfect stay , staff very friendly competent and polite from manager to usher excellent location comfortable quiet room although directly over the Catalunya plaza all 4 star amenities provided bathrobes slippers cafe tea machine cosmetics etc 
414455,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Nothing, Staff was very polite and helpful Made us feel very comfortable from the very first moment of our stay We received an upgraded room which was the highlight of our trip Everything was excellent 
414456,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Only the internet The speed is terrible, Excellent place with marvelous view The best staff and services you may imagine for a hotel specially Ms Laura We reserved a room for 3 persons but they gave us a large suit looking to the main Catalonia square with the same price From time to time they ask for any special services they brought regularly mineral water everything was perfect Very good breakfast Really value for money Thanks for the good management of the hotel 
414457,Olivia Plaza Hotel, The breakfast buffet area is a bit crowded and should be more spread out i e perhaps the coffee and juice could be put away from the buffet, Our room had a splendid view over the Placa de Catalunya but it was so quiet double glazing that we slept like babies The room had every comfort imaginable and the beds were very comfortable 
414458,Olivia Plaza Hotel, The wifi connection was really bad in our room And the bathtub was not cleaned before we checked in But this aside everything was amazing , Everything but especially the service the bed and the view 
414459,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Can t think of anything we didn t like , Location of hotel was excellent with transport links to rest of city right on the doorstep and most attractions in walking distance We were upgraded to a lovely room overlooking the square with complimentary cava and strawberries as it was my husband s birthday Staff were extremely helpful and friendly Bed comfy room quiet and the shower was excellent 
414460,Olivia Plaza Hotel, There was some concern with housekeeping We told them as we checked out However the front desk immediately made up and called the manager who offered us a lovely 3 course lunch before us departing to airport Excellent customer service , Excellent front desk service They have attended to our needs always straightaway They worked hard to give us the room types we need as we travelled with children
414461,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Internet could be a bit faster, The staff is very friendly and service minded from the doorman to the Managing Director Very flexible and caring Location is fantastic dead center close to La Rambla and Gaudi s buildings 
414462,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Their toilet privacy factor is a bit unusual as a sliding glass type door is shared with the shower door , The staff is fantastic in EVERY way Their caring helpfulness and support was amazing When I travel this far from home it made me feel very safe and secure 
414463,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Nothing, Took my girlfriend for her birthday to Barcelona When we got to the hotel we got upgraded to a room on the top floor with a view to placa Catalunya The service was amazing the staff friendly and with perfect english Our stay was perfect and we are certainly going to come back 
414464,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Everything was wonderful, The hotel is lovely and welcoming The staff are wonderful and very helpful The location is perfect The shops like Zara Mango H M are a stones throw away Right near the square We had a room with a view which is a fantastic view of the square Loved his hotel Location you can t get better 
414465,Olivia Plaza Hotel, What was there not to like , The staff from front desk to housekeeping were very friendly and pleasant The suite was spacious clean modern beds were very comfortable Breakfast was delicious and lots of choices Hotel location was perfect for us Couldn t have asked for better Just a lovely stay in a beautiful hotel in the heart of Catalunya A big thank you to everyone 
414466,Olivia Plaza Hotel, The cleaning of room But due to tired and jetlag of traveling we woke up late coz of time difference so our room wasnt able to clean up But if we woke up early and leave hotel early then the room will be cleaned , The location is very good The hotel offers good tours I ll surely recommend to my friends 
414467,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Whilst the room service staff were very helpful and friendly the food was average at best , The staff were very friendly Location is super Some of the other reviewers have complained of the noise Personally I was not bothered by any noise and I was on the Third floor
414468,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Nothing, Wonderful welcome The staff was excellent during my stay From beginning to end they were helpful smiling and professional My room was very good I like the design and the cleanliness The view from my terrace was awesome I can see the whole Place of Catalunya Amazing Also the private parking with access from lobby by lift is very appreciated The location is the best that you can find in Barcelona For sure I highly recommend thie hotel to anyone and I will be back with my family soon Thanks
414469,Olivia Plaza Hotel, No indication that the mini bar was charged for or what the charge was until we checked out as we d booked a suite we assumed this was complimentary as it often is with suites , Complimentary cava on arrival

414473,Olivia Plaza Hotel, The wifi is slow When I commented on it the staff tried their best to speed it up Which was great service The windows of our room was to the sea and it was not possible to block out the morning sun with the curtains , The location the staff and the atmosphere was all exceptionally good Friendly staff that wanted to do everything to make our stay great and they did The breakfast was very very good 
414474,Olivia Plaza Hotel,No Negative, The hotel and its staff where outstanding nothing was to much trouble and they really did go out of their way to make your stay an enjoyable one On arrival we were given a room upgrade with fantastic views of the city We didn t eat in the hotel so I can t comment on the food but I would recommend this hotel 100 We couldn t fault it at all 
414475,Olivia Plaza Hotel, 2 things which are still fine Lights in the room either too dark or too bright maybe a separate switch for each light will be easier Music in the corridor maybe the volume should be reduced Something nice a small coffee machine in the room everyone does that now so why not a nice hotel like Olivia Plaza , Extremely friendly staff nice room clean and modern Location is amazing

414586,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Some parts of the room hadn t been cleaned dusted for quite a while I ended up doing a little cleaning I wasn t a fan of the design style color scheme of the guest room and the furnishings were poor quality wobbly cheaply made The shower design made it very difficult to keep water from spilling out of the enclosure, Great location on Plaza Catalunya Efficient and super friendly staff at reception Beautiful outdoor bar area

414593,Olivia Plaza Hotel, Only thing we would have preferred was a later bar restaurant after a day of walking around th city and surrounding areas we would arrive back most nights after 11pm which the bar restaurant closed With the time difference in the uk that s 10pm which leaves us with the option of the more expensive room service which we all like to avoid if possible Although there was a lot that is available 24 hours , Excellent staff receptionist was very nice was nice enough to upgrade us to a city view room Hotel had a very relaxed feel Thank you to the doorman that was very nice too on our leave we were offered a water on checking out which the receptions realised there was none and searched for but as we had a flight to catch we suggested we would leave that offer It s the little things that count though Will be returning in the near future
