53897,The Goring, Lift was a bit slow , Very attentive service staff knew your name sumptuous rooms attention to detail Immactulate service Nothing a problem Location was great for Victoria Station and visit to Buckingham Palace 
53898,The Goring, was served an extremely tough steak the second one was not much better so was given fish instead this was dry and not the best and I left most of it but they charged me on the bill I would have expected a free drink at least plus no charge for the meal, bed excellent d cor lovely garden very good
53899,The Goring, There was nothing that we didn t like Maybe the drinks from the bar could have been a bit cheaper but compared to other hotels at least when you are charged a premium you get quality, Fabulous hotel great location within walking distance of Victoria station so access to all of London via underground Easy walking distance to Buckingham Palace The Mall Trafalgar Square and on to Leicester Square Covent Garden and ChinaTown Whitehall Horseguards Downing Street Cenotaph Churchills War Rooms and Houses of Parliament Westminster Abbey and Westminster Bridge The hotel itself is beautiful and oozes quality and great customer service Absolutely beautiful 
53900,The Goring, Nothing of real consequence although they did charge me for cleaning I did not have done However it was the hotel that pointed this out to me and provided an immediate refund , Great food and almost all the staff were great
53901,The Goring, Breakfast selection options were average or just explained poorly head of staff at breakfast seemed to be in a rush and just a little abrupt , Level of detail friendliness by staff was mightly impressive Overall a truly wonderful place 
53902,The Goring,No Negative, An excellent hotel so peaceful and quiet with a lovely room and wonderfully attentive and polite staff It was a lovely place to go for a celebration birthday 
53903,The Goring, The lounge staff were not so good very slow and not particularly diligent Every order we had was the same but turned up different and we had to confirm our room number ALOT , The hotel is beautiful and the door staff and concierge were great The food was also excellent 
53904,The Goring, Nothing to dislike , The service was exceptional Everything was excellent The staff were very welcoming and we were made to feel very comfortable throughout the hotel 
53905,The Goring, no fridge in room no hair dryer no tea or coffee in room these are basics not practical to ring for room service for these items every time water provided but is warm restaurant is defiantly not a michelin star had white fish on white plate with white veg very salty very very disappointed will not return, staff are very friendly
53906,The Goring, The room was gorgeous but too small, The staff were exceptional and the hotel felt like a country residence in the heart of London The food was also fabulous 
53907,The Goring, Nothing it was lovely Maybe tea and coffee in the room But the room service was quick and efficient , Fabulous friendly staff we felt like we had stayed a hundred times though it was only our second visit My daughter and her friend arrived to meet us while we were out and were made to feel welcome and comfortable The bedroom was beautiful and very comfortable and we were both able to take some work calls in the gorgeous sitting room We were able to easily get to everything we needed in London it s a very quick walk to The Palace gardens and shops we will certainly stay again 
53908,The Goring, Restaurant food did not feel like michelin star, Staff was amazing Real 5 star service made you feel special and not like a number Shannon at reception and the guys at the door were excellent Concierge staff also very helpful 
53909,The Goring, No complaints at all , Staff superb service manner attitude all excellent Nothing too much trouble Very comfortable particularly in lounge and bar area Good tasty light bar meals Excellent gin selection Haven t had a better experience anywhere in Europe or rest of world 
53910,The Goring, Temperature in dining room and lounge a little on the cool side Sunday evening , Very nice meal in restaurant Sunday evening All four guests delighted 
53911,The Goring, Room above must have had no carpets unlike ours because we could hear furniture being moved dragged about , Despite the fact that the kingsize bed was joined it did not give at the edges and was very comfy Staff were excellent nothing is too much trouble Food is also excellent 
53912,The Goring, That our stay at The Goring was not long enough , Outstanding attention to detail friendly service making us feel very at home Loved every moment of our stay 
53913,The Goring, The air conditioning in the bedroom didn t work very well and the water system needs updating bath took a long time to unfill, The staff are fantastic location is very good afternoon tea awesome
53914,The Goring, The hotel mentions a gym However the gym is just one running machine and a stepper in a closet I think they should be clearer when booking Of course there are acres of lovely running in the nearby parks or along the river but I would rather know this up front so I could bring my running shoes as opposed to my gym shoes It is very posh for want of a better word I don t think this is good or bad If you like old school British formal then this will be amazing if you prefer laid back without two people holding a door open for you at every turn then you may find it a little overpowering As I said in the like comments though all of the staff were very friendly its just the style of the place and once you can navigate the small lobby you are all good , Superb location Staff were great from the reception to the bar I was there on business but always use the opportunity to have a look at a number of non chain hotels to see if its somewhere I may whisk my wife off to for a romantic weekend Rooms were small but nicely laid out I wasn t happy with my first room as it overlooked some bins but after a call down to reception the Welsh chap there Ned I think was super helpful and moved me to a top floor room 112 which was much more pleasant and a little more spacious If you want a great gastro pub head five minutes down the road to The Thomas Cubitt Great suggestion from Ned was a fantastic place to eat drink and people watch 
53915,The Goring, I wouldn t change a thing , Everything A beautiful hotel throughout Exceptionally friendly and helpful staff Beautifully appointed rooms Great peaceful location Thank you for a memorable stay 
53916,The Goring, Aircon not working TV remote needed new batteries Breakfast OK but could be better especially at the price , Excellent Lunch and very helpful staff Personal service and pretty garden
53917,The Goring, Absolutely nothing , Having been fortunate enough to stay in many stunning luxury hotels world wide The Goring is simply the best Its down to the attentive staff who clearly adore working at the hotel who go out of their way to make your stay special and to feel completely at home Oustanding thank you 
53918,The Goring, Small mistakes we asked for an additional paper in the morning which was confirmed with staff but didn t arrive The wrong food order was initially taken breakfast we asked for poached eggs on toast and the toast came 5 minutes later A hotel of this calibre shouldn t be making such mistakes all happened on a one night stay , Staff were exceptionally helpful and a pleasure
53919,The Goring, I wished we could have stayed more than one night , From the moment we arrived our whole experience was wonderful Warm friendly welcome Greeted us by name during our stay Extremely helpful Would love to stay there again A truly memorable experience
53920,The Goring, our luggage very small got muddled with someone else s and we waited 30 minute whilst contradictory messages were relayed we were in a hurry at checkout we were confused with another family of the same name , the room was prepared ahead of time and the staff were good at names reception arrivals were very good 
53921,The Goring, Not really a bad experience It s just that being a landscape artist I would like to have seen more colourful landscape pictures in the hotel Also a nice picture of HM the Queen , I had never been to a 5 star hotel before so was a little apprehensive When I entered the Goring I was immediately put at ease by the friendliness and politeness of all the staff They made it feel like home to me Morning tea delivered to my bedroom The Bathroom with it s underfloor heating The breakfast was fabulous Special thanks to Liz for sorting a small problem I m planning my next visit 
53922,The Goring, i did not like the fact that the waiter cleared the plates away when the whole table hadn t finished eating if when I asked him not to , Friendly staff
53923,The Goring, The breakfast is underwhelming and disappointing The smoked salmon and scrambled egg was very odd and even the fruit salad was tasteless Toast was cooked on one side only , Excellent staff offering a personal touch A very comfortable bed and relaxing room Wonderful decor throughout A lovely atmosphere in general Super afternoon tea 
53924,The Goring, Nothing , A very special hotel run by dedicated and professional staff Attention to detail seen there is seldom seen today at any price We also stayed at The Hilton Park Lane on this trip which was more expensive but sadly not a patch on the Goring 
53925,The Goring, I think you fell down on breakfast , The welcome and the superb staff all very helpful and efficient and they made sure they remembered your name which is a lovely touch Dinner was excellent too 
53926,The Goring, There was nothing bad about this hotel , Staff very welcoming and helpful Friendly warm atmosphere throughout We were given an upgrade Food superb 
53927,The Goring, Not a thing , Staff ways available to help but never hovering Surroundings felt like home Food and presentation was sumptuous and service was par excellence 
53928,The Goring, I was especially perturbed that a credit card was entirely blocked by the Hotel upon arrival not just the card number recorded as per other hotels but the card credit limit and cannot be redeemed for 3 days after departure This is unacceptable to me and since a card can be blocked in 3 to 5 seconds then why does it take 3 days to unblock it Therefore I will never return to The Goring again on principle , The Hotel in general and the Staff especially was fine and quite excellent Everybody was polite and helpful especially the Concierge service
