511962,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, The huge minuses for me were no WiFi in my room fifth floor Restarting the router didn t help at all so that was pretty disappointing As i need Internet for my work i will have to select another hotel next time in Wien Another point is that there was somebody smoking inside their rooms and the cigarette smell was all over the corridor and staircases although it is stated as a non smoking hotel This is not a fault of stuff though , It was a pleasant stay as i was coming back late at night i had no problems at all getting to the hotel the location is excellent The stuff was very friendly and helpful they were all russian speakers so might be useful for somebody Breakfast was good with a large selection of foods comparing to other hotels The rooms are clean and bright beds are comfortable towels are fluffy 
511963,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, This hotel should never be touted as a 4 star hotel It is a lie This hotel is between a backpacker hostel and 3 star Bed was without sheets Tv hopeless from 1950s Cleaning practically non existent Street noise is problem , Location Staff ok 
511964,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, Disappointed with breakfast nearly all tables are not cleaned from previous gests dirty cups and plates are not removed from the tables missing cups for coffee bowls knives and forks One person is working in breakfast area Food is not refilled A lot of food is missing sausages bread egs tomatoes We had breakfast one hour before closing 9 30 10 00 the breakfast is until 10 30, Very spacious rooms excellent location
511965,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, Breakfast needs improvement , Location was nice just 50 meter to trams with 4 station away from State opera While 300metre to Underground with 1 station away from Central Wien train station Rooms were clean comfort though the rooms were smaller size but that s all okay 
511966,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper,No Negative, Spacious room and toilet Comfortable bed With sink kettle microwave oven air conditioner and heater Staff were very helpful on providing transport information
511967,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, The whole room was a bit outdated but clean The windows looked at the street which were busy with trams passing regularly under the windows therefore the room was very noisy I had to use earplugs for sleeping and I had to turn on the air conditioning instead of opening the windows It is not recommended for long stay although the room would be big enough , The hotel is at an excellent location The room and bathroom was big and very well equipped fridge microwave air conditioning hair dryer Thick curtains could be used to keep strong streetlights out during night and strong sunlight at the morning There was a lot of options to choose from for breakfast It was a good value for the money 
511968,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, No coffee in complimentary coffee in the room Had to use the same towel for two days wasn t replaced Breakfast needs more continental muesli options to choose from , The size of the room the courtyard and the location to the city centre Staff members were also really friendly and nice
511969,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, furniture was very dated and dirty actually filthy TV sets were from previous century This is definitely not a four star hotel Breakfast eggs were cold didnt stay warm at all Hard beds a huge gap between two twin beds Would prefer a double bed Hotel does not have anything luxurious about it Pictures on the walls are old wrinkly and crooked , Breakfast was good enough staff was nice and helpful Spacious bathrooms Pretty clean 
511970,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper,No Negative, Perfect location in a quiet district Excellent transport accessibility tram underground train The State Vienna Opera and the city center pedestrian zone is only ten minutes walk away but you can sure take a tram too Friendly staff A big bathroom and good comfortable beds I would recommend the hotel to other guests and would be glad to come to this hotel myself again 
511971,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, Some people might expect a bit more refined comfort from a four star hotel However I felt well accomodated , Well situated between main station and city centre friendly personnel standard room comfort on Austrian level The neighbours have been uncommonly silent might be by chance and the breakfast was really excellent with broad choices try the cake and rolls Several supermarkets in walking distance pay regard to opening times 
511972,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, Breakfast from 7 am is too late We had to leave hotel at 7 am for places like Budapest and Prague Inspite of repeated requests to provide breakfast 15 mins before scheduled time they did not , We were given 2 rooms connected at check in as suite On request Mr Sasha changed it to real suite on top floor 
511973,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, Bottom sheet on bed felt like a mattresses protector , Many thanks to wonderful Mariana on reception for great information and advice Great facilities and excellent location 
511974,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, The water glasses in the room were not clean the minibar was empty the AC didnt work and the wifi was so slow that I could not even check my e mails ,No Positive
511975,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, Bathroom screen at bath tub could be longer to prevent water from splashing out and wetting the floor , Good location central to opera house and nearby to central station hop on off bus red and yellow lines Walking distance to castle and central park 
511976,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, 3 nights from my 6 nights here were TERRIBLE although the windows were to the inner yard very late in the nioght 1 am 2 am I and other guests hear very loud voices either talking to each other aparty or just talking to someone for 1 hour or so late in the night very loudly The price seems a bit high for the rooms , Friendly staff some speak Russian All is OK except the price i do not beleive this is 4 star hotel maybe 3 star and one serious problem in the night time see below
511977,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, Hotel parking lot was full paypark zone I spent another 35 Eur day in a neighbourhood garage Cheaper garage 10 Eur day was offered at quite a distance , Good location nice building nice staff 
511978,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, I didn t like this hotel at all Very bed facility the bed was so uncomfortable the WiFi poor was working only in the early morning Stuff was rude and arrogant , Location is good 
511979,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, The kitchen facilities were interesting Assorted crockery but just one cup A small collection of miscellaneous cutlery A complementary sign with two chamomile tea bags I left a complementary box of black tea tea bags The corridors unfortunately smelt strongly of cigarettes but my room didn t An unexpected heat wave meant a hot room and there was considerable street noise with the windows open I slept through it but others might not , Spacious room Close to a supermarket other shops and a pleasant walk to St Stephens Cathedral and other iconic sites Public transport almost at the door Windows you could open Good linen towels 
511980,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, The breakfast was one of the poorest I have experienced for the price we only paid for it for 1 day and decided to buy our own food though on check out we were told we had been to breakfast 2 days something the hotel needs to look at as you just say your room number maybe show your key too fortunately they believed us and we were not charged for the other day Curtains had lost some of backing which meant more light came through early in the morning , The location was perfect for us a few minutes from one of the main underground lines and across the road from a useful tram line also not far from the hop on hop off bus could have walked to main train station if it wasn t so hot The room was big comfortable and comfortable with 2 big windows Staff were friendly and helpful having a kitchen area with cutlery plates kettle and microwave 
511981,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, PRIVACY ONE ROOM HAS TOILET AND BATHROOM IN ANOTHER ROOM THOUGH IT WAS NOT MUCH OF A PROBLEM BUT FAMILY MEMBERS FELT IT WAS LITTLE DISADVANTAGE , LOCATION
511982,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, There was a lot of noise from the street car that passed every five minutes The table lamps did not work The sheet on the bed barely covered the mattress There was no suitcase stand The mini bar was empty Cleaning staff appeared when I was back in the room mid afternoon , Within walking distance to subway and grocery store Staff especially the first woman I met were helpful There was a safe in the closet The buffet breakfast was value for the money The building was non smoking 
511983,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, The furnishings are quite worn out but what needs to be thrown away are the squeaky mattresses Bad sleep is the worst thing you would want in a hotel , I mostly appreciate the presence of a little kitchenette in the room microwave kettle fridge and sink Breakfast was also great especially the probably home made spreads Hotel is really close to a tram stop so we had a great connection when travelling to work in Maria Enzersdorf and within a walking distance to the city center however after a long day on the feet the 900m distance was too long 
511984,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, The bedroom was a little cramped and the view was very claustrophobic inspire of a small terrace The breakfast was average coffee cold no facility to toast the bread , For a family of 4 the double room with the sofa cum bed was handy and value for money The location is very good within a KM of all key attractions
511985,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, Evening drinks selection availability, Croissants are perfect and the breakfast in general Already for 1 5 years I am permanent client of this hotel when in Vienna Perfect location and comfort for the short stay
511986,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, As for cleaning the outbuildings it gets a bit to be desired My impression is that there are few people for the entire hotel , Reasonable hotel good value for money We stayed in a kicthnete room with the basic equipment for a small meal Breakfast is good though it has few fruits The hotel is 10 minutes from the subway and two more shortly after from the nearest stop on the hop on hop off Continuing in the same direction you get downtown in another fifteen minutes walk It has a grossery store well complete within two minutes on the same street and same side It also has several banks ATMs small restaurants and cafes within a few minutes walk of the hotel As for the receptionists the attention varies If you want someone to help you with transfers tourism purchase of train tickets etc talk to Mariana She is perfect polite friendly kind and very helpful 
511987,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, Breakfast was a little expensive at 12 euros but it was tasty and there were other local options as well as many restaurants and coffee shops a short distance away by Metro , The hotel was optimally located near the restaurant we particularly wanted to visit Entler Ein Restaurant which was about half a block from the hotel Wonderful food and atmosphere very reasonably priced compared to what one would pay at a similar restaurant in the U S There was also a very convenient metro station which allowed us to visit the local sights inexpensively and the desk staff helped us plan our routes The room was large and comfortable including a small kitchenette The staff was exceedingly helpful for instance they arranged a car pickup to take us to the airport at the end of our visit saving considerably over the taxi fare we d paid upon arrival 
511988,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, Basically everything in this hotel reflects the greediness of the owner The TV is a model from 2001 I checked just like probably everything in the rooms The beds are squeaky windows are simple layer and for those which open on the main street half of them it s very noisy even at night The wifi doesn t work it s basically a basic subscription that is shared among all the guests and staff It is fine if you use internet when nobody does but you can t use at any time in the evening I couldn t even download a pdf properly The breakfast is ok but still low standard compared to what you can get at this price in Vienna There was an uncomfortable remanent smell in the bathroom I just can t believe this hotel is still surviving with all the competitors and the Airbnb around I do not recommend I don t blame the staff they do the best they can with what they have it s just that the owner and the management are absolutely awful , The room are very spacious 
511989,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, room on street side street noisy so noisy room a little bit to warm and no possibility to adjust the temperature, close to metro 5 min to the city centre by metro 2 stops and to the main railway station by metro 1 stop The main railway station has direct train to the airport 15 min 3 90 room clean and big breakfast ok
511990,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper,No Negative, The proximity of the metro made it so easy to get everywhere The staff were very helpful There is a great coffee shop next door Corto e Nero a very good local restaurant Wieden Brau and a superb restaurant Entler that make breakfast and dinner worthwhile 
511991,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, Bed was probably 140cm a slightly wider would be better for 2 adults The wooden doors are not that thick you could easily hear noices from the hallway even though the walls were thick enough , Location was good two tram lines going by and they went to the center even though it s ok to walk as the name tells 900 meters to the Opera house Center The hotel was satisfactory nothing fancy some updating would be nice but basic neat room and bathroom Breakfast was the biggest plus nothing fancy but I would say better compared to the hotel feeling coffee few different juices different breads eggs sausages bacon 2 breakfasts out of 4 cheese ham fresh vegetables jam yoghurt and cereals muesli Our window was on the street side some urban noices but quite peaceful during night the traffic was louder during day Yleisesti ihan ok Hinta laatusuhde k si k dess aamiainen oli parasta antia huone voisi olla pikkuisen isompi samoin s nky Pient pintaremppaa voisi tehd mutta kuten todettua muutamaksi y ksi aivan kelpo paikka ja hyv ll sijainnilla t ll hintahaarukalla 
511992,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, Wifi on level 5 was a bit weak but I imagine the walls to be thick , This place really is 900m from the State Opera House Very good value for money No fuss breakfast which was included in the price Room comfortable City centre a walk away Situated in a part of town with loads of local restaurant and small shops 
511993,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, Reception people change frequently Some of them do not cooperate , Generally It is value for money some of the people working there try their best to help The room is clean but not fancy 
511994,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, The toilet are very smelly Very strong urine smell when sitting on the toilet The bed were so old and cheap it make lot of squeeky noise There is kitchen but not washing gear to wash any dishes TV were so old It were more like a 2 star hotel , Room were good size 
511995,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, original price of the room was two times higher The Booking com is trying to raise original price to look the discount more attractive But the price after discount was most proper for this standard room It s not fair , location
511996,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper,No Negative, The most comfortable hotel Spacious room Very clean The perfect location historical center with all the sights and museums and theaters in a 7 8 minute walk Friendly staff I highly recommend it to everyone 
511997,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, breakfast can be improved, location of the hotel was very good it is on walking distance from central train station as well as city center and many attractions breakfast was not bad either but it could get better having said that it was great value for money I requested for few print outs which was handled very pleasantly by the reception 
511998,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, There could be a wider choice of meal for breakfast , The hotel is placed not far from the center but on quiet location Definitely it is not true 4 star hotel but on the other hand there was not much that we would miss 
511999,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, The noise of the trams cars and people talking if you have a street facing room and light sleep you will have a rough night I ask to change room the next night and it was much better , The sympathy of the employees The location is 10min walkinng from the Vienna Opera 
512000,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, Cleaning was sloppy in bathroom Trash bin under kitchen sink had not been emptied from prior guests Staff helpful and forthcoming though when pointing that out , Good size room and comfy bed Good location near Naschmarkt and public transport Close to good grocery store Sink micro water heater basic plates and cuttlery in the room enough to fix a meal Quite budget priced so it is good value for money 
512001,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, The building and rooms were clean but shabby Walls needed to be painted as did baseboards and around the elevator The room was cramped and the bathtub and shower were very difficult to get into and out of Perhaps it was just this room with many angles 57 , We liked the location It was easy to walk to the center of Vienna The woman that checked us in was very helpful The lady the next morning was OK but nearly as the lady that checked us in They were good about getting us a taxi

512009,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, They are further than 900m to the opera it was more like 1300m Not a big deal but if that s your name it should be accurate The breakfast was extremely limited and not very satisfying , The location was very convenient and I felt safe in the neighborhood I was able to check in at 11am already which was lovely And they upgraded me Wonderful thanks

512014,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, Wifi hardly working on top floor facilities rather worn also true of the hotel which is hardly a 4 star one in its current state hot food options limited at breakfast , Great location metro station nearby and center is in walking distance staff was polite and very helpful room was already ready and I could check in at 12 the room was clean and well heated It was fine for a short stay

512020,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, I would not recommend this place in a million years The man in the reception when we arrived on the afternoon of the 2nd was the rudest and most unpleasant man I have ever come across If you want someone to treat you with disrespect and make you feel bad stupid and useless for no evident reason come here It took him two seconds to be rude from the moment we arrived and he was equally unpleasant impertinent and unhelpful throughout our stay I m sure not all staff are as bad as him we did met one nice man when checking out but just in case I would recommend booking another hotel ,No Positive
512021,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, One of the three heaters was broken and we received a funny reason that only this heater functions depending on the temperature below 0 outside It s not that cold in your room they said We had to insist a lot to get an extra blanket even a sold out hotel should have some The breakfast buffet was not refilled in the last 30 40 minutes which is unacceptable for a 4 hotel how much would it cost to have a few more croissants in order for everyone to get one Too much noise from the street tram running through , The junior suite was really spacious and comfortable with great facilities incl microwave and complimentary items like prosecco Location was great apart from the noise 
512022,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, Hello 01 01 2017 we stayed in your hotel My name NYCYPORENKO OLEKSANDR for all of your services I paid cash because on this day you have not worked for the terminal and gave an error on the next day But Yesterday 03 01 2017 years I have with your card the hotel will charge my credit card the amount of 26 60 euros I demand to explain to me the reason for this transaction and get my money back immediately Otherwise I will be forced through your bank to contact your bank and collect that amount Thank you,No Positive

512027,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, Breakfast was good many options but not the best , Very large room good location 20 minutes walk to Stephansplatz Good value for the money we paid Would stay here again 
512028,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, In the confirmation was that the car parking reservation is not necessary The parking was full Therefore the parking was inconvenient and complicated Wifi almost never operated internet access was uncertain The room was run down shabby uncomfortable sofa bed a four star hotel facilities are not adequate, Good location Good breakfest
512029,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, All great almost maybe minor maintenance for unnecessary stuff but wouldn t affect my positive satisfied review about the hotel loved it there , Clean Comfortable Great location great staff one of my best choices ever really perfect hotel great value Loved my stay hoped my stay was longer 
512030,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, Hard to fault this accommodation but having a room with windows overlooking the main road meant that it was noisy Only other fault was not enough milk for brewing up in the room but extra supplies were easily obtained at reception , Very friendly and helpful staff Breakfast on site was a bonus with wide selection of hot and cold food to choose from My room was spacious and comfortable complete with mini bar tea coffee microwave and kitchen sink Location excellent close to metro tram outside the door and a short walk to the city 
512031,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, Quite a distance to walk to the Opera My husband had a bad experience with the senior blonde front office lady who s kinda rude to answer his request to extend the check out time A simple sorry will do if you cant accommodate but she doesn t have to be sarcastic with her explanations , A simple basic room for a good night sleep The front guy probably the manager was kind enough to upgrade our room Tram station just a short distance from hotel 
512032,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, Very poor wifi Could hear the trams passing by in the street with closed windows , The room was really spacious with kitchenette Friendly staff Nice bathroom with bathtub

512035,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, We had a very small room on the top floor and getting into the right side of the bed meant being very careful to not hit your head Also the glass holding the spoons had lipstick inside of it which made us wonder how clean the other items were The refrigerator wasn t working but we didn t need it and forgot to mention it on check out The furnishings were looking a little worn and there was plaster peeling off of the wall around the window , Great location in a real neighborhood You can walk to the ring in about 10 minutes and there is a tram stop nearby We appreciated the parking garage and the great warm gluten free rolls they had on hand for my husband s breakfast There was a good variety of items at breakfast too The staff were friendly and helpful and we could leave the car in the garage for two hours after we had checked out 
512036,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, When breakfast room full only one staff member couldn t manage all duties so although rather good and rich breakfast was incomplete , Good location parking option big room
512037,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, Really cant think of anything sensible , We found it excellent all round Hard to see why anyone would grumble unless one had an unusual experience All 3 staff we dealt with were pleasant room was as clean and tidy as you would want We had a rear room but altho it has trams the main road isnt as busy ie noisy as some would make out and the glass is double glazed so I wouldn t be too scared to try a room facing the pretty street If you like a hotel near stuff but on the edge of the old town rather than in it this is bang on Have a pint of splendid Helles at the brewery around the corner then grab a bike at the city bike stand 100m away so so easy to use and mostly free and wobble your way to check out Hitler s weird flak towers

512102,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, The lobby was extremely small and basic with worn cols tacky navy blue leather furniture Next The breakfast that was offered with the room was very mediocre and not congruent with the hotels 4 star rating Then the pillows weren t adequate too fluffy hurt my neck no other types alternatives were available offered Last the lobby elevator door was unsightly with many scratches could have used an much needed painting showing an overall lack of maintenance in one of the most asthetically important areas of the hotel , Room was decent however the European 4 star hotels seem to be a bit overrated and generally overall are equivalent to most 3 star hotels in the USA 
512103,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, view into backyard It is ok if you need your room just to sleep and keep the curtain closed, central location clean and modern very reasonable price

512127,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, Wifi wasnt working well in the room had to go down to the breakfast room Overall certainly didnt feel any 4 stars atmosphere the price of 45 for 2p is adequate to pay more than that would be a complete nonsense, Clean well heated rooms soft bed good breakfast

512136,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, The staff were mainly competent and responsive Yet there was a sense of reserve by the morning staff that came off with a formality as if my questions were a bother This was subtle and may be due to cultural differences also the batteries on the remotes for the televisions were dead and there wasn t a remote to control the air conditioner, Lovely room Really charming with a great view of the boulevard below The food for breakfast in the restaurant was diverse and delicious

512140,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, The street in front was very noisy and the noise got fully into the room The facilities were outdated for a 4 stars hotel The mattresses were quite thin and the double bed were two mattresses together would be easy to add a layer on top to improve comfort and avoid the gap between them , it was close enough to the center and close the market and some good restaurants Very handy for conferences and activities in the university
512141,Suite Hotel 900 m zur Oper, The wifi in the room is poor We used a family room where we got one regular queen bed and another one was pullout sofa that is actually not suitable for overnight sleeping Beside that the hotel should be renovated since everything is looks pretty used , The location of the hotel is convinient
