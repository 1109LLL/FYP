486436,Colombia, There is no tea coffe machine in room Receptionists are a little rude They are not that much welcoming with smile I had to check out early in morninig to reach my train but could not getca packed brealfadt although it was inckuded in mu booking, Proximity of railway station
486437,Colombia, Air conditioning and wi fi were not functioning in my room with staff unwilling to do anything about it, Rooms are modern and clean gym is okay breakfast hall has an exit to the garden Great value for money 
486438,Colombia, Air conditioning and wi fi were not functioning properly in my room , Clean and modern rooms Gym with basic equipment and breakfast in the garden Great value for the money in the central station district 
486439,Colombia, My bedside lamp didn t work but I forget to tell them to get it fixed , The breakfast was great with many choices Location is close to train station but on a quiet street Very cute place and I would stay there again 
486440,Colombia, Nothing , Minutes walk from Central Station but in a very quiet street with hardly any traffic Great buffet breakfast at very reasonable rate Great caf restaurant near by 
486441,Colombia, The reception staff were not polite and welcoming I had a feeling I was there for them and not vice versa No smile on their faces not accommodating requests I did not feel welcomed , 5 mins to Central Station hotel located in a quiet street 30 mins walking to Duomo and other attractions Clean room and bathroom cleaned every day and towels changed Breakfast ok nice selection of food although a bit limited However you are offered a real Italian esspresso or capuchino included in the breakfast no extra charge Nice ladies working in the breakfast area 
486442,Colombia, Nothing The room is not very spacious but enough for two people , Within 5 mins walk to the central station so it s convenient to wherever you want to go metro to Milan Cathedral shuttle bus to airport and outlet etc The breakfast is GREAT The facilities are quiet nice too There is even a small garden on the back 
486443,Colombia, I found that there was almost no cold water pressure in both the basin and shower after flushing the toilet which took an inordinately long time to refill the cistern This caught me unawares the first morning when I had virtually only full hot water in the shower The second morning I waited until the toilet had refilled and all was okay , The staff were variable at checkin the desk manager could see I was struggling to get my suitcases up the front steps only about four from memory but it included holding a door open but he chose to ignore it When I finally made the desk I remarked that it was difficult but he also chose to ignore that remark Conversely another manager couldn t have been more helpful and was very pleasant Breakfast was good and there is a pleasant outside area where one can sit for breakfast or at other times There was easy access to the train station about 10 minutes walk 
486444,Colombia,No Negative, The location very close to the railway station and good to go walking to many of the main sites of the city and the ratio cost quality very convenient
486445,Colombia, Good location but over rated by booking com guests We had higher expectations on this hotel It felt like it had high standards in the 60 s Anyhow in the end we we re satisfied with our stay , Close to the central station where you find all the metro lines Close to the tram 1 and 33 that goes to Navigli and to the Duomo Nice gay bars in walking distance The garden was well needed because the AC in the room was not functioning very well we didn t tell the reception 
486446,Colombia, Can hear well what the neighbors are doing at any time of day n night All the noises do not help to sleep after the long work day It was very cold at night n in the morning to sleep no heating at all Stayed in May Asked fir additional blanket but it never appeared in my room would be nice to have a pot to be able to make a cup of tea for such cold nights in the room , Stayed for the second time due to the excellent location has got several spots for the meeting with the partners in the lobby 
486447,Colombia, I arrived at 10pm and asked for a toasted sandwich at 10 20 pm only to be told the chef had closed the kitchen I was given the option to go a bar around the corner That was a bad start went to bed hungry I dislike those hairdryers that one has to continue to press a button for it to work so uncomfortable Often Hotels forget that women with long hair require an additional smaller towel to dry our hair This once agin reinforces my belief that men are the decision makers I opted not to pay Euros 15 for breakfast there were ample coffee bars in the neighbourhood and MacDonalds had an offer of Cappuccino Croissant for Euros 1 90, the close proximity to the Central Strain Bus station the bed was comfortable but I must say that when I booked as a single traveller I did not expect a single bed it was not even a 3 4 bed nonetheless it was comfortable with a relaxing pillow The towels were really great in particular the large shower towel Super quality The toiletries etc were fantastic Kudos to the cleaning staff as the room was clean and the bathroom likewise The hotel had an elevator which is always a bonus The room had a TV yet it was strictly Italian channels It also had a fridge with reasonable priced beverages i e a bottle of water was Euros 2 it costs 50c in a supermarket but touristy areas can charge as much as Euros 2 I could not hear any street noise It took me a good 30minutes walking to reach the Duomo and the historic part of town I could have opted to use the metro but I chose to walk The Reception are has a PC and Printer which are available to customers 
486448,Colombia, The TV program should be rechecked or reprogrammed we followed the instructions numbers but couldn t find the international programs we would like to watch The wall is a bit thin we could hear sometimes other guests But late night after all people went sleep it s ok , The location is very good close to the central railway station can reach everywhere easily Very comfortable beds and clean room The friendly staffs 
486449,Colombia, They charged me 7 EUR for a 250 ml plastic bottle of water which you can buy for 30 cent from store Small dark boring room with mosquitoes uncomfortable bed and pillow and very small bathroom Worn dirty carpet and small lift Definitely not worth for money spent , Good breakfast
486450,Colombia, Toilet has only one Bowl There were too many mosquito in the room first day Second day only one , Location is good Staff is Good and responsive WiFi works well 
486451,Colombia, This time WI Fi connection was not good in the room There are a few 3 4 steps to reach the reception the lift is a bit small , Very close to the Central Station very kind staff and a comfortable bed Amenities in the bathroom are also a nice detail 
486452,Colombia, The lift didn t t work 3 days The old women at the breakfast was always angry never smile and yells often the room is very small with a high noise I will never recommend it to anyone Hotel mikalengelo is better , Ernesto the best
486453,Colombia, For my requirements it was all ok nothing to complain about , Effective hotel for my requirements an overnight stay while senior interrail travelling Very close to Milano Centrale only a few minutes away by foot Facilities were ok and WiFi network worked ok Left too early to have any opinions about quality of breakfast 
486454,Colombia, Poor sound insulation between rooms but not a big deal if you are not suffer from insomnia , Near the Central Railway station but in a quiet place 25 minutes walk from Duomo Excellent value for money proposal Excellent staff Clean room 
486455,Colombia, breakfast service could have been better , great location close to the railway staition and to the underground comfortable bed spacious bathroom 
486456,Colombia, nothing, the friendliness of the staff and the location was fantastic the night porter really helped to find the location in needed to go to I loved the Italianness of Milan as it is located in the north of Italy

486460,Colombia, There was nothing to complain about , The staff were very welcoming and helpful Rooms were clean and comfortable Breakfast was excellent Close to railway station and selection of caf restaurants near by 
486461,Colombia, Requested to change room due to AC was not cold and it took 1 to 2 hours to convinced the staff and finally got the room changes but the AC was still very bad as it was not cool enough this need to be improve , Staff was friendly
486462,Colombia, Pillows were flat and heavy not a cushion for your head A C set at 10C but marginally cooled room , Staff very friendly courteous and attentive Breakfasts very good with a nice variety Room size and amenities was perfect for my needs Great location if using trains good restaurants near by 
486463,Colombia, air condition is a joke cooling and de humidizing itself maybe but definitely not the room and seems very unhealthy would have check it for legionella pneumophila if I had the chance the breakfast is classic italian 3 hotel breakfast 90 made of sweet pastry I am ok with that because I know how italian hotels are but it might be annoying for first timers and those who are used to classical salty breakfast up to 60th channel it was all italian channels on TV literally not exaggerating gave up after that , was a 2 5 day refreshment weekend to get away from work stress keep it in mind haven t stayed long well central location you can t deny that but to be honest everywhere is central if you have a metro nearby the staff was ok didn t need to have much interaction also didn t have time to check gym but it was open till 23 00 which seems to be a positive thing even though I dont know who would go gym in a tourism city after walking 15 km day wi fi functioned without a problem
486464,Colombia, Had a room to the street unfortunalty some construction work in the morning But that was just temporary, Nice clean room friendly stuff Very central just a block from central train station 
486465,Colombia, Nothing, Most friendly staff I have ever dealt with very helpful and accommodating The rooms were a generous size and the facilities were great maybe the bed was a little hard or we are soft Very handy to Milano Centrale and the surrounding area

486467,Colombia, 1 Wifi connection was poor 2 The AC system was not good or was not working properly 3 The pillow was quite uncomfortable quite hard , 1 location is good close to CS 2 no disturbing noise from outside in my room

486469,Colombia, No Kettle in room to make tea or coffee Wifi not great everywhere in the hotel No acces other than stairs for heavy luggage , Close proximity to the staton good retaurants nearby Friendly and hellpful staff 
486470,Colombia, Pillows are horribly flat My jaw was hurting next morning Non social interaction friendly Does not have a restaurant inside of the hotel, Staff was super friendly Good location right next to the train station Close to shopping area Very clean Breakfast was very nice eggs bacon cheese selection fruits and pastry 
486471,Colombia, A bit pricey for such a small room but it is the location which is convinient for travellers Thin walls most probably in the bathroom I could hear the lady in the next room who was talking on the phone But during the night was quiet So no big problem , The single room was small but nice The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was equipped with nice toiletries Breakfast buffet was big with a variety of food and everything tasted good The hotel is very close to the train station

486473,Colombia,No Negative, Close to Milan Centrale helpful and friendly staff I booked late but asked for a quiet room and they allocated me a double at the back of the building which was perfect and extremely comfortable The bed was so heavenly I didn t want to leave it the next morning Very good breakfast served in an attractive dining area with an outside garden terrace It s not cheap but you get what you pay for 
486474,Colombia, The only thing I can think of is that the lift is a little bit small and the access to the hotel is through a few stairs, Really nice staff at reception and breakfast lounge The amenities in the bathroom are a good detail also 
486475,Colombia, The staff was not helpful The price of 1 night didnt include breakfast and it was very expensive The room didnt have a ref and there was no complimentary water Will no longer go back and will notrecommend this hotel , The location is excellent 
486476,Colombia, the room is so small i think this is not 19m2 bathroom is very old if you stay 1 2 days it is ok otherwise you can find more good hotels with this price, the location is so good it is close to centeral station Staff is nice and helpful breakfast is very rich and nice
486477,Colombia, The neighbourhood is good for the Station but otherwise a bit grim , Very conveniently located close to Milan central station Bed was comfortable and staff were helpful Good value for money Generous check out time of midday unlike some hotels that require you to leave by 11am

486485,Colombia, Bed comfort was okay but didn t mind much as I stayed for one night only , Great location close to Milano Centrale Great power shower and toiletries Loved the slippers 
486486,Colombia, The rooms were really small and the aircondition was non functioning WIth the hot Milano summer it was absolutely unbearable to stay in the rooms and I had to lie with wetted towels to even have a couple of minutes of sleep We complained to the staff but they only said that it was to hot for any aircon s to work This is just not true since we had warmer nights and perfect aircon in other cities , Close proximity to the railwaystation The interior was up to date 
486487,Colombia, A little bit far from the city centre but compensated by the 5 minute walk to the central station , Staff were friendly and helpful Wifi connection was excellent Both the room and toilet were clean and comfortable 
486488,Colombia, On check in i found the gentleman at reception quite rude and unfriendly maybe it was the heat , very convenient for Milano Centrale Station the Air con was good and very much appreciated in the August heatwave 
486489,Colombia, The location near the train station is also a disadvantage as there is little to see and do in the neighbourhood There are also a number of people sleeping on the streets though not on the street of the hotel and the walk there from the station seems quite safe even at night , Good location an easy walk from Milan s main train station I asked for a quiet room and I was given one on the internal courtyard
