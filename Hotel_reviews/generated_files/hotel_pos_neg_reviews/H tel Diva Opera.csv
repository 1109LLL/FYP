34078,H tel Diva Opera, Internet connection was terrible and barely worked Considering this is a hotel and people who travel need access to decent internet you would assume they would have something better in place , Location was perfect within walking distance to everything you need 
34079,H tel Diva Opera, Would have been better if the breakfast had been included in the price We had a look on our first morning to see if we wanted to buy it before we went elsewhere however we decided against it as the croissants etc hadn t been covered up and there were flies everywhere which put us off buying it Admittedly it was very hot that day however covering food up for me is basic food hygiene , The room was fabulous with a great view and the staff were super friendly and helpful 
34080,H tel Diva Opera, I spend a night without AC which is in the agreement but the staff at checkout had no concern how we managed without AC Very dusty room , Very good location 1 staff who was in the night shift was friendly and very helpful
34081,H tel Diva Opera, This was a 4 star hotel but I was disappointed The hotel room was dirty Bathroom caulking had mold curtains were stained bed cover was stained carpet had stains ceiling had some water damage or other issue room chair was dirty The tub was also very tall 24 inches and was difficult for my wife to exit Lastly the maid service never seemed to get it right all the time and was always forgetting something One day it was the soap next day it was the coffee next day it was not cleaning the cups , The hotel staff was friendly and helpful Larger room was also nice The room had air conditioning which was a real treat during the 90F days in Paris 
34082,H tel Diva Opera, Internet speed is horrible too pricey for the quality Bathroom is not clean shower curtain is dirty and showering fills all the bathroom with water breakfast is extremely poor, Location is magnificent easy to access quiet area very dark room so very nice to sleep
34083,H tel Diva Opera, Rooms were a little small and there is no room service , Very comfortable rooms with superb air con Loved the decor especially the spiral staircase with striped wall paper Staff were really approachable and fun 
34084,H tel Diva Opera, The room was on the ground floor and we were woken up every day at 6 45am when they started to get ready for breakfast Being on the ground floor we were also woken up by the bin men We asked to be moved but the hotel was fully booked There was no complimentary coffee available in reception There was no fridge in the room and we wouldn t have the blinds open with being on the ground floor so the room was very dark , The beds were large the bathroom was spacious and the air con worked very well 
34085,H tel Diva Opera, Scanty breakfast To NOT get flaky croissants and fresh coffee in Paris is a huge let down The size of the rooms is shockingly small so always best to pay a little extra and get the balcony room especially if you re a smoker , Walking distance to Metro 24 hour reception is always useful Hotel staff helpful about guiding you around the area A laundrette down the road is very handy The small but well stocked corner store operated by your friendly Moroccan family is open 24 7 
34086,H tel Diva Opera, It would have been nice to have had a bit more variety on the bar snack menu or room service or a mini bar scenario As it was u were not allowed to take food or drink from out side to ur room but there wasn t anything to purchase from the hotel either so unless u ate drunk externally you were very limited to what was on offer in the bar area downstairs after 10am when breakfast finished There were a few drinks on offer only , Staff were very friendly bedroom was nicely laid out bathroom was a good size 
34087,H tel Diva Opera, Truly nothing we didn t like sorry , The location is great right nextdoor to les grands boulevard and all of the paris sights to be seen We particularly liked the friendliness of the staff who had particular intentions for us travelling with a baby They do everything to make you feel comfortable and welcome Congratulations to everyone The room was perfect and we even had a balcony with a view on Montmartre We recommend this hotel without any reserve and we will definetly come back 
34088,H tel Diva Opera,No Negative, Really nice place to stay Staff were friendly and the room was always spotless after every cleaning We were even given the balcony room for no extra charge It was lovely 
34089,H tel Diva Opera,No Negative, The bed was very comfy the hotel was pretty basic nice room but no tv in the downstairs area Staff pretty helpful don t think we would go back to this hotel
34090,H tel Diva Opera, Plug sockets for USB ports in this era of hi tech equipment , Air conditioning was brilliant when it was 33degrees outside lovely hotel and excellent value for money considering the location Would definitely stay here again
34091,H tel Diva Opera, No parking in the area we didn t have a car but even the cab couldn t find a place to stop Otherwise really good , Very kind hosts We stayed for five nights at the hotel a couple a friend Room was spacious and the friend had his little semi room so it felt quite private as well Very clean and good shower 
34092,H tel Diva Opera, There was three of us family room but only supplied items shower gel etc for only two people Had to request items by calling them and then had to go to receiption to pick them up , The shower was a nice size some of the receiption staff were friendly gave us a map of Paris and great directions to places and to the nearest metro 
34093,H tel Diva Opera, It s not a secret that Paris service standards can leave foreigners cold and the reception I had at this hotel was a perfectly brutal example example Night desk man was rude at entry extremely perturbed to have been bothered to step away from his internet to answer the door Chastised me for trying the back door first Terrible check in obnoxious cold condescending and then when I asked him to please cool it he wasted no time launching into the insults condescension and defending his actions as legitimate as if his paying customers cared Le coup de grace you foreigners think your money buys you everything well actually sir this foreigner s money will simply buy me reservations every few weeks at the polite hotels in Paris where they appreciate the customers and don t put them down Hotel Diva indeed ,No Positive
34094,H tel Diva Opera, Too noisy around until mid night bed too soft space too small and no refrigerator in room no balcony no so worth for the price, Good location near to metro station super market friendly and very helpful staff
34095,H tel Diva Opera, The room bed is too soft feel uncomfortable The height of the bathtub is not enough water flow out easily , The property was conveniently located nearby metro The services were so good 
34096,H tel Diva Opera,No Negative, The location the staff the rooms welcoming very professional yet very friendly we spoke with few others guests that had stayed there before and everyone had the same opinion and one oerticular guest she said she is regular at the hotel my sister and I were very satisfied with everything we decided we will return and stay at hotel diva again and we will recommend it to all our family and friends 
34097,H tel Diva Opera, Rooms were very very small Air didn t work the entire time even after asking staff to turn it on we slept with the balcony doors open , Hotel location was good Walking distance to many restaurants 
34098,H tel Diva Opera, Very tight corridors tiny elevator and not an attentive staff cleaned room when I asked them not to and didn t clean when I did ask for them to, Atmospheric experience comfortable beds
34099,H tel Diva Opera, The TV was not working It was turning on and shutting down randomly making a lot of noise The room was tiny and the bed not comfortable at all The hotel was clearly not a 4 stars but more a 2 stars The location was not bad It s really not worth its price, The sound insulation of the room was perfect It was very quiet
34100,H tel Diva Opera, Nothing that I can think of, Fabulous hotel close to everything very clean comfortable beds very nice bathroom with a great shower tea and coffee making facilities and nice opening window
34101,H tel Diva Opera, Firstly it was very warm 21 degrees on 30 March and the airco was still on wintertime Apparently the airco is centralized and can t be managed per room So it was very hot in the room but the manager Guillaume meant well and organised a fan in our room which gave some relieve Secondly we went out one day by 1 PM so the room still needed to be cleaned When we came back at night the room was not cleaned at all When we complained and the receptionist came up to our room he was very unprofessional Looking annoyed gazing at us as we have never travelled before Not knowing what to say and to do no apology and not service minded at all He could only get us clean towers and even wanted me to go down to get them When I checked out the next morning the receptionist was aware of the complaint tried to help explaining that after 1 PM there is no one for housecleaning anymore but could not do anything The manager Guillaume was called but he could not offer us anything in return Considering this is a 4 star hotel which you pay the service for I expect the room to be cleaned even after 1 PM If they do not offer this service it should be mentioned at the website and at the reception Furthermore the receptionist from the night shift should be proper trained to give proper service Also what is the point of having airco mentioned if this can t be organised per room If you would like to have guests return to your property you should be able to give a discount after this discomfort but even that could not be done So if you are looking at the rating for this hotel it is not up to the 4 star standards It is also noisy being next to the staircase and staying at the first floor The breakfast is poor boiling eggs not a success You better go across the street to the patisserie cheaper and more tasteful Also one morning the wifi did not function and since I am travelling for work this also did not help Not coming back to this hotel again it is overrated , Good location near metro station Grands Boulevards and Opera Good shower Good firm pillows on a firm bed 
34102,H tel Diva Opera, The noise isolation between rooms could be and should be better , The staff is very polite and forthcoming The hotel is clean and the rooms are most comfortable Our stay was enjoyable 
34103,H tel Diva Opera, Said it about the narrow walkways TV service mostly local No CNN Comedy Central etc Music service seems lacking There should always need music service especially classical, The rooms are wide and comfortable The walk ways are two narrow Very difficult with bags a little big than the normal15 kid size 
34104,H tel Diva Opera, As a 4stars hotel facilities is not complete such as slipper in the room and refrigerator and hairdryer is slow and weak somehow it will stop in the middle of drying hair because of the over heat inconvenient for long hair Wifi is slow and weak in the 6th floor sometimes will disconnect with the wifi breakfast is expensive and normal a very typical condinental breakfast , The staff is really friendly
34105,H tel Diva Opera, Slightly overpriced like most accomodations in Paris Rooms and public areas are just on the verge of needing a little fresh up , Very flexible management when I wanted to change my room which was all in all well equipped and functional Quiet location yet nice neighborhood with lots of shops bars and restaurants Top floor rooms with balcony provide for post card view Decent breakfast 
34106,H tel Diva Opera, There was nothing that I did not like, The room and bed were very comfortable quiet location but plenty of bars and restaurants in walking distance The staff were friendly and helpful
34107,H tel Diva Opera, The bed sheets were stained and not changed after the previous guests stayed We were very disappointed with this and were not offered a discount despite having to keep requesting new bed sheets and eventually having to move to a different room due to no improvement The staff at reception were very nice however , The staff were very helpful 
34108,H tel Diva Opera, Wifi connection was a bit slow in my room, Staff is really friendly The rooms are convenient clean and very spacious for Paris standards Location is perfect if you re coming to Paris for shopping 
34109,H tel Diva Opera, One evening at about 7 00pm and after a long day of walking we were laid on the bed reading there was a knock at the door and before I had chance to get to the door the manager was entering the room using his master key When I asked him what he wanted he replied just checking No further explanation was given I went down to complain later but he had left We checked out the day after so I didn t get a chance to challenge him , We had a top floor room with two small balconies Great views across the city 
34110,H tel Diva Opera, The rooms are really small We had a superior queen and it was too small for me and my partner We loved the hotel and location but literally had to let one person get ready before the other could as there wasn t enough room for us to both move around at once , The GM was really lovely and the hotel was clean and modern The location of the hotel is brilliant 
34111,H tel Diva Opera, Wifi was a little unreliable at times The heating wasn t working properly we never got the temperature we asked for always way less or too hot but it was ok overall , The bed was very comfy and there was enough space in the room considering this is Paris The location was great lots of good restaurants and close to various metro lines 
34112,H tel Diva Opera, Honesty there was nothing that I did dislike , It was an excellent facility the staff we re polite and friendly the food was delicious and the hotel room was comfortable clean and tidy It was as expected from the website and we definitely got our moneys worth I would gladly go back 
34113,H tel Diva Opera,No Negative, The hotel is close to city centre The staff was very hospitable to customers The room is big and tidy I am happy to accomodate in Hotel Diva Opera I could honestly advice the hotel to new travelers 
34114,H tel Diva Opera, The room was small with not much space around the bed Bathroom about 2 feet from the actual bed , The bed was excellent Staff very friendly and helpful Room very clean 
34115,H tel Diva Opera, We stayed too short , Guillerme the manager was absolutely excellent superb service They sorted all our issues quickly and effectively The room was great and the service brilliant 
34116,H tel Diva Opera, Rooms were comfortable however walls very thin and could hear someone s alarm each morning at 7 45 and went off for 10 mins as they did not stop Other than that great value for money, Very friendly staff good location and clean
34117,H tel Diva Opera, The staff doesn t speak English very well It was often very hard to understand them , The hotel has a very unique feeling with the turning stairs and small hall ways Staff is very helpful and friendly 
34118,H tel Diva Opera, 4 hotel Fake info on website 1 5L drinking water for room 5 Hotel provides 0 5L water bottle as welcome drink room size same as budget hotels ibis staff busy but not so helpful lift smallest i have ever seen tourist support they have no idea if u request room with balcony 15 additional cost This hotel could be regarded ad goood clean LOGDE rather than star hotel Not worth for even 1 , Clean rooms 
34119,H tel Diva Opera, Nothing, Everything was great The hotel is located in the area full of restaurants cafes and theaters however they are far enough in order to allow you to fully relax 
34120,H tel Diva Opera, Location is little bit far from metro especially if you bring big luggages , People always made a huge different in hotel industry and Diva opera have the best people to serve the guests 
34121,H tel Diva Opera, Room very small and needed a bit more cleaning texted tiles in bathroom were not clean whats the point of bedside table stool with a sloping top when the hotel says it has parking it means there is an underground car park 2 blocks away that will cost you 35 euros a day this is not close to Opera Metro 12 minute walk , it was quiet and near bars restaurants very good vegan restaurant right around the back
34122,H tel Diva Opera, The stylish bed side tables in the bedroom are a bit of a mystery A bottle of water slips off So does a mobile phone So what s the point of having it there Mere decoration I was alone in a double room That was great Room would be too small for two people , Had no bfast as it was an extra 12
34123,H tel Diva Opera, No soap by the faucet Breakfast was kind of light I thought real baguettes and cheese were common staple in Paris , Very clean and quiet rooms newly tastefully renovated and a wonderful bed 
34124,H tel Diva Opera, WLAN access in room was bad either we couldn t connect at all or the reception was very poor But there was a very nice lobby with a great WLAN connection available and a cup o coffee , Beautiful rooms outstanding service at the reception desk very very good location 
34125,H tel Diva Opera, Room was a bit tiny Bathtub design made a mess of water everywhere these European style tiny partial shower doors are kind of useless Thick carpet in the rooms personally grosses me out a bit when you think of what could be stuck in it , Great lively location and helpful staff relatively safe neighborhood Quiet enough for sleep Well connected by transit and the room had all we needed 
34126,H tel Diva Opera, A tiny room But its just a room going out and enjoy Paris , Very good location It is just a few min to metro station by walk There are a lot of market and breakfast dinner area Safety place 
34127,H tel Diva Opera, Nothing Excellent for a short stay and I a good position for where we wanted to go , The staff I have stayed in many hotels including other Best Western especially in France and this I have to rate as one of the best reception staffs I have encountered 
34128,H tel Diva Opera, The Internet access was essentially nonexistent We reported it on three separated occasions to the staff and the issue was not resolved In a city like Paris is is essential to stay at a hotel with reliable access and would choose to stay at another hotel in the future because of this issue ,No Positive
34129,H tel Diva Opera, Small bedroom can t expect different in Paris for this price 10 min away from subway, Very good comfortable bed interesting decor super nice staff that could speak all languages clean I would stay here again and recommend it
34130,H tel Diva Opera, I thought the price was a little too expensive for what you re getting But what upset me the most was that 149 was taken from my account as a deposit which is fine but when I checked out the full room charge for two nights was also charged Which I did not budget for this made my trip more expensive and getting to the airport difficult and unpleasant as there was no money left on my card I am still waiting for this deposit to be reimbursed , The room was very clean and the bed was very comfy The lady at the front desk was very helpful with directions and recommendations 
34131,H tel Diva Opera, We had a room in the upper level The room was annexed with another and the door wasn t really sound proof No closets , Lovely area friendly staff and charming room Quiet area at night 
34132,H tel Diva Opera, I did not like the balcony not a nice view and a shame you could not really go into it I could not see any clear access to any garden Space wise it could definetly have been bigger Not enough room outside of the bed , I liked the staff very friendly polite and helpful the room was nice with the hygiene details like the bags and the cleanliness of the bathroom The lighting and general layout was good It had a cosy feel but could have been bigger Kettle with complimentary tea was a nice touch 
34133,H tel Diva Opera, Breakfast only bread available was sliced or a few small rolls In the past at this hotel there was a choice of delicious fresh continental rolls and french bread The price has increased to EUR 12 90 There is a choice of breakfasts from the several cafes in the vicinity so not stuck with hotel breakfast , This hotel is in a fantastic location surrounded by restaurants of all types and ethnicities It is 10 mins walk from Opera and close to bus stops to just about anywhere inc Montmartre Concorde Eiffel Tower Notre Dame etc It is between Grands Boulevards and Cadet Metro Rooms are small usual in Paris but clean and comfortable Aircon is quiet and effective Typical continental breakfast which used to be better 
34134,H tel Diva Opera, Location could have been better but not too far from the metro I contacted the hotel prior to our arrival as I was trying to arrange a bottle of champagne to be delivered the morning of her 18 th birthday but they never even acknowledged the emails in the end I decided not to pursue as it was not worth the effort they knew it was her birthday as they wished her happy birthday on check in so had obv received emails with request just a little niggle that annoyed me It overall hotel fine, Hotel lovely staff lovely breakfast certainly not worth paying extra for but overall pretty good hotel for the money
34135,H tel Diva Opera, There was only French channels on TV and there was only an iPod dock for music no use with no iPod or iPhone, Modern interior clean and well equipped rooms Very helpful staff Nice personal touches on arrival 
34136,H tel Diva Opera,No Negative, Very friendly staff although a superior Queen room the size was quite small but maybe that is the norm for Paris However the bath was huge and the overhead shower was excellent 
34137,H tel Diva Opera, Wasn t tempted by eating here food wasn t anywhere near the quality of nearby restaurants and little difference in price The size of the bath was too small for someone who is 6ft1, The decor is wonderful you wouldn t think black walls would work but they just do Accented by touches of purple and some great art The room was comfortable and room facilities although basic were top notch The shower was slightly cramped but very powerful
34138,H tel Diva Opera, Entry hall decor, Lovely decor in bedrooms Comfortable clean rooms and good bathrooms Second visit and will keep coming back The staff is incredibly welcoming and helpful 
34139,H tel Diva Opera, Hotel breakfast was provided by the entrance to the hotel not very private breakfast was on the expensive side for what was available Information stated a city view we had a view of the backside of the hotel and fire escape , Bed was very comfortable and restaurants were very close We loved the atmosphere of the hotel And the location gave us an authentic Parisian experience Staff were very welcoming and helpful 
34140,H tel Diva Opera, There was no view Location was confusing but that could be the layout of Paris The hotel was a bit pricey for just two days They also charge for breakfast which for best western is usually free , Location was close enough to uber freely across town The rooms were very comfortable 
34141,H tel Diva Opera, I found a Galaxy SJ6 under the bed I charged it a bit and found out EAs last turned on in March Meant a cell phone was under the bed got at least 4 months How d you miss that , It was pleasant
34142,H tel Diva Opera, The only thing which really did not work out is the WiFi connection which is absolutely bad , The hotel is a typical Paris Hotel with everything you would need The rooms and bathrooms are not spacious but thats normal in Paris for that price Otherwise ok clean and easy located 
34143,H tel Diva Opera, Parking 10 min walk However discounted by the hotel , Lovely staff felt very welcome and looked after Clean and spacious room Would defiantly stay again Thank you 
34144,H tel Diva Opera, The room is bit small with minimal furniture , The hotel is very well located 5 mins walk to subways 10 mins walk to LaFayette and plenty of restaurants nearby The facility is well kept and the room is very cleaned 
34145,H tel Diva Opera, The room turned out to be tiny in the backyard with small window and no good light No possibilities to change was offered though requested Location is rather central though Grand Boulevard station was not very convenient to get to sightseeing places as compared with Le Peletier which is a bit far away , Clean
34146,H tel Diva Opera, Firstly I had a birthday which we wrote in private message while booking but the management didn t react Ok maybe they didn t see it But our executive room was just not value for money There was bad smell during all our stay even though i saw aroma candles which obviously didn t help there wasn t any slippers or bathrobe EXECUTIVE room in best western come on are u joking What happened with BW and the night staff wasn t friendly When I asked for extra blankets because it was too cold the guy gave me few with such face like I was asking him to steal them for me The bar was closed at night so we couldn t drink champagne to celebrate Definitely not Best Western quality I stayed with them in many cities worldwide and big dissapointment for my birtday night I wish I chose another hotel , I liked the location but there are many other hotels on this street and nearby The room is spacious for Paris modern but partly already shabbby 
34147,H tel Diva Opera, The room in the rdc had an awful humidity smell Once you passed around 10 inside you adapted yourself but by entering again the room the smell was there,No Positive
34148,H tel Diva Opera, Ignored during check in for a little too long dirty carpets kind of a dark cave like interior very small room with slanted ceiling expensive charged 12 euros for crappy continental breakfast cereal yogurt pastries instead of including it like all other hotels in Europe , The bed was very comfortable 
34149,H tel Diva Opera,No Negative, Location was excellent Grands Boulevards metro very close Plenty of cafes and restaurants close by Easy walk to the Louvre Staff very friendly and helpful

34157,H tel Diva Opera, They use memory foam mattresses and ours had collapsed a bit near the edge The breakfast is good but a little pricey at EURO 12 50 but there are many cafes nearby doing breakfast deals , The location is great just a few minutes walk to bus stops and Cadet or Grandes Boulevards Metro Opera is 10 mins walk Plenty of bars cafes and restaurants around The hotel is clean quiet and comfortable and the staff fantastic

34159,H tel Diva Opera, Drinking water is given only 1 bottle at check in counter No more given the other day , Clean and comfort surrounded by restaurants French Chinese Thai and many more 
34160,H tel Diva Opera, Very nice experience and I would definitely return but it would have been nice to have a mini bar in the room The room was a little small but not too bad by paris standards and the standard of the decor made up for this , The staff were very friendly and the hotel was very clean and fresh We had a kettle in our room which was nice Location was easy to get around as we spent a lot of time in the centre Would definitely return Also was nice and quiet 
34161,H tel Diva Opera,No Negative, Hotel was beautiful very modern and very clean The staff were very helpful and friendly Location was great with metro a few minutes walk from Hotel Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Paris 
34162,H tel Diva Opera, The bathroom was missing things such as conditioner and toothpaste most hotels now provide it Breakfast was pretty poor the bread wasn t great the choice limited You would expect more from any hotel in France , The bed was really comfortable and the bathroom really clean 
34163,H tel Diva Opera, It was al good, Friendly staff nice and central location lots of metro stations within easy comfortable walking distance Spoiled for choice with bars cafes and restaurants Even your muck Donald s and star bucks nearby It s small but very clean and friendly I only had breakfast the first day then went out and about for breakfast Similar prices but more original
34164,H tel Diva Opera,No Negative, Room is very clean and comfortable quiet too Will book this hotel again in the future Good location for walks to pera and louvre and close to gare du nord too 
34165,H tel Diva Opera, Being charged for water in the room after your complimentary one bottle The hotel is quite expensive although in a good area but free water is the least they can give Also the breakfast needs a lot of improvement Poor choice available , The location of the hotel was perfect for shopping a sight seeing The staff were all very friendly and helpful 
34166,H tel Diva Opera, We had no water on both mornings of our stay and there was a huge amount of rubbish piled outside The rooms were dark and smaller than shown in the photographs, Location and the hotel staff
34167,H tel Diva Opera, A bit dusty maybe a little more care for the cleaning , Location of the hotel is great very close to 3 different metro lines Grands Boulevards Just a few steps away from Folies Berg re The staff was very friendly and helpful The room was spacious enough for two people when comparing Paris hotels It was modernly decorated and also very quiet dark even we re on the first floor and street side Batrhroom was clean and modern The bed was super comfy 
34168,H tel Diva Opera, The room was a bit dusty could use a deeper cleaning , Great location within a neighbourhood full of nice restaurants and supermarkets and 20min walking distance from the Louvre and the Opera Comfortable room very nice bedding and a brand new bathroom 
34169,H tel Diva Opera, Wouldnt call this a bad experience just that the room was so small but spotless and state of the art decor it was fine for the 5 days we where there , The staff They where lovely and helpful 
34170,H tel Diva Opera, I booked a double room with a full size bed because my sister and I were traveling with a 3 year old Upon seeing my 3 year old niece I was told that I needed a triple room because my niece was going to break the bed My niece is a child Not a grown woman , I liked rooms They were very comfortable 
34171,H tel Diva Opera, We bought a bottle of wine from a store and when we asked the front desk for a corkscrew to open the bottle they said we would be charged 10 even though we would be drinking it in our own room So we didn t pay the 10 That policy was very stupid , The bed was very comfortable
34172,H tel Diva Opera,No Negative, The staff was friendly and had someone to hell and welcome guests 24 hours a day our group arrived from a delayed flight at 1am and were instantly let in The hotel s decor was very pleasing and made for a welcoming and enjoyable space to come back to each night 
34173,H tel Diva Opera,No Negative, The hotel is well located between 2 stations The beds are very comfortable and the air cons work well Our room had a good size bathroom although the room was not big There are coffee making facilities in the room There are numerous restaurants close by as well as chains such as Hard Rock Cafe McDonalds Chipotle and Pret A Manger There are also wonderful convenience stores around the hotel The staff was very friendly I also borrowed an iron from reception 
34174,H tel Diva Opera, The air cons is this hotel do not work We were first allocated a very small room with a broken air con When we complained we were moved to a nice big room with a broken air con We choose the bigger room and took the fan from the small room with us Some bedrooms have extremely small bathrooms The hairdryer did not heat up only one setting so it is nearly impossible to dry thick long hair with it , The hotel is very well located One street from the station Is just off the main street that runs from the station to the sea You can easily walk from the hotel to the promenade or catch the tram The staff was very helpful One staff member got us a good taxi rate as we had to leave for the airport before 6am There was also a very nice coffee machine in the room The beds are very comfortable 
34175,H tel Diva Opera, We expected more from the breakfast but maybe we were too early it seemed the food wasn t ready , The hotel is not far away from the metro station If you are leaving for the CDG airport you may go to Opera to take the airport shuttle bus The hotel staffs are very nice 
34176,H tel Diva Opera, Nothing really to fault apart from the wifi being slow but you shouldn t really need it while you re on holiday anyway , Very friendly staff great location as it was close to loads of shops and round the corner from Hard Rock Cafe and plenty of metro stations nearby which made travelling around much easier The bed was incredibly comfortable and showers are amazing I would highly recommend this hotel as it s got all the essentials and is incredibly clean and well maintained 
34177,H tel Diva Opera, No coffee in the morning as coffee machine did not work No other alternative offered Why is it that when your cleaners clean the toilets that they forget to clean the bowls of embedded stains Bleach it , Location great Rooms good Beds comfortable
