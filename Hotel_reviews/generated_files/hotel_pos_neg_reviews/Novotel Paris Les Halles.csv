249541,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Really disappointed with this hotel I booked a famiy room for my brother his wife and two young kids While booking I submitted a special request to see if they could check in slightly earlier I would have been happy to pay extra for this However they did not even bother responding When my brother and his family arrived on the day they also requested an early check in but were advised that the earliest they can check in was at 2 which was the standard time anyway They went out to kill time and came back just before 2 pm They were then told to wait 5 minutes as the room wasn t ready yet These 5 minutes became 15 30 and eventually 50 they didn t get their room till 2 50 pm Absolute disgrace By this point his young kids who were already exhausted coming via an early morning flight were completely shattered and every minute felt like an hour Very very disappointed especially because this was the first experience my brother and his family had in Europe and it was very unpleasant because of the customer service at this hotel , I don t have anything positive to stay because the commencement ruined the whole stay 
249542,Novotel Paris Les Halles,No Negative, Good location accessibility cleanliness and accomodation The hotel room is very comfortable The staff was helpful Will come back to stay in this hotel Highly recommended 
249543,Novotel Paris Les Halles, One small thing was the shower has only half wall and the rug was too small especially with water that leaked out from shower , Everything we were in a remodeled room and it was great strong shower lovely garden for eating outside superb breakfast 
249544,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Nothing not to like , Rooms were newly refurbished and spacey Great location next to sights and shopping Best breakfast buffet throughout all my stay in europe
249545,Novotel Paris Les Halles,No Negative, The staff were very helpful the booking staff went all out to give us a great room and welcome gifts with a commemorative certificate for our anniversary This hotel has given us great memories of Paris The breakfast is all you would expect from Accor need I say more The area has dozens of small restaurants a convenience store and more For extended travel and longer stays there is a laundromat just down the road surrounded by small restaurants to make the doing of this chore a very pleasurable outing 
249546,Novotel Paris Les Halles, We arrived late evening and finding the location was a pain due to outdated google map entry The Taxi driver had to take two different routes to drop us off Upon arrival there was no porter and a single lady on the reception and i had to carry all my luggage personally While i was provided with hot kettle in my room i noticed other rooms had nescafe dulce gusto machines Again no complimentary water Definitely not worth the money charged , Only person worth mentioning was Mr Benjamin who personally assisted me in guiding the uber driver to the nearest location and even helped me carry one of my bags to the car which was approx 100 meters from the hotel Supermarket is in the next building and the metro station is also very close 
249547,Novotel Paris Les Halles, We had booked the mulin rouge show with tbe reception and they failed to tell us that the men had to wear long trousers We arrived at the 11pm show dressed nicely but the men were in nice Bermuda 3 4s and long sleeve shirts but we were denied entry It was our last night and a very big pity since it was something we really wished to see Souviner shops next to the show sell long trousers but we did not see it being hygienic , The superior room was great and the bed was comfortable Staff were there to book you a taxi or dinner at any time of the day and super helpful especially with luggages and delivering shopping to our room
249548,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Maintenance My room has a flood in the bathroom due to drain issues They changed my room immediately to another worse than that one i have paid and i found bugs in the carpet I do not expect to stay there again, Location
249549,Novotel Paris Les Halles,No Negative, The hotel is perfectly situated in the center of Paris a walking distance from the Louvre the Notre Dame Centre Pompidou Hotel de Ville and literally above the Chatelet Metro RER central station where most of the lines cross The hotel is clean and organized and the staff was very helpful and polite with any request We were traveling with both of our kids ages 8 and 5 and stayed in the executive family room The room has a double bed a nd a couple of twin beds and was spacious enough for all 4 of us The room offers a buffet breakfast which we took only on our 1st day The cost was 24 euro per person and children don t pay the buffet is rich with a variety of foods to choose from fruit cheese sausages eggs cereals and so on Nevertheless on the next days we had breakfast at different bistros which are right at the doorstep of the hotel and cost roughly half the price In addition right across the street from the entrance there s a branch of the Boulangerie Parisienne where you can by fresh Croisants and sandwiches and take them for the road The area where the hotel is located Le Marais is one of the nicest and coolest areas in Paris full of restaurants bistros and shops in a pedestrian mall so it is really nice to walk around the streets in this area and enjoy the atmosphere Transportation wise this hotel has the perfect location with the Chatelet Metro RER station located at the hotels doorstep literally this is a very central station with almost all lines passing there Especially RER lines A B which are used for airport transportation and Disneyland Paris I would definitely go back to this hotel on my next trip 
249550,Novotel Paris Les Halles, A lot of construction works were going on in front of the hotel the only drawback Hopefully when we come back next time the construction works are finished , Direct train RER B from the airport to Les Halles Room is clean as usual 
249551,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Breakfast price was way over the top Lunch menu was also pricey but the caeser salad at 21 euros was delicious Drinks very expensive too but found prices generally in Paris have increased since our last visit , The location is perfect Many sights are in easy walking distance Food was excellent We stayed here many years ago and the recent refurbishment makes it feel in another class Lovely courtyard which was a haven from the heat Room was excellent with a huge shower with clear opaque option glass panel quite a novelty 
249552,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Overall whilst this hotel is excellent we were left disappointed by our room and the late check in by rude staff By way of explanation we were unable to check in to our room until 5 30pm despite arriving well after the check in time if 2 Staff offered no apology or explanation other than cleaning running behind On heading to our room a level 1 room we found a very tired unrenovated room not reflective at all of the photos on this website or those given to my brother also staying at the hotel on a substantially lower room rate too The room lacked basic features e g the air conditioning did not work effectively the bathroom door did not lock poor tea and coffee facilities In this regard the room didn t have sufficient tea coffee or milk 1 teabag is NOT sufficient and when we requested extra tea bags staff were dismissive and incredibly rude the first person asked gave us one extra teabag and then demanded a tip We ended up buying our own teabags and milk truly Novotel What was also disappointing was that when asked why our room was not the quality as given to my brother or per the website photos the desk staff said that all family rooms were of that standard Sorry Novotel don t treat me as stupid Why not an honest answer that level 1 was not renovated Your check in process and rude front desk team let down the rest of our experience , This hotel is an excellent location close to all Paris highlights and with easy access to rail and metro There is a fantastic mix of restaurants nearby and the hotel has an excellent breakfast buffet A few notes 1 There is currently construction outside the facility but this didn t impact our stay it just created confusion for some of our uber drivers re getting to the hotel 2 Rooms are small and don t have room for kids families to move around relax in This wasn t a problem for us as we spent our time outside enjoying Paris 
249553,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Rooms where tiny When we ordered room service we had to eat it on the floor not so good , Fantastic location close to metro walk and great places to eat highly recommend for anyone
249554,Novotel Paris Les Halles, The hotel is next forum les halles shopping centre and the streets are quite dirty around the hotel , The staff were friendly and helpful Breakfast was good and plenty of it Next to chatelet les halles train station which is handy for the airport train 35 mins to the airport Clean well equipped room Very comfortable bed Though I did book an executive room so cannot comment on the standard rooms 
249555,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Restaurant staff were un professional especially the waiter s manager who is called Fredric isn t professional at all also the restaurant staff were un friendly, Overall location is good Customer relation team is excellent
249556,Novotel Paris Les Halles, The rooms were surprisingly very basic and small Even the family rooms Difficult to reach near the hotel due to construction , The Location was good but because of massive construction work it was difficult to reach the hotel and taxi could not find a way to the hotel The front office Staff is friendly and its family friendly 
249557,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Bar staff a bit slow and limited drink menu available , Bed was very comfortable air conditioning worked well Location excellent walking distance to Notre Dame and the Louvre Staff helpful and responsive Breakfast excellent 
249558,Novotel Paris Les Halles, All was excellent There is some construction going on around the hotel so you have to take your luggage a bit if the way Not an issue unless you have mobility challenges , We didn t have breakfast at the hotel My grandson voted for a McDonald s breakfast eaten at the fountain instead Bonus we fed the pigeons
249559,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Access to the building due to construction that I was not aware of made the experience less than ideal I expect that typically the hotel has an ideal location on a pretty courtyard The construction will likely be done by September 2017 However this is clearly beyond the hotels control For those visiting the construction did not hinder the experience within the hotel itself There was not added noise from our room and overall the conditions were very conducive for sleeping with comfortable beds and a quiet setting , I liked the size of the room for European standards and the layout of the room was good with two twin beds and one queen The hotel staff was courteous and helpful I felt my bags were very safe while site seeing the first day before check in I did not try the restaurant There was a lot to eat and see within a short walking distance and getting around the city was very easy from this location 
249560,Novotel Paris Les Halles,No Negative, This is the second time we stayed at the Novotel during a quick trip to Paris It is very convenient to both airports There are many Paris highlights within an easy walk of the hotel Also good restaurants in the area The rooms are large modern and comfortable 
249561,Novotel Paris Les Halles, The construction was a total mess and there was no way to get to the hotel by taxi without a lot of confusion Once we found it they did call all taxis for us from then on They use a local taxi company and all the drivers were fabulous well dressed beautiful vehicles and knew how to find the hotel The restaurant was not great at night The waitresses did not speak English and were a little rude , This was a beautiful luxury hotel an oasis of comfort The location is excellent BUT the whole square outside was torn up and all streets were blocked to vehicles so it was confusing for taxi drivers coming and going It is comparable to a Hilton The room was fabulous modern clean and comfortable The staff at the reception and concierge were fantastic friendly and beyond helpful The breakfast was incredible fresh fruit all kinds of breads hot food and beverages etc 
249562,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Nothing that I dint like, Excellent location V close to major must visit places like Louvre Notre Dame Orsya museum Middle of a major arcade with eat out joints and a big shopping arcade V well connected through metro and buses V friendly staff V well capacitized room Outstanding experience Highly recommended
249563,Novotel Paris Les Halles,No Negative, The hotel was in a very good location the staff were polite and helpful especially Djamel and Hugo who helped us all a lot The room was clean and spacious and breakfast was alright though having a little variety would have made it even better All in all we had a great time and I would highly recommend this hotel to all my friends coming to Paris 
249564,Novotel Paris Les Halles, The price of stay is a little high but not so big problem , The location is so good because near the station and you can go some sightseeing places on foot And also it seems that here is safer than other places in Paris 
249565,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Limited room service menu Room service staff declined to provide an order for toasted bread toast saying that it was not on the room service menu Limited and poor choice of veggie meals in restaurant bar snacks and room service menu , Good room design and comfortable beds Location was great with excellent connectivity for travel within Paris and outside as well 
249566,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Very old and unrefurbished rooms Old furniture Cigarette burns into the carpet Mold in bathroom Tainted sink and bathtub A pregnant urine smell into the toilet the toilet is separate from the bathroom Way to expensive for the real value We paid 560 Euro for 2 nights I might say that the room was the equivalent of a 2 star hotel There are heavy constructions around the hotel unanounced by the hotel on its site or on Booking com The taxi left us 300 meters away from the hotel because it was impossible to stop in the front entrance , Close to Les Hales Metro and only 2 minutes to Rue de Rivoli 
249567,Novotel Paris Les Halles, There was drilling happening at the Metro station nearby which continued to after 11 00pm The staff didn t know what it was at first but did find out offered to move us but you could still hear the noise from the other room The drilling eventually stopped Our room was in the first floor you could regularly hear the trains underground arriving leaving the station ,No Positive
249568,Novotel Paris Les Halles, It was noisy during the night Sadly the location was not good at this time I am sure this will improve when the work outside is complete this all made access difficult and it was an address that seemed hidden, Comfortable beds
249569,Novotel Paris Les Halles,No Negative, Location is very convenient to both Paris airports because the hotel is next to the entrance to the RER B line It is a short walk to Centre Pompidou Louvre and other Paris highlights in the area There are many cafes restaurants and shops around the hotel Our room faced the inner courtyard so it was very quiet 
249570,Novotel Paris Les Halles, We booked a room for 2 adults 1 child and I thought it had a bathroom with a bath However there was only a shower There was a separate toilet though which was quite a nice feature when there are three people using the bathroom, Amazing breakfast such a huge choice They had little cuddly toys that they gave out at reception on check in to the children Also as long as you get the right exit from the Les Halles shopping centre the hotel is right in front of you There is a new Metro entrance being built right outside the hotel and there are about 3 really French restaurants and a bar just outside the hotel As well as a grocers shop for bottled water etc
249571,Novotel Paris Les Halles, The square in front of the hotel is undergoing construction think it is scheduled to be completed Spring 2018 Consequently it was a bit confusing to navigate But I would definitely stay there again Combination of superb location between the Marais and Louvre wonderfully designed brand new room and helpful staff We didn t get to dine there so many wonderful options in the neighborhood , Incredible location next to Les Halles good value nicely designed good sized room Knowledgable and helpful staff 
249572,Novotel Paris Les Halles, There is currently some street construction on the main entrance side of the hotel which made it a bit difficult for the taxis or uber drivers to leave you right in front of the main hotel entrance I am sure once completed it will be fine , The room was newly renovated and very clean Lobby and common areas nicely decorated and the staff very friendly and helpful I would definitely book again at this location on any future travels back to Paris 
249573,Novotel Paris Les Halles,No Negative, Hotel is within walking distance of Louvre Museum restaurants stores and public transportation It s a well maintained business like hotel not much character but equipped with modern conveniences Air conditioning worked well and room temperature was comfortable 
249574,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Reception staff not friendly nor helpful as we were casually dressed asian staff were not as friendly to us front under construction have to drag luggage to taxi as taxi cannot drop in front of hotel no help was rendered There was a blackout in our room they checked and say it was my phone charger however the same charger work fine in other hotels we booked No apology nor service recovery was rendered , Room decor modern toilet is nice wifi speed is good location near good restaurants and forum halles and metro 
249575,Novotel Paris Les Halles,No Negative, Excellent room on 2nd floor Really comfortable bed So many restaurants to choose from nearby Very close to metro Walking distance of so many attractions Breakfast choices were excellent 
249576,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Varnish and a bit pricey , Very good location near the Forum mall with the Metro station there Great facilities but the room smelled a little of varnish But they accommodated my request for a transfer but the new room still smelled slightly of varnish 
249577,Novotel Paris Les Halles, nothing Room wasnt ready at 2pm but left luggage , location is excellent Staff are excellent friendly and efficient Room was quiet over courtyard looking out to a fantastic wall mural of Paris over the rooftops 
249578,Novotel Paris Les Halles, There was a construction in front of the hotel Not their fault though, Excellent location and very friendly staff The toilet in the lobby also looked really classy gives you that old Paris vibe 
249579,Novotel Paris Les Halles, mainly speaking there is nothing to complain but there are some constructions outside hotel so the way to hotel is limited and cars are difficult to arrive , Great location easy to go all the places restaurants and stores around friendly and warmly services especially thanks staffs to lend baby stroller to me 
249580,Novotel Paris Les Halles, You had to ask for soap toilet paper and tea to be restocked every day instead of doing it automatically , The room was a good size for an extended stay
249581,Novotel Paris Les Halles, The staff weren t very friendly , Clean and fresh room with super comfortable beds Have coffee tea facilities in the room Breakfast buffet looked scrumptious but slightly expensive for 24 Great bar
249582,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Coffee maker in the room was broken turned in front desk and during three day stay did not get a replacement , Good location tasty breakfast and clean room 
249583,Novotel Paris Les Halles, The central location meant that it was extremely noisy after midnight From our room we could hear drunk people shouting and singing in the streets and we were kept awake between 1 2am , The public transport links are excellent although we were able to walk easily to most tourist attractions We loved the breakfast brioche buns and Madeline cakes The receptionist gave the kids a Novotel soft toy on arrival which was a nice touch 
249584,Novotel Paris Les Halles, The rooms are undergoing renovations and they need it They aren t bad just a little old but very clean Repairs were started in the morning but no drilling etc until at least 9 a m which is very reasonable Just request an already renovated room once the repairs are completed this hotel will be awesome , The staff at the desk the busboys and the concierge were fabulous I switched rooms twice because 1 was not ready and the other room setup was not as comfortable as the other one and they were fabulous about it Excellent food in the restaurant and great breakfast selection Tea and coffee and room fridge was a real plus We arrived early and they went out of their way to accommodate us The young guys were so sweet and respectful and helpful The location is great we walked to the louvre Notre Dame and the river Seine Huge shopping area and restaurants around the corner of the hotel The price is great for all this I would definitely stay here again 
249585,Novotel Paris Les Halles, We were in the room that had not been updated yet Bathroom shower was leaking Lots of noise in the am due to construction upstairs , Close proximity for tourist sites Close to Metro Had a wheelchair we actually used for the duration of the trip which was very convenient Taxi stand very close by 
249586,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Not the fault of the hotel but there is big construction project going on right outside of the hotel We were there during a holiday weekend so it wasn t very loud but I imagine that during a regular work week there woukd be much more noise Also due to the construction there are a few little streets blocked off so you have to make small detours If carrying lots of luggage or small children be aware , Great location Very close to metro station and lots of resturants just steps away Clean comfortable rooms and friendly helpful staff We enjoyed our stay 
249587,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Construction is still going on so depending upon where your room is it can be very loud and intruding I booked this hotel in order to have reliable speedy wifi and a quiet accommodation in order to handle a few conference calls via Skype while in Paris so the construction noise was a bit frustrating When I let the staff know my concerns they offered a conference room in the business center and assured me the noise would stop after 5 pm My calls were on NY time so this worked out perfectly and all was fine , Large hotel nice rooms with all accommodations you may need Fast wifi ability to pay a small fee for an even faster speed and ability to have wired connections concerning any important matters you might have 
249588,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Unfortunately the construction works in progress right in front of the Hotel starts at 07 30am and the noise is loud For me and my family wasn t a problem because we are early risers These works affected the entrance to the area and a few taxis had trouble to get us there I know this is a very personal thing but I didn t like the mattresses too soft it killed my back TV with lots of channels but unfortunately not one for kids also poor choice for non French speaking unless you love the news The attitude of the breakfast personal namely the manager and the entrance attendant even though I understand the stress of the situation I all ways expect extreme politeness and sympathy a smile goes a long way We asked for a map to someone that was standing in front of the reception when everyone behind it was busy and he reply he was a bellboy and it wasn t his function to give up maps just like this , We stayed for 3 nights 2 adults and 2 children under 10 years old Overall it was a good stay Superb location to visit the all of Paris for it has a Metro station right at the door of the Hotel at Des Halles 1 arrondissement check Forum Des Halles Also the area around the Hotel is very nice with lots of restaurants and commerce really safe to walk around at any time The Hotel is at a walking distance of Center George Pompidou the Notre Dame and the Louvre Comfortable Hotel with a room spacious enough LCD Philips Ambilight with lots of channels Expresso machine in the room Robes and slippers nice bath amenities Good breakfast It as a beautiful outdoor restaurant drinks tapas area and a nice inside lounge piano bar there is also a small comfortable room with TV and games for children really nice The personal was overall nice and helpful Locked luggage storage room with free numbered tickets Very nice modern Hotel 
249589,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Parking it is virtually impossible to find and once found public parking in Les Halles rather expensive Access from parking to hotel is absolutely unacceptable through a shopping mall or walking through streets for 5 7min Therefore please use other means of transport to get to the hotel Construction going on in front of the hotel metro stop and starting at 7 45 in the morning If you want a quiet room make sure to ask for one on the other side of the hotel , The hotel is located in a very vibrant area with good and easy access to some of the major landmarks like Louvre 10min walk Notre Dame 7min walk and with a vast selection of cafes and restaurants nearby Facilities inside the hotel are more than passable with the hotel staff showing great care for our comfort Special thanks go to barman Franck who was close and attentive to our requests Breakfast was very good with a good offer for two days It could get boring if you are staying longer thought The room was clean and with good TV and WIFI offer 
249590,Novotel Paris Les Halles, My only complaint is that I found the bed a bit hard , I found the staff quite helpful with our requests and questions Th re was tons of room in our suite for 4 of us The hotel was central to everything and found navigating the city easy from there Many restaurants to chose from nearby At the moment there is construction in the area but wasn t an issue for us 
249591,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Double charge and check of credit card and this results a block on more amount on credit card You should charge the full amount as agreed at the first night and NOT make trials if credit card is working through blocking amount and release immediately cause release will appear only after 2 weeks which is very very bad , Location
249592,Novotel Paris Les Halles, We had a view of the Eiffel tower but the Dirty Windows spoilt the view set up of furniture and bathroom not practical My husband kept snubbing toe on desk The toilet was seperate and was extremely tight and we are not big people We had a Jr suite and didn t know the soft drinks were free until the end The decor was ok but the finishes weren t good ,No Positive
249593,Novotel Paris Les Halles, There is no parking Unless you arrive by public transportation or with little to no luggage I do not recommend this property There is an agreement with a third party parking 3 4 blocks away which solves the problem for the car but carrying luggage on the streets in this particular neighborhood is not a pleasant experience Management should make this very clear when advertising this hotel at least to give people a choice It was very frustrating to find it out only when we arrived There was intense noise coming from construction work happening INSIDE the hotel every morning It was very loud and made the room useless in the morning one couldn t sleep nor work due to the noise of walls being drilled constantly Getting to the hotel by car is a nightmare Several streets are closed due to construction works and there is no area for passenger drop off Once you give up and park anywhere you can locating the hotel on foot is not difficult but you are likely to see the back of the building first From there the location of the Reception is not very well signed and the alley yes alley leading to it is poorly lit and not properly signaled Other problems are beyond reach for management but they affect our experience as guests The area around the hotel is a massive construction site Noise wasn t a problem but circulation both on foot and by car is complicated and unpleasant Moreover being a very central area you are close to main attractions and shops but the area isn t particularly safe nor nice after dark The whole area around the hotel stenches to urine When you walk out of the reception you have the impression that you entered a chemical toilette , Breakfast is very good except for the scrambled eggs that come from a box and have a very non natural texture Rooms are spacious modern and comfortable Sound isolation is good considering how densely packed the building is The engineers did a good job in dampening the noise Staff is very nice and they try their best to help guests deal with the inconveniences such as absence of parking and the massive construction happening outside the hotel 
249594,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Slightly stuffy room on a blistering April weekend , Superb location Helpful friendly staff Good breakfast and since 16 s and under ate free breakfast was pretty good value 
249595,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Room wasn t ready for check in at 2pm had to wait for this to be ready in bar Complementary drink would have been welcomed but not offered , Location superb
249596,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Our sink drained slowly so there was an icky film once done washing face or brushing teeth Not enough hangers in the closet, Hotel was in a great location and close to everything There is construction outside but to make a new metro entrance which would be right outside front door of hotel Our bed was like a cloud The window in our room opened which allowed fresh cool air into the room Love that the shower glass could go from frosted to clear at the push of a button Breakfast buffet had great selection of food 
249597,Novotel Paris Les Halles, When we entered the room there was a very strong smell of sweat like after an intense gym session We had to wide open the windows and ask the personnel of the floor to spray the room it makes you wonder the cleanliness of the room and how come the cleaning personnel did not realize this Second no one told us that there were works in the hotel Very annoying when you are on holidays to be awaken at 8 30 by loud noise Same in the afternoon when trying to take a nap after a long day outside Also there were issues with the quality of the TV signal pixelized images etc Finally on the check out when we mentioned the issues the person was unapologetic incapable of handling a phone call a check out and a customer complaining Did not even offer a commercial gesture for all these disagreements This is our place of choice when we stay in Paris but this time our opinion of the stay rates very low , Friendliness of the personnel during check in and Benjamin the luggage boy 
249598,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Taxis can t drop off in front of the hotel You have to walk on an uneven path for appr 200 m Noise from nearby construction , Location is very convenient Staff is very friendly 
249599,Novotel Paris Les Halles, The hotel enterance is badly located one must walk 20 meters or so to get to the closest road , The location is very good close to shops and restaurants of Le Marias
249600,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Could provide free bottled water in the room was a smaller room that what was shown when i booked, Its a convenient location just right behind is the train station loads of food to get around the area walkable distance to the Lourve Champs lys es

249603,Novotel Paris Les Halles, We couldn t adjust the temperature on the air conditioner which was set uncomfortably warm and made it difficult to sleep , What you would expect from Novotel
249604,Novotel Paris Les Halles, I initially emailed the hotel to ask for some information but never heard back via email so I had to call directly to get my questions answered The person answered my call was very nice polite and very helpful A little bit concern with the lobby I stayed at the bar until late the night before I leave and I saw a couple of rats running around Wasn t expecting that , The hotel is close to many attractions and all are within walking distance The staffs are friendly Overall I have enjoyed the time I stayed there The room was clean a bit small however 
249605,Novotel Paris Les Halles, First room assigned was very very poor and not cleaned My son is allergic to animals and we found animal hairs in the sofa But the staff was helpful and changed our room Despite that I found it really not a level of Accor hotels because we shouldnt be talking about cleaning Thats not a 4 star hotel issue,No Positive
249606,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Food was very expensive well that may be a Paris thing , There is a some major construction going on near the area so the taxi will not take you to the door step The location was good close to 2 metro station and walking distance to the Louvre and NotreDam The reception staff were helpful in providing directions 
249607,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Staff behaviour My mobile was stolen at the hotel premise and even after repeated pointing towards a specific house keeping staff I was not made to have a word with the person , Location
249608,Novotel Paris Les Halles, The shower was odd you could see the silhouette of the person from the bedroom and there was even a light that made it completely transparent Not sure why anyone would want that Would have appreciated more privacy , The beds were super comfy and there was plenty of room for our family of 4 The location was great very near to the Louvre and good restaurants nearby We didn t get the breakfast there went to the nearby boulangerie for breads and pastries 
249609,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Given current construction in the area is not possible to arrive by car and leave your luggage at the front door The waiting line for breakfast was one of the longest in my traveler experience , Everything works as expected in Novotel location is very good and staff friendly as usual 
249610,Novotel Paris Les Halles, The manger of the reception is irresponsible and disrespectful we had an issue with the room heater where we requested another room moreover he charged us for both rooms while we accubied one room , Clean
249611,Novotel Paris Les Halles, In front of main gate it is still repairing It is not convenience Car parking cost 40euros 24hours But in center of Paris it could be like this , Very good location Nice stuff Breakfast is good Big and clean room It is Novetel lever 
249612,Novotel Paris Les Halles,No Negative, Great selection at breakfast Brilliant location as close to rail services which we used regularly Child friendly TV close to restaurant so we could take restless children there 
249613,Novotel Paris Les Halles, This time they gave me room 115 and it was awful The carpet had stains everywhere it did not smell fresh the bathroom was run down you can see mold in the tiles and the layout was just really strange There was popcorn walls and ceiling at the entrance overall disappointed , The staff was great The last time I stayed here it was very nice on the 7th floor Usually if you have stayed with them before they usually try to keep your room consistent 
249614,Novotel Paris Les Halles, The room was old and the carpet was dirty Its different with the lobby and the restaurant that was modern and clean, Location was great Near to RER frim airport and disneyland and Metro Walking distance to notredame and louvre Staffs were very helpful

249673,Novotel Paris Les Halles, I didn t like the fact that I was placed in a room with very old carpet poor shower facilities and one which had no view I stayed at a budget hotel the previous two days for less than half the price with better bathroom facilities and views It wasn t until I complained and compared my room to that of my cousin who was staying at the same hotel for a similar price that I was transferred to another room The initial advisor refused to change the rooms when the manager over heard she changed my room When I got to this room I had to request for all the additional facilities to be put in place is bathrobe slippers which I expected would be ready for me with the transfer , I liked talking to certain staff members who were very helpful and always smiling The seating facilities in the lobby is also very comfortable Being able to leave our luggage on hold until it was time to leave was also a brilliant We were able to waitin the hotel until our departure time

249682,Novotel Paris Les Halles, The hotel does not provide the basic supplements including but not limited to comb toothbrush etc Also the staff is very unhelpful and their guidance or have given me wrong instructions on items such as WIFI As a result I was suffering from a extremely slow WIFI for a prolonged period Last but not least I request the email alternative channel and this request has been refused by the staff as well Overall it has been a very disappointed experience And I highly appreciate you should think twice or even thrice before book this hotel ,No Positive

249689,Novotel Paris Les Halles, It was expensive for the facilities offered and the hotel failed to register my Club Accor points which for a two night stay costing over 600 Euros left me with the impression that their loyalty scheme is worthless Breakfast was sadly chaotic and disorganised although the staff did their best in a badly designed restaurant , It was next to where i was working so a good location and the staff were very friendly

249725,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Shame about the building site outside Bed was smaller than expected Bathroom was cool and styly but not very practical , Great location 2 minutes walk from Chatelet les Halles RER Station Very friendly staff
249726,Novotel Paris Les Halles, The building site next door however the hotel do their best to ensure that this is managed and that builders do not disturb guests , The Hotel is lovely and comfortable staff are warm welcoming and keen to help The management come around to talk to you ask if you need help and guide you around Paris Service is excellent The hotel team want their guests to enjoy Paris Breakfast is excellent Hotel is close the Louvre The metro and bus stops are within minutes Room is comfortable and big enough for a family of 4 and their luggage 
249727,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Major construction going on right in front of the hotel Nightly prices were way too high rooms were small and unfinished bed was like sleeping on a marshmallow moved out after one night Wall safe was not bolted to anything ,No Positive

249734,Novotel Paris Les Halles, I didn t appreciate the irregular bar staff Some exceptionally accommodating some apparently deaf and blind Don t understand the lack of use of garden Found it difficult to use shower without flooding the bathroom floor sounds silly but I ve traveled Europe before This was a tough set up , Clean but small room Good bed nice amenities Hated the shower but maybe that s just me very clean just design Excellent helpful staff Would stay again particularly if the outside construction was finished by then 
249735,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Our room was outdated and very boring and sort of depressing we didn t want to spend a minute there I think hotel should invest more in improving rooms rather than focusing so much on the lobby after all it s the room that we pay for , Hotel lobby and restaurant area was nice the first thing you notice when you enter the hotel are the most beautiful orchids in the lobby and reception area Great location 
249736,Novotel Paris Les Halles, I was extremely offended by a gentleman that claimed to be the manager of the dining room On the day we were checking out I stood in line for quite a while to get a table My husband was finishing up packing and I went to dine alone I was seated by a gentleman and went to get my breakfast When I returned a lady claimed I took her seat I figured it was a mix up because I was just seated The gentleman in question then makes a scene and dismisses me back to the reception area as if I did something wrong He didn t even offer to re seat me listen to me or move my plate I was humiliated and embarrassed and left the dining area in tears The kind hostess and the gentleman that told me he was the customer service manager Mr Wendy I believe that originally seated me came to my rescue and tried to make up for the rudeness of the supposed manager and offered to serve me breakfast in the bar area They acknowledged that he was wrong and even though it was a mix up he could have handled the situation differently I was inconsolable and mortified This gentleman was rude the morning before as well I was meeting my husband who was seated in the dining room and I explained this to him and he dismissed me to the end of the line without listening Not sure what kind of customer service you expect but I have been in the hospitality industry all of my career and I would never treat someone that way and I surely never expected as a grown woman I would be treated that way I had always heard the stereotype of Parisians but up until that incident my trip to Paris was lovely I will surely not return to this hotel again and will not recommend to friends I will also send a letter to Accor Corporate office and let them know about the service of this dining room manager at the Les Halles location , An Asian at check in was lovely as well as the staff I referenced in the info to the right A young lady hostess at breakfast as well as the Customer Service Manager Mr Wendy I believe The room was lovely as well
249737,Novotel Paris Les Halles, lack of parking on site due to building works by the city clearly the hotel will be enhanced , excellent staff with appreciation for a family with young kids very friendly but efficient and cordial great location 
249738,Novotel Paris Les Halles, the room was very hot even with the window open the toilet stunk of urine i told reception and i think someone had sprayed airfreshner but it had not been cleaned and remained smelly, the staff were very welcoming and helpful the beds were clean and comfy
249739,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Felt like we were put in the cheap rooms Certainly not like the pictures Breakfast was hit and miss Very busy if you try to eat at 9am queued for 15 mins Had to get up and eat before getting ready at 8am however they didn t have enough cutlery Always had to ask for spoons knives and cups Not enough staff to clear tables Pancakes scarce Right next to rer metro work being carried out obviously not hotels fault but be aware Could hear trains late in the evening and early morning when in bed , Good location right next to rer and metro Children s entertainer was a nice touch 
249740,Novotel Paris Les Halles, None, I loved the easy check in Our room executive twin had superb beds The lobby was great Wifi also very fast Location is very near the Chatelet Les Halles train station making it very accessible to other areas in the city and outskirts Just be mindful of pickpockets in the train station because they can be very aggressive Our friend was pickpocketed in M line 14 within 10 seconds 
249741,Novotel Paris Les Halles, The building work outside Bathroom could do with modernisation , The staff were extremely helpful The hotel facilities were modern and clean The food was excellent 
249742,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Anything technical did not work well and was not resolved or took too long to fix I e air conditioner movies purchases on TV wake up calls , Though surroundings were under construction the location was very centric with restaurants and amenities walking distance Also the modern look and size of the rooms were a pleasant surprise 
249743,Novotel Paris Les Halles, rooms are not that great as other novotel hotel and the construction work which is going on the les halles chatelet station there s no taxi which can take you to the hotle entrance you have to drag your baggage to the entrance not far but still, good breakfast good hotel
249744,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Price of the stay was quite expensive due to an exhibition , The position next to the exit of the RER very close to several restaurants and easy access to places to visit

249746,Novotel Paris Les Halles, The bar staff were not very friendly and little experience the seats at the bar were very low and had to raise up to look over the bar There was a lot of construction in the area and therefore it wasn t very pretty for Paris , location was convenient to the RER 
249747,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Had the worst two sleeps in any hotel I have ever stayed in Stayed on 5th floor but outside noise was so loud it was as if people were shouting outside our windows, location and baggae staff were great
249748,Novotel Paris Les Halles, The construction activity in front of the hotel was a bit of an eyesore but didn t really impact our stay The other thing we found a little strange was that there was no hair conditioner supplied in the bathroom not sure if that is common in France , Staff were very helpful and the hotel facilities were excellent The location was great and close to many attractions including the Louvre Notre Dame and the shopping strip all within short walking distance I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in the heart of Paris 
249749,Novotel Paris Les Halles, the entire Les Halles district undergoes major construction work with most of it in front of the hotel you better close your drapes otherwise a construction worker will peek inside your room, great location Nice rooms
249750,Novotel Paris Les Halles, The expensive breakfast is not up to what you would expect For the price of the rooms and even the price of the breakfast itself the buffet offers little choice and is not Parisian at all Little cold cuts and cheeses to choose from bread very disappointing for Paris , The location is excellent Walking distance to the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower 
249751,Novotel Paris Les Halles, There is currently construction in the area next to the hotel this is temporary but it did make it a bit harder to find our way to the hotel , Location and good facilities We were within walking distance to several main attractions including Louvre and Notre Dame Staff very helpful with bookings for taxi shows in Paris 
249752,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Buffet breakfast adequate but not good bathroom water problem with the hot tap running black sludge one morning In the middle of a building site but will be in a stunning position in the future, Proximity to famous sites Pleasant eateries nearby
249753,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Unfortunately I didn t like the pillows I found them very uncomfortable , The staff were very friendly and helpful The location was fantastic Lots of shops and restsurant I love the fact we could walk to the louvre within 10 mins 
249754,Novotel Paris Les Halles, The construction work at the entrance but the hotel staff made everything possible to make up for it , Staff very friendly Paulina and the Spaniard girl greeting us at the Breakfast room Excellent Very caring Facilities modern and in top shape 
249755,Novotel Paris Les Halles,No Negative, Breakfast was good value as children were free meaning we effectively paid 10 euros each It seems a lot but included cereals juices coffee yoghurt pastries cold meat and cheeses as well as eggs bacon sausages We didn t need lunch and nearby cafes bars were charging minimum 7 50 just for pastry juice coffee We were surprised but pleased to be given a room with two proper single beds for our children rather than the double sofa bed we were expecting 
249756,Novotel Paris Les Halles, There was no clost to hang our clothes in very limited storage but a nice big safe No toilet brush and coffee was only instant , Very centrally located Good access to Metro Nearby restaurants Rooms were small but adequate for staying 
249757,Novotel Paris Les Halles, breakfast is good but expensive room 429 was very far from elevator no drawers in the room, location is great near the metro and RER stations quick wifi helpful staff clean room
249758,Novotel Paris Les Halles, The room was run down for a 4 star hotel and the carpet was stained The room was overpriced for its condition albeit close to facilities and in a popular area , The location being close to the river restaurants and stalls
249759,Novotel Paris Les Halles, 1 2 lifts did not work Tv did not work even after being fixed Breakfasts not great Restaurant choices limited No warning of building work outside hotel started at 7 30 each morning, central location

249762,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Because of the huge construction around the Chatelet LesHalles Metro stops if you exit the wrong staircase you ll be walking blocks out of your way Many escalators out of order in the Metro so if you travel that way be prepared to carry your bags up many stairs If you chance to exit the correct staircase there are signs directing you to the hotel s street not found on most Paris street maps Look for the Big Crane to find the front entrance Traveling with a teenage son it s a bit odd having a translucent window between the shower and bedroom area , Non smoking Clean and modern Extremely courteous and efficient staff Ice machines Holy cow that s a rarity in Europe Good wifi Beautiful piano music in the dining area that we enjoyed from the lobby 
249763,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Breakfast rather crowded first morning so went down slightly earlier next day made big difference , We were family of nine grandparents children and grandchildren and liked friendly atmosphere Nice garden to sit with drinks etc location great building works didn t spoil things

249765,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Our room was in obvious need of renovation and maintanance could be better We were told that the hotel is in the process of being renovated three upper floors were already finished staff were a bit to eager to see us off , excellent location just next to Berger St exit from the Les Halles Mall and Metro station and lots of places to eat and shop lively atmosphere just outside easy walking distance from several central attractions Even though at the moment it seems in the middle of a building site in fact it did not affect our stay nice AC

249767,Novotel Paris Les Halles, The room view was of a building site Here s a brain wave for you tell people in the hotel description that there is building work going on before they book the hotel It s not rocket science is it I was unable to experience the magnificent view of the building site in the morning with a cup of tea because there was no milk in the room , The shower was pretty good 
249768,Novotel Paris Les Halles, Room 106 bathroom a little dated At breakfast had to wait for some things to be replenished Shame about the building works outside, Very helpful staff Lovely modern room 360 Comfy beds great shower
249769,Novotel Paris Les Halles, The set up of the bathroom The toilet was in one room with no sink so you had to flush then go to the shower part and wash your hands there The shower door wasn t long enough and the water flooded out if you didn t pay attention, Location
