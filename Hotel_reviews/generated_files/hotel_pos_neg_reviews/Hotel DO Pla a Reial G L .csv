412676,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L ,No Negative, Great staff beautiful design generous breakfast which was included beautiful view of square Great bathroom design awesome shower and great bath products with a selection of Molton Brown gels three scents 
412677,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , For the first night we were put in room 115 which was on the laneway from la Rambla to Placa Reial We basically didn t sleep a wink due to the unbearable noise of foot and vehicle traffic yelling shouting banging crashing Our request for a change of rooms to a quiter one was readily met with staff apologies The second room was higher up and faced Placa Reial and we had a very restful second night I suggest that windows doors with double triple glazing are required on the rooms on the laneway My low rating for comfort was due to our initial room experience , Very central location for walking taxis and public transport Placa Reial is a vibrant area Very helpful and friendly staff with strong English language skills Good value breakfast 
412678,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , My only concern is the bathroom had wood floors and counters It is impossible not to get the wood wet and the floor board in front of shower warped due to the water This occurred in only two nights stay My wife and I took maybe three shower , Food was good The staff was extremely friendly and helpful I felt welcomed and safe I would definitely go back 
412679,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , Love the hotel too much and cannot find any faults , Exceptionally friendly and helpful staff with unbelievable attention to detail They really make the stay special Room is spacious very classy and comfortable Divine breakfast with great service Reception staff gives the visit a personal touch 
412680,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , The noise of people drinking arguing fighting in the square ALL night made for a very sleepless 4 night stay Although we had a lovely suite overlooking the square I would suggest a room further back in the hotel , Really nice breakfast selection 
412681,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , Nothing, The hotel is in a fabulous spot Beautiful building with lovely rooms and staff Only small criticism is the booking stated landmark view ours was into an adjoining building Breakfast was fabulous choice great The hotel is within walking distance to many tourist attractions and to hop on bus area Fresh fruit was delivered to the room daily and a sweet treat atthe turn down service at night Lovely extras 
412682,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , the windows in the single rooms are intransparent and cannot be opened which results in relatively bad air it is suggested to book a double room , very thoughtful charming design hotel at a popular square in the middle of barcelona restaurant with a beautiful terrace 
412683,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , This is something that wouldn t have provoked a complaint but I would have preferred the scraps of fruit to have been removed when the evening treat was delivered An apple core is not a pleasant odor The dinner in the hotel restaurant didn t live up to its billing , Above all else the staff at Do Placa Reial were the best we ve encountered in a very long time They were friendly helpful and went a step beyond in everything they did for us even having umbrellas at he ready during the rainstorm The room had everything we could possibly have wanted and more The location was convenient for many of the attractions 
412684,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , Nothing, Very friendly staff excellent location and wonderful food Situated in a busy Placa the rooms are exceptionally well sound proofed Ideal micatiob
412685,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L ,No Negative, We liked EVERYTHING about the hotel the location the decor the service the breakfast It is quaint and charming the staff is especially attentive Breakfast which was included was delicious 
412686,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , nothing, Excellent hotel from all aspects Great service friendly and helpful staff great location marvelous food comfortable bed with variety of pillow options all in all it was great experience
412687,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , Pillows were too soft , Beautiful big beds bathroom facilities were also very good Soundproof rooms even though close to la rambla Breakfast room and quality of restaurant food was very good 
412688,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , Sometimes it gets noisy at night especially during weekends but it was fine to me T V was useless since most of the channels lags and disconnect every second Also the channels dont have the variety needed Small loby Small elevator The room rates are a bit high You pay for the location basically , The location was superb the back yard of the hotel has a lot of restaurants and bars the rambla road is 10 ft away you cant beat the location of this hotel The balcony was very nice and has the back yard view of the hotel The welcoming drink and chocolate were very nice I liked the shower soup collections molton brown The concierge boy was very helpful during our stay he helped us alot with restaurants and train booking etc The bed was comfortable 
412689,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , Mattress sagged Be aware that certain rooms overlook Plaza where partying sometimes goes on until 6 AM , Room was very modern and comfortable It is the place we stay in when in Barcelona There is a lovely welcome drink free mini bar fruit and wonderful baked goods delivered to room each afternoon Molton Brown toiletries separate shower room and tub room and breakfast included in this boutique hotel Top service and unique 
412690,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L ,No Negative, Perfect hotel for staying in Barcelona Extra friendly staff very good food nice and small hotel Pleasant surprises every day fruits candies or bisquits in room Next time when visiting Barcelona I will definately stay also in the same hotel 
412691,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , I honestly can t think of a thing We had a wonderful time , everything was included options when where and what to have for breakfast early check in without even asking 3 pillow options in room dining options as same as the restaurant fresh fruit in the evening the bathtub and molton brown bath products and the beautifully large windows that opened up to the Placa Reial 
412692,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , Had my phone stolen off the table by someone begging while at dinner at the restaurant Would be nice to put a line of plants or somehting to keep the begging off the diners It s kind of offensive when you are tryin to have a nice dinner , loved that the minibar was entiely free and that breakfast could be served in the room for no additional charge 
412693,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , The hotel is located in Playa Reial which is a very busy tourist destination and can be nosiey at night If you like to experience the life of the city it is a prefect spot for shopping and walking , We felt all the staff were very friendly helpful and professional The food at the restaurant was excellent Congratulations to the chefs Also a full breakfast was included plus a little extra treat in late afternoon 
412694,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , Upper floors are quieter , Fabulous junior suite facing the Placa Reail Amazing breakfast included with afternoon fruit and evening sweets Service amazing 
412695,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , Location is great set in beautiful square off the Ramblas Only reason for not being an excellent location was the unfortunate noise of partygoers throughout the night hanging around the square Not the hotels fault Also has a nice rooftop terrace although dinner menu was rather limited , Hotel provided lots of extras drink on arrival Afternoon fruit Muffins delivered to room in the evening Great selection of Free soft drinks in the room and great bathroom amenities Very friendly helpful staff 
412696,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , I thought that the room could be bigger But this is not meaningful dissatisfaction, Stuff were very friendly We also liked the design of rooms and of course breakfast was amazing 
412697,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , It can get quite noisy in the square so be prepared for that in peak season Even with the shutters and windows closed and good noise reduction in the rooms it is noticeable , The staff were always pleasant communicated well and very willing to help with our needs giving directions taxi etc The experience was memorable from the moment we checked in and received a welcome drink Our room was ready early as I had informed the hotel of our arrival time but did not request an early check in so that was wonderful We definitely took advantage of all the facilities the rooftop is just perfect to escape the mayhem in the Pla a Reial we loved it so much we had dinner at La Terraza Del Do twice during our stay 
412698,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , Nothing , Excellent location overlooking a bustling square lined with palm trees bars and restaurants Close to everything Hotel is superb in every way 
412699,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , Their lights in bathroom would not dim or switch off , This is one of those very special hotels that makes you feel so at home so comfortable and well taken care of that you actually think about planning another visit to the city just so you can stay here again Although they have just 18 rooms this hotel doesn t feel cramped or small the high ceilings and huge windows make it seem like a much larger space yet with a sense of calm and intimacy that will sooth any weary traveller They even have a small rooftop pool don t expect much it s tiny but hey you re in the city in an historic building a bar at the top with gorgeous views and a Spa with massage and facial services The hotel is located in an old historic building and rooms have beautiful hardwood floors and the original ceiling beams and details But the hotel is just four years old so everything was refurbished and renovated and very clean and luxurious The bathrooms are wonderful double sinks great lighting a detail so important and yet so often overlooked in hotels a full bathtub AND a full separate shower stall commode with its own full door so more than one person can use the bathroom at the same time Molton Brown toiletries huge thick and soft monogrammed towels and a heated towel rack In the room the beds are terrific and they even have a pillow menu so you can choose the sort of pillow you want and a room scent menu as well Drinks in the minibar are all complimentary so you can refresh yourself without spending a fortune And a sign of the exceptional service was shown when I left the room and came back in the evening to find that the exact same drinks I had consumed that afternoon has been restocked The hotel has an excellent location right off the Las Ramblas pedestrian mall and just steps away and overlooking the beautiful and popular Pla a Reial I just wish that more hotels would be like the Do and offer such fantastic facilities and service 
412700,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , The only small thing was that the bedroom door was near the elevator for people finishing up at the restaurant so it was a bit noisy one night when I went to bed a bit early The rest of the time it didn t matter because I was out and about , Staff were awesome so friendly and helpful The room was wonderful and the bed so comfy The little extras were really nice like turn down service and Molton Brown products I stayed in the top floor room with the private pool I had a few friends staying nearby so they would stop in and hangout there was plenty of room It was lovely having a private area to lounge at I had a great time and would highly recommend Hotel Do 
412701,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , Room without the possibility to open a window nor possible to look out of the window as it is tinted Super tiny not even enough space to open my suitcase , Lage
412702,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L ,No Negative, Very comfortable bed excellent bathroom facilities with amazing body wash and shampoo The breakfast was incredibly delicious and unique Just sitting at the restaurant over looking the placa Reial was nice Excellent location and friendly helpful staff 
412703,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L ,No Negative, I loved that they offered welcome drinks upon my arrival and that staff escorted you to your room to explain that everything in the minibar was complimentary and that they would pack me a breakfast for my 4 am departure to the airport I loved how they delivered fresh fruit in the afternoon and left truffle chcocates in the evening This was a superb hotel in a beautiful plaza in Barcelona 
412704,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , Nothing bad to say, This beautiful hotel is perfectly located between La Rambla and the Gothic Neiborhood and in front of the Reial Square there is nothing better The staff is very friendly and helpful
412705,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , Nothing the square is busy almost all night but this adds to the atmosphere and as the rooms are well soundproofed this isn t a problem , This was our second stay in Barcelona and a repeat visit to Hotel Do The staff are outstanding in their attention and very friendly Small touches such as the free mini bar and complimentary fruit delivered to your room make the stay all the more special We left early for a flight on our last day and were provided with a breakfast picnic The night staff were extremely helpful in arranging our taxi and providing a coffee before we left 
412706,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , Wi Fi was down for both the days that I stayed there Only available at reception and in the lobby area as well as in the terrace It was a bit of an annoyance as I would have to come down to the lobby area just to get some work done or to contact someone I was going to see that day Would have made the stay a 10 if not for this Other than that beautiful hotel I will definitely come back for my Reial 5 Star experience since I am a fair individual and saw how spectacular the hotel really is , Breakfast is amazing food here in general is really good should come here even for lunch or dinner especially on the Terrat Friendly staff and always there for any request you may have A beautifully decorated hotel From the Terrat down to the rooms and in the restaurant in the basement A pearl of a hotel amongst the busy and crowded Pla a and neighboring streets and avenues Location is everything and this hotel is at a very prime location I will definitely recommend it to anyone traveling to Barcelona 
412707,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , Food was very average The noise from the square was constant 24 7 with drunk youths , The hotel staff were very good and there attention to detail was excellent 
412708,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , Tha Placa is overrun by tourists and was noisy at times during the night and early morning notwithstanding very good double glazed windows Some of the street artists are very loud and obtrusive while eating on the square , The staff were extremely helpful and pleasant Free minbar in the room is a nice touch Room was very comfortable and stylish 
412709,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , I had a extremely tiny room but that was not the worst issue It had a window that faced a wall so there was hardly any natural light If you opened it you had all the smells from the kitchen getting in the room But the worst bit was the fact that the isolation of the room was very poor right next to a noisy elevator that was used most of the night I could also hear the people in the corridor or on the floor above Not acceptable for a 5 hotel In total the value for money was very poor , The staff was helpful and friendly Decor is nice Location is very central Having a taxi station right in front is handy 
412710,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , The adjoining square Placa Reial can get noisy and stays like that from late at night until the following early morning Would have preferred a room on a higher floor away from the noise of late night early morning revelry Nothing to do with the hotel but you really have to watch your pockets in Barcelona Pick pockets abound , Location great and just far enough away from busy Les Ramblas main street Spotlessly clean hotel great service excellent breakfast and free soft drinks in mini bar 
412711,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , Too noisy One night there was a food van feeding the homeless outside the bedroom window ALL NIGHT They were loud and raucous and kept me awake There were a lot of street vendors around and they are very ready to rip off small children trying to buy their cheap toys ie my 10 year old son , The situation in the square with all of the restaurants around Although on closer inspection the restaurants are not good and not very friendly and inviting
412712,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , Was not a good choice for me as i am a light sleeper Noise coming from outside next room somebody talking or even just walking outside the room Rooms are not isolated Another issue they detected money from my cc without asking me including more what they said as a deposit Althought every thing in the room is a complementary even i didn t especify in my booking the preferred payment method Till now haven t recived my many back , Location staff cleanliness are perfect Although room is small it is well organized and the bathroom is just excellent 
412713,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L ,No Negative, I loved the location In the middle of everything still very quiet Beautiful mentain proprety delicious breakfast The soft drinks in the minibar are free Really comfortable bed and good pillows I am a big supporter of small privately owned business The reception staff was very nice and very helpful 
412714,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , I Think the breakfast was a bit poor but you could order extra if you wanted, Perfect situated hotel in the center lovely and comfortably room nice staff Very good food for lunch and dinner
412715,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , Room service we ordered food but by the time it reached to our room it was cold guidance to use the ac , Food in the restaurant was amazing Breakfast alone was worth the value of 20 to 30 euros which was inclusive in the price of the room We had dinner there and it was sooo delicious everything that was brought to our table was excellent in taste highly recommend atleast one meal in the restaurant in the basement Staff was very helpful Excellent location Quality of baby cot blanket and pillow They provided a lot of things 
412716,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , The rates are bit on the expensive side There is no value for money , The breakfast was great and included in the rate Number of rooms in the hotel is small and cosy hence the service was excellent Staff attitude was excellent friendly and very useful The location of the hotel was excellent
412717,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , More choice for vegitarians, The location was great the staff were friendly helpful and had great english and it was close to airport Would stay here again

412722,Hotel DO Pla a Reial G L , Placa Rial is very busy particularly in evening when people are sitting outside in restaurants they tend to stay up late and you can hear some of the noise in the room Minor irritant and well worth it for this terrific boutique hotel , Fantastic location right off Rambla Only about 18 rooms Beautifully appointed and comfortable molton brown products in bathroom free mini bar and fruit left in room each day staff very helpful Excellent fully inclusive breakfast Would defintely recommend
