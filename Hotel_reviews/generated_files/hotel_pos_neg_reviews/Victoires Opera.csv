215311,Victoires Opera, This is a 2 star hotel Not a 4 as listed It had an odour from the first floor up and in the rooms Furniture is shabby and everywhere needs a refurbishment It isn t that the cleaning wasn t done it is just run down in general I would not recommend this hotel at all The location is great , I wouldn t stay here again Moved rooms twice Front of desk staff understood and were helpful 
215312,Victoires Opera,No Negative, The staff were so very nice and helpful We do not speak French loved they could speak English very well The location of the hotel was more than perfect 
215313,Victoires Opera, It was very hot when we stayed there and the A C in our two rooms was not working and as the street below was so loud we could not open the windows until about 3am when it was quiet enough to do so We only slept of a few hours that night The staff accommodated our request to move to interior rooms that we small and dark but at least the A C worked a little and they were very quiet allowing us to finally get some sleep The breakfast was unimpressive so we went out to local cafes every day , Great location from which to explore Paris The local neighbourhood is lively and full of options for bars and cafes The street is virtually pedestrianized with very few cars on the street
