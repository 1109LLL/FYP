424740,HCC Regente, Nothing I had an excellent stay , The service provided at the desk especially the gentleman He was very patient friendly and supportive Best information staff 
424741,HCC Regente, The room for three people was incredibly small and we were tripping over each other the whole week We also were facing a wall when we looked out our window The service staff turned off our air conditioning each time we were not in the room and one of the maids took my art museum member card and we had to go get it back from her ,No Positive
424742,HCC Regente, Loud badly isolated rooms you hear clear when people talk in the hallway and close open doors old incl smelled like an older hotel tiny and dark rooms I left the hotel after one night ,No Positive
424743,HCC Regente, Breakfast doesn t start until 0700 so if you have an early start for the airport or like us for the Moto GP you won t get breakfast The swimming pool is VERY small no more than a paddling pool but the hotel is very good and these are minor things compared to the overall high standard , Very clean hotel they clearly have their housekeeping staff well trained The hotel has a good roof terrace with excellent views of the city and a bar that opens in the evenings The swimming pool is VERY small so don t expect to be swimming lengths The location is perfect on the Ramblas and close to Passieg de Gracia train station shops and restaurants The Torres restaurant is just around the corner and we would recommend this for an excellent meal Overall an excellent choice for a city break in Barcelona 
424744,HCC Regente, The view from our room could have been a little better as we were placed in a room whose view was directly at another building so we couldn t see the city from our room But I m sure most of their rooms have better views , I appreciated how close the hotel was to the main part of Barcelona but you couldn t hear all of the outside rush The rooms were also sound proof which was great for our midday naps 
424745,HCC Regente, Air conditioning would have been nice and although the breakfast was lovely it was very expensive , The pool was particularly welcome after a hot day And the beds were very comfortable 
424746,HCC Regente, on arrival the reception staff did not serve us straight away and continued on their discussion even though there was no queue we had to wait about 10 mins , view from the top of the building
424747,HCC Regente, The service at the reception a 20 mins check in is definitely not acceptable It should only take 4 5 mins which was not my case and not the case of other clients as I could experience and see The decoration of the rooms With little changes it could look much better It was dark colored old fashioned without taste and depressive it was really not to my taste not nice at all The pillows were super uncomfortable and I have now a problem with my neck that I have to fix with an osteopath back home The extra 15 euros charge so that I could have a bedroom not standard with a window viewing outside rather than on a wall Imagine how horrific this is I remained under the shock when I happened to know that I saw later on internet that the hotel management explains that there are people that like to have a bedroom facing a wall so that it is quiet You have to be joking All these negatives made me think that this hotel is very lucky to keep its 4th star and I wonder why Maybe for its location I will not go back there and will not recommend it to anybody , The room was reasonably big and I had a balcony It was clean as well The hotel had a pleasant roof top terrace with a nice view and very quiet There was a tiny swimming pool as well so I imagine in Summer it is refreshing My room was quiet so I slept well I appreciated the easy access to the wifi system The fantastic central location and the easy access The friendly staff at the reception 
424748,HCC Regente, Booked and paid for a double bed was given 2 singles and told it is not possible Things didn t improve from there Roof terrace locked miserable bar jaded room and stoney faced staff , Excellent location
424749,HCC Regente, Phone was not working in the room we had to go down to the reception to order coffee early in the morning Additionally housekeeping was unavailable after 10 30 pm and the receptionist appologised for not being able to provide us with an extra pillow , Location
424750,HCC Regente, The carpet in the room has a damp musky odour and the room is dim Air conditioner water dripping from the air vent in middle of the night on first day , Location is good 
424751,HCC Regente, The beds were the most uncomfortable I ve been in for a long time I requested a wake up call and never received one thankfully I woke on my own in time for my flight , The location to the great and easy to walk to a lot of places 
424752,HCC Regente,No Negative, We asked for an upgrade and it wasn t a problem rooftop terrace was brilliant my son loved it the swimming pool and we were able to relax Location is brilliant There were ants in the room not many but we were cautious about having any food in the room therefore didn t bother us In general we had a good experience 
424753,HCC Regente, The website and reviews could indicate that this is a shopping district There are restaurants and cafes but no nearby supermarkets that we could find The beds were basic but the bathrooms were quite nice , Front desk staff were very helpful and spoke English Hotel is right around the corner from an ATM The location of the hotel is right around the corner from Casa Batllo About 4 blocks south is Placa Cataluyna where there are transportation connections like Aerobus Hop on and off buses etc We didn t buy hop on and off bus tickets from this hotel but some hotels do sell them This hotel is a good bargain for your money You need to be able to walk a lot though more difficult if you have a disability 
424754,HCC Regente, Twin beds rather than a double Very minor issue Didn t fancy paying 20 Euros for breakfast , Great rooftop bar and little pool Nice room worth paying slightly more to have a balcony over looking the street 
424755,HCC Regente, Coffee was from the jar From 4 star I would expect coffee machine at least No hamon at the breakfast , Location close to Catalunia but the area is very decent Closest metro stations 5 minutes Diagonal and Passeig de Gracia Very nice roof terrace with a view Bar is there as well Good cava
424756,HCC Regente, Our friends had a small bedroom with a view of a wall Can t figure out why we got the better room especially as they booked and paid quite a few months before us although they paid less than we did , Our room was a good size with a private balcony with a great view The king sized bed was very comfortable Loved the roof garden We had friends staying at the hotel and we met them in the roof garden for a drink before dinner Bathroom was a decent size and very clean Was about a 15 minute walk to La Rambla but that wasn t so bad as we were far enough back from the crazy crowds We were very happy with our stay Staff were very courteous and helpful Location was great 
424757,HCC Regente, The room was a bit noisy It did not have a noise proof and at 2 00 AM i suddenly woke up to the noise of people entering their rooms , Entering the room my wife s first impression was The room is perfect The breakfast was amazing and there was a wide variety The Staffs were friendly to help and provide details The 24hrs checkout really helped me and the cab was available at the entrance at 5 15 The location was perfect to walk to any of the Gaudi s Casa buildings I walked from La Rambala almost everyday during my stay Well connected to the shopping area The room was looking the streets and I was looking at the streets But quite honestly why do you need a view and what are you doing inside the hotel instead of being out there enjoying your Tapas and Sangria I will definitely recommend for anyone looking for a nice safe stay The pricing was a bit high but my over all impression would be to return here if I am visiting Barcelona again 
424758,HCC Regente, Nobody bothered to help us take our bags up to the room The room and the corridor outside the room smelled bad The sink in bathroom was half blocked hence did not drain water properly No tea or coffee facilities in the room They don t serve food on the terrace and have a weird rule that you can only have drinks on terrace after 7pm , The location is good as it right on Ramblas Breakfast was good 
424759,HCC Regente, 1 The rooms are very basic more like of a 3rd star hotel 2 For some reason there took payment from my Euro bank card in USD despite I specifically stressed I want to pay in Euro, 1 Brilliant location ideal for sightseeing and shopping 2 Reasonable pricing policy 3 I was there at Saint Jordi day the hotel people were so nice to put a red rose on my bed during cleaning 
424760,HCC Regente, Very disappointed that there were no tea coffee making facilities in the room I asked if we could have a small kettle and was told there was no problem getting boiling water from the bar but they made it difficult e g had to wait 10 minutes for someone to be there to give you a small jug of boiling water I believe they were charging 2 50 for a small jug of milk but I m not completely sure about that I wouldn t pay that for a drop of milk so just had black tea , Bed was comfortable and room was very clean 
424761,HCC Regente, Maybe the hotel is a bit expensive for what is offers , I liked the location of the hotel good breakfast friendly staff The hotel was also very clean 
424762,HCC Regente, The beds mattresses are hooooorrible We would be doing a lot of walking in Barcelona and that s hard to do with a stiff back and neck after feeling like you slept on I don t know A 60 year old bunk mattress that s hard as a rock Also AC in the room gets incredibly cold or lukewarm Water pressure is meh so bring dry shampoo , The hotel is clean the staff is attentive and it is in a very good location 
424763,HCC Regente, Lift was a bit small Bed could have used extra pillows but I didn t ask so no big deal , Could not have asked for a better stay Location was perfect short walk to Las Ramblas but not right in the hustle and bustle of tourist hot spots Room was lovely We were upgraded to a room with a terrace and the view was amazing Great value for money also Can t recommend highly enough 
424764,HCC Regente, Roof terrace bar was shut for most of the time we were there Very disappointing as the terrace is the best feature of the hotel and some lovely sunny evenings Had to pay extra for a room with a view other than a brick wall , Location was good within easy walking distance of key locations 
424765,HCC Regente, We requested a late check out and were granted an extra hour Any longer would cost around 11 euro per hour We also had to wait for 30 40 minutes after asking for our boarding passes to be printed or else we would have to pay around 5 euro to use the computer These are minor issues however I already paid an extra 110 euro to upgrade our room on arrival so getting a boarding pass printed and late check out isn t much to ask as the availability was obviously there , Beautiful view of the Sagrada Familia from the roof and a beautiful hotel in general The terrace bar is reasonably priced and I personally recommend the prawn cocktail salad It is also a 4 5 minute walk from the passeig de Gracia station which has a direct link to el Prat airport
