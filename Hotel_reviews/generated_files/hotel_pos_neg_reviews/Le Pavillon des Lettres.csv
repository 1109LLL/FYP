40495,Le Pavillon des Lettres, The pictures on booking com would suggest much larger spacious rooms and so the room was much smaller than I expected it was well set out but definitely compact , The hotel was really well located in easy distance of Paris landmarks Everyone was very friendly and the hotel offered lovely added extras for example use of bicycles we didn t have time to take advantage but it was still a lovely touch 
40496,Le Pavillon des Lettres,No Negative, We stayed in Diderot room which was an upgrade as it was our anniversary a lovely room with a balcony overlooking the rooftops of Paris so romantic I woke to see the Eiffel Tower in the distance each morning just perfect 
40497,Le Pavillon des Lettres,No Negative, Staff we re incredible Can t thank them enough for getting a car to take me outside Paris Had to use Uber because taxi would go there the young man at the front desk used his Uber account and then showed me the amount charged to his personal card and I paid him Who does that They couldn t do enough for us and the staff makes the hotel 
40498,Le Pavillon des Lettres,No Negative, The boutique hotel took the concept of literature all the way The rooms have names of authors rather than numbers That personal and human touch goes all the way to the care the Cleaners took with our belongings 
40499,Le Pavillon des Lettres, the pillows are bit small maybe its common in Paris, The service is very good and warm Amenities interior of the room and lobby are excellent Very good location too
40500,Le Pavillon des Lettres, Nothing to write here Really , Excellent and professional service Very close to central places to see in Paris notably the Louvre Tuileries Chams Elysees the Arch of Triumph and museums Very secure location on the same street area with the President s office ministries and embassies Their rooms are named after big writers and you can read their books available in the rooms Great bathroom 
40501,Le Pavillon des Lettres, No drawer space at all in our room Only some hanging space Not a problem for us as we were only staying for one night and didn t really unpack but it would have been pain if we were staying for a few days, great location Lovely helpful staff
40502,Le Pavillon des Lettres, Having a kettle with coffee and tea would be nice , The property was sophisticated in its interior design I love the fireplace at the breakfast area It s very cozy and charming 
40503,Le Pavillon des Lettres, Heating AC was faulty in the Baudelaire room either boiling hot or freezing The shower was impossible to use too tiny and if you manage to squeeze in it flooded the whole bathroom Toilet paper and bathroom amenities were not replenished daily , The literary theme and the books in the rooms 
40504,Le Pavillon des Lettres, A bit expensive this should be between 140 to 160 EUR to be competitive with other similar hotels in Paris We travel regularly to Paris and this is the only aspect they should look at , Friendliness of the staff overall coherence of the design of the hotel 
40505,Le Pavillon des Lettres,No Negative, what can I say the staff in this hotel is one of the friendliest we have ever met Extremely polite and helpful a lot of extra touches that made our stay even more enjoyable The location in Madeleine is a great one a calm neighbourhood with plenty of small good restaurants and pubs around Be careful though the majority will close early and on the weekends Not to worry though as the Champs Elysees is just a few minutes walk away
