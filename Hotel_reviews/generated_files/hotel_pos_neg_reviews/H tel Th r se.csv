196656,H tel Th r se, Small but adequate bedrooms , The staff were fantastic Lovely breakfast and afternoon tea Lovely choice of wine in the evening Excellent location It is a small hotel with lots of charm Super place 
196657,H tel Th r se, Room is a little small but that s what s Paris , Everything is perfect The location is awesome 3 min walk to Louvre and very easy access to everywhere Lots of restaurants downstairs but very quiet at night Room is great too Very clean and well decorated Staff are very friendly It was our honeymoon and the hotel upgraded our room and prepared Champagne for us 
196658,H tel Th r se,No Negative, It is a beautiful hotel with many touches that make it truly boutique The staff were charming and very helpful I loved the location on a quiet pretty street in central Paris 
196659,H tel Th r se, I needed to iron some clothing and one of the staff said that I couldn t iron in my room and had to iron in the hallway of the breakfast room where people walk through I questioned this and was told that s where I had to do it After some time I waited for the hotel manager to arrive and she put me in another room instead I found this quite odd I travel to Paris more than twice a year and never had to do this at any other hotel , This hotel is one of my favourites in Paris The location is the best just behind Palais de royal and around the corner from all the Japanese restaurants I booked the suite and the room was very large bed comfortable and very clean Breakfast delicious 
196660,H tel Th r se, This is a boutique hotel So room size is really small As two of us are staying with two large luggage we find it a bit difficult to open both luggage at the same time , Location is good just a few minutes walk away from Opera The staff are very nice and helpful Rooms are sweet and comfortable Settings are really cozy I really like the design Bonus point they offer free afternoon tea from 16 00 to 18 00 and it was really amazing 
196661,H tel Th r se, As in most hotels in Paris the rooms are really very small our room maybe 11 m2 INCLUDING the small bath There are no parking lots in or near Rue Therese Arriving by rental car you will have to book a parking lot in an underground six storey car park near to Metro Pyramides at reasonable prices , Centrally located in a narrow street near Av de L Op ra and Metro Pyramides between L Op ra Boulevard Haussmann e g Galeries Lafayette and Louvre Seine Both places and e g Place de la Concorde and Notre Dame are in walking distance and can easily be reached within minutes Very helpful staff english speaking Tasteful furnishing 
196662,H tel Th r se, The rooms were quite small and No flat iron Also the products in the room were very bad, The staff and the service was excellent And the location was perfect
196663,H tel Th r se,No Negative, The room was clean and comfortable Checkin out was speedy All staff at the reception were kind and helpful They offered me free coffee and sweets at the lobby 
196664,H tel Th r se, The room is a bit smaller than we expected Also capsule coffee machine wasn t found in the room but it was mentioned about it during the booking The breakfasts were monotonous during our stay within 4 days , First of all I should say that the hotel has the best location and decoration is stylish The Louvre is close The street is quiet but the area has a lot of restaurants The staff is very welcoming and kind 
196665,H tel Th r se, Each night we heard a buzzer a couple of times during the night I assume this is due to guests arriving in the middle of the night although why this was audible in our room I don t know we were on the top floor My friend was awakened by this each time although after the first night I used earplugs , We liked the friendliness and efficiency of the staff especially as my friend does not speak any French The breakfast was excellent We especially loved the afternoon tea in the salon each day at 4pm I have already booked another stay at this hotel and will be recommending it to everyone 
196666,H tel Th r se, Bathtub was very small but to be honest it was a bonus to have a bath so it wasn t a big deal , Very friendly and accomodating staff from the staff at the desk through to room service Would 100 stay again 
196667,H tel Th r se,No Negative, So comfortable and welcoming The staff were helpful and accommodating Thanks for the upgrade Room super clean Location excellent Would stay there again 
196668,H tel Th r se, No thermostatic control on the shower Small room is okay for a couple of nights but wouldn t suit longer stays , Beautiful decor throughout the hotel and the staff were all extremely friendly and helpful Afternoon tea was a great touch never seen this in any other hotel Great location just a 10 minute walk from the Seine Very nice traditional French all you can eat breakfast with plenty of choice freshly made coffee and plenty of it Unlike some other reviews we didn t experience any noise from the street however our room was on the fifth floor and it was winter so we didn t have the windows open maybe it s different in summer on lower floors 
196669,H tel Th r se,No Negative, Very friendly staff attractive communal areas Very good value for money considering Paris prices Great location in the centre of Paris but located on a quiet road with little street noise at night 
196670,H tel Th r se, The rooms were a bit small but charming We were on the top floor and had both rooms for us and our two teenagers , Bed was terrific Very cozy The staff couldn t have been more welcoming They gave good recommendations for restaurants and helped us book transfer to the airport The location was fantastic close to the Louvre restaurants and shopping Breakfast was included and more than a continental They had eggs and sausages 
196671,H tel Th r se, The only criticism was it was a little too hot but we opened a window so problem solved , Beautiful Boutique Hotel with lovely charm We had the best stay ever The rooms were lovely and the breakfast room was really quaint We were a 5 minute walk from lots of bars and restaurants and the Louvre Fantastic highly recommend this hotel
196672,H tel Th r se, Room size is a bit small but quite comfortable, Great very central location comfortable bed nicely decorated hotel and rooms And the free afternoon drinks and snacks are wonderful great idea 
196673,H tel Th r se, the noise from the street late at night and people smoking outside the Hotel smokes drifted into our room , friendly staff chocolates on arrival in our room Afternoon tea served every day 
196674,H tel Th r se,No Negative, Everything about this hotel was amazing The staff were the nicest people always cheerful very helpful and always ready to assist us The rooms were spacious and the mattress was great I want one for our bedroom 
196675,H tel Th r se, Room was small and a little on the dark side but we did not need to spend much time in the room plenty of places to go and see also a nice lobby in the hotel , The staff are really wonderful very helpful The hotel is very stylish and tastefully done The location is fabulous 
196676,H tel Th r se, The rooms on the top floor were a bit cramped if you re party has more than two , Pleasant staff and central to everything The breakfast buffet was simple but tasty and served in a charming environment The beds were comfortable even the sofa bed A good value for the money 
196677,H tel Th r se, I was given a queen but it was not a queen but two singles pushed together Upon check in I was not told breakfast was not included but was directed the breakfast room Upon check out I was later charged the price of breakfast Disappointing , Central location extremely clean rooms Comfortable quiet 
196678,H tel Th r se, Nothing , Extraordinary genuine service The team members at the front desk were warm eager to serve and wanted to ensure that we were totally comfortable They were flexible and accommodated our requests The team members are very well selected for their roles They made our stay enjoyable We will stay here again The rooms were comfortable and clean with an attractive d cor The bathroom was immaculate The hotel provided a light afternoon tea free of cost 
196679,H tel Th r se, Quite pricey but you can get deals to bring it down Mini bar expensive but theres a vending machine a minute down the road go there instead, My second stay at Hotel Therese and just as good as the first Great location five minutes from the Louvre but tucked away in the back street so really quiet Lovely staff and clean comfy rooms Didn t have time for breakfast this stay but previously was very good go early to avoid the crowds Also free tea coffee snacks in afternoon everyday in the lobby 
196680,H tel Th r se, Nothing , Lovely reception staff great location Hotel is located in a area full of Japanese and Korean restaurants which makes it convenient when one wants a change from the usual French fare 
196681,H tel Th r se, The door of our room is a little small so that the scroller is not easy to get in , Good location and there are a lots of Korean and Japanese restaurant around The room is very clean and the staff are very helpful They paid attention to details we found baby shampoo and lotion are provided when we arrive Really sweet decoration 
196682,H tel Th r se, Really loved everything about this site , The location was excellent Staff spoke great English and were very helpful with directions and shopping recommendations It really felt like home 
196683,H tel Th r se, Rooms are quite small but that s Paris real estate , The staff was friendly and helpful The establishment was very clean The lobby area and sitting reading room areas were comfortable and conducive to conversation with other travelers The available apples were great 
196684,H tel Th r se,No Negative, Truly lovely boutique hotel in a wonderful location with fantastic staff I would heartily recommend staying here if you re a person who is looking for a nicer small hotel It is appropriately priced for sure If I had to think of a population for which it is not suited I perhaps would not recommend it for a young family or at least not a family with more than one child nor to a person who prefers to stay at much larger chain hotels meaning they expect certain standard amenities presented in a certain standard way that s not a bad thing but it s important to know what you want My husband and I are people who like to travel want to enjoy a location s unique surroundings and vastly prefer a well appointed luxurious but not over the top boutique hotel or inn If that s also you I say don t hesitate to book Some points to note Rooms are small sure but the size is precisely what one would or should expect from a hotel in Paris or almost any large city Particularly at this price point Beds are firm but very comfortable and well outfitted Bathroom size is quite generous in my opinion especially for Paris Breakfast is available for purchase though I can t comment on it as we always went out Complimentary tea time coffee tea snack is offered every afternoon 4 00 6 00 Ice water with lemon or mint and fresh apples are available all day There is a computer and printer available for your use at all hours located just off the larger of two sitting rooms connected to the lobby The complimentary wifi is very good and reliable throughout the building Staff is present and ready to help at the front desk at all hours rarely only one person often more than two 
196685,H tel Th r se, No iron or ironing board provided I had to go downstairs in the lobby to iron because they couldn t provide an iron for security reasons,No Positive

196687,H tel Th r se, My room which was deluxe double room was very dark and very stuffy Not having the coffee and tea facilities in the room was not convo isn t at all It also would be nice if some form of room service was available too , Cute little hotel in a perfect location The staff were wonderfully pleasant and helpful The breakfast was nice with enough variety and very sweet and welcoming staff too
