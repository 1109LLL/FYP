342079,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof,No Negative, the best location in Vienna beautiful hotel excellent services awesome breakfast everything was in a walking distance because of the hotel our trip to vienna was awesome 
342080,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, 1 Costly for small room 2 I did not like that when we arrived and during check in I paid for the breakfast for the two nights In the morning I was sick and did not go for the breakfast My husband went alone but he informed the staff that I am sick and can t eat breakfast and requested for yoghurt and tea to the room when we were checking out I found that they have charged the breakfast for two persons and also the room service We explained to them and tried to request them to consider either one even if they charge the breakfast which was expensive But they said breakfast is nonrefundable and they claimed that they only charged the delivery for the room service Again don t know why it is not a big deal for this small case but they could manage it better so we an appraise and give good comment about the hotel , Location
342081,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Nothing, Excellent hotel Very good and polite staff Room was very comfortable and quite Everything was superb I will come back here for sure Dear hotel staff thank you again for your hospitality 
342082,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, The opening hours on the spa could be a bit longer , Steigenberg Hotel Herrenhof is a beautiful hotel with an excellent location just a few minutes walk away from Hofburg Palace and Stephansplatz The U bahn station Herrenhof was just around the corner which was very convenient 
342083,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof,No Negative, We arrived really late at night and despite the hour our room was upgraded the little perks in the room made our so much desired rest a great experience Beautiful room beautiful views Everything was great
342084,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof,No Negative, Food excellent good bar area with the staff being very friendly The hotel is in a great location for sightseeing in Vienna Overall a very good trip in a good hotel 
342085,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof,No Negative, Very good breakfast Mini bar contents were complimentary for the stay Room comfortable and felt at home Close to local mini market Close to many attractions Staff helpful and supportive 
342086,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, I mistakenly booked the room rate without breakfast and was happy to receive an email prior to our arrival giving me the option to add breakfast for 29 person room Not cheap but we wanted to enjoy their breakfast buffet so I booked the upgrade When we checked in I found out that one can add breakfast for 20 room nigh For a family of 4 that s a 36 difference per might This was an unpleasant and frustrating experience since the booking through booking com could not be undone The email one receives offering upgrades makes it look as if it came from Steigenberger directly when in fact it comes from booking com That s almost deceiving Lesson learned on this trip booking com rates are almost always worse than booking directly with the hotel Another issue we encountered not only but also at the Steigenberger although rooms with twin beds were specifically offered and one reason why we decided to book a certain hotel over another that wouldn t offer seperate twin beds we never got the separate beds we requested but ended up with one king or queen I have a feeling that this would also be handled better if done directly with the hotel Last but not least our room was on the small side and almost a bit claustrophobic Our kids had a slightly larger room which seemed more airy and comfortable , Excellent location excellent staff very nice and rich breakfast buffet Quiet rooms 
342087,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof,No Negative, The staff are very friendly and helpful They are willing to go the extra mile to help The hotel location is super convenient It is close to all the important visiting sites and museums Will definitely stay again if I come back to Vienna 
342088,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, The price of the breakfast was high 29 euro for an average eater and the daily parking cost was high in my opinion 40 euro There was a park house close there people may check the costs or look for a parking place before their travel , The location was good and the room was clean The breakfast was various and the network was strong enough we were at the 2 floor 
342089,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof,No Negative, Very good service friendly and professional staff great location comfortable beds superb rooms Fresh food at breakfast Will recommend the hotel to my friends business partners Excellent experience 
342090,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, As we found the breakfast too pricey we decided to go to a restaurant nearby , Great location Only a few steps from the underground station Herrengasse in heart of Vienna Very friendly and helpful staff Many restaurants and shops are close by 
342091,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof,No Negative, We arrived earlier than the check in time but were given a room at once which was a help The room was nicely furnished and clean with a comfortable bed The breakfast was excellent with everything you could want everything regularly replenished so no hanging around for foods that had run out and the cakes bread and pastries were very fresh Excellent scrambled eggs The waiting staff were helpful and attentive We found all the hotel staff restaurant bar and reception to be very friendly and helpful A special mention to Andreas on reception who was utterly charming friendly and efficient The hotel had a very pleasant atmosphere which was down to the staff and probably because the guests didn t have anything to complain about 
342092,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Expensive breakfast didn t feel like 5 hotel not a good value for money , The location was perfect close to everything Big room nice bar free WiFi

342094,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Very crowded at peak times in the breakfast room literally not room to move so make sure that you go early for breakfast then it is very relaxing and gives time to explore the extensive buffet , The rooms were very nice and generous in size and well appointed Fantastic location for exploring Vienna Great welcome from the reception staff 
342095,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Bed was a bit hard for us, Location was excellent being close to the city centre and main attractions Buffet breakfast was very good with lots of healthy options too Staff friendly and helpful

342097,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof,No Negative, Location was perfect right next to a metro station It was also right next to a famous coffee shop by Central Cafe which was amazing Staff was friendly and accommodating 
342098,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, The bed wasn t comfortable as there two mattresses were moved together to make a king size bed We wanted to order cheese board after 11pm and it wasn t available as the kitchen was closed otherwise everything was excellent , The hotel was beautiful very central location staff was veryfriendly and helpful 
342099,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Breakfast price was a little steep 20 29 euro for 1 person and we didn t use that services , As Vienna touristic center is small the hotel is in the dead center with a U bahn station 30 seconds away to get to the farther attractions or the city airport train Was one of the most comfortable beds we slept on and the room was super clean We also received 1 complementary use of the mini bar which was refreshing after a longs day walk The staff was always willing to help and took their time to assist and answer all the questions All in all the stay was one of our best I would have gladly stayed a few more nights
342100,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Wifi was slow and not so secure Our single experience with the restaurant was lackluster but there are several quite nice restaurants within a 1 block radius , Staff were unfailingly knowledgeable helpful professional and just cheery Wonderful location just steps from the underground Metro and in easy walking distance to main sights This hotel has a good mix of business and leisure travelers and they are thus fully equipped to handle the needs of both Smart comfortable appointments in the room with a number of little touches that made us feel appreciated and welcome including fresh bottled water and chocolates each day
342101,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Waiting 20 minutes in the foyer for my room to be cleaned at 15 45 pm on one occasionWaiting for 20 minutes at the outside sitting area for a drink as the staff had to come from the inside bar and they were quote very busy Although it seems petty horrible little sticks to stir your coffee or take out tea bags in the room , The location of the property the reception staff and the comfort The general feel of the hotel 
342102,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Valet Parking was expensive compared to other hotels in Vienna centre Got a room under the roof in the attic with a very small window and no view , Great location friendly staff
342103,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Bed a little uncomfortable and air conditioning was quite poor The room was very warm which made it difficult to sleep , Rooms nice and spacious staff attentive and friendly 
342104,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof,No Negative, The suite was spacious and comfortable and had a dining area which enabled us to order breakfast in the room for a daily rate of 15 euros The selection available for breakfast was extensive including eggs omelettes bacon mushrooms cereal yoghurts fresh fruit croissants and more Breakfast times were also extended of a weekend which is great if you like a lie in The staff were very professional and friendly a credit to the hotel The location was quite central and within walking distance of the museum quarter State Opera and shopping areas A lovely hotel 10 out of 10 highly recommended 
342105,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof,No Negative, From arrival to checkout the customer service and friendliness was absolutely superb Bed was very comfortable room and view was so nice Rented 2 adjoining rooms Valet parking was nice Restaurants museums shopping all close within short walk Wonderful hotel experience 
342106,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, We loved the hotel Nothing we didn t like, The location was excellent Short walk to major sites While we could have taken the train the transfer to the metro from the airport we used viennadriver com for a few euros more It was nice to get to the hotel quickly after a long flight Room was ready for us Breakfast is outstanding Rooms very comfortable Staff was excellent
342107,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Room was quite small and we had power issues Shower in bathtub Room was very dry too much air conditioned , Location is perfect near to subway station and very close to Cafe Central 
342108,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, The room decor and build although new and modern had a cheap feeling to it , The hotel is new modern and very clean Excellent location Very helpful staff Excellent hot breakfast with lots of choices 
342109,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, The staff could be more cheerful warm and caring They really behave like robots straight to the text they must say and not what a normal human being would tell in the same situation Some sockets in the room did not work it was too cold during the night and the temperature could no be increased There are some stains on the chairs the housekeeping went just while i was having breakfast and i spent some time convincing them the return later The door on my last day refused to open due to the fact they probably already checked me out but it was 9 45 am and i did not asked to check me out So i had to spend around 15 min going to the basement and back to the room each time with a new key that did not work , The breakfast is exceptional very good with fresh juices lots of warm food fruits and cheses The location is very close to the butique streets and just next to a metro station The streets are quit There is a free water in the room every day and nice chokolates The rooms are quite spacious and look nice 
342110,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Cannot think of anything , The hotel is welcoming and warm staff are attentive Liked the large spacious bar lounge Bedroom was spacious and comfortable Very impressed by one member of the reception staff who went out of his way to assist with a change of room 
342111,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, The streets around the hotel are fairly quiet but the room had very little in terms of sound insulation and Vienna like any city can be noisy even early in the morning , Mainstream 5 star hotel perfectly situated in the very heart of Vienna a few minutes walk from the Hofburg Palace the Graben shopping street and St Stephen s Cathedral It is in an old good looking building but at some point in the past 15 or so years was the subject of an aesthetically questionable refurbishment It is however truly impeccably clean and maintained to an as new level that is not easy to come by in lesser hotels The deluxe room was of fair size also impeccably cleaned and maintained and fairly well equipped for a business class hotel We paid a little extra for a corner room with more windows and I felt like it was also a little bigger than other rooms on our floor It was one of the very few to have a balcony which was a nice touch no space to sit but pleasangt to walk out in the morning The minibar was adequate water coke and beer and free throughout the stay Nespresso is provided but oddly not a kettle We did not try the breakfast but did use the spa gym sauna steam bath and relaxation area which is nice and very clean if often a little crowded 
342112,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof,No Negative, Nice notel in a great location The executive room is big the hotel staff is very helpful and kind I didn t like that the sheets and towels weren t changed every day pretty disappointing for a 5 hotel 
342113,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Neck support pillow not available first night when requested in the morning due to there not being enough in the hotel , Friendly staff Great facilities Always clean Modern decor Lovely breakfasts Perfect location for Vienna 
342114,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof,No Negative, The pillows and beds were really comfortable The free mini bar refreshed daily was a lovely surprise The breakfast croissants were so fresh and tasty 
342115,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, The dear as poison parkingwhile indicated on arrival it was 40 for the two days this was actually per night while I accept it would be higher than even the most expensive we had paid elsewhere this was more than double anywhere else which left my opinion of this property tainted Not happy jane and very little empathy was shown for the confusion, High end property with live music in the bar be sure to have the bar man make you a nice cocktail while enjoying the live music 
342116,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Would have preferred a separate shower No pool Breakfast expensive , Excellent location right next to tube station and walking distance to most central venues Not cheap but worth the money Spacious room worth the 17 upgrade option Free minibar Very good breakfast though expensive 29

342119,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Cleaning we have noticed that it was not even vacuum cleaned Why not to have a proper minibar selection for Superior Room , Breakfast was very good with excellent choice for every taste Staff at reception and in the restaurant were attentive and friendly Excellent location sights and public transport 
342120,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Our room was not maked up at one of the days of our staying despite we were out since morning till evening and placed a table please make up the room At the day of our departure a chambermaid wanted to make up the room before our leaving it was very strange,No Positive
342121,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, At 5 a m the heating the room started I could not turn it off It was a lot of noise and I could not get back to sleep again Without that my night would have been perfect ,No Positive
342122,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, First of all this is a 5 star hotel Being so I am expecting a service typical for that category Staff was not at the expected level breakfast as well This hotel is mainly for congress and meetings much less for couples Service is absolutely anonymous Saying that I would not rate it as a 5 star hotels indeed to my eyes this is a very good 4 hotel but definitely not a 5 one , Excellent position room was big very clean and well furnished 
342123,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Breakfast area is somewhat tight It is strange but they do not serve sekt or any other sparkling for breakfast whereas it is almost a part of signature lifestyle of Vienna , The hotel offers nice atmosphere and great location for those who want enjoy Vienna sparkling lifestyle Kohlmarkt with its shopping is just a few steps away major tourist attractions like Hofburg Albertina Opera are a few minutes away U bahn station is around the corner Rooms are spacious and sunny clean with incredibly comfortable beds 
342124,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, This is not a 5 star hotel anymore We already stayed there a couple of times But this stay did not meet our expectations Breakfast is mediocre but allright We wanted a nice and relaxing Sunday brunch until 12 which is a bonus But at 10 30 they in particular a busy manager started taking away tables and seats in one of the two rooms for a lunch buffet until it was empty They only waited that we would finally leave after having been there for 15 minutes After having changed the room we noted that also the nice tea bar was gone and had been replaced by a champagne bar for the lunch The small spa is not very clean Wet towels left by guests everywhere dirty glasses empty soap dispensers no tea water mould in the steam room broken fittings After two days we did not use the spa anymore The first days the bar was used for a convention and rearranged with additional functional furniture it came along with a heavy smell of food On one evening it was even closed for some time On the last day the room service came late but the breakfast was abbondant Too many inconveniences and negative points for 5 stars and the room price of more than 200 Euro without breakfast which is 29 It is a pity but we have to look elsewhere , Very good location Friendly staff at the reception 
342125,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof,No Negative, Great location to walk around the city Everything is in walking distance so We were able to see a lots though it was cold outside Stuff was very friendly and helped us a lot with spots where we want to go Room is very clean and comfortable 
342126,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Dust in the room wrote my name in the dust on the shelf in the bathroom was still there 4 days later Final night it was properly cleaned, Excellent breakfast
342127,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Breakfasts at the hotel are quite expensive since there were 4 of us but there are a lots of places near by where you can find cheaper breakfast options , Everything was great
342128,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof,No Negative, Loved this hotel The location was fantastic Minutes walk from the Hofburg the town hall Christmas market and cafe central Plenty dining options around it too 
342129,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, The spa was small not the best Breakfast very expensive but we went for continental breakfast in the bar which was more reasonable and we had plenty , Very clean and brilliant location Pillows and beds very comfortable and room very quite due to double windows The staff were very professional I would definitely stay again 
342130,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, I was really disappointed with the service especially for the price To be honest I have no idea how it was a 5 star hotel Felt like a 3 or lower as far as service goes We asked in our booking request for a feather free room due to allergies This did not happen Okay fine We then asked 4 additional times for the bedding to be swapped out in a 5 night stay It didn t happen until after 10pm on our last night We also ran out of tissues on the morning of day 2 They were not replaced during any of the the room cleanings so we had to ask for them to be replaced They still never were They never asked us how our stay was or was going All of this would be fine for a 4 star or 3 star or below but unacceptable for a 5 star of this pricing Honestly don t waste your money You won t get the experience you re looking for , Location was good Room was of a decent size Breakfast buffet was decent 
342131,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, first room we received had 2 mattresses and as we booked one queen size bed we had to move to another room which had one bed The second room s shower head was leaking , Staff location clean room size room service
342132,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, We were very happy with everything We didn t include breakfast in our option here nor did we eat here so that part is difficult to assess , The room was very spacious and comfortable and very quiet It was in a prime location close to a railway station and all major tourist attractions The bar was relaxing and a good place to unwind and regroup after a day out and before or after dinner 
342133,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, None, Location clean quiet rooms and the very friendly polite staff especially the young lady receptionist and Richard the concierge But everyone else was very kind as well 
342134,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, night staff was really root its a very expensive hotel and we expected more friendly atmosphere very pure christmas decoration since we were there for christmas holidays very dissapointed cause vienna is famous about christmas spirit not even music in public areas, excellent location big rooms and also big bathroom breakfast was really excellent with a big variety of food 
342135,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, I had booked more than a month in advance and paid upfront for 2 superior rooms via booking com When we arrived at 12 pm I was told the rooms were not ready and they would call me when ready with the guaranteed room check in at 3 pm So we went out and had lunch but since I was not feeling great and it was raining I came back and sat at the lobby We finally got the rooms at 3 pm not a minute earlier which was disappointing as many other guests were getting their rooms earlier at check in I was told that my booking category was lower than theirs Overall this was disappointing as I requested even one out of our two rooms if ready but was not given any flexibility I travel at least twice a month internationally and this was a very unusual experience which left a bad taste in my mouth Frankly it was clear that they waited till the 3 pm deadline which could have been managed better , Service was good rooms were good and the location is excellent If you want a hotel near the sights and shopping then this is it
342136,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, The restaurant was not the best Really had to venture out for a great dining experience , The staff who went out of their way to organise site seeing and location of activities 
342137,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Can t think of anything, Location quietness food and range of eatery facilities staff lounge bathroom layout and appliances solidness of the building and quality of construction
342138,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, We were misinformed about the holding deposit and they actually take more money than the cost of your stay I am putting this first issue down to the language barrier of the first lady we dealt with The manager was quick to rectified this situation so cannot fault anything else at all , Amazing hotel staff very friendly location is excellent as it is in the centre of everything We went for the Christmas markets and the location as said above was ideal I got engaged on my trip so Vienna is a very special place for me 
342139,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, The rooms need freshening up Breakfast was good but overpriced , Excellent location and within walking distance of many areas of interest The hotel itself was good and the rooms comfortable 
342140,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Below the bathroom mirror in all the rooms we have stayed in there is no ledge a very minor problem so is the glass of the washroom which is a bit short , Staff Incredibly nice and helpful Breakfast second to NONE Rooms comfortable and clean Location cannot be better
342141,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof,No Negative, Everything was perfect The staff were wonderful everyone we encountered The room was very spacious and clean and the wifi worked at all times The shower was great Breakfast was amazing It had anything you can imagine I also noticed people having their eggs made to order although we were happy with the huge selection available The location couldn t have been any better Staying here was a great experience Thank you all 
342142,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof,No Negative, It was the birthday surprise for my wife The stuff was very friendly an every wish of us was getting realized The birthday cake on breakfast was the topping of this Grand stay at the steigenberger Vienna We will come back really 
342143,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, The bed was a little hard We had classic massage was ok but a little sloppy , Fantastic room fantastic view fantastic staff fantastic breakfast fantastic location 
342144,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, you have many TV channels but anyone not in Czech or Slovak language , excellent breakfast pleasant staff beautiful position in centre of Vienna City
342145,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, The shower design was somewhat uncomfortable as it is combined with the bath tub which makes taller people stand in the already bend part of the tub In addition there was construction work right in front of the hotel which made the mornings rather loud Yet this is a temporary issue , This is a very decent hotel right in the center of town It is basically what you pay for but neither extraordinarily cheap or a secret tip Especially considering other decent hotels in the vicinity the undiscounted price seems just a little to high
342146,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Superior queen sized room was small the width was only a little longer than the bed Only one arm chair although it s a double room but probably wasn t room for a second one Room faced the inner courtyard which we thought would mean it was quiet but there was a private party in the bar one night that was very loud indeed and disturbed us even though we were on the fifth floor And although the party was meant to be in the bar it spilled out into the lobby so we had to push through to enter the hotel and get to the lift , Very comfortable bed and rooms well equipped Excellent central location 
342147,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, The first morning the entire bathroom flooded and water poured into the bedroom They changed the room that evening but it seemed as if it was a regular occurrence Can t believe they would build a walk in shower without a door , The location is excellent close to all attractions
342148,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Difficult to find with all the construction in the city for a foriegner The expense to park the car at the hotel Perhaps you could tell patrons of their other options, Buffet was the best
342149,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Was told breakfast was included when checking in But upon checkout was told it was not and was charged 25 euro per person per breakfast Would have eaten elsewhere for much cheaper had I known , Location and ease of getting around Venice was great Rooms were very comfortable and clean 
342150,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, It s really high level I really wonder what could have been better Ah they had no alcohol in the minibar , Location good room breakfast all excellent 
342151,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, The staff claimed they received all information from booking com except for the bed preference but it s hard to believe that my confirmation e mail and the hotel s email from booking com were different , The location is great the bed is comfortable and due to double windows you don t hear any noise from the street The restaurant in the hotel serves godd food 
342152,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof,No Negative, The location is perfect within walking distance of all the top sights Make sure you stop by the iconic Cafe Central turn right out of the hotel We especially appreciated the assistance of the charming Dave who greeted us on arrival and helped with everything Visit the little known Capuchin Kaiser Crypt for an alternative Viennese experience one place Dave didn t know 
342153,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof,No Negative, The location was excellent and the hotel staff most friendly helpful Our room was very comfortable and quite We were very satisfied with our stay there 
342154,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof,No Negative, The location is perfect in the center of Vienna all interesting places and the Opera are in a short walking distance as well as karntner street There are too many restaurants and cafes around the hotel 
342155,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Lack of early check in capability , The location the decor chocolate left every night fresh oranges squeezed with an old fashioned juice press at the bar a good quality breakfast buffet with lots of variety friendly staff and a spacious room 
342156,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, TV remote control malfunctioned everyday We called house keeping but it constantly malfunctioner , Location Is fantastic Great staff efficient friendlly really to help Bed is very confortable bathroom facilities excellent generous size room 
342157,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Bottle opener for mini bar was difficult to use and my sister hurt herself using it Recommend replacing with better design , Amazing location with easy access to everywhere Having Cafe Central 20 feet away was great 
342158,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, There was road works outside our hotel but this did not inconvenience us , The hotel was very clean The room was spacious quiet All the staff were very polite efficient The breakfasts were very good varied The hotel was located within walking distances to the shops restaurants and tourist sites that we wanted to go to We would definitely be returning to this hotel in the not too distant future 
342159,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof,No Negative, Excellent location near variety of cafes resturants and amazing shopping experience with luxury brands famous stores in the area Demel caf is only 3 minutes walk Clean hotel I will definitely stay in it in my next visit to Vienna 
342160,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Didn t like two beds joined together as a double together with two separate duvets, fab location great staff very quiet and peaceful area but so central Very clean Stylish bedroom great bathroom lots of towels All excellent quality 
342161,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Housekeeping was inefficient Coffee cups were not cleaned pods were not replaced Staff was rude and walked into the room speaking loudly and arguing amongst themselves ,No Positive
342162,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, we took 2 rooms different floors and theres strange smell in the corridors Noisy noisy place because of the constructions outside the hotel 3 when i reached the room there was no water from 11 untel 5am , location is good and rooms are species and perfect
342163,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, The room smelled damp or like it had been smoked in The bed wasn t comfortable and even though I put the do not disturb sign on the door they came in anyway They never restocked the mini bar The hotel staff wasn t very friendly even though it is not inexpensive to stay there They didn t even ask how my stay was when I departed , The location was hard to fine but easy access to everything The staff was ok 
342164,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, The water was boiling in the showers even when I turned the knob to cold , Very close to the metro and in the heart of the city The staff were very nice and helpful 
342165,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Breakfast was quite expensive we didn t take it and made our breakfast in nearby cafes, Great location Almost everywhere in old town is walking distance We stayed at standard room with our 1 year old The room was big enough 
342166,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Shame our visit coincided with the uplifting of the road and walking paths The noise was there but you kind of get use to it , Steigenberger is close to shopping cafes and historical monuments and museums 1 minute to Cafe Central which is a must to visit The rooms are clean and fresh and there is an option to upgrade which I did Nothing is too much for the staff Very friendly 
342167,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof,No Negative, We were upgraded to a premium room for free Excellent location Excellent wifi connection Breakfast was great with many varieties and fresh juices Super clean room
342168,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, We asked for toothbrush and it took 40 minutes to receive it , Nice breakfast Great location Nice bed Smooth checkin amd checkout professional staff in front desk
342169,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Breakfast was in addition to the room price which I don t think for the cost should be Parking was very hard to find and concierge not very helpful Cleaner knocked once and entered the room at 8 45am the day we were checking out which not really acceptable , Location was great 
342170,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, I don t know why but the cold water became boiled water in the late evenings and early in the mornings , Everything was very good i would mention the breakfast was excelent with a wide range of choices The staff was very helpful and efficient 
342171,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Nothing to dislike, Perfect knowledgable and friendly staff check in check out were a breeze the cleanliness and quality of rooms and hotel areas were 10 10 the breakfast was second to none for choice and availability again with excellent staff Fantastic location we would thoroughly recommend this excellent hotel to anyone 
342172,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Nothing to complain, Right in the centre of main shopping district and very close to the metro evert morning went out for breakfast and find many places Had a great time
342173,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, No water supply in one night because of broken boiler or breakage of water pipe and no explanation was given until we contacted the receiption , Very tasty breakfast especially freshly made fruit vegetable mixed juices and omelettes to order Nicely decolated spacious modern room and confortable beds
342174,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, I cannot think of anything bad really , Our room had a tea coffee making facility and drinks in the minibar were complimentary What we drank they replaced them next day Room was spacious clean and elegantly furnished Good location and excellent service Both of us thoroughly enjoyed staying at this hotel 
342175,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, there was no swimming pool and kids didn t like that, Friendly staff and speaks English the location is great close to the main points of the city 
342176,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, I requested connected rooms at time of booking and I communicated with hotel 48 hours before check in as my first priority but the hotel failed to provide full booked is the reason my personal feeling that reception at time of check in was not concern about my request since one employee say if you request before you will get and after looking to her manger she kept silent for few minutes and replayed it is not available but we will give you rooms next each other my understanding from body language that my request was not matter for the hotel for two days I did not feel comfortable since I am traveling with children and the family had to separated , all I stayed three days and in second day there was some water came down from the roof of my room Hotel replaced my two rooms with two connected suites due to roof damage as complement for last day It was very nice and kind

342180,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, There was street construction going on in the front of the hotel However I did not hear it from my room , The staff was friendly and accommodating The room was well designed with comfortable bedding 
342181,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Neither the Hotel when we called to book an extra night NOR Booking com EVER mentioned that there is major road construction around the hotel therefore there would be NO automobile access IF we knew in advance we would not rent a car that cost 208 just so that we could have them park the car in the garage for 3 days without access and for THIS PRIVILEGE charge us 29 Euros each night that is 90 Euros WITHOUT offering anything in return and a just saying SORRY NOT going there again or use our favorite booking site that is Booking com It is outrageous Jahan Salehi Ph D , LOCATION CLEANNESS COMFORT

342187,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, We got a free upgrade which was excellent although they said we could have a free mini bar there was not much in it so a bit disappointing , The air conditioning was very good not noisy so we were able to keep it on through the night 
342188,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, staff are not friendly mainly a front desk person called Kristina who treats you like you are not really welcome at the hotel main point is that it is a 5 star that should be considered 3 stars for its old carpet messy lobby service at the bar and many atreas of the hotel that does not look like a 5 stars at all , good location but there are many contradictions about what it is said at booking and what you get when you arrive at the hotel

342218,Steigenberger Hotel Herrenhof, Upon the check in they did not have a family room booked by us despite sending a separate request at booking com Could be booking com messed things up They managed to find one pretty soon but in case there would not be any available our holiday would be messed up since we travelled with 4 and 6 year olds we forgot a small bag with toys in our kid s room While they were really helpful with finding it and organising for it to be sent by post to us we were surprised they charge us extra for the postage At the end of the day I ve stayed at their hotel probably 10 times in last 4 years Similar happened to us in Kempinski in Vilnius in January we forgot some books They sent them free of charge to Slovenia , Location staff in bar bell boy on chech out
