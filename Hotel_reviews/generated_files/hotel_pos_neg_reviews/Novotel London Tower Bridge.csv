21147,Novotel London Tower Bridge, Hotel blocked GBP50 on my card on top of the full price for room without any notification or information in booking com system which I find breaching booking com rules The amount was released 2 days after check out which meant that during my London trip I couldn t spend part of my money Receptionist manager in the hotel couldn t find any immediate solution to that and behaved as it hadn t been any issue Is not about GBP50 but I may simply imagine that the hotel might have blocked GBP500 for same security reasons and in such condition I would be deprived of any money I had converted earlier to my GBP account before weekend trip It s just can t be trusted ,No Positive

21157,Novotel London Tower Bridge, My room only came with tea sachets with the coffee making facilities As I am a coffee person it would have been great if there were some instant mix coffee packets provided as well Other than that I had a very wonderful stay and sad I couldn t stay longer Such a great place , The room was super comfortable and sumptuously decorated I love the bathroom which I find very spacious The staff were welcoming helpful and friendly The room came well equipped with an iron ironing board flat screen TV coffee making facilities tea sachets several power outlets to charge your electronic gadgets The bath condiments in the bathroom were quite lush It is literally less than a minute walk away from the Tower Hill Underground Station which then gives you access to all of London via the Tube and the historical Tower of London and iconic Tower Bridge are just five minutes stroll away In other words superb location 
21158,Novotel London Tower Bridge, No parking at the hotel , Best sleep in a year Best customer service in a decade Front of house staff impeccable Kind attentive they really care that you have a good stay 
21159,Novotel London Tower Bridge, Due to location nothing open close by at the weekend Upgraded room on arrival offered but still not worth the money very small and basic Had to move rooms due to bad smell Small and uncomfortable bed Room service wrong every order Despite staying gluten free options a very poor choice, Clean Helpful staff
21160,Novotel London Tower Bridge, I was on the fourth flour somehow in my room I heard toilet flushing all over the building which was kinda annoying , Service and people very friendly 
21161,Novotel London Tower Bridge, I called the hotel to change the booking to a win room which they agreed over the phone but when we arrived it had not been arranged and one of us had to sleep on a sofa bed not ideal as we were working The bed was too soft and the sofa bed was too hard , The place was stylish
21162,Novotel London Tower Bridge, I ve talked to several people Ola Gabrielle Salem about how dissatisfied and was never asked to be put in another room nor did they compensate me for the extreme discomfort I was in Then I was told Veronique Delattre was going to be in contact and that was 4 days ago My daughter had a room Ella 18 4 21 4 and the air cooling system was broke and we called 2 times and finally they brought her a fan Never was she asked to be put in another room or anything and our room air cooling system worked perfect However in our room there was a really bad smell coming out of the pipes that causes my fianc to buy several times and I mentioned downstairs and nobody ever sent anyone up or asked to put us in another room because my daughter s room didn t smell like that Every time we had breakfast SOMETHING was wrong and they had to bring something else up On the last day we ordered an express brekfast and the lady on the phone said she would have a grilled ham and cheese with a coffee When I go downstairs to pick it up Gabrielle said they don t make grilled ham and cheese and the kitchen was closed and they don t make coffee Now I stay in hotels every single week and I ve NEVER heard in the history of staying Anywhere that our kitchen is closed and we can t make you coffee If that was the case I would NEVER tell a paying customer that we can t make a cup of coffee for you even if the kitchen was closed but what made matters worse was that they lady took our order down and it has 2 cups of coffee My point is that the staff taking the order could have told us paying customer that which would NOT have made it right but at least it would have made us aware In the end we didn t eat the sandwich and the banana looked like they were both open and we didn t eat those Finally Salem in the end after much complaining and understanding where I was coming from he made us a coffee , The decor
21163,Novotel London Tower Bridge, The breakfast starting at 16 95 is excessive even for London so we didn t eat at the hotel at all, The staff on reception were very good and efficient with a friendly smile Room clean and comfortable
21164,Novotel London Tower Bridge, the breakfast price was 16 99 which I guess is standard prices for hotels in London chose not to have breakfast as there is a lot of choice around the hotel for cheaper options , Check in staff very polite and welcoming Location great for City of London Tower of London Bridge and transport links
21165,Novotel London Tower Bridge, Nothing, Staff couldn t do enough for us Always excellent customer service Lovely hotel Very clean Breakfast selection very good Great location Just round the corner from Fenchurch St tube 
21166,Novotel London Tower Bridge, We had an executive room which was new and clean but it lacked a few things Firstly no mirror at the vanity desk unit to do your hair so you had to stand near the bathroom to do this Our room was No plug in sink so difficult for my partner to shave as some men still enjoy a wet shave Overall good but missed those few things May seem petty but sometimes little things add up , Hotel was good and in good location right near the tube
21167,Novotel London Tower Bridge, wierd bathroom layout with sink in middle of room and kinda see through glass to the shower , Comfy and clean hotel with a modern feel Was a lovely room and a perfect weekend away in an awesome location

21172,Novotel London Tower Bridge, It seemed a bit pricy but I guess within the normal price range of quality London hotels , The hotel design is modern with attractive internal design Creative reception arrangement Good choice of colors and style The room was comfortable and adequate size Proper and delicious breakfast offered Quality in every detail 
21173,Novotel London Tower Bridge, Expensive breakfast prices if you only have cornflakes and toast like me Horrendous traffic problems in central London making locating the hotel difficult spent more time stuck in traffic than the journey from Birmingham , Nice room and bar area and free parking outside the hotel a bonus 
21174,Novotel London Tower Bridge, Unsure if room was the right one as booked as we thought minibar was included in price but only had water and milk in fridge, Excellent bed great location
21175,Novotel London Tower Bridge, The price paid when I originally booked the hotel on the Booking com site it was 224 The day prior to arriving it was available for 109 00 on the website they then had the cheek to ask if I wanted to pay 16 00 extra for breakfast If you can I would leave booking till the last minute and get better rates , The room was spacious and clean although the bed was very hard 
21176,Novotel London Tower Bridge, Not enough towels in room just I hand towel and one bath towel for two people Also the meal from room service was cold , Very clean reception staff very friendly and helpful easy to check in and out

21179,Novotel London Tower Bridge, We had a new style room and the sink was in the bedroom looked ok but impractical to use no stopper so you cant get a sink full of water very limited on space for toiletries which tended to make it look a mess Shower enclosure and toilet door are full length mirrors which quickly got covered in finger marks generally all design but not functional Oh and a huge wall to wall picture over the bed of a fox in the snow err this is London not Lapland Breakfast was a bit of a rugby scrum with lots of people all trying to get food at same time hot buffet was ok but food was only tepid and one 6 slot toaster for the entire dining room was a joke and it was really really slow , Staff were brilliant

21191,Novotel London Tower Bridge,No Negative, We arrived a few hours before check in and had to wait for a room and had to wait with jet lag in the lounge The manager saw us falling asleep and made sure we were a priority check in in a room that was quiet She was amazing

21199,Novotel London Tower Bridge, Room was booked until 11am but when I came back from a run at 10 am cleaning people had prepared room for the next guest and would not let me in though I had not checked out , Well located nice rooms and a very good breakfast
21200,Novotel London Tower Bridge, We were very disappointed with stay as we were woken up at 8 15 to the sound of constant construction work being carried out on our floor Constant drilling and banging until 12 pm We was not told of this in our arrival and this spoilt our anniversary SUPRISE gift for my girlfriend I m am very disappointed and expect something to be done about it I have stayed a Novotel many times in the past and I can t say I will do so again until I m satisfied you have felt with this situation promptly , Room 
21201,Novotel London Tower Bridge, The glass panel separating the bathroom and bedroom The breakfast is a little pricey , Clean modern hotel in a excellent location The room was spacious with a fridge safe plenty of towels bathrobes slippers toiletries and a little box of chocolates to welcome you A good size bathroom with a lovely shower 
21202,Novotel London Tower Bridge, Because there s no air conditioning it could get very warm sometimes They did provide you with a portable fan though which helped a little And although it s close to the tube station and the tower of London it s kinda far from everything else such as shops restaurants and supermarkets The bed was too soft and very lumpy so it was uncomfortable to sleep in Right now early November 2016 the hotel is going through a renovation so it could get very loud and noisy during the day , Close to a tube station Easy access from Heathrow airport
21203,Novotel London Tower Bridge, Staff are very nice but it is sometimes hard to communicate due to different language proplems , Wonderful location near Tower of London Tower Bridge and tube station

21210,Novotel London Tower Bridge, The house cleaning service only changed out the towels each day and made the bed They did not empty the garbage or restock the coffee supplies or water the last night of our stay There was no complimentary coffee service available in the lobby area during the morning hours , Comfortable bed Nice modern decor 
21211,Novotel London Tower Bridge, Pleased to say everything was good, Great fairly quiet location near Tower Bridge and the Tower of London but close to Underground station so less than 30 mins to most attractions including shops Ideal for exploring the locality and history of the City Keepers Restaurant within hotel was excellent and good value for money Rooms have everything we wanted liked the free safety deposit box and hot shower Staff very pleasant and always pleased to help Second time we have stayed here so that in itself is a good recommendation 
21212,Novotel London Tower Bridge,No Negative, Location was great Right next to the Underground for easy travel Close to sightseeing and restaurants Amazing comfy bed The staff were extra helpful and catered to any of our needs 
21213,Novotel London Tower Bridge, One of the rooms had not been cleaned and changed from previous guests We were given the key and went up to discover a dirty unmade room This was at 16 40 pm more than 2 1 2 hours after the official check in time Had to vacate the room again so it could be cleaned for another 30 minutes , Location was nice
21214,Novotel London Tower Bridge, Nothing, The room was spotless with a comfy bed Staff were friendly breakfast was really good Drinks in the bar were surprisingly cheap considering we were in the city of London Great base for sight seeing

21221,Novotel London Tower Bridge, During breakfast our table became the service point for waiting staff Seemed to hang over us for the whole of breakfast Manager was overly concerned with signing the bill , Problem shower dealt with quickly and new room offered immediately
21222,Novotel London Tower Bridge, I don t like the way the hotel automatically adds extras to your bill whether you ve had them or not The agreed booking fee with you was 189 and yet my card was debited with 235 on arrival It was only my query with reception that the card was credited How many other guests miss this , The location

21226,Novotel London Tower Bridge, The superior room was bland which is fine if you are just passing through but a couple more colourful pictures would have cheered the room up but clean and bed very comfortable Air con not effective though, The quality of the food was very good The staff were very helpful as I needed gluten free food and were willing to find alternatives with the chef to help me I was impressed with that
21227,Novotel London Tower Bridge, Check in time was at 2 00pm We arrived at 2 30pm and the room was given at 4 30pm Further they promised to put the third bed by the time we went back from dinner in vain We returned at 10pm after repeated three phone calls bcos the could not get the third bed moved is hurriedly in the middle of the night at 11 30pm to another room for floors above Now our sleep got ruined and further more we left the next morning and realised that my daughter left one of her denim trousers behind on the other room Wrote to them but nobody bothrted to reply , Location
21228,Novotel London Tower Bridge, The hotel staff did not issue me an invoice for the amount paid to them I explained to them that I have to submit the invoice to my company They insisted that they would send the invoice to my e mail address But Evian after three days they are yet to send the invoice to my e mail address This is a big negative point for the hotel , Breakfast was good

21230,Novotel London Tower Bridge, Staff struggle to be conversant about Hotel information in English Unable to understand words like dressing gown bath mat newspaper Lack of clothes hooks in bathroom Ended up dropping my clothes and accessories into a heap onto the toilet seat , Excellent breakfast 
21231,Novotel London Tower Bridge, The Tap water smells and tastes like something died in their water tank The toilet seat was broken The in room safe didn t work and I waited 3 hours for a technician to fix it Prior to the stay the reservations people delivered a last minute surprise telling me the day before departure that one of the dates I had confirmed I wanted was not available However it was available on Booking com Asked to check out at 1pm rather than 12 due to my meeting schedule and they said no , Good location
21232,Novotel London Tower Bridge, The plug for the hairdryer was nowhere near the mirror which made things extremely difficult The room was too hot through the night The bathroom looked luxurious but water dribbled out of the shower not the power shower I was expecting Only enough milk etc for two drinks each Wasn t the cheapest hotel so a bit disappointing , The hotel was clean welcoming and tastefully decorated The staff were all friendly The room was spacious comfortable and away from the main road 
21233,Novotel London Tower Bridge, A bit random but there were two of us in the room and we only had one big towel and one hand towel It was a bit awkward discovering that when my partner had showered and left a wet towel that I then had to use , All good Easy check in check out Nice size bar Rooms clean and tidy Would recommend 
21234,Novotel London Tower Bridge, No complaints , A cleverly designed room with all that you need in a very convenient location near the Tower of London the river and tube station Room was lovely and clean and the bed very comfortable Would recommend

21236,Novotel London Tower Bridge, no dislikes , We liked the location for access in and out of the city with the rental car Tube line was 100 meters from this hotel and made gatting to any London attraction easy This hotel is also just steps away for Jewel Tower Tower Bridge and water taxi Several Pubs in area The room was clean modern and perfect for this stay

21241,Novotel London Tower Bridge,No Negative, Every thing about this hotel is spot on our third time staying here I wouldn t stay anywhere else In London now Close to tube station 
21242,Novotel London Tower Bridge, Breakfast was a shambles hot food items ran out and were not replaced quickly resulting in queues and frequent visits back to that area Always had to ask for tea coffee no one kept an eye out for our needs Also the bar on Sunday night was very very noisy a raucous rowdy chanting party rendered it impossible to hold a conversation with family and friends There is nowhere else to go from there to get away from the row Our daughter had run the London Marathon and we had no intention of walking outside to find another bar Our tooth mugs and milk cartons were not refreshed and we had no bath plug Our pillows were mightily uncomfortable in whatever combination we tried It didn t seem like a four star hotel to us and though stunning in its styling and location it was disappointing in its service especially at breakfast Chaotic , The location Excellent Cleanliness Faultless Reception Friendly welcoming and highly efficient

21248,Novotel London Tower Bridge, Appalling hot buffet at breakfast Must have been cooked the night before and kept hot Bacon and eggs uneatable Disappointing at 7am, The snack luncheon was very good and good value In the evening I had asked for Calvados at the bar Waitress had bever heard of it but the bar girl unexpectedly found a bottle 
21249,Novotel London Tower Bridge, I booked B B for my partner I but on arrival the receptionist said it was only booked for 1 person even though I had my email confirmation We didn t bother going for breakfast because of this an extra 17 00 was required However on checking out a different receptionist confirmed we had booked breakfast for two , Location was brilliant Bar was very good

21259,Novotel London Tower Bridge, The only down side was the bar at night only served one actual beer bottled London Pride the rest was either cider or lager and as I come from the Real Ale capital of the world found the bar rubbish with nothing to interest me it was also waitress service taking 10 minutes to arrive when I could have fetched it myself in a fraction of the time , Stayed here 6th February for a night and found it a very modern and good value for money hotel Situated right next door to the Tower of London and close to Tower Bridge St Pauls Cathedral and many other places of interest A minutes walk to the nearest tube station made it very convenient A buffet breakfast in the morning was perfect including full English or continental style eat as much as you like 
21260,Novotel London Tower Bridge, The rooms were lovely however the windows didn t seem to keep out the noise from passing noisy people or cars The rooms were a little hot and the air con didn t seem to get cold enough That was the only issue apart from that the hotel is lovely Loved the decor, Great hotel really friendly relaxed feel and reasonable prices
21261,Novotel London Tower Bridge, Booked the executive premier room thought that it would have a view be higher up only to find that it was on the 1st floor Asked for a quiet room got put in the room next to the lift could here the lift operating Went to change the room which was no problem but got put above the bar night club could here noise and music in the early hours and then the chairs and tables scraping when the cleanup was be carried out Not very superior or executive I m afraid , Location
21262,Novotel London Tower Bridge, breakfast could have more variety of fruit or salmon or trout for those who don t like to eat sausages and bacon but it has a good breakfast anyway, hotel looks stunning room has good size everything was very clean I booked a superior room and i got upgraded to an executive queen room due hotel wasn t fully book and that types of details from part of the staff are really nice i would go back to this hotel for sure
21263,Novotel London Tower Bridge, Coffee machine in room not working but when I reported it the staff made me a coffee as there was no time to wait to replace a new machine , Lots of attention to detail great service throughout my stay 
21264,Novotel London Tower Bridge, Only one point when we went down to breakfast in the Keepers restaurant I was expecting some of its own honey that the restaurant was advertising I was even expecting some honey in honeycomb form but all we got was a little pot of Tiptree honey Don t advertise something if it s not on offer , Clean room Very good facilities in the room Bar area nice and relaxing 
21265,Novotel London Tower Bridge, No bad experience , I asked for a room on a high floor with a nice view we got the top floor which looked out onto the Tower of London just perfect Hotel in a good location for walking to the sights 
21266,Novotel London Tower Bridge, The smell of sewage that we experienced in all 3 rooms coming from the bathroom sinks was quite unpleasant The staff were particularly slow at bringing us our drinks in the bar and one didn t arrive at all When prompted ten minutes later a waitress told us that she only dealt with food orders and then it took another attempt to ask that same waitress to find a bar staff member to get it as none were around , The location quality of facilities value of room and relatively decent breakfast

21269,Novotel London Tower Bridge, We booked a triple room which was described as having Queen bed sofa in reality instead of sofa there was a tiny seemingly foldable bed It did not look as a triple room Also the third piece of toiletries and a glass were missing were delivered on demand Plastic curtains in the room The bathroom door was not closing properly due to very peculiar design Neither sauna nor hamam were working inquiries at the reception produced no results , Very good location Tower Hill tube station is very close Tower of London and the Tower Bridge are nearby convenient connection to London City Airport Overall service was OK our bags were stored and we were able to borrow the plug adapter 
21270,Novotel London Tower Bridge, Rather small area to make tea and coffee not many tea bags ran out for the morning , The room was spacious and clean Lovely restaurant for evening meal everything you could need 
21271,Novotel London Tower Bridge, Check in was a bit slow 1 person at reception though the hotel was packed I also requested a quiet room since i was recovering from surgery but got a room right next to lifts No view from room facing another building Location would appeal more to business travellers Not so close to and from central , Room bathroom and shower decent size compared to price location and other similar central london hotels Restaurants and shops within walking distance General ambience and feel of hotel especially around Christmas time would appeal to all types of guests travellers Room service and breakfast in room options Staff were pleasant Fenchurch Street tube station right outside hotel Although hotel was very busy it still felt peaceful

21277,Novotel London Tower Bridge, Having to wait 10 minutes in a long queue to be seated for breakfast was a little disappointing The food was good and plentiful and there were lots of efficient staff on hand to help but maybe the restaurant was not big enough to cope with popular eating times , Evening meal in hotel was excellent Room well appointed quiet had everything we needed for a very comfortable stay Close to Underground station which made it easy to get around Central London
