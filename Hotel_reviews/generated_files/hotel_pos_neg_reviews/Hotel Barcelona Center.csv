282520,Hotel Barcelona Center, Condition of the hotel room was completely unacceptable, Please don t stay here felt completely tricked by the pictures online Room was very small much smaller than the hotel Pictures and was not properly sealed Smoke from the other properties lifted into our room all day and all night We emailed the property to inquire why our room was stinking of smoke ongoing no one could even take the time to email me back Did we forget to mention that we were travelling with young child both allergic to ciggrate smoke

282522,Hotel Barcelona Center, The room and lobby were heavily perfumed the bathrooms could use some scrubbing in the corners to get rid of black spots on the grout, Space value and location were excellent
282523,Hotel Barcelona Center, Giving one small beg of coffee natural and one small beg of coffee decaf for 2 guests for 24 hours is ridiculous Even more ridiculous is to argue with the guest that actually the coffee is courtesy of the hotel and therefore whatever the hotel decides to give is fine ,No Positive

282527,Hotel Barcelona Center, Breakfast package Scrambled eggs were salty and greasy It was pretty much the same for all the other cooked dishes Only good thing is fresh OJ to cut the grease Get breakfast elsewhere Location is great but noisy If your room faces the street you will hear traffic noise So if you get a room where the thermostat to control heat or cooling does not work and you open the glass door for some air be prepared for traffic noise and smell of car exhaust If you get a room along small atrium it is quiet but stuffy for 2 people occupancy , Staff was very accommodating Location is in walking distance to many local sites such as Casa Batllo Casa Milla restaurants shops Las Ramblas and public transportation 
282528,Hotel Barcelona Center, I found some of the staff at reception a bit dull and sour faced to start On Arrival guests should be greeted with a smile this sets the scene for the rest of the stay There is a gloomy atmosphere in the hotel and management should take note The shower was in a dark corner of the bathroom no lights on that area and difficult to tell whether you are washing your hair with shAmpoo or body wash , Hotel interior and room very nice Bed comfortable and everything seemed to work well 
282529,Hotel Barcelona Center, the recpetion is lightly manned one would expect that a 4 star has more than two often only one people manning the desk especially in the morning with check in out going on, they sent in a maid to make our twin beds into a massive double bed she was AMAZING did it in less than 5 minutes The room was facing inside a very small yard not a great view but this made it perfectly silent

282548,Hotel Barcelona Center, Everything was poor Very uncomfortable beds They gave us a room with one bed when we checked in but we were a family of three Our teenager daughter was with us the purpose of this trip to celebrate her birthday I had to fight on a different room That was a bad start for us ,No Positive

282552,Hotel Barcelona Center, Coffee from machine in breakfast room was pretty dire although there were sachets of tea and decaffinated coffee available , Beds very comfortable and bedrooms quiet and clean although windows quite small and therefore rooms are dark Excellent reception and portering staff who were helpful and very informative about local transport and attractions etc Hotel is in a good location with excellent restaurants and bars within 5 mins walk Roof top bar with jacuzzi and sun beds is a wonderful addition to the hotel and was very quiet during our stay 
282553,Hotel Barcelona Center, That you would have to pay for extra tea and coffee in your room They only provide one complementary serving per person , The staff couldn t be more helpful They were very kind to us helping us with every wish need 
282554,Hotel Barcelona Center, The cleaning of the rooms was problematic We were away from the room until 16 00 and the room was not cleaned until then and after they would clean around 17 00 so if you were at the room at the time you would miss the cleaning service for a day If they did clean always forgot to add the paper and the amenities The Indian receptionist was not friendly at all at the limit of being rude , Great location firm nice beds 
282555,Hotel Barcelona Center, nothing to be mentioned, very nice room and comfortable beds room was very clean bathroom fantastic the location is very close by the center of BCN on foot and metro was close by also also a very quiet room

282560,Hotel Barcelona Center, The location of the breakfast room is below street level therefore no daylight I found the breakfast poor for my taste and did only go once , Location is excellent the room was clean and the staff friendly It was my second stay at this hotel and I recommend 
282561,Hotel Barcelona Center, A bit further to the nearest metro than some other city centre locations but a short walk in Barcelona is generally a nice thing to do anyway , Good location in centre of the city helpful staff esp the doorman who got the taxi s for us clean and quiet room and a decent breakfast too 
282562,Hotel Barcelona Center, The shower No shower curtain water splashing outside the tub area A box of Kleenex in the room would be much appreciated instead of a few sheets in the small package , The location the hotel restaurant and the friendly waiter 
282563,Hotel Barcelona Center, The room was lovely but the mattress on the bed could of been a bit more comfortable, Location you could walk everywhere the room was lovely and big and the staff were very helpful They looked up a lovely restaurant for us on the Saturday night and booked it of us and they gave us an adapter plug because we did not have one to charge our phone They also gave us lots of chocolates with our coffees which was nice 
282564,Hotel Barcelona Center, The room was too small really for three of us An extra bed had just been wheeled into a double room for our 13 year old son The extra bed actually blocked one of the wardrobes and the window so it was a bit awkward moving around Furthermore it was unbearably hot in the room at night although only in April There was air con but it didn t work We couldn t open the window because of the noise of traffic outside so difficult to sleep Receptionist quite indifferent to our comment on how hot the room was We opted for half board and the food was good but we were offered quite a limited menu which would have been fine for about three nights but not for six Coffee not good from a machine and not at all fresh tasting , The breakfast buffet was excellent with a very good choice of food The room was spotless Food in the restaurant was good and with very large portions Good central location

282567,Hotel Barcelona Center, Room a bit tired holes in curtains and blackout blind also curtains don t close properly not nice when a light just outside the window Two people staying in the room but only one robe and slippers provided would have been better to have had none Espresso pods were not replaced after use even though it was requested , Good location nice staff and good breakfast Very amenable to late checkout 
282568,Hotel Barcelona Center, The reception desk staff were all disinterested and not helpful at all They really made us feel a nuisance if we asked the simplest of questions Snotty is the word for their attitude , Comfortable bed and great bathroom facilities 
282569,Hotel Barcelona Center, We visited in February but it was not too cold The hotel only had the heater on in the winter I called to confirm that but the room gets pretty warm during the day and we did not need heating at all It was not possible to have fans without heating or cooling AC We had to open the window to let some cool air in but the street was very noisy The room got stuffy and too warm without AC or an open window We kept the window close for the night but had to get up and open it a couple of times during the night to cool down the room I suppose it d have been perfect in the summer when only the cooling AC is on , The hotel s interior design is nice and the staff is friendly Very clean and great location for the price Their buffet breakfast was wonderful though a bit pricey We visited with our parents and we all liked the hotel a lot except for the stupid AC system 
282570,Hotel Barcelona Center, this is my second time staying and I am not sure why almost everything was not as good as the first time Wifi very poor there is a new notice underground like that I didn t notice the first time The hotel insisted that I pay all 5 days in full when I arrived The most surprising thing was the bed have become uncomfortable, I like the location and I like the fact that I was given an early check in
282571,Hotel Barcelona Center, asking for the payment to be in advance the guest is just arriving from a tiring trip although it was secured by the credit card , the location cleanness 
282572,Hotel Barcelona Center, The bed in my room made some horrible sounds when you sit or sleep on it So I balanced the bed out with guide books from the room Hope someone finds them Are hottubs meant to be cold or hot , I like the idea of a walk in wardrobe huge space 
282573,Hotel Barcelona Center, Breakfast was the same everyday and very basic Some of the facilities were not available like heater in the rooftop sitting area , Location was perfect Staff is chearful and very helpful in promoting the attractions 
282574,Hotel Barcelona Center, The room was incredibly hot no air conditioning To have a bit of fresh air we had to keep door and window open We asked the staff for another room but we didn t get one The room was full of dust and the tiles of the bathroom were dirty black At breakfast the personnel was absolutely unkind and annoying They were rushing continuously to have the tables free On a Sunday we have witnessed the scene of a waiter insisting on a client to leave immediately the breakfast room because it was 11 05 and way beyond the breakfast time 11 00 All this for 220 eur a night Beware , Nothing
282575,Hotel Barcelona Center, Before arriving in Barcelona the hotel tried to charge us 100 euro for a taxi from the airport to the hotel After researching prices it turned out that a taxi should only cost in the region of 30 euro so this was disappointing from the hotel in terms of honesty and customer value , Very clean hotel Excellent location Staff were very helpful and friendly 
282576,Hotel Barcelona Center,No Negative, THE ROOM HAD A WOODEN FLOOR AND WAS FANTASTIC A BOTTLE OF WATER AND FRUIT WERE OFFERED TO US AS WE ARRIVED ALL AROUND THE HOTEL THERE ARE VERY NICE TAPAS BARS AND RESTAURANTS

282579,Hotel Barcelona Center,No Negative, Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful It was my boyfriends birthday whilst we were there and they bought us a bottle of champagne up to our room totally unexpected and a really nice touch 
282580,Hotel Barcelona Center, Hotel is about 7 mins to got from main shopping street However at the location there are no other facilities as restaurants food markets or pubs etc to stay next to the hotel If for some reason you got to the hotel during the day you have to spend 7 mins again, Friendly and open staff
282581,Hotel Barcelona Center, The bed in our room was a bit on the hard side and creaked Tea and coffee facilities in the room would have been nice , The hotel was close to the metro and easy walking distance of the centre of Barcelona restaurants and attractions A friendly and welcoming team made our stay easy the room was cleaned daily to a high standard and the roof terrace was the icing on the cake 
282582,Hotel Barcelona Center, Bathroom had not been cleaned and still had a tub of paint and tools lying in it At the end of the stay we had someone else s bar bill charged to our room , Roof top hot tubs and design of room
282583,Hotel Barcelona Center, The jacuzi at top of terrace are of no use since the water is always cold in them Breakfast was poor except for the scrambled eggs very fresh and tasty Other breakfast such as pastries were not fresh coffee machine doesnt give good coffee , Very clean nice rooms not too small big walk in closet was great Very nice and clean lobby nice terrace
282584,Hotel Barcelona Center, Nescaf machine as the only possibility to have a coffee for breakfast really hard mattress necessity to ask for towels at the main reception when going to 7th floor jacuzzi area poor level of English at the reception hard to explain them what we want,No Positive
282585,Hotel Barcelona Center, Our rooms did not have coffee or Tea facilities but did not raise with hotel staff Too busy trying out all the local bars and cafes , Lovely helpful staff So much choice for food and drink Foodie heaven 
282586,Hotel Barcelona Center, The roof top bar was very expensive and poor service There was a lot of pigeons in the hot tubes, Very helpful staff and excellent English our flight was at 9 at night and they had no problem keeping our suitcases for the day 
282587,Hotel Barcelona Center, There was no wifi signal in our room The room was very dim and dark The jacuzzis on the rooftop don t open at night , The location is central and perfect Staff were very good Room service was great 
282588,Hotel Barcelona Center, I really did not like to get deduced a tourist tax out of the fixed prize It is much better to include it in the prize and do not say anything at all It was disgusting like being called an unwelcomed guest and gives the hotel and the city a minus , The location and facilities in the hotel are superb 
282589,Hotel Barcelona Center, No major gripes at all The Bar Staff could occasionally come across a bit surly mainly when we were after some tea we are British after all But I think this may have been more due to a little bit of a language barrier and also in comparison to the reception staff who couldn t have been more helpful and seemed fluent in every language that was thrown at them One thing to be made aware of which is good to know because we didn t is that tickets for places like Parc G ell and the Sagrada Familia are based on entrance windows rather than just queuing up to eventually get in Not knowing this beforehand created instances where we d arrive at say 11 00 to be told that the next available entrance time would be 13 30 Which left us with an awkward wait time that didn t give us enough time to go somewhere else and to get back but was also a little bit too long to just kill by mooching about there are only so many times you can look at bar a themed fridge magnets Whilst we made the best of it with a little picnic and enjoyed the relax it s the kind of downtime you can t afford if you are trying to see as much as possible in the time you re there Especially if it s happening 2 or 3 times My advice would be to spend your first morning day hopping on and off the open top bus booking your tickets day s in advance for the time slots you desire and then you ve got better structure to your trip and can plan accordingly This was our first city holiday together so we ve certainly learned from it If you re a veteran this is probably old news , The staff here were amazing A particular mention to Xavier but ALL reception staff were polite and always did everything to help regardless of the time of day Location is great only a short walk one block to either the open top bus tours stop or Metro station We used the metro to get to and from La Ramblas and the beach and the tour bus to get to Parc G ell Nou Camp etc The great thing about the Bus is that the stops are always close to where you want to be and you can pick up little bits of knowledge you wouldn t ordinarily get whilst driving about Can also pick up a nice tan upstairs along with a welcome breeze Word of warning regarding the Metro take a second to orientate yourself when you come out Its easy to take the wrong direction when emerging into the daylight as they are usually on an intersection with 4 directions to go in But the Metro itself is easy to navigate so long as you know what stops you want prior to setting off There are no signs about saying for tourist attraction A alight at station C etc There are also some great little restaurants near the hotel recommend Bar 2254 Fantastic tapas and service And there are also plenty of little bakeries and caf s knocking around the nearby streets where we could pick up breakfast for 10 15 for both of us rather than 15 each in the hotel Also as my girlfriend commented each time we stepped through the main entrance the lobby always smelled wonderful Only a little thing but it certainly makes a difference The rooftop terrace is also nice with space enough to sunbathe and the jacuzzis better name than hot tub not necessarily hot giving welcome relief from the August heat and precious therapy for feet after a day pounding the streets 
282590,Hotel Barcelona Center, Not really that bad a point but know that the location is not in the very center of the city it needs a bus ride or a 15 minute leisurely walk or a cab ride , Large room comfortable bed and pillows helpful staff
282591,Hotel Barcelona Center,No Negative, As this is my second time staying there I obviously like this hotel The staff is always friendly and always smiling During my two week stay my room was kept clean at all times I will be back again next year 
282592,Hotel Barcelona Center,No Negative, Staff are very friendly and we found Belkie the waitress on the terrace to be absolutely amazing and made us feel so welcome as a result we visited the terrace each evening for 5 nights 
282593,Hotel Barcelona Center, MEALS AT THE CAFETERIA WERE TOO SMALL A PORTION FOR THE PRICE PAID AND PRACTICALLY NO VEG WAS PRESENT WITH THE MAIN , THE FRIENDLINESS AND HELPFULESS OF THE STAFF ESPICALLY RECEPTION WHEN I FOUND MYSELF IN NEED OF THEIR HELP
282594,Hotel Barcelona Center, Wish there was a pool on the terrace Although the small hydro pools where fine, Really lovely massive comfy bed
