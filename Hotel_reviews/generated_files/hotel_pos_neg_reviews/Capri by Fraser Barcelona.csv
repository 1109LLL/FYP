439332,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, N A, Had a fantastic stay at the Capri in a very quiet area about a 5 minute walk from the beach and 30 40 minute walk from the from the centre of the city Metro access very easy 5 minute walk if that 
439333,Capri by Fraser Barcelona,No Negative, I had a really big very nice and comfortable room with a big bath room The personal was very helpful all the time The metro station is in the near so I could reach everything easy The sea is in 10 minutes walking 
439334,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Nothing, Good location metro station a 5 minute walk 3 stops from centre 15 20 minute walk from marina beach Clean comfortable rooms suitable for families Excellent shower Kitchen cooking equipment clean perfect for breakfasts snacks Would recommend would use again 
439335,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Only downside is no late check out on rooms so no where to shower if you have a late departure pick up, We stayed here for a 4 night break with our grandchildren Rooms are very very comfortable clean and Tidy with loads of space beds were also very comfortable so we slept well We all had breakfasts for 3 mornings during our stay a very wide selection of food on offer All the staff were very polite and helpful 
439336,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The pillow , Good breakfast excellent espresso Friendly staff cleanliness Quiet zone not far from the beach and attractions Very good hotel for families with childrens Definitely next time I will stay at the same hotel 
439337,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Actually I cannot even remember what I didn t like because the hotel was so great I would say that some of the staff reception could have been nicer but except for that 10 10 , I loved the fact that it was near la big beach of Barcelone where the clubs are too the hotel in itself has everything you could need I stayed in a flat hotel and if I go to Barcelona anytime or if there s a Capri by Fraser somewhere else in the world I would probably book it again 
439338,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, I think the only downsides to the Capri are the slightly too thin walls and it s location great for the beach a touch to far from the centre , The staff were very friendly the food was good and my room was perfect I moved on to another hotel the next evening paid a little more but got no where near to decor of the Capri 
439339,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The resteraunt wouldn t serve food but the menu in the room said it would I wasn t allowed to use a room to quickly shower in after check out after sitting in the solarium all day and anywhere else I ve stayed in the world offers that They also charged me the tax 4 times when there was only 3 of us staying It was out of the way I would stay in central next time as there wasn t much around , The beds were comfy and the reception staff were generally helpful 
439340,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Could have had more tea coffee milk and sugar but wasnt a problem as just asked for more The corridors were a little smelly but the rooms were fine, The room was of a great size and a large en suite bathroom very comfortable will definately use again
439341,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Not really any criticism of the Capri The bathroom was en suite to bedroom which meant those sleeping in lounge needed to go through bedroom for access to toilet , Staff very pleasant Room immaculate Hotel 15 mins from beach and short taxi journey to usual attractions e g Sagrada Familia Camp Nou 20 mins in taxi from airport 
439342,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Check in seemed to take a while to organise especially at the late time we arrived to the hotel , The rooms were spacious and well presented allowing for an enjoyable and comfortable stay The hotel was also in a close location to the nearest metro stop allowing us to be able to travel into the centre of Barcelona easily 
439343,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, A little bit far to go to the beach by walking, The front desk very helpful It is not far from the metro station and really close to the park There is a balcony with chairs at the top of the hotel where you can hangout 
439344,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, It s not really a negative We had a few days we wanted to enjoy at the seaside If you don t mind walking the distance from the hotel to the beach will take you 20 25 minutes it s an easy walk if you re not in a hurry Otherwise better order taxi it will cost no more than 10 euros max , We were four of us with two kids 7 and 11 y o A hotel has a nice double room which is spacious with a huge bathroom shower a small kitchen and round dining table Very stylish new and clean Hotel staff is friendly and helpful Price quality ratio is superb to my liking 
439345,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Varity of the breakfast was not satisfactory everyday the same things served Look and taste of the scrambled eggs was bad Cleaning services did not refilled the cosmetics and we run out of the gel, Very nice and helpful staff Metro station was nearby Good Wi Fi coverage and quality of the service
439346,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Value for money the hotel is nice but for the price you can find a really nice hotel in a similar neighborhood Breakfast buffet was OK nothing spectacular for the price , Hotel is well located near to villa Olympic 15 min wall where you can find plenty of restaurants and more Neighborhood pretty quiet during the day and secure to walk around
439347,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Maybe a hello from the reception when going out coming in I did not hear one word after checkin They were not that busy every time we passed , The area around was not so nice but just 15 min down to the beach and all you need Bogatell and Marina metro in short walking distance 3 minutes to tramstation which will take you to Diagonal Mar shopping for example or down to Villa Olimpic The room was so nice comfy beds big soft towels very clean and good standard overall The rooftop with two showers was so nice and needed after some sightseeing in the heat Also tried roomservice great food Will definetly try another hotel from this chain in the next city Im going to if they have it 
439348,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Bed arrangement for our family two adults two teens was one king twins pushed together which was comfortable and a double pull out bed Not the best bed ever but for a pull out sofa bed actually decent Breakfast at the hotel was close to 15 euros per person no way we were paying 60 euros for our family for breakfast Seemed steep , Very clean and new feeling We had family apartment which had two rooms which included small table mini frig etc Bathroom was very nice with an awesome shower and plenty of counter space for four people Staff was helpful and friendly We walked everywhere from this hotel but just because we were willing and not because things were necessarily close The location was safe and quiet 
439349,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Staff unable to accommodate requests advertised laundry but machines broken throughout stay mold throughout bathroom no pool was painful, Quiet location modern bathroom fast wifi
439350,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Breakfast overprized needs more diversity Kettle in room dif not turn off automatically Dishes not washed by room service One kitchen cabinet door almost falling off , Laundry facilities Refrigerator in room Plenty of seating in room Shampoo and soaps provided are good quality products 
439351,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Breakfast was expensive but very good My only complaint really was that it was impossible to shower without water spilling all over the bathroom floor This seems to be typical in western northern europe from my experience , Rooms were great beds were nice Would have like nicer area immediately surrounding but lots of nice areas a 10 minute walk away Staff was friendly and helpful Appreciated free laundry but it took longer than the machinces said so difficult to plan for that 
439352,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, I liked everything, Just loved this hotel bright and cheerful with great air con which was a relief as it was 37 degrees outside Our room was decorated to a high standard and surrounded along two walls with windows that all opened and full length curtains there was a sofa kitchen area with tea coffee and a kettle sink a fridge freezer and a lovely bathroom In the shower there were 3 dispensers on the wall with rum body wash peppermint shampoo and peppermint conditioner and everything was spotless The breakfast was great loads of choice including bacon beans sausages tomatoes The hotel was so safe you had to access it with your room card and the lifts also would only operate with your room card 
439353,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, There was a faint sewage smell in the bathroom which went away after using the shower Surrounding area is not particularly lively , Lovely studio and apartment hotel with large rooms and great toiletries Breakfast was limited in options but tasty and filling Reasonably close to the beach and some of the main attractions of Barcelona 10 20min walking Metro station 5 minutes away 
439354,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Considering how far out of town it is it s a little over priced , Staff were friendly room was spacious and clean Location is in a quiet area though is about a 30min walk to the Las Rambas etc if you don t want to walk you can catch the metro in 3 stops I think to the centre Front door is locked and can be opened with your room key so building is secure 
439355,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, We lost some valuables in the room We weren t able to recover, gym laundry and the soap shampoo dispensers Front desk was also helpful on where to go and way finding
439356,Capri by Fraser Barcelona,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful The hotel was pristine and modern Working toaster kettle microwave fridge and hob Internet was fast and great signal Metro is a few minutes walk from the hotel The cleaning staff accidentally smashed a bottle of expensive make up and when I went down to reception the staff had been honest and reported it They had the brand and type of make up printed out from the cosmetic brand s website and the price They apologised profusely accidents happen and refunded the cost of the make up onto my card 
439357,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, No lock on the bathroom door and no door in the shower so floor was very wet and slippery after each shower , Tram buses and metro all very close by About 25 minute walk to Sagrada Familia Free gym and laundry room downstairs are a nice bonus 
439358,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The view from room was really bad We looked to some offices through window , Hotel is OK You can stay at the property with pleasure It s 2 3 metro stop from city center 
439359,Capri by Fraser Barcelona,No Negative, very modern spacious room with a comfortable bed and a great bathroom the hot buffet breakfast was nice but could have been hotter we would stay again all staff very friendly
439360,Capri by Fraser Barcelona,No Negative, The location was excellent close to the subway and walking distance if you like walking to Gothic quarter beach area and plaza Catalunya The laundry facilities on site are such a convenience and the breakfast was delicious and just the right amount This was a great hotel and we would definitely stay here again 
439361,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The bed was not so comfortable in particular the pillows , The hotel was spotlessly clean and in perfect order the room size was comfortable and the breakfast had a good range of options
439362,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Location is slightly out of town If you are looking for a hotel in the centre of the tourist area this is not for you If you don t mind a short walk then this place is well located for bus tram and metro , Good sized rooms with excellent facilities Bathroom had a large walk in shower with plenty of complimentary toiletries and hairdryer 
439363,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Unfortunately no food was available during night but if you are organised you have nice kitchen to prepare , Apartments were clean well designed and fit for purpose especially if you are travelling as group would be perfect place to stay Staff were helpful and were there 24 hours Facilities were good nice and new Transport was close by easy access to city 10 to 15 minutes walk to Beach
439364,Capri by Fraser Barcelona,No Negative, The room had clean hard wood floors instead of carpet which I loved The room was a one bedroom with enough space for my 7 month old to crawl around spacious bathroom with bathtub Very good and healthy breakfast and staff was extremely helpful
439365,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Though the bath rooms were very big in size the bathing area was bit uncomfortable as the water tends to move out , The Bed was very comfortable The utensils provided were adequate and as per the requirement The children bed sofa cum bed was very comfortable 
439366,Capri by Fraser Barcelona,No Negative, Great stay clean rooms and spacious Staff was extremely friendly and courteous which was very helpful when you are traveling alone for work Kitchen was an added bonus Keep up the great work 
439367,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, the place was little bit far from the tourist spots not so many restaurants around the hotel , It was my parents first time on Spain they really enjoyed the hotel it has good breakfast with sufficient amenities helpful staff 
439368,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, We had a room in the corner of the building so was a lot smaller than shown on the pictures , Location is good close by subway station Marina not in city centre so very quiet Deluxe studio was great comfortable bed nice bathroom 
439369,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Not very clean hair on the bathroom floor mirror dirty Lack of lighting in the living room , Qiet location Walking distance from most sites Staff very helpful and friendly Good apartment size Apartment was ready early 
439370,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, That there were only two washing machines and dryers for such a large place so it took about 3 hours to do 2 loads of laundry because we had to wait The beds were also a bit hard for our comfort but very clean, The staff was excellent very helpful with directions and arranging tickets for attractions Although it was not centrally located the metro was nearby and easy to get around There were lots of places to eat The room had everything we needed and the maid service and cleanliness were excellent 
439371,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Bathroom and kitchenette required some cosmetic repairs, Nice staff at the reception and restaurant walking distance to the city center good breakfast
439372,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The only thing that could have been better would be free breakfast The quality and selection of their breakfast buffet is great but it would be nice if it was free , We chose Capri by Fraser based on the reviews I am so happy we stayed here for our 4 day trip to Barcelona The staff was awesome Our first night there we ate at the hotel and my girls 1 and 4 years old where tired and cranky The manager came up and was playing with them and even brought them a little stuffed lamb which is the Capri mascot It was such a relief for my husband and I We had been up since 3am and where tired and cranky too lol The staff also arranged an airport shuttle for us When we arrived to the airport the driver was holding a sign with my name on it and I felt like a rock star He even had a car seat for my little one This is a quite location and away from the city life of Barcelona It was a nice 15 minute walk to the beach and there is lots of public transportation near by We did take the metro and taxis everyday so we could see the sights but that s because we have two kids If it was just my husband and I we would ve been able to walk to just about everything we wanted to see It is only a few blocks for La Sagrada Familia I would highly recommend Capri by Fraser and their airport shuttle service to everyone We plan on coming back soon 
439373,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Cushions on the sofa, Great location right in between Sagrada Familia and Port Olympic 10 minutes walk from the Truimpf Arch Feee laundry is great Water and tea coffee in the room were very handy
439374,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, I did not like the location of the hotel , nice hotel overall clean very helpful and polite personnel If this hotel was located in a different area I would have definatly select this hotel in my next visit to Barcelona
439375,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, It was much further to the Marina then advertised about 15 20min walk and very far from Barcelona centre 50min walk or you can get the metro , Room was of a good standard and clean There was a uk outlet within the room which was useful Bathroom was a good size Breakfast was good although expensive at 14 50e pp Also you re able to keep your bags in a luggage room once you ve checked out and the staff will book you taxi s
439376,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The pillows could have been better, Modern clean apartment The only negative we found were the pillows Could be replaced with softer and regular sized ones The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from the metro and a 15 20 minute walk down to the port and about the same again to Sagrada Famillia Reception staff friendly and helpful Very quiet at night Overall we would stay there again
439377,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Breakfast area was small Even though I slept in a sofa bed and knowing all the problems that comes with it It was actually one of the worst I have slept in There was some areas where the mattress sink due to no support Their preferred communication through email still I sent them one in the previous day to my flight asking for some information and never got a reply , Despite being already well located close to several attractions 20min walk the hotel is near two metro stations which makes it easy to move around the city It is also located near a shopping mall enough for everyone needs The apartment was well equipped the wireless internet was very good and the surrounding area was very quiet Breakfast was very good 
439378,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The bed dipped badly in the middle and wasn t as comfy as we d have liked, You had everything you needed in the room The shower was excellent and the toiletries provided were really nice
439379,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Everything was fine , The breakfasts are good the room was quiet which was important for me when I was booking the hotel The room was very clean and nice looking Three minutes walk from two metro stations 
439380,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, nothing, From the moment we arrived the staff was extremely helpful Overall my stay was great in this property they arrange everything for me tours taxi etc Thanks guys for your Awesome services and make me and my family very happy and gave me feeling that I am with my family Thanks for all staff as well I would definitely recommend this hotel and I would like to thank all the staff for their kindness and hospitality
439381,Capri by Fraser Barcelona,No Negative, Just back from 5 fantastic nights here The Capri is defo a hidden gem and would recommend it to everyone The rooms were bright and spacious and always clean The staff at the hotel were very helpful and always friendly We were there over the Sant Jordi weekend and had a lovely rose and bottle of bubbly left in the room for us The location is excellent and the marina metro stop is about 3 mins walk away There are a good selection of cafes within the area and also a couple of supermarkets very close We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will defo recommend it to everyone and hopefully be back there soon 
439382,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, No insect net for the large windows Noisy ceiling panels when you open the bathroom door Next to no ventilation in the bathroom A toilet brush would have been nice but I didn t miss it and they must have left it out to keep the maintenance costs down , The best time to realise that you didn t bring your UK plug adapter is when you find a UK power socket in your room All in all I wouldn t mind booking this again The reception were helpful and the room was as clean as one could reasonably expect It wasn t far from the Marina underground station with a direct link to the more interesting parts of the city It is within walking distance to Arc de Triomf and Parc de la Ciutadella The breakfast buffet English and continental had more than enough variety for the time we stayed there 
439383,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, No quite in early hours BIG Night Club very near very noisy when club closes , rooms were ok unfortunately pictures on booking com makes rooms look much bigger
439384,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The room service food isn t great We wouldn t normally get room service but due to the late arrival time the kids were hungry so resorted to ordering from the restaurant downstairs It served the purpose but it was cold so not great Didn t put me off the place though It s a great place to stay, Served our needs perfectly With two young kids it was spacious and clean The bathrooms were big Perfect for travelling with kids It s handy to the metro for travelling around the place
439385,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, We arrived at the airport around 5 we had a private hire booked But because of traffic it took us well over an hour to do a 20 minute journey , The staff were friendly and helpfull The room was a good size with a very large comfortable bed The bathroom was very good excelent shower and great towels 
439386,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The bed sofa was not the most comfy but still ok , Clean and modern rooms Silent Really good breakfast 10 15 minutes walk to the beach and Gothic area 
439387,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, location could be more central it s a bit into the non touristic residential area although good access to the tube , staff is professional and friendly good spacious room
439388,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Not a central area of Barcelona and no sun on roof top terrace in afternoon evening, Comfy beds spacious room and bathroom daily cleaning tidying Staff helpful Nearby Metro and some good restaurants 20 mins walk to Sagrada Familia or beach
439389,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Unfortunately if you are there for a while over a week there was only three drawers and a small wardrobe space to put clothes in take hangers if u can but we were there only for a few days so didn t matter to us If you are going to mount tibadabo just pay to go up the finicular dont get park tickets until u have seen what rides there are if there is just adults then u wont want to go in the park you can still go in the church that is up there without a park ticket , 5 minutes walk to the Marina metro stop Then from there it is very easy to get about Airport is about 45 50 mins away via metro 20 mins to the beach walking Senora sports bar round the corner was good for food and beer The room was clean shower was good We didn t go in the restaurant or bar so cant tell you what that was like
439390,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Everything was good except for the breakfast spread which was average Not worth the money You have better options outside for the same money , The property is very good we stayed for 4 nights with younger kids and enjoyed the stay The rooms were properly cleaned everyday 
439391,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, staff on the front desk were unfriendly and unhelpful especially two of them location was awful it was just next to the funerial office of barcelona and every morning we saw some people in grif,No Positive
439392,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Expensive breakfast , Large room perfect for families Comfortable bads clean and quiet room with all facilities you need Close to metro station Marina 
439393,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, They served the same brrakfast every day and it wasnt great , The locations was withing walking distance to La Sagrada Familia The metro station Marina was neaby The staff was excelent they helped me take the breakfast in the room The internet conection was great and the room was spacious 
439394,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Very unfriendly and arrogant behaviour of staff during check in Staff especially the hotel manager arrogantly escalated a small problem that could be solved in a friendly way and after check in Definitely unprofessional attitude to the guests The rooms are nice and clean but unfortunately due to poor sewage system infested with a strong bad smell On request the room was without any problems replaced but the strong odour of sewerage was also there According to the staff approach to this this problem the hotel knows about the sewer smell For this reason the price does not correspond to quality of the accommodation , Very nice design comfortable and clean rooms good location near the centre of Barcelona and 15 20 min by walking from the beach
439395,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The staff were nice enough but as we were a large group did get flustered at check in Also when we ordered taxis from reception the drivers always came in and spoke in Spanish quietly to the people on reception and we re always 5 to 10 more expensive than when we got our own taxI , The hotel was very comfortable and clean Close to everything we needed and in quiet location 
439396,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, I was given a 1 bedroom flat in the ground floor with no view Safety box wasn t working , Friendly staff Good location 5 minutes walk from underground station Marina on L1 which 3 stations away from Catalunya station Clean rooms comfy beds well equipped kitchen Good WiFi speed
439397,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Even though I thought it was comfortable when lying on it awake I hardly slept on the sofa bed Apparently the other bed was comfy though, It was so clean and the rooms were really spacious I loved the interior design
439398,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Since there is no place in the neighborhood to eat after 22 00 and in the hotel no bar restaurant nor room service after 23 00 I think a vending machine would work Also a remark to the cleaning staff if the towels are not to be changed please don t relocate them we need to know which one is who s Finally there is something like a communal funeral service of Barcelona very close by one block away if someone gets frustrated around these things they should avoid the particular route of the main entrance and enter the hotel the other way , Very comfortable and very fashionable interior spacious bathroom nice to have kitchenette 
439399,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, There is nothing what I didnt like , We had 2xstudio and both were great Wonderful location you can walk 15min to Sagrada 20min to beach 10min to estacio del nord We almost didnt use public transport only to Camp Nou Closest metro station is Marina which is red line 3min walking Receptionist was very helpful he showed us map told where we should go where are metro stations 
439400,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The room smelt slightly of smoke and we are non smokers and there was a very small blood stain on the duvet cover, The bed was comfy and clean and the staff were fabulous It was my son birthday while we were then and they gave him a card and some chocolates
439401,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Area does not have too many restaurant shops etc although it s within walking distance to a lot of them so it s a menial problem, The apartment itself was clean and quiet Very helpful staff Well equipped venue
439402,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Nothing we can think of , We loved everything about the apartment so beautifully decorated spacious comfortable bed being able to do our own thing re breakfast with kettle toaster fridge etc lovely to come back to after a tiring sight seeing day We ll be back 
439403,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, All was good did not have breakfast thought 15 euro was a little expensive so can t comment on breakfast , staff were very helpful restraunts they advised on were very good delivered bottle of cava to our room as it was my partners birthday very nice gesture really nice apart hotel rooms cleaned everyday fresh towels everyday very clean hotel beds were very comfortable 
439404,Capri by Fraser Barcelona,No Negative, The rooms are spacious and well done up The staff is courteous but unfriendly and non accomodative Overall good hotel just have to be very very careful with every staff member and every penny you pay 
439405,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, We sadly got pick pocketed by the funeral home just at the corner REMEMBER DO NOT let anyone on the street give you ANYTHING They gave my kids flowers and I NEVER saw them take my money my wallet was in my hand I was so stupid , The room is large and really quiet There is a well equipped kitchenette The staff is helpful and the breakfast is great The metro is not exactly around the corner but a 6 10 min walk 
439406,Capri by Fraser Barcelona,No Negative, Good sized room I travelled with husband and two children and there was plenty of space Brilliant kitchen facilities everything you could need Very clean hotel Room cleaned every day and fresh towels provided daily

439408,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Monotonous breakfasts , The cleanest hotel I ve ever been to Friendly staff that was very helpful Spacious room with a comfortable bed Close to the city centre 
439409,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Nothing at all This is a great property , Every aspect of the property was top notch The location was great for our business meeting but for leisure guests the property is within easy walking distance of the Olympic Port and Gothic Quarter for sightseeing Room was spacious really comfortable and stylish There was a great choice for breakfast

439412,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The bath has been a bit worn , The hotel has met all of our expectations Perfect for families also with baby Very friendly staff excellent kitchen facility in the room perfect location Good value for money And not to forget the breakfast Fresh tasty good coffee very friendly staff good start of the day Also the hotel offered the laundry for free has been an extra for us We fully recommend this hotel 
439413,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The ventilation heating system in the room was quite noisy during the whole night The hotel doesn t provide things you would expect in a 4 star hotel for example slippers or basic need things , The hotel is very central you can reach most of the sightseeings within 15 Minutes by foot The rooms are spacious and very clean The staff is friendly and helpful We enjoyed our stay very much
439414,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The location could potentially be an issue it suited us perfectly however if unsure both the beach front and Sagrada Familia are less than 15 min stroll away , Highly recommended we got a great price on booking com too Staff above and beyond gym and laundry facilities and excellent bonus 
439415,Capri by Fraser Barcelona,No Negative, Staff unfriendly during night shift Poor breakfast Cold dishes which supposed to be hot 0 5h before breakfast finish tables not cleaned Staff located us in a stincky room even they knew that draining system in the bathroom is damaged Not nice at all We needed to ask for change of the room which we got but why they wanted to cheat on us Very bad feelings Hotel was nice few years ago but now it is only looking good on pictures and pretends to be fancy Loundry is free and it was only nice thing in a hotel worth more than 100 eur for a night Never will come back and do not recommend at all 
439416,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, It s near a mortuary on the block before The bed is not very comfy , The convenience of having the washing machine and dryer is a very nice communal area
439417,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Hair dryer wasn t very powerful it could do with some replacement Otherwise no complaint at all , Lovely break in Barcelona It was 4 of us in apartment and it was perfect Room was cleaned every day which was really good touch as we didn t expect it Everything you need for shower after shower was there and it was good quality products I have requested less noisy room and got apartment on the top floor as I m very light sleeper Gym was very good too Kitchen utensils was good Few minutes walk from metro made it everything so much easier hola bcn card is the best way to move on the metro easy to understand including airport 15 min walk from beach and Sagrada Familia very good place to come back thank you

439423,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, We had a bit of trouble with the air conditioning could not manage to turn up the heating in the room and with the shower the hot water would sometimes alternate with the very cold for a few seconds For the rest a perfect stay , Capri by Fraser is modern and very tastefully decorated The location is good close to the Metro but the beach is not exactly close by if you are walking The studio was impeccable have never seen such high quality toiletries by the way and the staff extremely friendly The breakfast overpriced in my view but the variety of options compensated for the fee I m very happy we stayed there Barcelona is gorgeous Would return in the future if given the opportunity 
439424,Capri by Fraser Barcelona,No Negative, We loved this place nice and close to everything very clean and an added bonus of onsite laundry facilities The staff were very helpful and exceptionally enthusiastic sharing insights into Catalan culture Staying here simply made our stay that much more enjoyable

439431,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The breakfast was very overpriced for what it was and the hot food was cold Only had breakfast on one day , The room was excellent clean spacious had fridge and microwave 
439432,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, There are no places of interest in walking distance but it wasn t problem for us to use subway, Great place for staying two subway stations are in 5 minute walking distance
439433,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Breakfast is quite expensive but so many nice cafes around its not really needed , Clean Very accommodating Gave us a free travel cot for our 7 month old Great facilities 500m from Minara metro station most landmarks are 20 30mins walk train ride
439434,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The strong smell of the reception area like Dettol Some staff were not as friendly Also dishes were not washed from the morning, Love the black out curtains the cleanliness and it s within walking distance of train station grocery shop and some shops cafes 
439435,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The beds weren t that comfy and would of been an issue staying more than a few nights , Safe secure building very clean and within a 20 minute walking distance from most places 5 10 taxi fare from Marina Ramblas or Sagrada Familia
439436,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Nothing, Really nice modern hotel with really helpful staff Well located from the beach and centre albeit a 15 20 minute walk Will definitely stay there again 
439437,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Whilst we liked the cleanliness of the hotel the products used to clean were rather strong and the smell hits you as soon as you enter , The staff at the hotel are very friendly and helpful The hotel was very well located nearest metro station is Marina which is only three stops to the centre The rooms are spacious and very clean Would definitely stay at hotel Capri again There s a laundry room situatuated on the lower level of the hotel which is free to use great idea 
439438,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The staff could not fix some issues in the room we had a problem with the safe Cleaning was not so great and we had to request they clean the room twice despite being out of the hotel most of the day They also did not refill the basic things we needed in the room The Telepizza food order service was really in very bad taste and not on par with the hotel vibe and internal food service they could use some internal room food service There is no view of anything from the hotel it is literally staring into adjacent offices from the window Everything great in Barcelona is about a 3km from the hotel which is a plus and minus , Breakfast was pretty good though there is no variety same every morning The room we got was spacious the big 45m room really worth it well designed and very well equipped if you want to cook in the room The staff were extremely friendly and tried to be helpful on every occasion The bed was comfy and very large though it was two joined beds and not a single 
439439,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Late checkout is over priced at 60 euro One time the cleaning lady walked in the room even though we had the sign outside stating do not disturb Luckily we were just having a quiet breakfast in the room The sign keeps flipping between the two sides so she had mistaken it for please clean but she should have knocked first I was holding the door with my hand and saying no don t enter and she kept pushing it There are no computers in the lounge only some tablet stations My husband had some work to do and he couldn t so we walked to an internet cafe instead , Very close to tram metro etc Excellent wifi It was nice to have a microwave in the room too bad it was only that and not an oven Very clean Nice shower The staff surprised us with a little gift for our honeymoon 
439440,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Service was slow and not attentive hassle opening the hotel entrance door in the evenings tv was tiny cafe and food offering was too minimal hard to get a taxi, Nice spacious rooms good furniture clean bathroom modern design comfortable beds and linens quiet area
439441,Capri by Fraser Barcelona,No Negative, Very modern and comfortable apartment hotel Helpful staff Fairly large apartment for family of 4 One good double bed and a sofabed which was ok for the children but would not work for adults Good pentry and plenty of space Quite location and Metro station around the corner 
439442,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Not cute for family but it is just a subjective view , The room was spacy enough for 2 adults and 2 boys It is clean and tidy well Facilities and Hot shower no problem The staffs are OK There are 2 metro stations within 5 min walk No problem to stay here however I felt this hotel was more suitable for business people and I saw many of them there 
439443,Capri by Fraser Barcelona,No Negative, Great apartment extremely clean and spacious in a quiet area Close to metro station but you could walk to most places but a bit of a trek We walked miles

439446,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Only two washing machines and dryers Instructions in English would have been helpful , Modern clean very quiet and close to public transportation Walkable to some popular areas too Large bathroom which is not common in Europe 
439447,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, I don t know about its location since I chose the hotel for its proximity to the port where I was taking a Royal Caribbean cruise the next morning , Spacious room and bathroom Excellent quality of beauty products and well equipped kitchenette Hotel also organised our transfers from the airport then to the port the next day in an efficient way and a good price 
439448,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The mattresses in the beautiful bed were disappointing too stiff , Everything very clean and neat and a good fitness room in the basement Excellent bathroom Close to M station

439451,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, I left my coat in the room by mistake when checking out and when I got back it had gone I know this was my own fault but your staff whilst doing what was required of them indicated that I must have left it somewhere else An acknowledgement that it might be found at a later stage and I would be notified would have made it a nicer experience I am usually very careful but because of this experience I would not return to your hotel nor would I recommend it to anyone in the future,No Positive
439452,Capri by Fraser Barcelona,No Negative, Stayed for five nights Bed was super comfortable Amenities topped up and room cleaned daily Amazing service as well Nice decorations and ambience Walking distance to Marina metro stop Would definitely stay here again

439454,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Just a remark to the cleaning up the client should know in advance that the clean up is made only to 2 p m We have put the sign please tidy up the room in the morning till noon but nobody has come After that our baby was sleeping so do not disturb and after 2 pm is too late And the price of the breakfast is too high , the rooms are perfect for family with children a lot of space The businnes lunch at noon is perfect for people who must stay in the hotel at that time the location is good near the main Marina street and the tramway only 4min to the beach by tram 
439455,Capri by Fraser Barcelona,No Negative, Loved the location the cleanliness the staff the solarium everything overall I we give it a 10 out of 10 We will recommend this to our friends and family if they do go to Barcelona 
439456,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The location was not great No good restaurants within walking distance , Staff were wonderful and helpful Loved the 1 bedroom apt Washer and dryer in basement was included Good Wi Fi Did walk to La Sagrada Familia 20 min Metro about 10 minute walk 
439457,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, unfrendly staff on the reception who gives you the impression that you are not welcome horible smell in the area some times We had a problem with the door couldn get locked and from reception desk told us that we can go because in 5 minutes someone will fix it After a full day we return and our door was still unlocked The second day we remain until someone fix it Lots of funeral shops nearby , Big room modern furniture comfortable bed you can order food in the room 
439458,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The price for the breakfast had been a little bit too expensive for us but I think it s normal for hotels in Barcelona There are definitely other options around , The deluxe apartment had been really big and comfortable for 3 people The little kitchen with everything you need was perfect Nice staff and very clean room And super wifi connection 
439459,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The restaurant is barely a restaurant and the breakfast is exceedingly expensive There isn t much of a lobby or a bar no real place to relax and meet people , The location was good the room had all the necessary facilities The bathroom was large and well equipped
439460,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, At breakfast each day same food , Hotel is located in a quiet zone it s nearby Sagrada 1km away and nearby to metro station and tram station Is a clean hotel everything was very good
439461,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The breakfast is very expensive Luckily the hotel tipped us some info on a bakery nearby where you can sit down for coffee and freshly baked pastries , Great room Bed very comfy Like the kitchenette and the free washing machine with detergent provided 
439462,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, There was flies in the room there was something like bugs that caused allergy to the three of us soap were not L Octaine as it was written on booking com , Staff were helpful location was excellent quite clean neibourhood with a supermarket and few restaurants around close to conventional center 20 minutes by tram easily accessible by tram underground Taxi stop was two buildings away 
439463,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The only downside is that it s a bit far of everything and not in a best district , The rooms were spacious and clean lots of space Also it has a kitchenette which was very convenient for us as we could cook or heat something Good bathroom with nice toiletries The service was fine too No complaints 
439464,Capri by Fraser Barcelona,No Negative, design of room was perfect but there is a smell at room which is bad Hotel need to solve this problem not so close to city centre from La Rambla it costs 8 10 euro by taxi if you traveling 2 3 people it is not a big value by walking 15 20 minutes to La sagrada familia Breakfast was perfect but extra I wish I could have this breakfast included in room price that i pay 
439465,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Nothing oh sorry the sausages at breakfast not sure what they are made off lol, Locality modern facilities were all spot on and the staff were accommodating We were able to check in early and when checking out we left our luggage in a secure room which allowed us to experience another day in a great city 
439466,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The smell at lobby is really strong and makes us headache It is probably the air freshener The breakfast is expensive , Have everything in the apartment We can cook The furniture and interior design are modern which we like very much Room is clean and tidy 
439467,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The towels weren t too white and not of a good quality cotton as it wasn t thick and didn t smell good, Staff was extremely helpful Booked trips for us and gave us very good direction Very Comfortable rooms very clean sheets and modern interiors 
439468,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Noise from the street in the early hours of the morning specially Fri and Sat nights, Studio appartment was very spacious and comfortable for a longer stay Walking distance from the beaches old town and Sagrada
439469,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Wifi was so slow that it was not really functional Perhaps because we had a corner room on the ground floor far from a router But still disappointing as we needed to use the net as most travelers do nowadays , Friendly efficient staff Good location easy walk to the beach and local supermarket and restaurants The area felt very safe but we were only there one jet lagged night 
439470,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Fridge was not usable due to excess ice that was not checked and cleaned by house keeping but I guess this is an isolated incident though should not happen You really need to re check the rate again 48 hours before you arrive so that you could cancel and re book the same apartment again at a better rate In my case it went down by Eur 45 per night but they refused to give me the new rate on the day So I was penalised Euro 90 in two nights stay for early booking , Excellent new clean building roomy apartments with very good equipment and facilities 
439471,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Although the bed was very comfortable it was squeaky , Very spacious room Location was quiet The nearest taxi stand was only 30m away and metro station was fairly close as well Excellent wifi Extra points for washing drying machines that guests can use 
439472,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, A couple of points Each room has a doorbell or buzzer which the cleaners ring when wanting to enter a room The buzzers are quite loud and we were woken up both mornings by our neighbour s buzzer I initially thought it was ours Not an issue if you re already up bright and early but we wanted to lie in and rest till late morning which was not possible Despite having the Do Not Disturb sign on the cleaners still entered the room to make the bed replace the towels and tidy up the room This has never happened to us before so we were a bit surprised Had we wanted our room to be cleaned we would have displayed the Please Clean My Room side of the sign but when staying for only two nights I do not see this necessary We raised both issues with the staff at checkout and they were very apologetic , Amazing value for money Much better than a standard hotel you get a kitchenette and a living space with a TV on a stand that rotates to face either the sofa or the bed En suite bathroom no bath but walk in shower was enough space for a couple to leave all their toiletries The room included plenty of space for storage as well as an iron and safe Everything was clean beds were comfortable and all electricals worked as expected For the two nights we stayed there it felt like we had a small studio apartment to ourselves rather than a hotel room which definitely improves the experience 
439473,Capri by Fraser Barcelona,No Negative, The rooms were lovely well decorated a good size The staff were very friendly The hotel is about 15 20 min walk from the beach and about 5mins from a metro stop so was perfect for our long weekend in Barcelona

439479,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Depending on your preference the beds were a bit hard but they worked for us and we slept great , The staff were extremely helpful and positive They helped us figure out the street parking free on the weekend and how to do tolls on the highway once we left Barcelona when we got coffee to go they gave us croissants and chocolates to take with us for free The room was also very nice blackout curtains plenty of space well appointed very positive Then the location is great for walking to the old town to the beach etc There is a bakery nearby along with a cafeteria park and a few restaurants 
439480,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, we lived on the second floor and it was a big problem to catch free elevator to put our luggage on the ground floor We were waiting for 20 minutes but finally use stairs, Friendly staff Good location 20 minutes by foot till Sagrada Familia or till the beach 10 minutes away from supermarket Carrefour 5 minutes away from metro station Marina 
439481,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, My two teenage children were obliged to sleep together in a sofa bed We would have preferred that they each have a single bed , Clean quiet room Satisfying breakfast 
439482,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Not so closed to the center of the city or see sights but if you plan to travel with the metro then that will not be a problem , Very close to two Metro Stations so it was very easy to travel around The Wi Fi had a very good signal and the room was very big and clean Perfect for families with kids 
439483,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Bed was too hard a mattress topper would make all the difference Needed earplugs as noisy road and bars , spacious room with everything you need for a city break 
439484,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Sofa bed was not comfortable for two boys Room 003 is set up for a disabled person therefore not being disabled it was very awkward to shower A simple separate hook on the shower room wall would have allowed an abled bodied person to shower in comfort, Bed was comfy room was clean overall nice
439485,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, No swimming Pool this is a huge setback NO shows for visitors departing to Airport, It was well situated There is no view But lots of light Staff were excellent Rooms very comfortable recommended
439486,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Check in was a bit chaotic We requested earlier checking but as the hotel was busy it could not be accommodated We came back at 2pm and had to wait another half hour and had to keep chasing the staff to see when the room was ready When we finally got the room it was the wrong type of room so had to change room again , Nice rooms and hotel is modern and near a metro 
439487,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The front desk clerk who checked us in was rude unfriendly and set the tone that overshadowed everything else the hotel had to offer , The hotel was modern

439492,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The airport shuttle may be more affordable and some play areas for kids may be prepared , Location cleaning of the room helpful staff calmness we love all of them The best thing for our baby is to have a little kitchen in the room If you want an hotel where you both travel and rest this is the best place in Barcelona 
439493,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Compared to other Fraser properties that I ve stayed in it does not live upto the brand name The location was accessible but not great For the price I expected a better breakfast and atleast a pool , The apartment was nice nothing fancy It was clean and comfortable 
439494,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, I don t think is located in the center of the city Is close to a Metro station but if you go with kids and like to stay up until late I will suggest you to stay closer to the center At night the city does not have enough taxis on the weekends is really bad , I liked the comfort of the hotel everything was new and clean The services was good compare to what the service is in Barcelona

439533,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Ok the location was not amazing as the immediate area doesn t have much going on for families however the metro is close by Having said that we found the price of a taxi ride to the city centre or beach to be the same as a metro for two adults and an 8 year old at 6 7 euros so my advice is would be to forget the metro if you have young children with a buggy , The rooms are exactly what you see in the picture modern stylish spacious and very clean It was a pleasure to come back to after a day s adventure in Barcelona the kids loved the separate living area to sleep in with a huge TV The bedroom and ensuit felt luxurious and loccitane toiletries were a nice touch This is one of the best family rooms we ve ever stayed in The staff were nice couldn t comment on the breakfast or bar as we didn t use it the kitchen in the room was well equipped the safe was free there was an iron and hairdryer what more do you need

439541,Capri by Fraser Barcelona,No Negative, The deluxe room very comfortable with a large bed and the room was cleaned every day Hotel staff very helpful The Rambla del Problenou was only 15 to 20minutes stroll away and there were enough bars and restaurants to suit all ages and pallets Would recommend this hotel away from the crowds but close enough to all the sites of the city for an enjoyable city break 
439542,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, There was a strange smell in the bathroom all the while It did became less strong after we complained about it next day to but was still lingering for next 2 days as well , Decent location with proximity to Metro Tram stop and also for a city tour bus during winter times The staff at the reception was very warm and helpful

439552,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The wifi connection dropped out often in our room, The room was nicely decorated and the convenience of a laundry was great The staff were very helpful also
439553,Capri by Fraser Barcelona,No Negative, Excellent helpful staff and great location within walking distance to the Metro the Cathedral and the beach Large room with small kitchen was great for the family 
439554,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, AC being temperamental and mostly cold in winter which affected our comfort , Loved the apartment style accommodation with kitchen area equipped with essentials from microwave to fridge and sink Comfy bed spacious room tasteful design 
439555,Capri by Fraser Barcelona,No Negative, Good and quiet location The rooms are enormous and spacious Breakfast and lunches outstanding Taxi waiting all the time next door no need to wait Near the city centre less than 20 min walk to Sagrada Familia 4 min to the Auditori 
439556,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, We have stayed in Fraser properties in multiple locations around the world We were very pleased with our previous stays but the stay in this Barcelona property was so disappointing It is definitely not up to the Fraser standard We had a one bedroom apartment The sofa bed on a spring base had a very thin mattress It was so uncomfortable that it caused my daughter to have a backache Pillows provided was thin and this caused a neck ache The sewer smell from the toilet was horrid The shower tray is rather slippery a situation where diasaster is waiting to happen The pedal bin did not have a lid and obviously it had one before We are surprised that Fraser allowed the continued use of a broken bin in the room We originally intended to stay for 4 nights but after the 2 nights which were pre booked we left totally disappointed The house keeping of the room was shoddy Floor mat for the toilet was not given Used mugs were left in the pantry sink The housekeeper must have forgotten about washing them , Front desk staff were helpful 
439557,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The layout of the room was terrible We had a room on the 5th floor The TV was mounted on a wall not facing the bed making it awkward to view the screen The wardrobe space was limited and directly by the door One too many furniture makes the room cluttered The sewerage stench from the toilet was unbearable and we had to place a towel over the floor trap We fo not recommend this place for holiday makers No shops or cafes next to building A few minutes walk away there are a couple but this is it Pricing of accommodation was attractive but for the inconveniences one is better off paying a little more to be in the city centre Subway is more than 10 minutes walk away , Helpful staff
439558,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, I cannot really put it in the negative category It is more of a personal opinion but I would have like for the towels to be fluffier and some slippers would have been nice But that was not something to really bother me , Best hotel I have ever stayed in I loved the spacious room Very interesting design of the room Huge bathroom as compared to most hotels Big comfy bed Cleaning was done properly every day The reception staff very friendly and helpful always greeting you with a smile Good location in a quiet neighborhood Metro station very close Sagrada Familia within walking distance Beach about 10 15 min walk Near the Glories commercial centre including a carrefour supermarket I would warmly recommend it 
439559,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Bathroom had a slight odour that was kind of off putting but only a Minor inconvenience, One of the best rooms I ve stayed in plenty of room and well decorated 
439560,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Sofa bed is very uncomfortable I ve got an apartment in faro and have a sofa bed in it that is really comfortable This changed and it would be perfect , Lovely accommodation very stylish
439561,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, A bar is missing in the building which could provide an area to sit in the evening , Very spacious apartment and delicious breakfast included in the price
439562,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Everything was perfect, We stayed in Capri with our 9 months old daughter We loved this hotel The room was very clean modern and spacious Perfect for families with small kids Highly recommended 
439563,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The staff was very kind but the last day there were a not so nice recepcionist which asked us for 0 60 just before to leave because they had have a mistake with the payment and I didn t consider it appropiated after all the money we spent at that place and also the fact that it was her mistake and not ours The rest really good and satisfied about my stay , The style design and facilities of the hotel are great Location is not the best but still very close to the center and the beach The aparment was actually comfortable and the cleanliness quite good althought there were smell of smoke and it was a bit disgusting for me as non smoker 
439564,Capri by Fraser Barcelona,No Negative, The place is fantastic The room very spacious comfortable brand new inside well equipped Everything of high quality 3 min from metro I loved it and highly recommend 
439565,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Nothing everything was perfect , The hotel was very modern and our room was very large with a main sitting room that had a large sofa bed for the kids and a separate master bedroom The location of the hotel was very central just a few minutes walk to Marina station 
439566,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, If nextdoor you have a very loudly neighbour as we had the noise can bother you Anyway the staff from reception have called them and after that they ve stopped , We liked that the hotel is closed to 2 subway stations from where you can arrive in every tourist area Every member of staff was very polite The appartment is exactly as you can see in pictures Even we didn t use the kitchen we ve noticed that is very good equiped They made cleaning everyday and change the towels also 
439567,Capri by Fraser Barcelona,No Negative, Very close to metro stations L1 and L4 The one room apartment was very spacious with all the amenities in kitchen Ideal for a family with children Staff at the reception were very nice and helpful 
439568,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The front desk staff was very helpful but they did get it wrong once when giving us directions The funicular had closed and they were not aware of it Another small but significant irritation for me was that there was no socket either in the bathroom or bedroom to use a hair straightener , Modern building contemporary interior design close to Metro 15 20 Mts away from the heart of the city Helpful staff We stayed in a nice apartment 
439569,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The only point is that the bathroom stall had no door then I wet the floor and it was a little uncomfortable , The apartment was spacious well equipped and comfortable The location is great has a laundry room and the staff are very kind Printed check us in they gave tips about the city and were always very helpful Great stay and would go back again 
439570,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The only downside was that the beds were not as soft as I would have liked but that s really just a matter of preference , The one bedroom apartment is very spacious and beautiful There was plenty of room for my family of 4 The value is fantastic It is in a good neighborhood and the metro is a few minutes walk away The shower was my favorite part especially with the L Occitane toiletries that were provided The staff was very helpful in helping us reach our tourist destinations 
439571,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The maid did not wash the coffee cups like in other hotels , Welcoming caring english speaking staffs at reception All in one hote Good Food proximity to city for work shopping Sporty gym on premise parks near the sea for jogging Tram a few mins walk from the hotel Then the big studio room Perfect 
439572,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The Wifi connection to Internet was poor and unstable , The appartment was very clean well equipped spacious nicely decorated The hotel is located in a quite area not far from the metro station though The staff was very friendly The breakfast was very good 
439573,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, It s not that we didn t like something we just missed a hotel bar where we could drink a cup of coffee or a glass of wine Hotel bar is really the missing thing , The appartment was nice and lovely decorated Just big enough for a family of four Staff were friendly and very helpfull 
439574,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Breakfast did not cope with amount of people at times not enough tables and food drinks only replaced when completely gone, Location size of rooms
439575,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The reception staff is absolutely unqualified inattentive even happens to be rude Annoying cleaning ladies We asked for a good Asian restaurant nearby they sent us 2 km walk by foot with a baby to a small deli type shop by metro burgers only Another minor request was postponed for ever we had to ask again and again Their reception guys are quite dumb don t work well No even the slightest idea of a good client service Capri Fraser never again , Good cozy room clean spacious bathroom cosmetics free laundry self service Location not bad walking distance to the Sagrada Familia Gothic Quarter seaside Good kitchen plates kettle enough for a short stay Worthy breakfasts 
439576,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, There was a complication in the bathroom Some water dripped from the ceiling and when I took a shower the water moved towards the bedroom , Spatial room with very nice decoration very comfortable and clean Great value for such comfort
439577,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The only negative I would say about the hotel is that the street it is on is rather industrial with a lot of garages and businesses but is not at all noisy However it is within walking distance 20 30 minutes of major attractions eg Barceloneta Picasso Museum etc And it is very convenient to the metro and tram lines So while on first sight it seems a bit out of the way it is still very accessible and the public transit system in Barcelona is easy convenient very clean seemingly safe and reasonably priced , The facilities are modern and clean The staff was very helpful with directions to and about public transit and information about the city On my first day in the hotel the internet worked only very sporadically and I was ready to give the hotel a poor rating for that alone since I needed internet access for the business I was doing in Barcelona However I mentioned the problem to a staff member at the front desk he rebooted the Wi Fi router and I had excellent internet access for the rest of my stay So I now give the hotel an excellent rating The staff speaks fairly good English certainly good enough for anything you may need to know 
439578,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The corridors seem a bit dismal but the rooms more than make up for this , The appartment was lovely and clean very comfortable and amazing value The location isn t in a tourist area but is rather industrialised The metro is 5 minutes walk away on the red line which means it is very easy to access the popular locations 
439579,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Location far from all attractions maybe 5 min walk to the nearest metro station , Nice homey apartment Internet was good and fast Kitchen facilities were super good they had everything to cook 
439580,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Location was ok not many nice places to eat locally but only 3 stops on the metro to place catalunya , Rooms were spotless well designed and very comfortable Would highly recommend for families cruise ship visitors and business people Loved the l occitane shampoo etc nice to find a high quality product in a hotel 
439581,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Perhaps a bit too far from the center but close to the beach and to the metro and tram station, Great design Polite staff Great beds including the sofa bed
439582,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, The room was smaller than showed in the gallery on the hotel s hompage Limited number of TV channels 7 channels , Quite good location peacefully area it is nt the downtown but not far from them There is a Metro station in 5 minute Line 1 red You can reach the hotel quite simple by public transportation from the airport by railwail Refne R2 Nord and Metro Line 1 red Shopping centre Glories is at the next Metro station 6 9 min on foot The room is clear quiet and comfortable The personal nice and helpfully We could enter the room 2 hours earlier than the official deadline 
439583,Capri by Fraser Barcelona, Quite some noise during the night caused by noisy drunken people passing by Very steep way out of the garage, Location larger appartement for couple with kids
