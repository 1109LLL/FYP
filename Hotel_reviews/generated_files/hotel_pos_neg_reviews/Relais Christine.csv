136748,Relais Christine, Just free 50 ml water in the room and surcharge for any other commonly free service in such a prestigious luxury hotel In the bathroom shower not working so well Too much dark the breakfast hall otherwise wonderful and with high quality food and beverages , Free bluetooth Marshall amplifier in the room 
136749,Relais Christine, These can easily be improved and can make a big difference Need to improve wifi connection too slow for whatsapp calls Can improve breakfast selection add more fresh vegetables , Very good location and nice hotel very good service 
136750,Relais Christine, Breakfast The breakfast was disorganized with a poor selection of food On the first day we arrived at 10 20am and there was literally no food left despite us being told breakfast was served until 11am Room Despite our request to be in a room that was all on one level it was stated in the booking form they gave us a duplex room which really spoiled the holiday as we were traveling with a 5 year old who could not sleep downstairs by herself Therefore our daughter had to sleep on a mattress on the floor not what I would expect when pay 600 Euros a night Also there was only one tiny AC unit covering two floors which meant the room was really hot at night Construction works our room faced a building undergoing construction so not only was the view ruined but we were woken early each morning with loud banging and shouting , The staff were very friendly the decor and furniture was beautiful and the location was excellent 
136751,Relais Christine, I was upgraded to a jr suite The only issue here is that the bedroom was upstairs and the bathroom was downstairs This made for a precarious walk during the night , Perfect location staff and decor 
136752,Relais Christine,No Negative, This hotel is a gem The location staff and overall service is exceptional 24 hour room service of a high quality Room and facilities are first class and of a very high standard 
136753,Relais Christine,No Negative, We have stayed here lots of times the service is always excellent the staff are always so helpful really genuine Love the rooms always immaculate perfect location We won t stay anywhere else now when visiting Paris Love love love 
136754,Relais Christine, The breakfast Was sub standard so we went out to have breakfast for three of our four days there The bathroom Unusually narrow bathtub and I am a slim person a shower that really didn t function well The toilet The toiletseat was loose which is not to be expected at a five star hotel , The location and the staff
136755,Relais Christine,No Negative, The hotel is perfectly situated in a quiet street in the 6th and a lovely atmosphere The staff is very friendly and helpful Each room is different and appointed a bit differently which gives it a lot of character Perfect for our stay 
136756,Relais Christine, Overheated rooms ancient heating system Hard unyielding mattresses Never slept properly entire stay Breakfast staff unsupervised resulting in chaotic service No utensils No plates Huge ham brought our every day looking nastier and nastier as it aged and turned a very dark red , Location very good and very helpful staff Nice breakfast 
136757,Relais Christine, Nothing , There wasn t anything not to love about this gem of a hotel in Paris The friendliness of the staff the amazing location the beautiful room we had and the lovely food 
136758,Relais Christine, , Jean Flora of the front desk really made a difference to our trip with their tips and suggestions The location is excellent Right in the middle of busy St Germain but on a quiet side street An air of old school elegance prevails throughout the hotel Very nice 
136759,Relais Christine, A nice but bit expensive breakfast , Feeling like a home away from home Very nice with pets the hotel has two cats of there own and we traveling with a dog got a very convenient room with direct access to the garden and our own little patio 
136760,Relais Christine, The reception and downstairs area smelled musty damp they need to use a dehumidifier and scented candles However it has gorgeous decor and ambience so we could look past it , Our suite was fabulous and we loved having access to the garden The hotel is in a fantastic location with the Louvre just across the river and Notre Dame very close too The service was exceptional 
136761,Relais Christine, They did not give us a much needed late check out In room dining was all microwaveable food and even then we had to return dishes because they were still cold in the middle They gave us a hard time every time we had to ask for something almost everything was unavailable The toiletries were very minimal and scarce For the high bill we paid it was a complete rip off and we do not say that lightly Relais Christine does not stand up to SLH standards , Quiet 
136762,Relais Christine, If only the rooms were bigger We traveled with two big suitcases and there was literally no room on the floor , Excellent location in one of my favorite areas in Paris Historical building yet with a modern touch Bathroom is new and they separated toilet area from the shower very hygienic We also enjoyed drinks in the living room and breakfast very much 
136763,Relais Christine, I got the impression from your website that the garden is available to all guests This was one of the reasons I chose this hotel I was informed by staff that this is not the case As a solo traveller I would have enjoyed sitting in the garden in the sunshine reading my book Toiletries in the bathroom were a bit ordinary and a Nespresso maker is standard in other hotels of this price , Breakfast was lovely 
136764,Relais Christine,No Negative, The Hotel is in a great location and the staff are friendly helpful and informative Lots of great restaurants close by and you can walk everywhere except the Eiffel Tower 
136765,Relais Christine,No Negative, Beautiful boutique hotel Amazing position for walking to the sights of Paris Quiet location which was important The furnishings were top of the line Resulting in a comfortable stay but with all the necessary mod cons Highly recommend 
136766,Relais Christine, Room a bit small and cramped for a tall big guy stayed in one of the loft suites 6 3 250lbs , Very charming hotel in a fantastic left bank location The Louvre St Germain and Notre Dame easy walking distance away 
136767,Relais Christine, Underwent a renovation of the breakfast area during our stay without any prior warning The management tried to accommodate by serving in the lounge area but there was not enough room and the staff was not able to handle it We actually felt sorry for the staff that had to handle guests yelling at them , Lovely reception area Great fluffy towels On a quiet street but near many restaurants and cafes 
136768,Relais Christine, Breakfast should be included in the price with an option for fully cooked breakfast and perhaps another for continental breakfast , A very charming and comfortable peaceful hotel with a very helpful staff 
136769,Relais Christine, I know the breakfast room is 13th century but its pretty dreary down there The food and the coffee were great though, The staff were exceptional so helpful and friendly
136770,Relais Christine, Only issue is lack of inclusion of breakfast in what we feel was a fairly expensive hotel This is not typical of other experiences we have had traveling in Europe of the years I would prefer including even if the nightly fee was a bit higher , Virtually everything 
136771,Relais Christine, Breakfast was too expensive , Great location one block from Latin Quarter but quiet and secluded Pricey but it is Paris Several nice nearby places for breakfast 
136772,Relais Christine, There was little relaxation space The garden in the pictures was only accessible from four rooms The living room was busy with strangers needing to sit next to other strangers not relaxing The rooms were tiny I was in a superior so not the smallest and we had to move the chair every time we wanted to open a wardrobe door There was no sink in the toilet so you had to open two doors before you could wash your hands , Breakfasts were delicious and varied The dining room and spa were in the medieval basement with vaulted ceilings The decor was luxurious 
136773,Relais Christine,No Negative, Great location in the Saint Germaine area The rooms were small but lovely The breakfast dining room is charming and warm The staff was very helpful 
136774,Relais Christine,No Negative, Unbeatable location Team very helpful Rooms full of character If you like big corporate hotels this ISNT for you If you like a small hotel with character and history without huge price tag then this IS for you 
136775,Relais Christine,No Negative, Realais Christie is a wonderful boutique hotel perfectly located in the middle of the sixth The staff is wonderfully solicitous and you can walk to a half dozen top notch restaurants within two or three blocks 
136776,Relais Christine, There was nothing We didn t like, The location the hotel is very comfortable the staff always acknowledged you with a smile and very helpful the rooms catered for all your needs and the bed was to die for after walking all day 
136777,Relais Christine, Constant noisy refurbishment work while we were there for Valentine s weekend But see what we liked , The staff at the Hotel couldn t have been better at responding to our concerns about the noise In fact the staff at the Hotel were excellent across the board and we will stay agin 
136778,Relais Christine, There was work going on at the hotel which was noisy mid morning on Saturday It would have been helpful to have been informed beforehand A second minor point which may have been related to the work going on in the hotel there was a smell of drains in the lobby area Not in the bedrooms not the breakfast area , Elegant establishment sophisticated decor including art excellent location The staff were very helpful and engaging The hotel added to what was an excellent weekend break apart from the result of the rugby match and we would hope to be return visitors 
136779,Relais Christine,No Negative, A mistake was made with the address of our restaurant booking This was handled exceptionally well by the front desk team thank you very professional 
136780,Relais Christine, Wifi was not working at all times It seemed like it was on and working but it would not allow us to connect every time We alerted the reception and I think they tried fixing it but we had the same problem again a few more times In my opinion the spa area needs some restoration perhaps It is very nice but it seemed old Machinery in the gym likewise very old and a bit dusty it seemed to me , Location and the ambiance Room cleaning was very well done 
136781,Relais Christine, When we mentioned that the room smells U fresh and we could smell smoke Our complaint was just dismissed As there were many rooms cancelled no one seemed concerned Reception Staff male not as friendly as they could be surprised they make such a fuss by mentioning it and even leaving a card about the fact they supplied on e bottle of water for 2 people for 3 nights Awful noise in the early hours from cleaning bottles etc Courtyard view, Location
136782,Relais Christine, There were just a few things I would have improved upon the breakfast offerings were minimal and way too expensive Also we would have enjoyed having more light in our room It was virtually impossible to read for instance The room was not large and could have used another dresser although I don t know where one would find the space , The staff was very friendly and helpful Also the hotel s location was to our liking We were able to walk or take the metro everywhere The staff was really the best aspect of the hotel from the desk to the cleaners really quite welcoming 
136783,Relais Christine, The room was too small I am sure that we could find a better hotel to the price that we have paid for that very small room , The location of the hotel is nice This is the only positive side 
136784,Relais Christine, Over priced poor 4 star hotel Bathrooms not great cleanliness could be improved Only double bed Not really impressed , The locations great English well recieved here 
136785,Relais Christine,No Negative, The Hotel was quaint comfortable quiet and in an excellent location Breakfast was included and you could have it brought to you room or eat in the gallery There is no restaurant however they do offer room service 24 7 and some excellent little restaurants on the same street The rooms open to a small beautiful court yard garden You can get tickets from the concierge for some of the top museums so you do not have to stand in line Really enjoyed our stay
