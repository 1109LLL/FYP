372660,Hotel Derby,No Negative, All was perfect thanks to the reception staff and the floor staff They were really helpful The bed was excellent to be honest i am in the hospitality business it is worth staying at Derby A real 4 star
372661,Hotel Derby,No Negative, The hotel is clean and beds are very comfortable The hotel staff is very friendly It is about 1 4 km from the nearest metro station which connects to most of the places of interest While travelling with small kids it might be a problem walking 1 4 km However there is a taxi stand right outside the hotel if you are willing to shell out a little extra 
372662,Hotel Derby, The location meant I spent a lot of time in taxis The swimming pool is not in the hotel it s across the street , The room was quiet and the staff were helpful 
372663,Hotel Derby, Reception service was rude They did not want to go and change 500 in order to pay us for the room number they were blaming us that we do not have credit card in order to pay It was awful experience , Breakfast is very good and room numbers are clean
372664,Hotel Derby, Staff wasnt too helpful when we needed to print a PDF Fairly expensive No coffee or kettle available before 7am , Looked forward to returning to the room every evening Top notch comfort and the aesthetic was perfect Great wifi great windows quiet 
372665,Hotel Derby, it is mentioned swiming pool is included for hotel but in reality it was not swiming pool very small open pool in gran derby hotel which was not really usable , area access to hotel and facilities

372669,Hotel Derby, Tv lacks english programs and any dual function to view films etc in original language , Bed excellent good controllable Air con quiet Enough storage and hanging space 
372670,Hotel Derby, It was very noisy in the morning at 8am when the cleaning staff decided to make up the next room to ours and move the furniture It s quite irrelevant for a 4 star hotel , The room looked great the bathroom was awesome My fiance especially enjoyed the shampoo The location is pretty close to the railway station and nearby sights
