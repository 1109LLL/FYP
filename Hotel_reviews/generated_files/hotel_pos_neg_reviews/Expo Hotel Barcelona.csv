373305,Expo Hotel Barcelona, silly but would have preferred sheets on beds as quilts were very warm, really liked the terrace bar especially after a busy sightseeing day you could eat and enjoy a drink there also nice to sit by the pool although smaller than expected could do with more beds as peak summer was an easy walk to the magic fountains and can get buses from there to las ramblas and the touristic buses the taxis were on strike as we left but the airport bus was there as well a 10 min journey for 5 90 euro taxi is 25 euro
373306,Expo Hotel Barcelona, There should be more sun beds or chairs around the pool We were unable to use the pool as it meant sitting or laying on the floor , Location was good for getting around town
373307,Expo Hotel Barcelona, We had to complain about my daughters mattress you could feel the springs sticking out of it They did bring a better one The rooms are very small and the balcony has no seats , We loved the upstairs Terrace Grab a burger and a beer but it is a sheer drop and wouldn t advise unattended children playing about Swimming pool is very small but still good to have on those hot days 
373308,Expo Hotel Barcelona, We asked for rooms side by side as we travelled in a group of 6 4 kids but we were not accommodated, Very convenient to get to from the airport Train direct to Barcelona saints and you just walk outside
373309,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Balcony didn t have the greatest view Was hoping for more options for a breakfast buffet Was not able to get the correct adaptor for our chargers constantly given incorrect ones , Breakfast was good quality The rooms are quite large and spacious and have A C which is almost essential Also a nice little balcony Bathrooms were of very good standard Cleanliness was very good 
373310,Expo Hotel Barcelona, This was the most noisy hotel we have ever stayed in The room was small and cramped considering the cost of the room No coffee or tea making facilities not the 4 star facilities we would expect very disappointing overall we were glad to leave ,No Positive
373311,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The bed was on wheels so everytime I shifted the bed moved Need a locking mechanism on the wheels Bathroom in my single twin bed room was a little small shower was cramped and poorly lit Breakfast buffet options are limited , The windows in my room let in a lot of light balcony had good view Breakfast was good and the fruits were fresh Location was nice easy to get to from the airport and train station 2 metro stops nearby and can walk to the Arena mall and pla a d espanya The rooftop bar and pool was really nice free towel service perfect view of the city Hotel staff spoke English 
373312,Expo Hotel Barcelona, N A, After a long train journey from Paris to Barcelona this hotel proved to be fantastic The reception staff were brilliant upon our arrival and similarly the staff in the morning at breakfast and check out were superb This hotel is very close to the station clean comfortable and the staff are very friendly and attentive Both of our rooms were excellent 
373313,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Price of cocktails 10 euro No seating on the balconey, The bed was comftable and the room cleaned everyday the train staion is right next door to the hotel
373314,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The pillows on the bed were way too soft no support , The central location meant ease of travel across Barcelona and departure to the airport via the nearby train station 
373315,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Old property they haven t done much in renovation , Location is nice Walking distance to Sants estacion 15 minutes drive from airport and close to all attractions 
373316,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Nothing , The warmth and helpfulness of the staff location the fantastic breakfast the amazing bar staff up on the top floor great views roof top pool will be back 
373317,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The food at the terrace restaurant, The balcony room I stayed in and also the layout of the Terrace bar and restaurant and pool was luxurious and made me feel so comfortable and good Check out was a bit too early 12pm The excellent fire safety in the hotel corridors

373319,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Good and clean Hotel with a lounge bar at the roof 10 minutes walking from plaza de Espanya and really near to Saint Estaci lots of taxis and metro 
373320,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The service is terrible They first said they would change the bedding in my tiny single room Then later 10 30pm said that they were unable to provide non feather pillows and when asked are rude about it and I quote We are a hotel we do not cater for allergies I contacted the hotel before writing this review and gave them 10 days to respond and they haven t So I don t think customer service is anything they really care about If you have an allergy stay away , I liked very little about this hotel The location is good I can say that 
373321,Expo Hotel Barcelona, I paid by my credit card at arrival and front desk lady did not give me receipt or invoice I returned there to ask to give me together with evidence of my credit card payment If you pay you must receive receipt and credit card evidence immediately Use to be this hotel s price was very good some times I paid 55euros but now it becomes more than 120euro without b fast So if you have more time in the morning to catch airport train may be you better stay in the city center at reasonable price hotel , Room was renovated and very modern compare used to be This time I did not feal noisy problem from next room although wall remains same thin as used to be 
373322,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Small swimming pool Little information available on tourist attractions , The staff were friendly Hotel was close to train station and bus routes metro 
373323,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Unfortunately the hotel advertise that each room has a balcony but none of the rooms that myself and friends stayed in had any furniture on the balcony so we were unable to sit out Part of booking this hotel was that we could perhaps sit on the balcony and have a drink in the evening but this was not to be Why advertise balconies in this case , The hotel was generally very good The pool area was a bonus in hot weather Pleasant helpful staff 
373324,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Perfect location right near main train station and a not too long walk to plaza espagne Friendly helpful staff rooms simply decorated nice balcony good Breakfast
373325,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Our bathroom was a bit small and cramped But we were facing the lifts so I think the rooms are slightly smaller , Pool and upstairs terrace Location to train station and local tapas bars Fridge tea and coffee facilities in the room Bed was very comfortable Balcony overlooking the rooftops 8th floor free wifi

373327,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, It was nice they were able to find me a room hours before the check in time Breakfast was great Room was spacious Rooftop bar and pool was a good place to get a sunburn at 
373328,Expo Hotel Barcelona, We had booked a room and sent request asking could four share a room as we where traveling with two four year old children who would share a bed We received confirmation from booking com that the request was confirmed by hotel and would be at no extra charge however upon arrival the hotel would not stand over this and an extra room had to be booked and children and parents split up Not good service the room does say max of 3 persons but two small children should be allowed to fit in with adults The hotel also had lots of stag hen parties, Location was good very basic hotel but clean

373331,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Breakfast was strange Not a normal type breakfast selection of cheese ham salamis etc There were white cheese one choice of ham bread was cutted so that it was difficult to add any slices on it However food quality was good but I felt the breakfast seletion was a bit light , Room was clean and ok good air condition luckily because it was hot season beautiful view from roof terrace close to main railway station Friendly reception person 
373332,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The rooms are functional and of average size walls are not sound insulated so you can hear conversations next door The balcony was of decent size but there is no chairs and tables to sit and enjoy the view , The location of the hotel is central to Sants station and metro so easy to get to attractions The hotel pool on the roof top is a bonus with terrace and ample sun beds The breakfast is also of good quality and variety The view from our balcony on the 9th floor was amazing The staff work hard to give you a pleasant stay
373333,Expo Hotel Barcelona, No instructions Spanish or English on the use of the business centre computer and printer Had checked in online for our flights and needed to print the boarding passes The reception staff helpfully printed at the front desk but a stress I didn t need We were on top floor which I found a bit noisy from the street but partner slept through It s a busy big city though , Located directly across from and an easy walk to Barcelona Sants train station Room was available prior to regular check in which was a pleasant and much appreciated surprise Were upgraded which was kind Many facilities Very helpful and welcoming staff 
373334,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Very noisy guests on three of the nights we stayed there staff seemed reluctant to deal with them , roof top bar restaurant not many restaurants near hotel 
373335,Expo Hotel Barcelona, There is no water boiler and cup inside the room No free coffee tea provided , Just next to Sants station Bus subway and train stop close by very convenient to visit area Walking distant to Pla a d Espanya Shop closeby but not in visitor area good location for people do not like expensive visitor area 
373336,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The rooms are too small They are like a long corridor Almost no room between the bottom of the bed and the wall And a bathtub instead of a shower ,No Positive
373337,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Room was small but comfortable and clean Roof top terrace was nice and pool was clean but small Breakfast was good Location wise it s not amazing in terms of needing to get the metro pretty much everywhere but getting to the metro took about 3 minutes and is easy to use ,No Positive

373340,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Requested room with double bed but were given twin beds , Excellent breakfast with wide choice and spacious dining room Roof top terrace and pool though we did not use as only staying 1 night Great location for Barcelona Sants station 
373341,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Although it s clean and not that expensive it wasn t clear while booking that this particular room would be SO tiny think London or NY shoebox size A few places to hang things would also be helpful especially given the size of the room ,No Positive
373342,Expo Hotel Barcelona, front of desk staff weren t very welcoming or approachable we also had a power cut in our room and had no explanation of why or if it d be safe afterwards, lifeguards were really friendly rooms nice and beds really comfy
373343,Expo Hotel Barcelona, shower head had to be fixed no tea or coffee in room bar drinks a little expensive bed was two beds pushed together so there was always a gap in the middle need more information around the hotel as to how to get to places etc but all minor things, Location right next to sants station that takes you anywhere and also the magic fountain of montjuic which is a 10 min walk bar food is lovely and pool area able to leave suitcases in hotel due to flight not being till late room well air conditioned balcony would definately stay here again 
373344,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The breakfast was overpriced we decided not to take it and go out for breakfast There could have been a kettle in the room for some tea and coffee in the morning , We liked that it was a clean well run hotel The staff were multilingual which was helpful and the pool was a great feature 
373345,Expo Hotel Barcelona, More control over aircon throughout the day was very hot and aircon only comes on at certain times , Staff friendly modern facilities Nice rooftop terrace and pool cleanliness Wonderful view from room
373346,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The outside of the building looks terrible Like a 1960s residential block Fortunately the inside is nice clean and modern , Excellent location a stroll from Sants station and then from here you can see the rest of Barcelona 
373347,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The hotel is obviously a favorite with tour groups and the front desk is extremely busy , The hotel is about one block from the rail station but the area is quite nice The room was very comfortable very modern and had a fantastic view There was a nice bar light eating area and a rooftop pool that wasn t filled 
373348,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The bar staff upstairs where very slow even when the bar was empty bar staff would make you wait in fact the food upstairs came out quicker then the drink over the 4 days there was 10 of us and you probably would have earned another 400 out of us we just ended up going somewhere else maybe you are earning enough money not to care about extra cash, Aircon rooms and bar snacks upstairs and how quick the food was done
373349,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Being forced to pay for the room on arrival pretty jarring after a long hot journey when all we wanted to do was freshen up as apparently this is quicker than charging everyone at check out but but of course we also had to settle the bill at check out ridiculous system that meant we just had to queue twice as long There s a reason the vast majority of hotels worldwide DONT do this despite the opinion of the ill informed staff at check in For 130 per night I would expect a mould free shower taps that don t take 5 mins to cool down warm up and some basic amenities in the room no kettle no iron 2 bottles of water only in the fridge Felt like a large hostel not a hotel ,No Positive
373350,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Staff aren t responsive and efficient Restaurants are not great No room service , Big spacious rooms Comfortable beds Cleanliness Fabulous location 
373351,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Room nothing like photo complained got poor response and had to argue about room change for twenty minutes Similar grotty room still offered Not happy , Housekeeping doing a valiant job keeping a very tired hotel clean 
373352,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Very warm room but the room air conditioning does not produce cold air just a means of regulating the winter heat settings Unable to leave the windows open due to the intrusive noise from the busy street and influx of midges mozzies No tea coffee making facilities , Roof top terrace with bar and pool area with panoramic views of the surrounding area 5 minutes walk from Sants railway station and 10 minutes walk to the Arena with its roof top restaurants Comfy bed and spacious room 
373353,Expo Hotel Barcelona, We booked a double room on booking com but were told on arrival this wasn t guaranteed and only twins were available The rate when we paid on arrival was higher than we expected we later found out the conversion rate from euro to sterling was very high The rooftop pool was also a lot smaller than appears in pictures , Location was really near station and metro stops making it easy to get to lots of places around the city Rooms were basic but always kept clean
373354,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, We love the location It was very near the train station The facilities are great The rooms are big And the staff were very helpful There was a mini ref provided with shampoo bath gel slippers and complimentary water 
373355,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The pillows were a bit uncomfortable , The room was great including the bath the staff friendly the burgers at the bar on the roof top delicious the pool fantastic and the location so good for getting around Barcelona 
373356,Expo Hotel Barcelona, terrible standard hotel basic rooms tiled floor which meant you could hear the cleaners scraping chairs along other apartment floors from 7am bad customer service air con didn t work bad location too far out, clean
373357,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Because it is located on a side street the entrance was a little hard to find so we first walked past but then backtracked Now that we know where it is no problem , Loved the comforter on the bed and the views 
373358,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, I must have reviewed this place about 6 times at least as we stay there every year it almost feels like a home from home not sure I have much new to add Off the train over the road check in drinks on the terrace within 20 minutes of arriving in the city The staff are lovely The rooms are fantastic The beds are comfortable You get a brilliant panoramic view of the city from the terrace bar and usually a decent view from your room balcony too We even had an actual bathtub this year I don t know if all the rooms have one but I m sure they ll sort you if you ask Same time next year then Of course 
373359,Expo Hotel Barcelona, No minibar no conditioner , The room was clean and bright I liked the balcony and also the selection of bathroom brand Rituals The rooftop bar is amazing 
373360,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Reception was always busy and staff seemed overwhelmed by the number of guests checking in or out or with general queries my room key stopped working and I had to queue for 22 minutes to speak to a receptionist about getting a new key We ordered room service but didn t receive all of the food we ordered and the tea came as a pot of hot water without a tea bag Our trays weren t collected from outside the room for 36 hours when I had to ask at reception to send someone to remove it , The hotel was well appointed with a large bathroom bed and balcony The hotel was 100m from Sants Station where you could get public transport all over the city 
373361,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The walls of our room were quite thin I could hear the furniture being moved around next door but that s all , So many things to mention the location easy access to metros the pool roof top bar the late checkin checkout the breakfast buffet at a great price for what you get the friendly staff
373362,Expo Hotel Barcelona, No tea or coffee in rooms , Fantastic hotel brilliant staff very welcoming easy access to Train station I have booked again twice for September everything was perfect thanks so much
373363,Expo Hotel Barcelona, There was completely nothing to like about the property , Nothing as it was falsely advertised not even a 1 star rating not the star rating online you had it advertised 
373364,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Overall we stayed at the hotel on two occasions and found that our impression was dependent on our room location Our first room a king bed room was not good Cramped and no where to put things and located near the lifts so we were disturbed by late night revellers Our second stay was fine we upgraded to an executive double room high up away from lifts Much more pleasant 
373365,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The stuff on reception didnt help us even one of them was so rude they couldnt even provide enogh shampoo and tooth paste the towers in bathroom were really terrible also there wasnt kattle in room to at least make some tea or coffe for ourself they didnt put at least one chair in balcony balcony was totally useless, The only good thing about hotel was the location
373366,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The standard of our room was poor Could definitely do with an upgrade the rest of the hotel looked good e g the reception area lounge restaurant so quite shocked at the presentation and overall standard of room , The breakfast was of a good standard good selection of hot and cold 
373367,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The room was not what I expected A bit bare and unwelcoming No patio furniture The pool was smaller than the picture looked, The duvet was comfy nice to have a duvet
373368,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The bed was on casters and had no headboard so the pillows ended up on the floor The menu in the restaurant was very limited Only three main course items Got a kettle but nothing to go with it The pool closed at six pm So a swim before dinner was out , Not a lot Just an average hotel at an inflated price 
373369,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, I have stayed at Expo numerous times It is a wonderful location near the trains and Metro especially for weary travellers I noticed that now there are some bicycles in the lobby I didn t have time to inquire or use them but love the idea 
373370,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The first day of check in there was hair in the toilet bowl 2 little bottles of body and shampoo soap in the toilet but one was empty so the cleanliness of housekeeping service was not good They refilled the soap in the following days Becasue there was only one chair in the room and we were 2 persons to stay for 5 nights the next morning I asked the front desk staff to request one more chair The female staff called her staff to confirm OK with one additional chair to my room However I did not find it when I returned in the evening I asked the front desk again and they gave me later after , the bedroom is big and there is a balcony in the room
373371,Expo Hotel Barcelona, well now that you have asked we did not like the drunken english hoons that were terribly intoxicated at the roof top bar these persons were obnoxious loud and were clearly heard on poolside it gets worse these intoxicated hoons about six or seven made themselves at home on the poolside deckchairs and right in front of my wife and i one them lowered his pants and proceeded to squat his bottom onto the face of one his associates horrified i immeadiatley notified staff at the bar who intervened what a disgraceful act and right in front of hotel guests who were minding their own buisness the person who committed this obscene act should have been removed from the hotel and the police called but no he was permitted to stay NEVER AGAIN EXPO HOTEL WILL I EVER STAY HERE for the safety of your hotel guests your staff should practice the responsible service of alcohol this is not the first time we have seen unruly and intoxicated english persons at this hotel 4 years ago we stayed here and witnessed an english female who was so drunk she had to be sent to her room to recover warning to future guests to be mindful of the roof top pool bar , location right next to barcelona sants train station with convenient connections to the airport
373372,Expo Hotel Barcelona, 1 photos in booking com only show the new rooms not the old ones that are not worth 1 star rating Our room was old smelled weird toilette paper was not new almost no shampoos and bathroom accesories no furniture electrical appliances cables were hanging out from the walls 210 euros per night for this is unacceptable 2 My partner had to wait for 90 minutes before i arrived because the hotel wanted us to pay for the room at chekin When I arrived and asked for explanations all i was told is that is corporate policy Unacceptable for a 4 star hotel , location is very good to take the train
373373,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Soundproofing was inadequate We were disturbed by noise from the corridor and from adjacent rooms , The staff were helpful and friendly Our first room was inadequate and cramped but we paid to upgrade to an executive room and found that much more comfortable The hotel is well positioned for exploring the city and its environs and has many eating places within a short distance Overall a good choice for a short stay 
373374,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Breakfast was expensive and though adequate there wasn t much choice for hot food , Rooftop bar great views Efficient and friendly staff Recommend take a jumper cardigan if staying up at the roof top bar as we got cold at night in mid May Pool was a good option during the warm days Being next to Sants station meant access to Barcelona tourist attractions was really easy buy a ten trip for ten euro metro pass at the stations 
373375,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Bathroom poorly designed in that the washbasin is too close to the toilet a large person would have difficulty fitting into the space The reception staff were very impersonal and not particularly welcoming There is a wide range of food for breakfast but staff struggled to keep up with the flow of guests so there were gaps in the buffet and people had to wait The breakfast area was very noisy due to the number of people and design The electrical socket for the kettle was broken although it was a bonus to find a kettle and I plugged it in elsewhere , Very close to the train station Room compact but generally well designed Room was quiet despite the city centre location 
373376,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Front desk staff attempted to be helpful answering questions about the city but not always that knowledgeable , Convenient location easy access to public transportation Great rooftop bar with amazing views delicious food friendly staff 
373377,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Nothing , The beds were excellent the pool was not in use due to time of year the lifts were very efficient and our room on the 9th floor had excellent views 
373378,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Room walls were bare no other furniture than bed tv shelf and chair DID NOT LOOK LIKE PICTURE ON BOOKING COM Originally given triple bed room although traveling alone I was able to change to a double bed room This is a very large hotel I think this was an unrenovated floor , The view from balcony 
373379,Expo Hotel Barcelona, There was nothing to complain about your hotel was good value for the money , your staff was excellent Jordi was so helpful and worth returning for the food was very good and the terrazo nachos were great service was good and cheerful 
373380,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Great location easy to walk or use public transport to get everywhere Several metro stations are just a few minutes walk from the hotel The rooftop bar was lovely the view at night was incredible The breakfast was great too lots of choice and really fresh 
373381,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The only issue was that the room was very hot and the air con wasn t amazing It was actually cooler outside , The breakfast was a good buffet however I do think it is a little expensive The rooms are a little dated however very clean and it is definitely good value for money The centre is easily reached by metro 
373382,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Pleasant bright and quiet room near Sants station Nice district with excellent and fast connections to town centre port and beach metro buses and taxis There are many good restaurants very close to the hotel as well as excellent shopping Creu Coberta St 
373383,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Regulating the air conditioning and heating , Staff member who greeted us at checking was very friendly and helpful He gave us a fabulous suggestion for dinner which we took Hotel is very close to Barcelona Sants Train Station where we arrived and where we were meeting friends 
373384,Expo Hotel Barcelona, the hotel restaurant stopped serving food at approx 11pm so unable to get something to eat when arriving late Our plane arrived at El Prat at 10pm , the staff were mostly friendly and helpful Hotel was 2minutes from Santa railway station were able to leave our luggage in a secure storeroom after checkout 
373385,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The rooftop bar and pool was closed This had been one of the main reasons for booking the hotel so was v disappointing, V good value for money Less than 10 euros for a taxi in to town Couple of lovely restaurants nearby 
373386,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Price is rather steep Stayed there 2 times one time I got a large room and lower price second time higher price and tiny room Noise from the street is not filtered by the windows some drunk people shouting near the station If you get a room with a balcony it is long but very narrow and does not have protection against falling or jumping off , Excellent location close to city centre and main station Typical business hotel Clean luxury Restaurant is roomy and has good services 
373387,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The room was extremely small I could hardly open my tiny trolley 100 for such a small space is far too much , The breakfast was great and good value for money 
373388,Expo Hotel Barcelona, No complaints , The hotel is right by the metro and bus stations so it s very convenient to get around Also the tour stop and go buses are right down the street if you want to explore the historical locations The staff was very friendly and spoke English The hotel breakfast was a buffet with a nice variety of hot and cold items I am a female who was traveling alone and I felt safe and comfortable there 
373389,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Two of the three Coffee machines were not working on our last day The staff were brilliant and handling it really well but the management should give them the support they deserve by ensuring that the machines are well maintained and perhaps that back up machines are available since breakfast at this hotel is always super busy perhaps because of the excellent spread coupled with the reasonable pricing and being located so close to the Barcelona SANTS station The rooms feel a bit small there is a changing room area which is redundant in a room this size If there is a remodeling opening that space out to increase room area would be a good improvement This was my second stay in 3 weeks at this hotel Yet again I noticed that the reception staff were not as friendly or warm or helpful as the restaurant staff , Loved the breakfast fantastic spread of food which range from cold meats right through to deserts with cappucino on the coffee machines to round things off The location is unmatchable just a short walk from Barcelona SANTS station The staff at the reception Maria Jose and her team are warm and friendly and will go out of their way to ensure that everything is perfect The views from one side of the hotel ask for rooms with Odd numbers as opposed to even has amazing views of the city crowned with a stunning view of the Barcelona cathedral in all it s glory 
373390,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Maybe a faster check in, Restaurant was the best the room was comfortable and the view was just amazing There is a balcony in each room And the views were amazing Hallways between rooms had many beautiful artwork Try the restaurant it s amazing food
373391,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Walls are pretty thin so woken up easily as I m a light sleeper, Really clean good sized rooms comfy beds good location with easy access to metro shower with good water temperature helpful staff and most were very friendly
373392,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Poor noise attenuation as could hear talking in adjoining rooms any movement of furniture and outside traffic Difficult to sleep , The location was perfect for our trip
373393,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Very basic bedroom no facilities for making tea or coffee No decorations or nice touches One plastic chair that could be put on balcony One shower gel one shampoo and one bar of soap in bathroom would it hurt to be more generous , Location Staff in bar Bed Good size bathroom and great to have hooks to hang towels
373394,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Bed side cabinet on one side of the bed only No sockets to recharge phone on that side so had to put it over on the dressing table instead of using it as alarm clock next to me No comfy chairs in the room and only one hard one to sit on the balcony so only one at a time seated , A good selection for breakfast Reception were very understanding and accommodating 
373395,Expo Hotel Barcelona, they dont open up the pool or the airconditioning until May Barcelona can get very hot some days during April, Very close to the Barcelona Sants station as well as other Metro stops which makes the entire city and all the attractions easily accessible La Rambla 4 stops Camo Nou 3 Stops Barceloneta Beach 5 stops Room was great as well 
373396,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Rooms with Air conditioning switched off Very hot in the night , Staff were very helpful Thanks to malya the lady receptionist for organising the fan otherwise we couldn t have slept 
373397,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The experience overall was lovely but there were a few things that I felt ruined our trip and weren t up to what I expect from a 4 star hotel Toiletries Being provided one small bottle of shampoo and shower gel between 2 people isn t great From most 4 star you receive shampoo condition shower gel and body cream which is stocked daily Water The hotel was nice enough to provide 2 bottles of water in our fridge on arrival but the following days we only received one bottle Using this water to brush our teeth and stay hydrated in our room temp was 25 degrees that weekend and between 2 of us meant this went quickly Aircon When trying to turn our aircon on we felt hot air coming out not cool cold air It was then on the info in the room we read that the air con heater is seasonal so at that point in the year was hot air only which I found extremely odd at the temperature was 26C all 3 days we were there Rooftop terrace and pool This is the main reason I felt our trip was ruined I specifically chose this hotel because of its amazing views from the terrace pool and restaurant It was only when in my room and reading the hotel info that I saw these facilities do not open until May Nowhere was this made clear when booking in my confirmation nor on my arrival Extremely upset and disappointed by this as it was a surprise for my partner and the weather was unbelievable Our swimming gear unfortunately stayed in our suitcases for the trip , The location was great Close to the station and walking distance from the shopping mall and fountain display recommend going to this on a Saturday night and watching the lights show The receptions Jordi was lovely Very friendly helpful and had a great sense of humour The reception and 3rd floor lounge and restaurant area were very modern clean and vibrant 
373398,Expo Hotel Barcelona, There was no air conditioning and it was very hot in Barcelona Guests should have the option of turning air conditioning on off and not being forced to stay in hot rooms Horrible sleepless nights , The hotel was clean 
373399,Expo Hotel Barcelona, I had some noisy neighbours with loud music in their room that Security was not able to fix it , Very close to Sants Train Station 2min walking and also 100m from nearest Metro Station
373400,Expo Hotel Barcelona, They run AC depending on season We were in between winter and summer so cooling was not on but it was very warm at night , It is pretty close to some attractions Nice quite neighborhood Close to train metro bus taxi The staff was very friendly They have a sumptuous breakfast Though they had check in time at 3pm we could check in at 11 am as the room was ready 
373401,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Staff at reception could be warmer and more enthusiastic They messed up by failing to inform when our baby stroller had been returned by the airline even though it bore our room number on the package Sigh Also AC doesn t work plus shower is spotty and very difficult to adjust mixer shower and get a consistent temperature , Loved the breakfast which was a proper hot breakfast for 10Euro if you pay at check in Staff at bfast were super polite and the spread was very good Location is awesome

373406,Expo Hotel Barcelona, air conditioning in the room wasn t working rooms could use some renovation a bit too expensive for the standard there was planned hot water outage one day between 10 am 2 pm which we were informed about only previous evening since I m not an early bird I was really displeased being forced to get up before 10 am on my holidays to be able to take a shower, great location in a quiet neighbourhood with best tapas with a good connection to the city center and walking distance from placa Espanya large room with separate wardrobe good breakfast

373413,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The only fault I could find was my wife and I stayed in a double room which only had one chair but the staff got us a second chair after we asked for one but surely if a room is for 2 then both people need to be able to sit down , The room and facilities were very good as was the breakfast

373430,Expo Hotel Barcelona, it is not working air conditioner and they said they cannot offer individual air conditioner each room and they only offer entire heating and cooling however remodeling room is consist of good air conditioner each room is quite looked so old I dont understand why this hotel is the quality of 4 stars we do not have any responsibility so if you complain the hotel condition or service complained it on the website as bookingM com there is located near train station in this hotel so it is definitely confirmed noisy place and noisy crowds the opposite side of room not close to train station, Good breakfast
373431,Expo Hotel Barcelona, We were directed to what can only be classed as servants quarters which were located by exiting the lift at the top floor and using stairs to access a room space that was a health and safety risk This was adjacent to a boiler room which could actually be viewed through the ventilation panels the noise from this made sleep impossible light fittings on the headboard were unsafe as they were metal and you risked hitting yourself when sitting up not how described by bookin com and certainly not worth the price paid Will be very wary of booking through this site again, The hotel was in Barcelona
373432,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Not a big criticism but the room was a wee bit tired , The staff were fantastic from check in to the security man very friendly Ideal location for Barna Sants Pla a Espanya and the Arenes de Barcelona I hope to return to this hotel 
373433,Expo Hotel Barcelona, I got a 3 beds room although i booked for one person which left very lttle space in the room The bed was not uncomfortable the pillows were but is quite narrow The bathroom had a slightly strange odour likely due to pipes being old and not well drained The breakfast was entirely ordinary somewhat bellow expectations for the location and price , Its very central location close to both train station and the airport bus station and to other relevant city spots Rooms have a nice balcony

373452,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The quality of the room ranging from bed to toilet to everything do not justify the cost they charge per night Worst hotel bed that I have facing so far ,No Positive
373453,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Asked for quiet room but was allocated a triple room facing a very busy noisy train station room quite dated and not sound proofed Expensive considering breakfast was not included , Near Metro station great view from roof open 24 hours
373454,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The bed was extremely firm and the drink prices was unbelievably expensive , Location was ideal roof terrace was beautiful but extortion is the only way to describe the drink prices 
373455,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Although room was large and spacious the walls are not soundproof not only could I hear conversations from neighbouring room but could also hear the shower running Not ideal for a light sleeper , Location was perfect metro just 2 minute walk and Pla a d Espanya about 10 minute walk Breakfast was great especially the fantastic assortment of pastries and breads good coffee too 
373456,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The beds could definitely be better more comfortable Water should be placed in the room as a free amenity every night not just the first , Free wifi easy subway access near pla a espanya fast food close by small restaurants infront of hotel Nice snack bar and restaurant The terrace is a great place to relax enjoy the view and pool as well as good food and drinks 
373457,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The rooms were quite strange The bed was huge though , The hotel had a nice bar and a great pool It was very close to Sants station which suited us perfectly t here are some great little tavernas and supermarkets down the side St 
373458,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The room was bleak with no coffee tea making facilities The bathroom was ok There wasn t any furniture on the gloomy balcony The hotel top floor bar food was horrible but the views were great The photos of the pool are much better than in real life , The best thing about this tired old hotel is its very close proximity to Sants Estacion 
373459,Expo Hotel Barcelona, At night and early morning hotel was noisy Loud conversations and door banging At 5 30 each morning we were woken by furniture being moved around in room above us on 6th floor A women we assumme walked over and back on tile floor in high heels above our room and slammed room door two morning out of four Wanted to complain each morning but always busy reception area so no point We complained about tv not working and not sure if any thing was done we pushed back in the aerial cable which had become detached and was to short so when tv was moved it fell out I don t feel we got value for money as previously noted only booked again for location Will not be returning again two strikes and your out Nothing really special about hotel Dated decor cracked floor tiles No soft door closers no spy holes for doors Pre arrival requests were carried out double bed instead of twin We were able get into our room early which was good after early morning flight, Location and pool
373460,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Beds were uncomfortable Very noisy you could hear the occupants walking around above at all times of the night due to tiled floor Pool area needs modernising , The staff are very friendly It is a quick trip by metro to the hustle and bustle of La Rambla It is clean however one night the drains were really bad Would stay there again 
373461,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Could do with a lick of paint in our room and the balcony needed a table and chairs so you could sit and enjoy the stunning view, It was just around the corner from Sants station less than 5 minute walk
373462,Expo Hotel Barcelona, It would be good if they provided a mini bar including bottle of water Breakfast could have been a little warmer although there was plenty to choose from Four twin rooms booked 14 weeks in advance but we were all far apart why ,No Positive
373463,Expo Hotel Barcelona, A minor quibble about an otherwise an excellent stay We booked a twin room but were first sent to a room with a double bed This should not have happened since the booking was clear and furthermore the hotel had sent a standard email a few days before arrival asking again which type of room was required The desk clerk tried to say no twin room was available until a colleague intervened and corrected him , Very good choice of food at breakfast both hot and cold options Comfortable room and good location close to the metro and main railway station 
373464,Expo Hotel Barcelona, We had to wait nearly 2 hrs at check in to get our rooms allocated according to the hotel 3 of the 5 rooms had been cancelled but they could not say by whom We then had to wait for two rooms until 4pm for one and later than 4 30 pm for the last room All this was totally unacceptable One room was a family room as 3 people were sharing we were given a standard room with an extra bed so you couldn t swing a cat Extremely disappointed in the hotel as I did liaise directly with the hotel before arrival to explain this was a special occasion and I did not want any problems Also disappointed with booking com as this should not have been allowed to happen when I had a confirmed booking for 5 rooms my special request which included details of the special occasion never got to the hotel via booking com , The roof top bar and pool area Security when checking room access etc 
373465,Expo Hotel Barcelona, 1 the staff were not really helpful after changing room on day 1 coz ac was not working they didnt update our details on new room and later said we havent paid nothing good we had our reciept Staff needs more training 2 housekeeping skills are not great and i wouldnt say it s up to 4star hotel standarts 3 The swiming pool on roof is kids size couldnt use it because everything was busy there , Location was good 
373466,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Slightly cheaper, Breakfast very good Balcony from bedroom and bathroom Right next to Estacion Sants where I was coming into late at night and leaving from
373467,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The Air con was super cold even stopping it immediately when checked in the room couldn t avoid a nice cold in the following days when external temperature was 30 or more air con around 18 is not optimum, Location is very good staff very helpful and rooms are like they look on the pictures 
373468,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Our room was not the superior room we booked in our opinion Cleanliness could have been better mould around the shower screen signs of damp in the bedroom and dirty fingerprints on the service hatch in the ceiling Rooms were serviced daily but you could tell the floor had only been swept not mopped or polished , Comfy beds good soundproofing we asked for and got a quiet room with a view Close to rail station and good metro access to city centre 
373469,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Room had scratched wall The room was not clean and the beds were very uncomfortable Facilities Need refurbishments and renewals Very noisy as well , The straff was nice and helpful The Location is good nice Roof top bar 
373470,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Very late check in as an International guest one likes to freshen up rest for an hour before going out 3pm check in does not allow this , Room all that is required bed comfortable a bit dated 
373471,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Bed mattress was average We bought breakfast and found items like butter not available and hot water for tea and coffee not able to meet demand of a large crowd , friendly helpful staff Location just a couple of mins walk to the train terminal Also convenient to metro station 
373472,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Not in the city centre and the check in was unnecessarily time consuming, Modern looking rooms with comfortable beds and nice bathrooms The roof top bar is quite cool and the pool is small but nice relief from the heat Its very close to a tube station but getting a taxi at night to return can be a bit tricky 
373473,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Wasnt there long enough to find much wrong with anything , Was only staying overnight on the way back to Ireland but checked straight in and straight back out no problems super quick You remembered I was there before the welcome back message in the room was a nice touch
373474,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Service in bar restaurant is very poor Rooms very basic no drinking water available TV channels not working properly Rooms mini bar not cleared still had a sandwich an apple and soft drink from previous guest or maintenance personal lunch , location
373475,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The staff were rude Rooftop bar was understaffed with dirty glasses littering bar Camp beds with disgusting green velour covers Room had no outlook smell of dampness in room Bathroom had brown mildrew around shower screen Definately not a 4 star hotel ,No Positive
373476,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Although I don t really have any complaints I wouldn t really see this as a 4 star hotel But on the other hand the price we paid was less than what one would usually pay for a 4 star , The hotel is situated in a quiet area and located right next to the Barcelona central station It was very clean and modern Staff was very helpful throughout our stay and the room was cleaned daily with changed as well There is a rooftop pool which one can use freely and a restaurant bar next to it If you ask you can be provided with a kettle and iron board too The hotel room also has a small Fridge 
373477,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The room are def not 4 stars not comfortable poor material and beds Top of that we had a problem the room wasn t the one we booked and one woman staff acted in bad faith wasn t helpful at all and was being mean , The pool on the rooftop is enjoyable and good location metro is 20m aways 
373478,Expo Hotel Barcelona, 25 euro parking fee for one night we put off car hire for two days as we were traveling 30 euro taxi fare to city centre , The staff were friendly and very helpful the room was very clean and spacious Everything was amazing apart from the location it was good but not the best 30 euro taxi one way only thing that let it down 
373479,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The safe and toilet lock in our room didn t work I phoned up reception and asked for someone to come help The security guard came and opened the safe wasn t the problem the battery was low and would stay locked when shutting it The chap who came to fix the toilet door lock left to take a phone call and never came back Not to mention the beds were not comfy at all and the room wasn t cleaned properly not happy at all my air BnB that I had stayed in the two nights before was 1 3 of the price and 10 times better I know for next time now though ,No Positive
373480,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Rooms were quite dated compared to reception bar and pool area Noises of rooms next door were quite noticeable , Nice welcome of staff on first day literally next to the train station Good location 
373481,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Rooms were a bit tired Only one English channel world news not the happiest , The location was great for our purposes but not so great for the noise of the funfair next door which was particularly loud at the weekend However we were often so shattered from our full days and nights that it wasn t too bad Lovely lady called jasmine on reception who was very helpful and cheerful and upgraded us Rooftop pool was nice to end the day Overall a good place to stay 
373482,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The family room was extremely plain and the third bed had not been made up nor had a third towel been added so we had to ask for these when we arrived after a long train journey late in the evening The thumping base from a fair outside was ear splitting until about 2 a m , Unpretentious friendly efficient staff and close to Barcelona Sants station It is very reasonable given that Barcelona accommodation as a whole hotels and airbnb alike is grossly over priced But breakfast was not included 
373483,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Standard of the room was not that high I expected it to be better after looking at photos online , The roof top pool area was excellent my favourite part 
373484,Expo Hotel Barcelona, an actually double bed not two different singles pushed together leaky toilet and hairdryer thats does not work properly, the roof top bar and restaurant
373485,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Staff was friendly but not very professional From check in to ordering a drink on the roof it all took ages As I got a nice last minute price with booking com it was good value for money but without a good deal I would recommend a better location Unless you have that train to catch than it s unbeatable , Very good location if you need to catch a train next day otherwise its a rather uninspiring part of Barcelona Close to plaza Espa a but not that close View is mostly blocked by some office buildings but you have a nice outlook on montjuic Rooftop swimming pool is tiny but still nice Rooms are good but who wants to stay in a hotel room when in Barcelona 
373486,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Put on 10th floor where we need to carry up luggage up the the stairs No privacy as Window facing rooftop open space with people moving around and kitchen exhaust in front of window , Location and friendly staff Need upgrade rooms and provide electric kettle

373490,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The walls of the room are really thin so you can hear everything from the people next door , The hotel is really well place in Barcelona with the metro just around the corner The room are nice and clean 
373491,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The price of the breakfast in the hotel was quite expensive specially if around you have many choices of cafes , The access to transport was very easy And the hotel was surrounded by small cafes and restaurantes And there was a great mall closed by t
373492,Expo Hotel Barcelona, I can t think of anything that I didn t like , The breakfast was very tasty and there was a lot variety Staff were very helpful and courteous The bar was also very good There was s veranda that where it was llovely to sit and enjoy the sunset 
373493,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The bed was a little hard for me and the room was looking a little tired and the air conditioning struggled during the night to keep the room cool , The views from the roof terrace were fantastic you could see the National Art Muesum and the remains of the Olympic Village The complimentary shampoo etc were particularly nice green tea It was only hotel with a roof pool and balconies that I could see

373498,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Only thing I could say is I would havd liked a chair on the balcony as I wake early and it would have been nice to sit and watch the world go by with a cuppa , We loved our stay here our daughter lives in Barcelona and she came up and spent some time with us at the pool and we had lunch on the terrace bar and we all thought it was fab The room was fine and the air condioning much appreciated Location great as we headed out of the city from Sants station a couple of times A pleasant walk down to town and felt very safe walking back after midnight We will certainly stay here again

373502,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The bedroom was tired and in need of updating Mini bar only had two small bottles of water no alcohol Air con worked but not very well could have done with being a little cooler , Location to Barcelona Sants Train station Easy to find and only 2 minutes walk from entrance of station We only needed a place to stay overnight between train journeys and this could not have been better The staff were excellent Spoke very good English and the check in out procedure went smoothly If staying in the city for a while they provide information on what to do where to go etc would have been very useful if we had stayed longer 
373503,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Walls were paper thin we got threatened with being chucked out because we were up chatting at midnight no music etc and the people below us complained hotel didn t handle it very well let s say , Pool was great location a little out of the way but quiet area and could get a cab etc no problem 
373504,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Our room wasn t ready until 3pm but we were able to leave our bags and head out sightseeing so not really a problem , Enjoyed unwinding at the rooftop pool Reception staff helpful Great location for train station

373509,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The staff upstairs on the terrace were rude and extremely slow I was staying there for a week with a work related matter and found myself free most afternoons I don t know whether it was because I was solo but I found the bar staff to be very uninterested and at times acted as though I was invisible On two separate incidents I had ordered food and a drink at the bar and it took over an hour for me to be served and that was only after I had reminded them Wouldn t stay again , The staff on the front desk were 10 10 for friendliness and helpfulness 
373510,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The room was tired and in need of a makeover But for what we wanted it was fine There was no minibar in the room as advertised , My wife and I were travelling from the UK to Almeria by train We only needed a place to stay between connections in Barcelona This hotel is only a couple of minutes walk from Barcelona Sants main entrance and very easy to find We did not arrive until 9pm and had to catch our next train at 7am the next morning This hotel was ideal for us 
373511,Expo Hotel Barcelona, D cor it s lacking Not too much touristic information unlike nearby Torre You get what you pay for but at times it is worth it No luggage racks portable no where to put stuff , Roomy but very plain 
373512,Expo Hotel Barcelona, There where lack of electrical contacts beside the bed They have charge me twice for room service I hope I will get my money back , The staff are extremly service minded and helpfull Always at their top of helping you when you need something Always a smile at their lips The food and room service are really great They courted me at my birthday and I will never ever forget such a lovely thing I am both pleased and grateful to them 
373513,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Could do with more sunbeds on the roof , Very good value good location being close to 2 metro lines which is easy access to anywhere in the city Pleasant surprise ro be a short walk from the magic fountain too Very happy with the little extra effort from the staff birthday card and balloons in the room for my girlfriend after asking reason for our trip 
373514,Expo Hotel Barcelona, No coffee facilities only herbal and tea but no milk sun terrace good only downside is no shaded area or parasol s being rooftop ia amazing but when heat is intense a parasol would have been the answer instead we had to sit inside our rooms Not much to do around hotel bar eating or shopping wise had to taxi 14 euros approx either way to las rambla Good hotel just wrong location, The beds were very comfortable and rooms very clean Staff at front desk poolside and housekeeping very friendly and helpful Cleanliness 10 10 as housekeeping allways washing polishing hoovering but quietly and not in the way 
373515,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Surly staff cold breakfast and not replenished for late breakfast despite being open for another hour tables not cleared promptly lack of staff Very noisy neighbouring room but dealt with by security Expensive drinks at pool bar Needs more sun beds, Location for metro and train nice pool area and life guard vey helpful
373516,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, The rooftop bar has amazing views and is great to sit out in the evenings Staff were really friendly and welcoming especially in the bar pool area Pool assistant was very helpful 
373517,Expo Hotel Barcelona, For the price the room was quite cramped and basic Found the staff to be a bit cold not very helpful and seemed to resent my lack of spanish much more than anywhere else I visited in Spain, Nice and close to the main train station Sants Reasonably short metro trip into the city Rooftop terrace and pool were lovely
373518,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The hotel doesn t offer complimentary water or coffee Cleaning is insufficient we all had an itch when using the sheets , The place is close to the station and away from the crowds
373519,Expo Hotel Barcelona, I ordered a low calorie breakfast through room service and they didn t have the things I ordered which were on the menu e g joghurt and all bran so I got no joghurt and normal corn flakes it s a detail and next time I ll go downstairs for breakfast , Very helpful staff spacious rooms with balcony and there s no better way to start or end a visiting day than with a dip in the swimming pool on top floor 
373520,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Bathroom could be retiled Double bed became a twin bed upon checking in , Good location next to Sants train station Room was fine Balcony was nice No big complaints Shower was good and there was a bath which I enjoyed after a long trip 
373521,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Pool quite small although fine for cooling off which is all I wanted it for We were told that we couldn t leave our stuff on our sunloungers whilst eating lunch in the hotel terrace just under the pool resulting in losing your sunloungers if you get hungry The terrace at night can be loud if you are on floor 9 so if you are wanting a good night sleep before 2am then request a floor lower , Staff helpful had problems with the noise in our first room and the staff were very helpful and moved us the next day Rooms were cleaned every day and towels replaced Views from rooftop were lovely Taxi drivers know the hotel so getting me a taxi back at night wasn t too difficult Near to a metro stop on line 3 as well Nice hotel would stop again 
373522,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The hotel was ok but for the price expected a lot more I had requested a double bed on arrival was given the most basic room with 2 single beds As we arrived quiet late reception were not able to move us to a decent room Our first nights sleep was awful as it was lower level and could here the noise from the street The next however we were moved to a better room with a double bed , It wAs ok Basic
373523,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The fridge was out of order they fixed but it does not work again it s time to be chang d It was very hot in barcelone, Th location IS perfect
373524,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Outside appearance looks like a run down car park breakfast was expensive compared to what you can buy for half the price in the restaurant around the corner, Good position close to the central railway station clean and nice bar area on the roof lots of local non touristy restaurants near by
373525,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Dishes and glass ware dirty in restaurant Weeds around the swimming pool No parasol or shades at the pool, Happy staff Clean rooms Good air conditioning
373526,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Only thing I would say is the breakfast was really not nice I won t judge the whole experience on the breakfast however because everything else was brilliant but if you don t want your tastebuds to die a little then don t get the breakfast , The room was lovely had lots of great facilities free toiletries open air pool and a bar open really late 1am and lovely staff 
373527,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Bar ran out of fresh ingredients eg salad two nights running Someone tried to steal my bag from beside my feet in hotel reception Hotel staff responded quickly though , Friendly staff nice rooftop bar with good menu Great location by Barcelona Sants station easy to get around Ask for a room near the roof for a good view 975 is a corner with balconies 
373528,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The room could have been bigger but I would stay again as so convenient , The hotel is walking distance from the railway station and a safe walk for a solo traveller The room was on the small side but facilities good including pool and bar If it is your first time in Barcelona city tours are available from the bus station just around the corner 
373529,Expo Hotel Barcelona, A bit of mould in the bathroom Shower head kept sliding down but that was a v minor thing , Great to have a pool Bar area was nice staff were very helpful Good location although a 30 min walk to old centre not ideal if you want beaches which we didn t 
373530,Expo Hotel Barcelona, No shadow from the sun on the roof Dated building , Nice urban pool 5 min walk from Sants Estaci Little breakfasts places in the area Friendly staff 
373531,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Swimming pool was closed Very noisy lobby A seat on the balcony would have been nice, Location just 200 metres from trains and buses and a 5 minute walk from Placa d Espana View from room
373532,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Big queue at reception but the staff were very friendly Very strangely shaped room but such is life Shower over bath not walk in unfortunately , Very close to Sants in the centre minutes walk lovely rooftop terrace with bar sun loungers and small pool with lovely views Diverse and nice breakfast worth the money Hotel e mailed me in advance to ask for preferences which was a very nice touch 
373533,Expo Hotel Barcelona, rooms very sparse no chairs on balcony only 1 bedside cabinet 1 straight back chair 1 arm chair no umbrellas or sun shade around the pool , Near railway station 
373534,Expo Hotel Barcelona, the rooms were very old fashioned and in desperate need of upgrading i booked a double room and was given a room with 3 single beds had to pay more for a double room which i booked and paid for thought booking com, i liked that there was a roof top pool with views for barcelona
373535,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, We usually stay here when visiting Barcelona Most tourists arrive by train either from the airport line or from the international line and you can see the hotel as soon as you leave the station The desk staff are universally polite and efficient the rooms are fantastic and the wi fi actually reliable The pool terrace is lovely with a stunning city view 
373536,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Swimming pool too little And not enough transats King size bed is a twin bed indeed so it is a lie Breakfast is good And personal very kind,No Positive
373537,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, The staff were really helpful and also organised exactly the type of room asked for Thank you Definitely worth paying the extra for the higher rooms with a view Quite small but comfortable and the balcony was great 
373538,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Maybe all hotels in Barcelona do not provide kettle but I found it inconvenient , Very spacious room close to the big railway station but quiet balcony view is nice 
373539,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Next to rail and bus hub A large park across the street and weekend market stalls Best buffet breakfast in Barcelona Very helpful staff who helped us find alternate travel on to Marseille during French rail strike Recommend this hotel 
373540,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The room was not up to the standard of what you would expect Old fashion took me back to the 90ties litterally , Location was great Lobby looks great and very nice staff extremely welcoming
373541,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Rooms are small and slightly on the dated side , The location was great for catching a train at Barcelona Sants and the staff were very friendly and helpful The hotel was clean and quiet 
373542,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Beds were uncomfortable balcony was very basic and never got the sun, Good location as a base for Sonar festival Rooftop pool and sunbathing area had great views perfect for our needs Clean and friendly
373543,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Food and drinks expensive The quality of sleep was appalling Although the bed was comfortable enough and the room was clean and tidy the noise from adjacent rooms not only on the same floor but on the floor above was awful As one guest put it The walls and floors are so thin you could hear someone changing their mind , Great staff excellent breakfast and good location 
373544,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Rooms were poor noisy and the beds need updating The terrace barrier is very low I would be worried to leave kids alone at any point , View and close to train station 
373545,Expo Hotel Barcelona, booked deluxe king size room on return checked room only to find out that the room was supposed to be a king sized bed with kettle compared to the room seems we have had a normal double room as we had no kettle and TWO SINGLE BEDS PUSHED TOGETHER Not a king sized Seems that our upgrade was a waste of money ,No Positive
373546,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Staff miserable I also booked a room incl breakfast but they sent a confirmation saying breakfast was extra They did not honour the offer on Booking com A late check in meant I couldnt walk to another hotel Really unpleasant scene with several staff who just were prepared to honour the original agreement , Location near to Sants Rail station
373547,Expo Hotel Barcelona, If you like a firm bed this is good for you but personally it was as close to sleeping on a plank as you can get and neither my wife or I had a decent nights sleep The breakfast was mediocre and on both mornings that we stayed the hot food was tepid at best What really annoyed us however was that the pool and rooftop bar was closed without any notice to accommodate a private function The reason that we booked this hotel was for its proximity to Sants station and that it had a pool We had a full day out in Barcelona and returned to the hotel at about 5pm expecting a relaxing couple of hours by the pool before going out for our evening meal On arrival at the pool we found it was closed and the staff at the bar said that it was because there was a private function that evening Clearly the 20 30 other people in the bar wearing their swimwear were also unaware of this event We ordered a drink and sat down with our books expecting to have are relaxing hour or so but after 10 minutes we were told to drink up and leave Why didn t they warn us before we bought the drinks Relegated to our room we thought we would go out onto the balcony to relax for a while Unfortunately there were no seats on the balcony so that was also not possible I did make the front reception aware of my feelings as we had returned from the other side of the city specifically to lounge by the pool and when a hotel advertises it s facilities then it should make sure that they are available Unfortunately the manager wasn t available to answer my questions There was no prior warning of this event and no discount offered because facilities were not available Very disappointing overall , Very good location for Sants train station and metro lines to reach other areas of the city 
373548,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The room is a bit spartan No wall decoration whatsoever and no real comfort of the sitting area , The efficacy of the room its cleanliness courtesy of staff from receptionist to info ofiice to cleaning ladies Great bathroom also 
373549,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The room doors could be made to close without making so much noise very ease to do and would not cost much , It was our fourth time staying in the Expo hotels in Spain my wife and I will be back we find all we need so no need to go any other hotels All staff are most helpful 
373550,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Nothing really although the balcony could do with rubbing down and repainting , Having a kettle and a fridge in the room was great the rooftop pool and terrace was amazing and the extra touches of slippers robe and the complimentary shampoos and gels even a toothbrush was a bonus 
373551,Expo Hotel Barcelona, AVOID THE BAR AT ALL COSTS Our food was mostly fine but it took three hours to have lunch Having to ask multiple staff members to take an order then for everything from cutlery to ketchup to drinks was a real pain but since half of our food had arrived we felt obliged to stay At one stage the manager seemed apologetic but then seemed to have stopped caring by the time we finally got the correct bill having received one with a few different tables orders on it It was corrected finally with no apology and they asked us if we wanted to leave a tip and seemed annoyed when we said no Drinks were pricey also which would have been fine if acceptable service came with them instead of Fawlty Towers minus the comedic value There are plenty of alternate places in the area don t waste your time , The reception staff were pleasant and accommodating room was clean and comfy 
373552,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The hotel decor is tired and old The TV was really old and did not work very well The rooms need redecorating but that I assume will put the price up , The hotel was exactly where I needed to be and well connected to the metro The overall price quality ratio was very good I appreciated the towelling dressing gown in my room The bathroom was large and very clean The hotel was what I expected so all in all I was contented I was not in Barcelona for pleasure and did not want to spend a great deal on the overnight
373553,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Very noisy at night The walls between rooms were quite poor acoustically and it was very easy to hear the other guests , Good location beside Sants station 
373554,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Was a lovely location and perfect for hopping on off trains and tour bus Roof top bar is brilliant hotel is clean and staff helpful It was my bday and they brought me a slice of cake to my room as a surprise as must have got my dob from passport details 
373555,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Quality was okay but not good enough for the price we paid and the number of stars the hotel receives Almost everything in the hotel except for the lobby is outdated The bed and linen are of very poor quality the bedstead was in shambles and the linen consisted of a few dusty old blankets Staff were friendly yet in my view neither really organized nor really focused on the customer Overall the hotel was probably very good back in the 1970s or 1980s but is now in desperate need of refurbishing , Good location and connection to public transport 
373556,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Staff were rally friendly and answered all our questions There was 4 of us but our friend dropped out of our trip last minute because of unforeseen circumstances and they put an extra bed in our room 
373557,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Not really 4 star We had executive double where we just had a kettle with no cups or tea and coffee , Roof top terrace pool bar and bar food Jordi Galbas on reception was very helpful
373558,Expo Hotel Barcelona, It was a shame not to have any tea and coffee making facilities in the hotel room especially early in the morning and late at night when you don t want to be going to the bar or restaurant to get a hot drink We could have ordered room service but didn t The pool was nice although very cold Shame it closed at 5pm We would have stayed another hour at least On the first evening we ate at the hotel restaurant for ease The pizza we ordered was not good quality for the price We watched the staff wipe down the tables with a blue cloth which had clearly been used over and over again without being rinsed as it smelt awful We almost left but had already placed our order The staff were very pleasant though The other odd thing we found at Expo is that there are no chairs on the balcony And only one chair in the room so only one person could sit outside at a time Shame Overall a nice hotel and with just a few tweaks could be a great hotel Would return , It was quiet at night so we were able to get a good nights sleep The beds are comfy and the room was very clean the sheets and towels were changed every day The reception staff were exceptionally helpful and eager to assist in any way The free wi fi was very good in all areas of the hotel We felt safe in the locality and the metro and buses are only a short walk away The terrace bar is very nice with friendly staff and a good view of Barcelona from there The public areas of the hotel have been decorated to a very modern high standard The breakfast is good value at 9 euros each if you pre order at reception If you don t pre order I believe it is 13 euros But very tasty and a good selection of food and beverages 
373559,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Just an advice for the summertime maybe the swimming pool should stay open for a longer time in the evening , Very close to Sants station Panoramic view from both our room and the bar restaurant on the top terrace 
373560,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Swimming pool works only in sunny days from 11 17 No options to take morning swim before discovering the city You can not order in advance breakfast in the room even in the late evening Welcoming staff but not very flexible to client s needs , Service and Honeymoon and birthday cake surprise in the room Balcony view Great location 
373561,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Near to the train station, Reception Staff I was just a number My executive room was on 8th floor It was a 4 star hotel Although I stayed there before but I realise the standard now is much poor than before There was a kettle in the room but no clean water only from bathroom tap There is tea bags but no milk There is sugar but no coffee What a stupid stupid idea of service I want to make coffee there is no coffee no milk You have to ring for the customer service through your room phone I decided to go out and have coffee While I was leaving I was told a 6 Euro extra bill for telephone services I told them that I had my own mobile I did not touch the phone I was told that I ordered for the customer s service for tea or coffee I told them that if you want I can pay you 6 but when did you brought tea or coffee for me She had no answer and called the manager who waived the charge saying that it was a mistake I thanked them but what a unprofessional attitude of a professional person 
373562,Expo Hotel Barcelona, For a 4 star hotel the King room with balcony was less than basic 2 single beds pulled together after requesting a king size bed Kettle provided without tea coffee No bottled water on arrival No table or chairs on balcony to sit outside On last day the shower hose broke and soaked the bathroom , Sunroof terrace was lovely and staff up there were so nice Food was very good too Bit pricey though Breakfast buffet was great 
373563,Expo Hotel Barcelona, We bought a room online for 2 singles extra bed however when we arrived they told us this is only for 2 people and made us pay an extra 60 Euros, Staff very nice Room was ok I suppose
373564,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Internet access was a bit hit and miss for me a lot of the time , Great location close to Sants Station with easy walk to Montjuic Pla a Espanya and into the city centre Short walk for Bus Tours Both the main companies City Tours and Bus Turistic location on the opposite side of Sants Station which give a hop on off service around all the major points in the city 
373565,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The bed was very uncomfortable only a top sheet and a fibre blanket were provided at this four star hotel Only three pillows were provided for 2 people The hotel smelt unpleasant The Building was tired and had seen better days There were no vegetarian options This hotel should not be rated as a four star hotel, Almost nothing 
373566,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Restaurant food variety seating Furniture and d cor a bit tired Pool shuts at 5pm , Great friendly and efficient staff Nice breakfast Good room Brilliant location for rail bus etc 
373567,Expo Hotel Barcelona, We decided to pay in check out moment On second day in my room found a document Contact urgent receptionist The reason was to pay Why We decide for in check out moment , Hotel was in very good area near central train station and metro Breakfast very good Comfortable room with balcony 
373568,Expo Hotel Barcelona, No first aid kit when I asked Outdated design old fashioned decor , Good location Next to train station Short cab into city costing around 10 15 Let us check in early 
373569,Expo Hotel Barcelona, There was discrepancy in quoted price on the booking com website and what I payed at the hotel It s was only 3 euro more that I had to pay but this does count as misinformation , Location staff room cleanliness
373570,Expo Hotel Barcelona, A bit far from the main city center tourist attractions beach etc in that they were not within walking distance and public transportation was required Also didn t have the fanciest rooms but they weren t bad either , Convenient location near train station easy transportation to other parts of the city from there 
373571,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The room accessories and the increase in price due to a home match between the football team Barcelona and Madrid When I had booked before the match was planned and quoted less price for the room, The location to the train station
373572,Expo Hotel Barcelona, It IS located just off a busy street so with the windows open there is a lot of noise BUT with the windows closed it s fine The walls are a bit thin and you will hear people watching TV etc in the next room For the price breakfast really should be included and whilst a kettle was provided in the room there were no cups coffee etc , Very convenient location near a metro and a train station as well as walking distance to Pla a d Espanya The room was clean and tidy and the bed was comfy Good water pressure in the shower and decent Wifi speed 
373573,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Beds were too hard for our liking The facilities needed a bit of maintenance Glass screen is bathroom difficult to move very minor but a bit of lubrication would have solved the problem squeaky doors soft furnishings a little tired, The staff were friendly courteous and helpful
373574,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The air conditioning wouldn t work in our room as it was too early in the season but depending what temperatures your used to would be nice to have available throughout the year, Staff were very friendly attentive Location of hotel perfect for tourists next to train station hop on off bus stop View from our room was beautiful perfect way to start end the day Would definitely recommend 
373575,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Nothing wrong Everything perfect , Friendly and very helpfull staff Small issues were resolved with lightning speed Awesome breakfast Spacious room Very clean room Clean public toilets near restaurant If and when we visit Barcelona again next year we will come back here for sure 100 
373576,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Superb breakfast you can buy at reception for 9 EURO Perfect location next to Sans Station and nearby Espanya Plaza I liked L shape balcony in my corner room 
373577,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The only slight negative was that the location was a bit far from the beach however its located right next to a train station which came in very handy It was also about a 20 minute walk from Camp Nou so all in all the location was not a massive issue to us and we would not have chosen a different hotel , The staff were fantastic they really went the extra mile to make this such a special stay for us They really stood out to me and my partner Everyone was so approachable spoke great english and was willing to help the whole time The hotel room was beautiful modern and really comfortable to stay in It was lovely to sit out onthe balcony in the evening We even had a little fridge in our room which definitely came in handy We ordered room service twice and both times it was lovely The cleaners also did a lovely job fixing up the room whilst we was out Overall we could not have chosen a better hotel it was perfect for our stay and we were very sad to leave Would strongly reccommend this hotel 
373578,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Room was very sparse and contained a box television I have not seen in 15 20 years Bed was just about acceptable for comfort level It did not appear to be a great neighbourhood to eat and drink in but at least it was only 1 metro stop to the livelier parts of the city , Hotel location was good from the aspect it was only 20 mins from Nou Camp and just 1 metro stop to the heart of the city 
373579,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The bathroom was poorly cleaned I could see dusty footprints on the tiles as if they had done some maintenance and not cleaned after The rooms are so basic old TV small cheap cupboard and basic bed The bathroom is cheaply furnished It is so noisy at night as the walls are paper thin so you can hear other guests and any noise from outside , The hotel is by one of the main stations and the rooms have a balcony with a big window which is nicer for hot summer months 
373580,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Not very helpful staff I had to get up early to leave for business and when I got disappointed about breakfast not being served before seven AM there was no attempt at trying to help out with the situation I ve had other hotels offer to pre pack a breakfast package to go for instance Nothing like that here They generally didn t speak very good English making communication awkward My room was very expensive and very small The size wasn t really a problem per se but it was probably one of the smaller rooms I ve seen anywhere I d have appreciated a little more space especially considering how expensive it was The WIFI while easy to access and stable was quite slow making for instance streaming video difficult , Real WIFI access no hoops to jump through like registering for an account having to reconnect every now and then or anything like that Just a network with a password and you re done The place is nice looking and clean Breakfast was well stocked and tasty Nice view Room had a small terrace Good access to taxis with a taxi stop right outside the main entrance Taxi to from the airport is less than 20 minutes 
373581,Expo Hotel Barcelona, We were satisfied with the hotel It was what we expected from the reviews that we had read prior to booking, It was very convenient for public transport Felt safe even though it was close to main station Great bakery nearby
373582,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, LOCATED PERFECTLY FOR THE TRAIN FROM TO THE AIRPORT FRIENDLY HELPFUL STAFF A SHORT WALK TO THE SPORTS EXPO HALL ETC 15 MIN WALK TO CENTRE
373583,Expo Hotel Barcelona, I booked a family room but was given a twin room with extra bed I was told that they only have that type of room for family However the picture on the booking site appears different , Excellent location 
373584,Expo Hotel Barcelona, I had a really small room I booked a single but asked if they could put me in a modernised room i had been before to view the hotel Bathroom needs modernising , Staff were very pleasant 
373585,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Cost was little bit higher than I expect for that period of the year may be it was caused by big amount of peoples participating in Barcelona Marathon , Support from the staff not ideal but nice location in between Sants railway station and Plaza Espanya Normal variety of food choice for breakfast They made breakfast one hour earier on Sunday to support all running Barcelona Marathon that day 
373586,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The room had no tea or coffee making facilities I had been travelling all day and it would of been nice to have a drink after my shower The room was Bijou and perfectly formed but small, Location was the most important issue for me and it was virtually next to the train station Great
373587,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Same Breakfast option all the week , The hotel is within the walking distance of many turist checkpoints like the magic fountain national catalan meumeum and many more In terms of transportation the train station and the metro are 5 minutes away Also there is a big shopping centre nearby The hotel provide a bargain breakfanst buffet about 8 per person with a good food variety although the food oprion is the same all the week receptionists and security are kind and friendly I really recommend staying there for a lesiure and turism seeker 
373588,Expo Hotel Barcelona, We didn t like the first room number 545 that was given to us on arrival It stank very badly It had nasty unbearable smell of sewage and mould We went back to reception and made a complaint The receptionist didn t look surprised He apologised and offered two separate rooms one double and one single number 903 and 904 for one night and promised to find another family room for the next night what he did and we have been moved to room number 608 night after I can not say anything bad about those rooms , Helpful staff The location of the hotel is excellent near to Barcelona Sants railway station and Plaza de Espana 
373589,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Family room we had could do with being refurbished Room hot but air conditioning not working Ceiling tiles broken shower good but no thermostatic control so took a while to get temperature right Exterior looked dirty and some rendering cracks Lovely feature was room had a balcony but no furniture outside perhaps this is because of the time of year , Being close to train station metro and hop on hop off bus mede this hotel the perfect location 
373590,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The beds were not very comfortable and the pillows were not quite big enough There was also no tea coffee making facilities in the room as a visitor from the UK that was quite important , The hotel was a great location and the staff were extremely helpful abd pleasant 
373591,Expo Hotel Barcelona, New flat screen TVs rather than old style, Friendle efficient staff at check in Quickly dealt with Good size rooms and request re room honoured Cleanliness of room and public area Location for Sants station
373592,Expo Hotel Barcelona, 40 minute walk to the main centre lots of transport links metro about 400m away so that was no problem nothing else negative Excellent hotel staff will go out of their way to help you have a great holiday, Clean warm staff very friendly and helpful made us feel very welcome 
373593,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The room was very tired and dated looked like nothing had been updated since the 90s Basic things you would expect in any hotel were not provided e g they had a kettle but no cups tea or coffee The walls are also paper thin we could hear the conversations of the couple next door , Staff were lovely and a great location
373594,Expo Hotel Barcelona, If there was anything I would say maybe update the bath shower Otherwise there was nothing we disliked , Staff very friendly lovely breakfast with lots of choice Our basic room was absolutely fine large and with a balcony overlooking Sants Station and the hills opposite Very comfortable Lots of toiletries available and new ones each day 
373595,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, The choice of food for breakfast was very good there was something for all tastes The staff were very helpful The tables were cleared quickly All the hotel staff were efficient pleasant and very helpful 
373596,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The cheapest room is very small and has slope if you put a bottle of water close to a bed the bottle roll down to the door It is very noisily and cold as well In general the hotel is fine except of that small room, Everything except of the cheapest room
373597,Expo Hotel Barcelona, We were given a twin bedded room on our second stay and I found the bed very hard and uncomfortable There were some bad scuff marks on one wall It was noisy too and I got little sleep,No Positive
373598,Expo Hotel Barcelona, It s always a pity that tea and coffee facilities are not available , We did not eat in the hotel because of arrival and departure times Though our booking was not on the hotel system there was never a problem 
373599,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Very close to the train station and the national palace Close to 2 subway stations so the transportation is very convenient Great hotel with good facilities Strong recomendation

373601,Expo Hotel Barcelona, I ve upgraded to a King Room and got a big bed but there s nothing else in the room A kettle was provided but no coffee or tea nor cups and saucers not even a bottle of water They are advertising as a 4 stars hotel but we ve been to 3 stars accomms with better offerings , Location is very close to the train station 
373602,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Hotel is quite dated but is clean Not a problem for a city break when the room is only needed for sleeping in and showering etc Traffic noise was audible at night most notably ambulance sirens , Great location just over a mile from Camp Nou which is what we wanted Metro and bus stops nearby Lots of little cafes and restaurants in the area 
373603,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Room was noisy and cold I stayed 4th 5th January 2016 I had to sleep in my fleece to stay warm despite using the one spare blanket provided , Convenient near the station Barcelona Sants from which I was travelling
373604,Expo Hotel Barcelona, No coffee tea making facilities scrambled eggs mad out of powder no real eggs there , Excellent location good choice for breafast big room no noise in the room from the street friendly staff
373605,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Beds were of poor quality Shower difficult to control It s not right in the centre if that s what you re after But the transport links are really good , Everything was in order Room was perhaps a bit outdated but everything was there What was really good was that we booked double bed but they had only twin beds left Instead they upgraded us to executive room with a beautiful view over the castle so we had a fantastic panorama on the fireworks that night 
373606,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, We were travelling from Paris to Alicante and stopped overnight The hotel is ideally located to get to Barcelona Sants station only 5 minutes walk Excellent buffet breakfast Close to the Arenas shops and restaurants where there is a rooftop view over the city 
373607,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Nothing untoward during my short stay , I stayed for only one night and it was all positive I was given a good room at short notice Right next to Sants Mainline Station so convenient for the airport train and just as handy for Metro line 5 for a quick visit to Segrada Familia The staff were very helpful in providing any information I required 
373608,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Mt third visit to this hotel It seems twin double rooms are spacious and lovely but my single although very well fitted was a bit glum and suffered a lot of traffic noise I would stay again though but book a twin for single occupancy , Brilliant location outside Sants rail station for long distance and local trains including the airport Fabulous breakfast spread Speedy check in helpful front desk Good value 
373609,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Not a bad experience but I was travelling in late October It seemed that the air conditioning was turned off only air blowing in not cool air and it was warm in the room I didn t address it with staff as I was too busy enjoying the city most of the time , Love the location rooms are comfortable and have enough space staff is helpful and friendly Being near the Metro and the station made travel so much easier 
373610,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Rooms slightly dated the balcony view was of the car park the bed was two singles pushed together rather than being a proper double king None of these reasons would stop me from staying there again though , Rooms very clean and fairly spacious Good shower Mini bar was reasonably priced Kettle in room Restaurant and communal areas where nice breakfast was good Good transport links I would stay there again
373611,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, The staff have been friendly in the 3 times I have stayed there The rooms are a good size and comfortable Proximity to the Sants Estacio is invaluable 
373612,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Air con not working in bedroom Very bad value and choice for breakfast Could do with a good paint , The location of the hotel Close to main train station and bull ring and also camp nou Go anywhere within easy reach of hotel 
373613,Expo Hotel Barcelona, I had to check out early for my flight and didn t have time for the excellent breakfast Next time , I ve stayed here many times before and it s always excellent I use this hotel when I have an early flight from Barcelona

373625,Expo Hotel Barcelona, I reserve a room for one person but the room is very small as if I reserve a room in 2 stars hotel No way for me to look for another confortable hotel and really a good four stars one because I paid at the day of the entrance , location near Sants Estacion
373626,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Total lack of customer service and flexibility The weather was warm but the pool area closed due to standard opening times The guys in the cafe would not serve us a cup of coffee 10 minutes before opening time even though they did not seem busy at all and we were the only customers around , Close to the Barcelona Sants Central station with connections to airport metro and more
373627,Expo Hotel Barcelona, We were accused of leaving without paying for breakfast We hadn t had any breakfast at all and were hurrying to catch a train Roof top pool was freeeeezing , Close to main railway station Had roof top pool
373628,Expo Hotel Barcelona, I will definately some other time use this Hotel but please don t GIVE me room NR 872 Its so narrow i could hardly move around Adjusting the water temp while showering was so annoying Anyway I did not want to complain kind like OK but , Friendly VERY helpful personel Atmosph re 
373629,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Rooms are extremely outdated Only one other in the entire room to charge any electronics Walls are super thin , Rooms are extremely outdated Only one electrical outler in the entire room to charge any electronics Walls are super thin Toilets don t flush well Staff is super friendly and location is perfect for getting around Barcelona using the train system 
373630,Expo Hotel Barcelona, We had a squeaky bed on our room which maintenance had a look at but never resolved was a little annoying , Fantastic links to transport Super friendly staff and great facilities Roof top pool and bar were brilliant 
373631,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Staff were friendly and helpful Our room was spacious and comfortable The roof top deck has a pool sun patio and a lounge We found the location of the hotel very convenient and returned mid afternoon to chill for an hour in between sight seeing and other activities Located on a Metro line it was very easy to get around the city The hotel is also right by the main train station which made access to the airport very easy 
373632,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Room was quite basic in decor there was no kettle facility however got hot water from bar , Staff rrally nice and helpful Rooms clean Space in room ok Shower was good and powerful Outside balcony good Roof terrace and pool nice space and towels provided
373633,Expo Hotel Barcelona, There was nothing that i really disliked It was funny weird that the tv in my room was the old style CRT TV but i guess if it works why change it lol, Staff were helpful Nice bar and pool area with great views and close to the train station Quick access to the airport and access 2 tour bus nearby 
373634,Expo Hotel Barcelona, a little bit noisy at night but there was some sort of festival on in fairness , Very close to Sants Train Metro Station Rooftop pool and bar very welcome Breakfast is excellent Room was fine for our needs Robes slippers a welcome extra for pool visit 
373635,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, I like the location of the hotel as it is just 5 to 10 minutes taxi drive from Placa di Catalunya Although still situated in Barcelona center you still are not right in the middle of the touristic area so you have time to relax Also the shopping center close by has amazing shops but also an amazing Mexican Restaurant
373636,Expo Hotel Barcelona, I forgot to request a non smoking room Our room reeked of cigarettes , The proximity to the station Good restaurant and roof top bar The staff were very helpful 
373637,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The room whilst clean was in need of an upgrade The furniture was old and worn the bed was hard and the TV was an antique , The staff were friendly and helpful 
373638,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Only one chair in a king size room so nowhere for both to sit No chairs for balcony There was a kettle but no means to make tea or coffee , The bed was big and comfy The staff were helpful and friendly 
373639,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Marble floor cracks showing King size bed was a roller wheel bed that squeekes and moves about Bathroom is dated the king size room is quite small compared to the other standard bedrooms , Location Balcony Public transport Weather Staff Room service Air conditioning Our stay was personalised 
373640,Expo Hotel Barcelona, If you stay in the other part of the hotel and park your car there you have to walk from the car park to your hotel as there is no direct access by lift , Location and good access to metro There are two buildings for the hotel so if you want a good view go for the tallest part which is around twenty three floors high with fantastic views from the restaurant at the top 
373641,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Although there was a kettle in the room we had to ask for cups No spoons No tea coffe sugar sachets provided Only one chair had to ask for another Only one bedside locker for a kingsize bed Bed was very noisy , Minibar was handy room was clean and bright good bathroom safe in room plenty of hot water Staff friendly and helpful but not all spoke english
373642,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Highlight was rooftop pool bar cafe Location just outside main Barca rail metro station meant that everywhere in the city was easy to get to 
373643,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The room was tiny and whilst the bed wasn t too bad given I was provided a room that was advertised at discounted from 500 EUD to 123 EUD it just didn t add up IMHO the room wasn t worth 123 EUD night let alone the 500, Staff were great helped me with the train tickets and changing them the wi fi was particularly handy given I was there on business and the breakfast was really good Easy hotel to find with close proximity to railway station
373644,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The floor of the bathroom was not clean and also the floor on the bedroom and the smell of room as we enter was not pleasant we apologize to tell you this but its one thing to give attention , THe staff and everyone is so kind and friendly
373645,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Avoid a room on the 9th floor The noise from the floor above which is where there s a bar is awful Lots of noise from furniture scraping on the floor until well into the early hours not great when you re trying to get children to sleep , Handy location for the airport as near to the station 
373646,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Queue s for check in out but that s a minor gripe, The location was just right for us good walk to the fountains at night nip around the corner for the big bus Great views from the roof Loved the inside restaurant relax zone
373647,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Family rooms do not actually exist in this hotel We are a family of 4 2adults 2 small children we were also travelling with my mother So we booked a double room for mum and a family room for us and we got a double room and a room with three single beds So my poor mum had the kids and we had the double room however the rooms were not even next to each other Had we only booked a family room we would not have had enough beds This is after I responded to an email from the hotel specifically informing them of our requirements Decor in the rooms were horrid restaurant was severely understaffed and food was not that great Would not recommend at all especially for the price there is a better hotel even closer to the station which is 100 times better and cheaper same price We only stayed for one night as we were travelling through but I certainly would never stay there again even for one night , Close to Barcelona Santa train station
373648,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Some aspects of this hotel must have earned its 4 star rating Unfortunately our room was not one of them Grubby d cor ancient bath and TV and very dodgy dangerous wiring , The location was great for the train station and the staff were very helpful 
373649,Expo Hotel Barcelona, This time we stayed only for one night and the room was considerably worse than when we stayed for 3 nights the week before No kettle nor sponge faulty light switches sub standard TV etc Old looking room and no breakfast like before so it turned out a bad value for money , Same as last week location staff restaurant and pool 
373650,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Old looking room and no breakfast Expensive price taking these points into consideration , Just out of Sants Central train station connecting well with anywhere in the city and the airport Very nice staff and restaurant The swimming pool Kettle and sponge in the room 
373651,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Weak or no Wi Fi connection only very slow at the bar staff at the reception not very nice ignoring guests walls are thin so it s often loud many young people in the hotel so one can hear when they are partying or screaming rather recommended for people who don t care about comfort in the room, Nice swimming pool and jacuzzi bar next to the pool interior yard pretty good breakfast very nice cleaning lady
373652,Expo Hotel Barcelona, We have stayed at this hotel many times but on this occasion we had a very bad experience As we checked in with our three bags at our feet our bag with hand luggage was stolen It was proved by the overhead camera We filed a police report but so far no word from them We will never stay at this hotel again , Convenient location next to the railway station Reasonably priced 
373653,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, I took the final train from Madrid to Barcelona arriving at Sants station around 23 PM The hotel is close to Sants station and it was very safe around hotel 
373654,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Hot buffet food at Breakfast was not kept warm Therefore a bit hit and miss how hot it would be depending on length of time the food had been out when you arrived, Roof top terrace and bar
373655,Expo Hotel Barcelona, They need temperature controls on the showers they are scorching so we couldn t use not greta for hairwashing1, Amazing staff great breakfast lovely pool fab location
373656,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The noise we were unable to sleep one night because of the noise from the next room and woken at 3AM another night when the young men next door came back put on the television singing etc, We liked the pool on the roof and the Terrace bar
373657,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The light switches were at the top of the bed right above our pillows and we turned on the lights too many time a night by mistake which was pretty annoying And the bed was kind of all shaking when one of us was turning from one side to another , Everything Right next to Sants Station 7 min walk to Plaza Espania and Magic Fountain all kind of restaurants and cafes and markets and fast food places around the hotel They have all the possible amenities including bath robe and slippers which was a nice touch and a kettle for coffee tea in the room which is very unusual for Spain The staff if more than polite and kind and helpful We had room with a terase which was very nice The room is pretty big and comfortable The rooftop bar has an amazing view of the city especially of the Montjuic Don t miss it And the pool is reasonable for a rooftop pool bigger than in most other hotels We were very impressed about everything for the money we paid great value Next time we re in Barcelona we ll definitely get back here 
373658,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Air conditioning on full all night I was freezing cold in bed and couldn t sleep My elderly friend was at the other end of the building on a different floor VERY inconvenient and not what you expect when you book two room together , Breakfast was good 
373659,Expo Hotel Barcelona, we were put on different floors on opposite sides of the building which was very inconvenient for my elderly friend despite asking two rooms near each other , Breakfast was good 
373660,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Bed was decent but a little hard for my taste Small TV Not even flat screen old school tube TV on a stool , Right Next to Sants Train Station Perfect for those spending just a couple of nights or who need something close to train station airport Really Nice Clean rooms with great bathroom and shower Free Fast Wifi Desk in room Ample Storage Space Balcony some are a little small but we had a corner room with a really nice balcony that went all the way around the corner 
373661,Expo Hotel Barcelona, Paid for a king room 2 single beds pushed together Not impressed No attention to detail Extremely plain room and not cosey at all Very sub standard Pool area was awful Was so disappointed with it Views and area are not too nice either, Staff were lovely Rooftop bar was nice

373663,Expo Hotel Barcelona, The quality was far away from of a four star hotel even hardly reached of a three star one Breakfast was inedible the selection is wider in a small pension ,No Positive
373664,Expo Hotel Barcelona, We were charged 19 euro for the mini bar which we did not use and repeated attempts to sort this out on the phone and email have not been responded to at all I still do not know yet what I was supposed to have used from the minibar , Location
373665,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, From start The hotel accommodated my requests via email before our holiday The hotel itself is two minutes walk away from Sants station but don t be put off from this we heard no noise from our room On arrival we were an hour and a half early not expecting our room to be ready I wanted to ask if we could leave our bags at reception for safe keeping to which I was told we could check in as our room was ready The lady that dealt with us at reception was lovely very friendly and welcoming as were all staff that we met The room that we were allocated was on the 9th floor as i requested to be close to the roof top pool The balcony offered fantastic reviews and the room had everything we needed If I was picky I could say that tea coffee facilities would have been nice and an updated TV too but we weren t on holiday to stay in the room We didn t use the bar or restaurant we only used the pool on one occasion and we weren t disappointed It was quite busy around 5pm but the rooftop area was big enough to offer you your own space without feeling crowded The life guard on duty offered us serveral towels and was a pleasant chap My two sons loved the pool The pool itself is quite small but at one point I counted around 10 people enjoying it without it feeling like sardines On returning from our adventures each evening we returned to a cleaned room with fresh linen on every day and fresh towels and it just felt nice credit to the cleaning staff As i said before we didn t use the restaurant for breakfast or dinner We went to some local eateries all within a couple of minutes walk I would recommend El Pati for dinner the tuna steak and paella is out of this world and around 8 each which was a steal El Pati is opposite the hotel and there is a little pastry sandwich shop around the corner from the hotel two pastries for 1 and they were devine 
373666,Expo Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, The only good aspect of this hotel is the roof terrace and a pool which you won t use much if you want to visit the city We never had breakfast in the hotel as it was way too expensive Just outside the hotel there are lots of cafes where you can grab a much cheaper breakfast Room old and not too clean We had to change room the second night due to a sewage smell coming from the toilet Not sure how the hotel is classified as a 4 star hotel
