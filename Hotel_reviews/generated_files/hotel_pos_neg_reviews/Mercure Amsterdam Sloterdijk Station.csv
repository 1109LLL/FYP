382857,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station,No Negative, The staff and very friendly and helpful the location is perfect away from the main city centre but easily accessible by public transport couldn t fault the hotel in anyway would without a doubt 100 recommend this hotel 
382858,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, One of the male staffs were quite rude from our arrival, The room was very comfy and was perfect for a 2 night stay Wish we could have stayed longer Location is also great since it is near the station D
382859,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, We missed our shuttle to the airport from the hotel because we were late for 10 minutes We were fine to the fact that the hotel driver had to leave us but the attitude of the staff towards us were definitely not nice The way they talk is annoying and rude maybe they weren t happy that we were a bit late but we were not even angry or complaining We just wanted extra help to get other means of transport to airport So MINUS point for service this time , Hotel is close to the airport good for people traveling on tight schedules Room was clean bathroom was nice 
382860,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Some of the staff were not cooperating and not welcoming and after 10 pm there was no room service for food , Location was excellent which was just near the train station and alot of restaurants 
382861,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, I have stayed in other mercures and the breakfast wasn t as varied The make your own coffee machine was in an awkward position and there was always a queue In previous hotels the staff bring you coffee pots to your table and this machine meant we didn t get to enjoy our meal together as one of us was in a queue for a good portion of the meal for a hot drink They need to refill food a little quicker as the fruit salad was mainly grapes and a little disappointing , We enjoyed the shower and the pillow menu as well being close to the station for ease of travel into central Amsterdam It was a nice and modern hotel with electric buttons to press for clean up or do not disturb as well as enough lifts etc Staff were helpful 
382862,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Free breakfast with the booking would have been amazing , This is my second stay at the hotel great location and a great place to relax after a full day in the city 
382863,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, It would be better if there were a refrigerator in the room and if the room floor was made in wood instead of carpet The cost for breakfast was very expensive , The confort of the room and bathroom The easy way to get the railway station 
382864,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, We had some bad luck with a room with bed bugs but the staff was very attentive and accommodating to move us and adjust some charges They really did care about our experience , Property location was by a main train station and close to a food store Rooms were decent size and fairly efficient Nice bathrooms 
382865,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, We had booked two rooms as being a family of 5 and were given rooms in different floors We tried to suggest different options but very little understanding and willingness from hotel Would not recommend the hotel for other purposes than short business trips as location very convenient ,No Positive
382866,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Location was 6 kms by bike from station but nice ride through park and we knew that when we booked reception staff very variable 50 very good and other 50 were terrible and unable to help with our questions about Amsterdam and local transport, Spacious modern room great bathroom with rain shower comfortable bed our room away from building works was very quiet good airconditioning good nearby public transport
382867,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Nothing to dislike , The bed was very comfortable a great choice for breakfast and the hotel was very quiet On arriving at the hotel the guy on the desk was very helpful and all the restaurant girls were very polite So close to Sloterdijk Station no need for a taxi at Amsterdam Central 
382868,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, First impact with elevators was confusing There s no button inside you must call from outside choosing your floor then your lifter is served This is only unlikely issue I can say but it s actually just first impac Once you learn how it works it s a great stuff , Amazing breakfast with a lot of choices and excellent quality of food and beverages Served in the restaurant at 8th floor with a gorgeous sight over the surroundings All the staff is very kind competent and effective And always smiling gently Thanks for all I ll come back for sure
382869,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, I hate the chair inside my room We always got hurt whenever we step close into the chair and it was hurt, Very close to the train station and not crowded
382870,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, They are quite strict about the times for breakfast Not a touristy part of town There s a EuroSpar and the train station and mostly industrial , 6 minutes on the train to Amsterdam Central Better quality hotel for less cost than in Amsterdam Good breakfast 
382871,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Nothing bad at all about this hotel, Very good location Next to the station and one stop from the centre Hotel was very clean and modern 5 star service in a 5 star surrounding Loved our stay hete 
382872,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station,No Negative, They were able to accommodate early check in and slightly late check out Location is strategically great just a short walk to the station for trains trams and buses Amazing shower and sleep experience 
382873,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, There was an annoying display touch panel that you had to press for room cleaning and do not disturb which glowed really bright when you turned the lights out to sleep We stuck a couple of plasters over it to dim it lol Ask for a higher floor if possible we were on 2 and it wasn t that private unless blinds down and curtains drawn , Nice hotel and stylish room I would have expected water available and three nights in June was almost 500 so breakfast thrown in would have been nice Super comfy and good sized bed and room was spacious staff were good and welcoming Close to the station which was super handy and even though close to the road the room was quiet But I am being picky here very good hotel 
382874,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, No windows the windows in the room were locked Luckely they made an exception and opened it because we were staying for 20 days , We stayed at this hotel for 18 nights and will definetely come back again The hotel is very clean quite comfortable and most importanatly staff are super super nice especially Evelyn They are always ready to help you with a big smile The bed and pillows were very comfortable Dinner at the Restaurant was very tasty 
382875,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Sometimes the lifts became confusing with many people trying to use them but mostly fine , The bed was very comfy and a spacious room with good shower and TV 
382876,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station,No Negative, The bathroom was lovely location superb super close to the train station very convenient Free coffee tea loved that there was no extra charge for the fridge ironing board and safe Air conditioning was a life saver Also the option for room service was very convenient aswell 
382877,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The mini bar in the room was empty , Comfort bar and peace are the advantages of this hotel The hotel is clean and in a great location Only 20min from the center All transport facilities are 2min away from the hotel 
382878,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, More restaurants near to the hotel would of been lovely, I loved everything about our stay here staff was fantastic hotel room was beautiful Location in a great place easy two minute walk to the train station to other destinations Would highly recommend my stay here and will be returning
382879,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Room was little too hot even with air con on but it was bearable , Bed was extremely comfy plenty of English channels to watch staff were extremely helpful room and view was beautiful spar right outside and very short walk to the train station 
382880,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The corridors smell bad The rooms have a weird grey full length mirror that you can t see through They don t provide complimentary water Didn t offer a free large city map , The location was decent but certainly not city centre in the sense that it s close to a train station and a convenience store It costs about 7 per person to get to the train station from the airport so if there is alot of you you re better off getting a taxi works out cheaper If you take the train you can literally see the hotel when you exit the train station To get to central Amsterdam you need the tram 12 change to tram 13 or 14 at admiral or williem stops When you have done this once it s pretty straightforward You just do the reverse when you want to get back I d also recommend not buying the day ticket coz one walks alot and only needs a single ticket to get into Amsterdam and another single to get back works out cheaper The rooms were clean and all things you need for a comfortable stay were provided except full range of toiletries I e moisturiser They darken up well at night If you re OK with the cons it s a relatively decent stay with no cause for issues 
382881,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station,No Negative, There is a supermarket and cafes 100m from the hotel Next to the bus tram Metro Train station Very clean Good location Modern facilities Logic prices at the restaurant 
382882,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Our bathroom fan did not work so well , Perfect location easy to navigate to the city or regional towns by train Impressed by the level of quality and food presentation of their room service Afternoon sun flooded our room creating a nice ambiance Quality amenities and well built rooms 8th floor restaurant breakfast has great panoramic view great place to have a nice continental buffet breakfast To start the day Would return again highly recommended 
382883,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The low level hotel building sign needs to be improved we walked straight past the hotel the first time There is a massive sign on the roof but that s on level 8 In the daytime this is not so obvious as it s not lit up For travellers It s the first building on the left after you cross the road from the train station , Helpful staff cleanliness throughout breakfast was impressive with a large selection of choice good air conditioning and good wifi even in our room on 6th floor and location is perfect only one stop from Amsterdam central station 5 mins 6 Euro s day return 
382884,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The front desk did not check the CCTV footage to check who took away my jacket worth 50 US Dollars inspite of my request I lost it at the time of check in We were tiered after a long journey from Bengaluru India That is it , The Breakfast was made to our need The staff were friendly All in all it was yummy 
382885,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Poor lighting very dark rooms Unable to see self in mirror No lock on bathroom door , Excellent location right near sloterdijk train station Friendly staff Lovely sky bar Clean comfy rooms
382886,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Can t complain We would have ordered a cheeky room service if it weren t so pricey, We arrived and instantly worried how much we had spent because it looked sooo nice and posh No need to panic just good value Lovely staff both on desk and porters who offered advise on enjoying our stay we got a free upgrade to a privilege room The bed and walk in shower wet room was huge and amazing and luxurious Best nights sleep in months no noise at all and a Nespresso machine to wake us up both mornings Very modern decor with warm relaxed feel and lovely art everywhere Location wise we were right next to the train station which connected us straight to the airport and we were a 20minute cycle ride to the city center and only 5minutes from parks and climbing centres 
382887,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The first team of receptionists when we first got there our rooms were not ready yet so we left our bags in custody were very very nice and friendly We rented bikes In the afternoon when we returned to the hotel at around 8pm the new receptionists were NOT nice because they did not want to honor what the earlier receptionists offered to us regarding the 24hour bike rental period We were told we could use the bikes during a 24 hour period of time meaning since we rented them at almost noon we could still use them the next day until noon But the afternoon receptionists said we couldn t and were rude about explaining why not to There were a man and a woman It was obvious the man was not happy about our claim When we ask him to please give us our luggage he just directed us to the room and pointed at our luggage so we could go and pick them up ourselves Not that we couldn t do it by ourselves but his behaviour was not nice at all We couldn t park our bikes because there was not enough space so that same man said he would do it for us and later will bring the bike keys back to our rooms But after him and his boss woman decided not to honor our rental period and we complained about it he later called our room and told us we would have to go downstairs to get the keys opuselves We ended up not using the bikes the next day , the location is wondeful next to the train station 
382888,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, No problems, The hotel is right next to the train station Not that you could hear anything with the sound proof windows which meant it was easy to travel to and from the airport and into Amsterdam if wanted We walked it in on Saturday evening Brilliant view from bar breakfast room Great friendly staff Couldn t do enough for us Beautiful big clean room 
382889,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The ceiling fell through in the middle of the night 3am due to a faulty air conditioning unit Reception did not answer my call and was uable to change room or report the incident until I checked out There imediate offer was to offer a reduction in the cost of my room but I have refused to pay for hotel room This is reasonable and they were lucky that the ceiling fell on the floor and not me The emails from the hotel have further aggrevated the compaint as they have said I am holding them to ransom as I have refused to pay for the nights accomodation This I beleive is not unreasonable and I should not have been expected to pay anything Opinions would be welcome ,No Positive
382890,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station,No Negative, The hotel is gorgeous The room is clean and tidy breakfast on the top floor is very good view from the window is great The place where the hotel is located is very comfortable for transfer and the place is calm 
382891,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The hotel is 30 minutes from the city center unless you take the train then it s less than 10 minutes to Amsterdam Centraal The area around the hotel is industrial clean but boring There s nothing to do in the vicinity In my opinion the hotel is severly overpriced but it was the best we could do on a short notice and on an especially busy week end The toilet s door does not close properly and I personally do not like the open shower though it was working properly I don t like that type of shower , Excellent breakfast comfortable bed helpful staff Clean but very simple and small room 
382892,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Slow check in one room was smelly and has to move Issue with locks on another room and got locked out for over an hour , Comfy bed big room lovely shower good breakfast

382894,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, You could make a coffee or tea in your room but there was no coffee provided The hotel provided a few bags of green tea but no black tea Fortunately there is a supermarket next to the train station so I was able to buy whatever I needed , The location is very convenient The Sloterdijk train station is within a short walking distance It takes only 5 minutes by train to reach the city center The hotel is modern the room is rather small but it is cozy and comfortable It was also very quiet The reception desk personnel is friendly attentive and accommodating I would definitely stay at this hotel again

382896,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Menu selection in restaurant was limited but food was good , Showers were heavenly Bathrooms are nice and clean Beds were adequate Three in a room was pretty tight but ok Easy to get to transportation but there really is nothing close by for restaurants or shopping 
382897,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Nothing Though we feel that the price was a little pricey given the size of the room maybe because is the tulip season , Location is great 5 minutes to centraal and 10 minutes to airport by train Bed is comfortable and the staffs were very friendly Wifi is very fast too We got vouchers to spend in the bar for choosing not to have our room cleaned during our stay 
382898,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Brunch was a bit pricey , This hotel is a great alternative to the expensive downtown hotels only one stop away by train and right in front of the train station too Clean friendly staff and very nice accomodations i would gladly recommend this hotel 
382899,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, On arrival you are charged a city tax on top of your room rate which we were unaware of , Very comfortable room very clean and spacious Excellent bathroom facilities also 
382900,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Room was small and very hot unable to open window for any fresh air Bedside tables would have been a plus, Hotel in a quiet location just outside the city Nearby train stop to get into Amsterdam centre within 5 mins 
382901,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Was easy access into central Amsterdam but would like to have been a little closer, Shower was amazing rooms were very clean and bed was so comfy Liked all of the coffee and tea that we got with the room Staff could speak great English and we re very helpful We only had a late flight on our last day but the staff were kind enough to let us leave our bags all day until we had to go to the airport Would stay here again 100

382904,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, the bar is part of the restaurant So if you are having a late drink you are among diners Feels a bit odd as used to a separate bar area , room was clean and good size Bed comfy Very modern Location good for offices in that area

382909,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, We had such a drama on checking out I booked rooms for friends and myself both paying separately when we checked out However when I tried to pay and check out of my own room my card failed and I was forced to pay by my personal payment card On checking with the bank I had been charged twice for the room So I returned to the hotel and explained the situation that I had been charged twice The gentleman who dealt with my concern explained this is normal procedure That the hotel take an authoritative payment blocking money and then it is returned however it can take a number of days to return the payment not allowing me to complete the actual transaction for payment on the room I couldn t quite believe this was standard practice and therefore asked to speak to the manager No manager available Surprising so who would help He then said there was a duty manager available why he wouldn t be suggested in place of the manager I do not know However the duty managed came to reception and immediately resolved the situation Fantastic Apologised for the problem agreed I was right and everything was put right He was kind enough to extend hospitality to my friends and partner who had been waiting some time whilst I argued with receptionist Who was more interested in 4 girls that were walking out the hotel than allowing me to explain the situation This is purely a mistake made on check out and of course took some time to resolve however I wanted to extend my thanks to the duty manage in his swift and very lovely approach to resolution This wouldn t put me off using this hotel again Although perhaps the desk staff could benefit from additional training , The hotel was of a very good quality the rooms looked lovely A tad small but high standard finish cleanliness of the room was great and the shower was lovely The upstairs restaurant was brilliant we arrived late and they did their best to accommodate us The hotel is in a really good location 2 minute walk maybe less to the station It was a 6 minute journey to Central and 11 minute to Schiphol 
382910,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, We travelled at the busiest time of the year and the price was so high The hotel doesn t have dresssing gown which was really inconvenient The shampoo want really good which made our hair really dry If conditioner can be provided that would be really good , The location is amazing and the staff are so friendly They even helped me to print my boarding pass 
382911,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station,No Negative, The location of the hotel was brilliant just 5 minutes away from Amsterdam central and 10 minutes away from the airport The train was easy enough to navigate your way there and back which was great for us first timers The hotel is easy to locate in a quiet and safe place which was brilliant The room was amazing we had superior had a beautiful view with a great bathroom especially the shower The room was always cleaned when asked and being able to adjust the temperature in the room was a bonus The hotels cleanliness was spot on and the staff were friendly and always there to help with giving directions and maps to help find your way around Amsterdam I honestly have nothing bad to say and would definitely recommend to anyone 
382912,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The room was small for three persons We would constantly bang our toes and knees into the furniture The second bed was a cot for a 5 11 14 year old Uncomfortable The cot was located right by the so while he was in bed his feet and the sliding mattress would block the door from opening It was CRAMPED , It was quiet with good location Close access to train station

382915,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Breakfast was rich and tasty but exactly the same every day Maybe not important for guests that stay for 1 2 days but boring for those who stay for more than 4 nights Table lamp didn t work well asked the staff to fix no one cared about it , Modern beautiful interior design of the hotel the restaurant and the room comfortable room and all we needed to feel at home Superb location 1 stop by train from Amsterdam central 3 minutes walk distance from the station

382923,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station,No Negative, When we checked in the staff noticed it was my birthday and they put a card and a slate saying happy birthday in our room which I though was so thoughtful The room was very clean and comfortable and in a great location as it is only 5 mins from the centre of Amsterdam by train or tram

382930,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, View from room was more of a commercial industrial estate although there was a lot of natural light I was not offered assistance to take my luggage upstairs but I also didn t ask so I m not sure if that option is available Kitchen in hotel not open late so no late night snacks but there is a train station with fast food convenience store less than 3min walk away , Compared to other restaurants there was a greater range of food Initially I thought the price was a bit steep so didn t include it in the initial booking but after seeing the food offered I was happy to pay All you can eat Buffet style service Restaurant open until a good time with slightly extended opening times on weekend Room service breakfast orders accepted until 2am however 4 room delivery charge The order card did not have all the options that were served in restaurant Food offered variety of fresh breads pastries fresh fruit juices hot drinks eggs made to order 1 2 3 eggs in various styles e g Boiled fried scrambled sausages beans popper pancakes selection of cereals cold meats pork non pork options cheese fresh salad porridge museili dressings yogurts dried fruit seeds and Lactose free soya options for milk Very clean restaurant I came in the afternoon and they cleaned for almost 2hrs thoroughly And probably more as they were already cleaning when I arrived More of a limited lunch menu Very decent portion sizes I couldn t finish it but it wasn t wastefully large Friendly service Restaurant has a bar which opens until 11 30 Has a view of the surrounding area although this is a view of the train station and various buildings but a lot of natural light not buildings blocking Hotel services Earlier check in was made available Luggage hold alternative if no rooms were available earlier thank check in time Printer and computers free to use in lobby Fast speedy lifts Asked to sign as part of check in documents a document declaring that you will not use drugs on premises Very good train transport links Frequent trains kiosk with help desk also present in this station Lifts in station for easier access to platforms with luggage Room Waterfall shower or hand held shower head option Nice room design Moderate size

382932,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The price of the room was more on the day then when I had booked it originally However everything else about the hotel was exceptional , I loved the walk in shower
382933,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station,No Negative, Location of the hotel was great 1 stop to centre trains every five minutes would definitely go back Though didn t really like the sky bar staff in the hotel are friendly and happy to help
382934,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, I didn t like how you get the lift Sometimes it was difficult to get to the right floor I also didn t like the chat that was going on between the ladies at the bar in the restaurant in the morning they were talking personal stuff and I could not help overhearing without wanting to The bed was a little too soft for my liking , The bathroom was lovely I really liked the walk in shower unit The reception staff were very pleasant and helpful 
382935,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Breakfast Buffet was poor Standard price is ridiculous and the promo price we got it at was still too much We got there 15 mins before breakfast was over and the food was dead as if was cooked 3 hours ago and wasn t fresh The food should be fresh regardless of what time to arrive The selection was not great and boiled eggs were cold Would advise against the breakfast here , Staff incredibly helpful and helped us with transport and even pointed the best bars to head towards The staff also bent over backwards to ensure we printed out boarding passes as there was a problem on the communal computer Room very clean and tidy 
382936,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The room could have been cleaner there was a weird stain on the wall that looked a bit gross and there were stains on the bed side tables The temperature was set to cooler than i d like but once we figured out the aircon controls it was perfect , Staff were lovely very helpful and friendly Modern hotel with good quality fixtures and fittings Location wasn t central but the train station was so close that it didn t really matter The rooftop bar was really cool and good value for drinks

382939,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, We arrived quite late and chose this hotel as we knew we wouldn t be travelling into the city that night We wanted a nice meal and bit of luxury Annoying that we were only told after check in that the Sky bar restaurant was closed Told at reception this was due to refurbishment but later we found out from staff it was due to staff walkout Atmosphere and morale in the bar was very flat and low Only stayed for one drink and went back to our room to enjoy our supplies from the supermarket , Location to the station and mini supermarket was excellent just one stop to central station Hotel room was lovely and beds very comfortable 
382940,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The tiles towards the bottom of the shower area was a little bit dirty but nothing major , Got upgraded to the family room for free upon arrival For someone that travels alot this is one of if not the best hotel I ve ever stayed in Great value for money and location was perfect one stop on the train and your in central Amsterdam
382941,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Staff at the breakfast in the morning were rude the beds were quite hard and uncomfortable and the key for our room kept deactivating there was also a long wait to check in, Good location and nice hotel and rooms
382942,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, We would have liked a bath with our room but no big deal very nice shower , Merel hope we ve spelt her name right was really helpful with our check in out and helping us get to know the city Our visit was all the more easy because of her knowledge and help The hotel was just what we were after somewhere comfy after long days exploring the city 
382943,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Should include breakfast in the cost of the room Nothing else to be disliked , Excellent location right next to the train station Comfortable beds and bathroom and the room Quite and clean Reasonable price 
382944,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, There was not enough milk for the tea , The staff were really friendly the hotel was very easy to travel to and the room was very comfortable and clean Also liked that the fridge was empty so we could put our own food and drinks in there instead of it being stuffed with mini bar items 
382945,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, first the double bed two single beds put together which has given me the difficulty to sleep i swear i didnt sleep the first night i had back and neckpain the pillows are square not the usual shape of a pillow which were also either very big or very flat pls improve that the other thing is the receptionist made us pay the water that she said we will find in the fridge but was empty when we entered the room last thing is the bathroom light is too dim it was quite hard to do your make up there , We really liked the location of the hotel it is one train away 8 10mins from the amsterdam central which is perfect for those who would like to rest well after a long day Our room was at the 6th floor if i could remember it well it was very quiet aside from our last night in the hotel maybe that was past 3 in the morning and i heard someone moaning quite loudly LOL didnt last long so that should be fine i think haha then the staffs were polite and helpful the room was big enough for two persons i really love the rain shower in the bathroom and the room was clean during our stay 
382946,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station,No Negative, Everything about this hotel was lovely the rooms were very well decorate and the bed was very comfortable the location was perfect only a six minute train journey to Amsterdam central staff very helpful and friendly aswell Would highly recommend this hotel anyone 
382947,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Breakfast staff are lazy and unhelpful Slow to clear empty plates off small tables WItresses stand chatting in the corner They let down the rest of the excellent staff Breakfast expensive for what it offers , Fantastic quiet rooms Modern decor Underground parking Train to city centre takes exactly 5 mins Sky Bar on 8th floor has beautiful views at night Evening restaurant staff are really nice and helpful Everyone speaks perfect English 
382948,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, We stayed here only a few months ago and were amazed at how lovely it was but so much seems to have chnaged on our second visit Cleaner only ever made the bed but never cleaned the sticky coffee stained side table or mirror once No cocktails were at the bar no more complimentary water or biscuits Heaters were not working , Love the room layout shower and gym Staff are friendly and helpful at times 
382949,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, We paid for a privilege room however our bed was two singles pushed together I think if you are paying more it should at least be a double bed , My lovely little birthday note and cake Staff were extremely helpful and we went all over amsterdam I was worried we would be too far out but we was 5mins on train away from the centre Get a day 2 3day pads for tram bus and train It s so worth it Don t get a taxi anywhere Trains are quicker Highlight was Anne Frank s house worth the trip 
382950,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The price of breakfast 22 euros is a very high price We solved this by buying our own croissants fresh orange juice and coffee at the nearby Spar and eating in our rooms we calculated we had 8 breakfasts for the price of one at the hotel , Beds extremely comfortable rooms spacious restaurant very good staff friendly and helpful Good location very close to public transport 
382951,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Nothing, Location is amazing Away from the noise and crowds of the city centre but only 5 minutes away on the train which runs every 10mins So easy to get to from the airport

382957,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, One particular lady in the restaurant was very rude food was perfect service was sloppy My partner was given his meal but mine was given to the table next to us By the time that my meal came my partner had finished his meal Was told that they would not take his meal away and put under the heat lamp as it wouldnt taste as nice not really our issue Also was repeatedly told that they were under staffed once again as a paying customer not really our problem sorry , The maintenance guy and reception staff were great Reception amended our bill based on the poor evening service 
382958,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, I travel A LOT and I can say this was the worst stay ever specially the staff I forgot the receptionist name but I remember Maria or something She treated us like school boys without any respect or decency or professionalism Luckily a gentleman receptionist called Nick was present and was very nice man who helped a little bit This Maria or Sira or whatever should have proper training or sit at home , nothing
382959,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The reception staff were rude and unhelpful and the worst thing was even though you prepaid through this site you were asked to produce the credit card you initially paid with Luckily I had mine but hadn t seen this under your terms and conditions and four other people checking in had not seen it either and didn t have their initial credit card so they had to be refunded and repay which was causing extreme problems This has put me off using booking com in future and all the reception staff need sacking they are really so rude , Modern rooms and a great shower
382960,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Car park should be free for hote customers , Very clean Car park available Comfy bed They have everything you need from a good value hotel Very satisfied

382964,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Reception staff could be a bit more friendly and helpful especially to tourists who not speak the local language they were very curt and abrupt with all my enquiries , nice spacious rooms with amazing bathrooms Excellent service and reception at the sky bar Close to train and tram stations 
382965,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, We wanted twin beds rather than double but it never materialised in spite of the promise The area around the hotel is a bit of a concrete dead zone but we spent all of our time in the centre anyway , The rooms were comfortable Short walk to the station or to the tram so convenient to downtown Easy to park paid and very easy to access motorway in and out 
382966,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The Sky bar was very impressive but very expensive Still worth visiting for a nightcap though , The staff were really friendly and helpful from checking in early to leaving our luggage to be collected later after checking out The rooms bedroom and shower room were great Location was excellent couldn t ask for better

382969,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station,No Negative, Although the property is not located in the city centre access to the city is quick and easy by train The hotel is located within walking distance from the station one can see the station from the hotel so even with luggage this should not be a problem The hotel room was large and comfortable with a kettle and coffee tea A desk and chair made it possible to do some work or share some holiday pictures one Facebook The staff were very friendly and assisted me where possible 
382970,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station,No Negative, The hotel is very conveniently located directly opposite Sloterdijk station the room was spacious and impeccably clean and the staff were extremely friendly 
382971,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, It would have been handy to have a smoking room especially for the later time of night instead of going outside the main entrance all the time but not a major problem as you find this in most hotels , The room itself was very nice modern and comfortable and shower room was excellent Staff are very friendly Not a bad location only 7 mins on a train and train station is across the road from the hotel Also there is a Spar across from the hotel which is very handy for drinks and snacks I would stay here again definitely

382974,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, It was all good didn t get a chance to try out the rooftop bar for the view something to look forward to on next visit Can t comment on the breakfast food either at this point, Big roomy corner 2nd floor room with a view while not a scenic view as such it was a lovely urban night view with windows on two walls huge bathroom very comfortable bed pillows Great monsoon shower hot good pressure Kettle and mini fridge in room Tea coffee provided Location Only 6mins into the bustle of Amsterdam Centraal 10mins other direction to Schiphol Possible to leave luggage there for a while after checking out Staff are friendly courteous and nothing is too much trouble all done with a smile accommodated me with early check in storing case on leaving I have stayed in city centre on previous occasions it s fine once or twice to try it out but invariably expensive and cramped and those vertiginous staircases are not for the faint hearted Mercure is clean modern spacious calm and excellent value it s well worth one hop on the train I would not hesitate to return here 
382975,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Not enough milks for us for hot drinks And sometimes a bit dusty in places and a patch of uncleaned side board by the kettle The poor handling of their power cut on the second night which lasted what felt like forever , The bed was excellent The room was luxurious and the bathroom was fantastic Couldn t fault it we felt very comfortable 
382976,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The water pipes in the walls of the bathroom were extremely noisy Every few hours there would be a rushing sound that persisted even at night Not sure if this was specific to our room but very odd and annoying , Location is in between the airport and the city centre so very easy to get to both using public transportation but much cheaper to stay at than a hotel in the city centre Rooms were relatively large clean and well decorated

382983,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The views from the rooms aren t great due to the commercial location of the hotel but that s to be expected , Excellent location only 7 mins from Central Station one stop on the train 30 mins on a bus all readily accessible from the hotel within a couple of minutes walk No tram but there is a metro which takes a little longer Cycling could be an option and the hotel has bikes you can hire Breakfast was very good with a fairly good selection of continental and cooked options Room was clean spacious and had everything I needed including a safe and iron Would stay again

382992,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Shower s water temperatures keep changing every few second which made showering uncomfortable The hotel only has one restaurant and it was closed during our stay therefore we had to go walk in yhe rain to find another restaurant which wasn t too easy since most of the restaurants open after 4pm , The interior of the hotel was beautiful and the staff was friendly The hotel is quiet and modern 
382993,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The double bed is bad In fact there s no double bed in my room they put together two single mattresses and a topper If you are with your partner probably you will start to fall between the mattresses like a valley lol Yep it bothered me a lot , It is close to the train station There s a spar just on the opposite side of the road The rooms are very silent It s grand alright
382994,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Smokers outside should be a designated spot or shelter like in England because they stand just outside doors spit on ground too u have to walk through it Not nice for a none Smoker they spit a lot because of smoking weed So should have a special area to go to this spoils a perfect hotel, Great location only 2 stops on train from airport 1 stop into centre of Amsterdam hotel modern clean very spacious rooms everything you need staff excellent always polite helpful very comfy bed love the bathroom sky bar nice to chill in evening looks pretty high up at night would definitely stay again good value for money too

383072,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The location was industrial which was not obvious from website so i was dissapointed as i visualised it being in the museum quarter The bathroom shower didnt have a door which made it difficult to use The dark colour in the coridoor was creepy and depressing Felt like i was in a tunnel , The property was new and staff was very friendly and helpful 
383073,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, No instructions to use the safe so had to ask at reception Had to ask for my coffee machine coffee cartridges to be replenished but after the restocked it they didn t provide any more milk Found a small blood stain on the foot end of the bed sheet The elevator touch screen did not include level 0 until you tapped the screen in a certain way This was difficult to use , Well within easy walking distance from Sloterdijk Station Upon arrival I was offered an upgrade to a Priviledge Room which was spacious had a comfortable bed and a very nice shower For 50 EUR extra I was given a late checkout until 5 00pm a little expensive but much needed Hotel wifi worked well and had no hidden charges Hotel foyer was clean and comfortable It also offered two computers which were free to use The breakfast was good Food was fresh and the place was clean

383078,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Could have done with a better view as room on the 6th floor Pillows were very uncomfortable so we switched the cushions for the pillows which helped, Excellent location Friendly and polite staff Very clean facilities Nice cool modern decor
383079,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The only thing we didn t like about our room was that the bed it was a bit uncomfortable, We liked the hotel very much and the room was quite nice and clean 
383080,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Reception staff were very helpful but one member of staff was a bit brusque , Location to station an closeness to Amsterdam Central and airport excellent

383082,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, We paid for a double bed but we got two collated beds There was no top mattress overlapping the two beds Consequently there was a rift in which we fell during the night The structure of the bathroom was designed in a way that the floor was flooded as soon as we took a shower When we wanted to use the mirror wash our hands we had to accept standing in wide puddles The area around the hotel is bleak We were forced to pay upfront on the day of our arrival but it was not stated on the website we used for the booking When we shared our surprise about this unexpected ask we were told that it was the policy of the hotel in a tone that made me feel like a walking wallet Following this first contact I did not even dare bringing up the unacceptable issues we faced in our room It was the first time of my life I booked a room in a Mercure hotel I never even considered booking a room before because Mercure meant to me high end hotel with top quality and high price It was the last time of my life I booked a room in a Mercure hotel , Leaving the hotel 
383083,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The staff weren t overly helpful when checking in We arrived at 9 and the room wasn t ready which was fair enough and were asked to wait until 2 Came back at 2 25 and were told room still wasn t ready and to take a seat because the cleaning system hadn t been updated meanwhile everyone else checking in got straight in It was until one of our party went up at 3 that something was done They clearly needed to review their cleaning schedule as by 3 you d expect the room to be spotless and not have socks from previous customers lying about , The location is excellent it s right beside the train station and is only 6 minutes to Amsterdam central and 10 to the airport The room was very nice and the shower was great 
383084,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Our rooms were over 2 hours late to be checked in This wasn t early check in either it was 2pm We didn t get into our room until 4pm This hampered our sleep to catch up on a very early flight out and we had been walking all morning All we got was a free drink while we waited , Bed was best bed I ve stayed in whilst holidaying So comfy Shower was fab
383085,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station,No Negative, We stayed in Mercure Hotel Sloterdijk for 3 days We really enjoyed it The hotel was clean plenty of space and next right next to the train station which goes to Amsterdam Central in under 7 minutes All the staff we came across were very friendly and helpful In the future we will recommend your hotel to other people 
383086,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, There are not many bars or restaurants close by so your options are limited , This hotel was exceptional value compared to prices offered in central Amsterdam There is a train station approximately 100m from the hotel so access to the centre is easy and cheap The hotel itself was very good with all areas have a modern design The rooms were modern and very clean
383087,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, cleaning the room is not good at all they havet change the bed untill i asked to no water or anything in the rooms by taxi to dam square 25 max not the easy to get to there by tram and train if u take it it will be 6 euro max overall if u r going to the crnter daily it will cause u alot of money by taxi, the staff was good night staff the best new hotel good size
383088,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, i stayed at Mercure back in October as we upgraded to a superior room this included drinks in our mini bar 1 small bottle of Cola 1small sprite and oj Water too A lovely lady knocked on our door each day to fill this up Although this time when me and my partner stayed even tho I paid extra for the superior room and facilities the drinks were not topped up once on our 3 night stay This isn t a major issue but would have been nice very welcoming hotel great location 1 train stop from Amsterdam Central ,No Positive
383089,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, room service is the worst dose not clean well when he finished cleaning my room I didn t find my 3 lemons Also I figured out someone open my pockets There is bad smell was coming out of our bathroom The arrangements of the room is not suitable that makes the room bigger enough, breakfast is excellent Nora is the best waiter working hard restaurant at the 8th floor wonderful train station is very near 5 minutes walk
383090,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, View from the room And the pillow could be softer , Location 1 min from the train station 6 min from the centre 10 from the airport Great view from the restaurant If the chef cooks as good as he gets contact with guests the food may be worth to try 
383091,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The location of the hotel Even though it is next to a train station still it is a little bit away from Amsterdam s downtown , Excellent amenities excellent food rooms are great 
383092,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, One big bed was created by joining two smaller The matress above them was too tight that s why one of us had to slept in hole between beds It was really uncomfortable, Location is close to the station with trains each 10 minutes Big windows Quite location and stay Excellent wi fi and facilities Even standard room has comfort to stay size
383093,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, the only thing I could suggest is the windows are locked and do open would have been nice to have some fresh air rather than air conditioning, the bed was absolutely beautiful best night sleep in a long while the location also is not bad at all if you don t mind a 40 minute walk although sloterdijk train station is minutes away as well as team stations dotted around the area the staff where brilliant and the room was beautiful we paid 12 extra to have the privilege room and was 100 worth it 
383094,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The payments for the rooms were very un organised holding money left right and centre refunding and taking more money the city tax was not clearly organised and the bathroom door does not lock and you can see through it this is bad especialy in a family room, All the staff were friendly professional and helpfull the rooms were clean and a good size and a very good location
383095,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, They made double beds by putting two single beds next to each other Those that have lower back problems know how it can make you uncomfortable The staff were helpful and upgraded us to a better room so we can try a different bed but beds were the same in all hotel s rooms , Modern design good access to transport and airport
383096,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, In related to cleanliness our glass did not get cleaned or replaced with the new one And eventough the hotel nearby to station there isn t anything else to see in walking distance because the location far from any sightseeing , Mercure always have the best in hospitality and room interior design I love it 
383097,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Dark colors of the room Not good shampoo Hairdryer is not powerful Receptionists is not clear and not so professional , Good breakfast Big room but in dark colors Clean Good position near train station and in 10 min you are in the center of Amsterdam Good bed 
383098,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Sofa bed could have been more comfortable Not many options for room service either , The staff were absolutely amazing so friendly smiley and helpful The room was a very good size the double bed was comfortable but the sngle sofa bed we had a triple room not so comfortable Amazing Shower 
383099,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Overall cleanliness was quit good but I could still spot some hair on the bed sheets The heating system was rather noisy This is my personal opinion so it doesn t mean is good or wrong but when they repaint the hotel they could make it more colorful They have used very cold colors , Me and my girlfriend had a very good time at Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk hotel The location of the hotel is extremely convenient across Sloterdijk railway station at a 6 minutes distance from the city center by train We liked very much the girls from the reception they were very nice and helpful The bed was also comfortable 
383100,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Far away from the center you need to take a bus 20 minutes to reach city center Room was not thoroughly cleaned , The room was new very nice decorated with big bathroom Staff was helpful 
383101,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The light in the bedroom was detached so it could have fallen any minute during my stay Also the air con wasn t working properly nor the keys to the room As well as this the room was really dark and there was barely any light , The shower was the only good part 
383102,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, I loved everything Bring me back, The bed was so comfy the staff are so friendly the room are gorgeous the cleaniness locatiom 5mins away from central the transportation links was brilliant the hospitality in general is what i loved about my stay at mecure hotel amsterdam

383104,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Breakfast expensive, Excellent location 1 stop on train to Amsterdam central 2 stops from Schipol Airport We had a late flight and they stored our bags for the last day 
383105,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, the pillows were too big and too hard Now suitable for all sleeping needs One soft and one hard would be better , The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff 
383106,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, We would have opted for breakfast had it been a little cheaper , EVERYTHING Very clean and helpful staff They even printed our boarding passes for us Nothing was too much trouble and our rooms had fresh sheets and towels every day 5 stars 
383107,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The price for breakfast is extortionate , The hotel staff were great especially the bar restaurant staff They gave recommendations on where to go in the city and how to get there etc 
383108,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Housekeeping would only make the bed Didn t wash the coffee mugs or keep new tea bags Was my first time in Amsterdam I love the city and the ppl who live there , Very close to the Sloterdijk station Receptionist staff were nice 
383109,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Beds a little hard but that is the standard across Europe I believe I m use to American soft beds at hotels and only other thing was the shower was nice and hot at night but a little cool in the morning due to so many guest taking showers I assume, Location and child friendly this place was great choice with good parking but we did go in the off season I believe they have limited spots though We have kids and the walls were good to keep sound out the room next to us had kids and we never heard them either Very modern set up I enjoyed the stay here Heating in rooms works great
383110,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Bed wasn t comfy at all 2 single beds pushed together to make a double, Lovely room very friendly staff Hotel was in a very isolated location but was right beside train and tram which was very quick to Amsterdam central 
383111,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Not very cheerful at reception Annoyingly strict controls at breakfast there are nicer and more subtle ways of making sure everybody has paid for breakfast than checkpoints with stern stares and obligatory signatures, Great bed shower and tv Fast free wifi Very comfortable bar and restaurant atmosphere with really nice staff in the evening and good breakfast Excellent quiet location for anyone not intent on walk around tourism Ideal for business trips Tourists have railway station at 2 minutes to get to centre or airport
383112,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station,No Negative, The hotel is very close to transports Tram Train Bus gets you to the city in minutes or outside of town via Sprinters Train Transports are not expensive especially if you use the IAmsterdam Card The room was very clean and tidy nice and warm facilities little to no noise from the outside beautiful bathroom with all facilities roomy and nice bed for a young couple The Stodyjk station nearby has some stores a supermarket and some take away food stores to help in times of need The meals and view from the restaurant topside are very nice a short yet very well prepared and cooked list of dishes is available We ve not enjoyed but it has also a bar that allows to have a nice cocktail while resembling Amsterdam city 
383113,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, it was cold in the bath room and there was no heating at all the floor was as cold as Antarctica maybe pillows were too stiff , this is new hotel and located near Sloterdijk Station and you can get to the city center by train tram or bus nice bar and restaurant on the 8th floor with beautiful view over the neighborhood big double bed with wide blanket 
383114,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Staff complicated our bill So rather than pay for the total once we paid three times One staff member told us we had not received a deluxe room and that we only revived another bed for a present arranged upgrade for an extra guest Then we where told to pay the extra when we left Communication wasn t the best and I don t belive our room was the standard of Deluxe However they did honor the free breakfast that was detailed on our booking That we hadn t realised about , Breakfast and location of this property was great 
383115,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Nothing at all everything was perfect , We had the most perfect stay the staff were amazing and so friendly they made our stay really special as the room was perfect and they even upgraded us It was so clean and stylish we both loved every minute of the stay Thank you so much for a wonderful stay We will both definitely be back X Just a little tip if you stay for 4 nights like we did buy a 3 day pass for the trains trams buses etc it s 25 euros and you can use it all over Amsterdam X
383116,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Probably more selection of food at breakfast, Thanks to all the staff at the hotel fantastic service through out and very professional and helpful will be visting again
383117,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Quite mediocre food in the restaurant Nice views though , Super sexy and classy interior design It gave a feeling of total luxury The bed was supremely comfortable and I slept very deeply I also enjoyed the bathroom the rainshower and the soft lighting Staff was friendly and helpful The lounge is cosy and warm The location isn t that great if you want to explore Amsterdam but we went to an event 5 minutes walk away from Mercure so for us the location was perfect Warmly recommended

383122,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The tap water was not warm and we wasted the precious time in the trip We asked for reception and were told to wait until the hote water start to come They said it is natural because many guests use showers in the morning at the same time you know we waited until 11 45 a m just before the check out time but the water never became warm Unfortunately we lost the whole morning because of this we hope they will improve the water heating system , The restaurant in this hotel was very good not only we could enjoy the wide night view of central Amsterdam but also the meals especially Dutch Cheeses with warm breads were super

383126,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Its is quite a distant from nearest amenities shops The corridor leading to the room is narrow and not straight with rooms designed to optimise space but might be hazardous in the unlikely emergency event , Its located away from the main part of the city and hence quieter from the typical city noises The basement parking is secured and so are the lifts 
383127,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, It was bad experience to stay this hotel When I first entered this hotel the woman staff who were wearing glasses didn t say hi or hello No greetings After when I was writting down registration card that woman staff hurry me to finish to complete card I was so offended that she doesn t respect asian guest In addition I uses to stay in the hotel all around the world and previous hotels never ask me to pay a hotel bill beforehand However that woman staff hurry me again to pay a hotel bill According to the policy I don t have any duty to pay it beforehand Suddenly I felt woman staff is racist It was extremly awful to stay here It was waste of my money I was so humiliated and offensed , Neat and clean

383134,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Room was a tad too small Moving around especially when we have our luggage was a challenge Washroom had an open shower which meant it was always wet after a bath and room s carpet also got wet as well Breakfast menu can be improved manifold given its a 4 star hotel , Amazing location Right outside a major Rail Station in Amsterdam which means you re always connected Comes in handy especially when the weather is not on your side 
383135,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, We booked a privilege room as a comfy bed is important but it was two beds pushed together rather than the king size advertised, Right opp the train station so easy to get into the city
383136,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Found ourselves in the hotels sky lounge very classy amazing views etc was very impressed BUT Unfortunately the floor staff not so much Returned a dish that was ordered as not what we asked for and this caused a huge scene within the restaurant between our table and waitress Not very professional and embarrassing on the restaurants behalf Could of been rectified in seconds with very little fuss After this we found that our table was avoided and waited 30 minutes for our bill a massive let down Also found very limited menu for Lunch quite disappointing really Would advise going into city centre We tried the Hiltons Sky Lounge on our second day and wow Did it live up to expectations Amazing food amazing view right over the canal and amazing service They even made us our own personalised cocktails And to my final point on arrival we were offered breakfast as extra 20 pp Which I found pretty steep as we had paid 90 pp for a family double room so would expect to be included in price after paying over 200 in total even if just continental This also let our stay down , Amazing location just 2 stops on the train from the Airport Schiphol and just one direct stop to city centre Couldn t ask for more Quick journeys and direct train to Airport for going back home which meant no faffing for Taxi s and 25 for 3 day unlimited transport pass Bargain Hotel vibe amazing Absolutely beautiful Favourites had to be our bathroom due to spacious rainfall shower and extra comfortable beds Receptionists were all extremely helpful and willing to do anything to assist us we found that booking tickets were far easier at the hotel paid for and printed there and then Thumbs up from us 
383137,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, no ramp be prepared to lift up your lugage even only for 5 steps if it is a heavy one, the distance from the city and the access to transportation are excellent
383138,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station,No Negative, Clean hotel and excellent bathroom However the closest is setting in front of the door that we almost bump into the closest before we find the switch of the light The enterience is a bit tight for setting between bathroom and closest We carried two two large luggage and its a bit difficult to pull them into the room Aside from that the location is great if you re looking for a business stay 
383139,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station,No Negative, Loved the bar area on the top floor Staff were really friendly Was 15 mins by regular bus service using a cheap metro bus pass from Central station or 4 mins on the train 
383140,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The receptionist seemed slow not efficiently paced to check us in Felt like I should have gone behind the counter and helped We were the only ones checking in , The hotel is very modern just a short walk across the road from Sloterdjik Station and you re there 
383141,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, There was no Room service menu in the room so the only way to order room service is to go personally to the restaurant Room service comes with 4 additional charges , Room was tidy and decent 
383142,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The log fire in the hotel I liked there was a gym The bar is inviting We stayed next to the bar on the top floor The view was amazing Staff were freindly ,No Positive
383143,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, There is no water etc in the mini bar I said couple of time they says you can take from the restaurant The organisation is too bad Odada mini barda su bile yoktu Su istedi im zaman restorandan gidip al n dediler organizsyon ok k t , The hotel clean quite Temp ve sessiz bir otel
383144,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The bed was a bit too soft for our taste small movements propagated throughout waking up the loved one next to you , Pretty much EVERYTHING except the bed 
383145,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, We booked the room by special price 356 euro per 4 nights and may be because of that there was only one tea spoon and the hotel didn t provide us with toothpaste And one bottle of pure water in the room this is obligatory I suppose and the hotel can do that for the clients this is not so expensive , Just 5 minutes from the centre on the train While booking the room I asked for the high floor and we lived on the 7th very nice It s really quite in the room when the window is closed but it s too warm and you need to open it rather often Condition is too noisy and not effective 
383146,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Too expensive for a hotel near a train station and not in the city center Noise from hoter flushing baths from the top floor, Near train metro and bus station Clean a spacious room good Wifi big confortable beds
383147,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Our TV didn t work we weren t there to watch tv but it would have been nice , 2 min walk to the train station and 5 min ride into Central station Great location just outside of the city Gorgeous room with a decent view Bathrooms were amazing 
383148,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, I wished there are more extra amenities , The staff are friendly and the lication is really convenient The resto is good The room is nice I will definitely stay here again 
383149,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Sometimes the lift was temperamental but there as 3 our friends had trouble with there room and checked out No where really to relax and have a drink only In the restaurant which was not ideal We had few problems but the deputy manager sorted them out With a generous discount , The staff were lovely well most of them the hotel was new but had a lot of teething problems Breakfast lovely so we re the dining staff 
383150,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Bar wasn t open all night, Staff are very friendly location is one stop down from Ansterdam Centraal Station so you re never far from the action but you re not in the mix all the time
383151,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Size of the room compared to its price During the mornings the shower water was not warm enough but in the evenings it was , Staff helpfulness Decoration
383152,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The double bed was not a kind size bed there were 2 adjacent queen beds, Everything From design to cleanliness quality complementary products staff etc
383153,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The window was locked and not allowed to be open by internal regulation I ve requested them to open it since the second day but only after few more days when I announced I want to leave the hotel for this reason they unlocked it There is some heavy metal furniture in the room one armchair has these metal legs going out of the sitting area and it s a real hazard for the guests toes , Very close to the office They were cleaning everyday although they always missed some scraps to testify about previous guests on the carpet just a little under the bed They did unlocked the window for me eventually 
383154,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Poor breakfast Small fitness center for only 1 person can work Not large enough for 2 person work outnat the same time Angry face staff They think we beg for the room and they are doing favor for us to give the room Minibar is always empty They charged me for the day that i did not stay I had an urgent matter back home that i needed to check out one day before reservation date They insisted to charge me for the day i was not in the hotel They say they are not after money But they charged I had booked as non refunded rate which should include the first day charge if you do not show up They cannot charge whole reservation , Location only
383155,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The location was far away from the city s attractions even though it is right in front of a mayor train station , The staff was very attentive to all our needs and everything was very confortable 
383156,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Paying for parking, The location very close to the train station restaurant had excellent views TV had a good channel selection with quite a few English speaking ones WiFi was good 
383157,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Stayed 4 nights 2 days we did not have running hot water for showers Not just our room apparently a lot of other rooms as well Breakfast was not 4 star hotel worthy Chefs don t know how to make omelettes ours was made from scrambled eggs Pre made scrambled eggs half boiled eggs bacon beef sausages beans and mushrooms were cold these were not kept in warmers For a hotel that has a lot of British tourists they did not know what an Eggs Benedict was and I m not British Coffee machine spewed out bad cappuccinos Toaster was not near the bread Restaurant seating makes it look like a canteen , The friendly staff and clean room hotel Cool elevator selector Got served by a really good bartender who made solid Old Fashioned drinks Really cool bar with big glass windows all around wish if there was roof top bar 
383158,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Poor staff quality The lady at the reception was really really unfreindly and didn t help us in our request , Amazing room very modern bathroom Super clean and warm atmosphere 
383159,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Room is right next to the elevator so is kind noisy during sleep time Little far from Amsterdam City , The arrangement of higher floor and stuff were nice Train and Metro just right near 
383160,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station,No Negative, Booking a privilege room was definitely the right decision beautiful room complete with coffee machine soft drinks and a robe The room and other areas of the hotel were spotless I was very impressed 
383161,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station,No Negative, We really liked our stay Staff was very polite and helpful Hotelroom was one of the cleanest I have ever slept in Even the WLAN was perfectly fast Next time we ll book it again 
383162,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, It was quite far from the city center You have to take a tram or train to get to where all the action is in Amsterdam Having said that location is convenient if you plan to take day trips elsewhere in the Netherlands since it s very near the train station Room was also quite small but it wasn t such a pain because everything was well maintained and very clean , We were pleasantly surprised Great hotel nice interiors Clean and new with everything in order 2 minute walk from the Sloterdijk train and tram stations 
383163,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Nope nothing bad , It was amazing the staff were so friendly and helpful the hotel was lovely beds were sooo comfy The atmosphere was great you should defiantly stay here it was just so nice 
383164,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, it would be better if there would be a courtain or something in the shower because too much water flow out , The location is perfect train buses tram in 2 mins walking The breakfast was perfect The room was comfy 
383165,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, None, Location near a transport hub this easy access to central Amsterdam Very new and clean and the lobby was cosy for pre checkin or pro check out 
383166,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Had asked for early check in and was told for another 35 euros it would be done after 8 hr flight from delhi and a 50 dollar taxi we were told they dont do early check in they did scramble and get us in a room by 10a, Great location if you need a break from center Amsterdam right next to train bus station nice rooms clean
383167,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station,No Negative, Staff were great polite and helpful room was as expected very comfy and modern Location a bit far from central but since we have a night bus to catch up from sloterdeijk station it was the best option for us
383168,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Very noisy as our room near the lift when the lift operation it is very noisy I talked with the staff a young lady just feel no patient and say they can t help as the room fully booked Really rude , Clean New Nice location 
383169,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, no thing really but I think they need for more light , the bed was really much comfort than others hotels I stayed before staff helpful and always smile the Design of rooms are really simple and modern I will come again to Amsterdam just because I want to stay in same room and same hotel
383170,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, since location is far from city center i wanted to use public transportation even though there are two train stations near by the hotel the staff didn t help when asked about public transportation forced me to use taxis the cushions in the room were dirty price too expensive not to include breakfast Even though the hotel is only few months old but the mattress felt like its been 10 years old No comfort at all , the taxi company associated with the hotel is the only good thing i faced while staying at the hotel internet was fast and never disconnected 
383171,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Inconsistency in room service on minor things Didn t affect cleanliness or comfort but slightly confused Also took the hotel card away just because I left it in the power slot The location is a bit far from places but the Sloterdijk Station is just next door so easy to catch public transport , The staff are nice front desk or at the restaurant The room was comfortable and clean They let me checked in the morning which was a great help A bottle of complimentary red wine was a pleasant surprise 
383172,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Air condition was not working We told that air condition not working for two days but we were not able to get it fixed We had to sleep in a freezing cold room although we got a little baby They don t have a technical service working at night , Location and clean
383173,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Nothing although it does seem a little cold from the outside, A very nice Hotel in a convenient location near to the train and close enough to the city to be able to bike
383174,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Dark colours of corridors like black tunnels Wardrobes were very tall over 7 feet so I couldn t reach top shelf and there was only one other so all our clothes that didn t hang were piled on one shelf There were no drawers anywhere so all make up iPads phones keys etc etc just littered the windowsills or the dressing table Made the room look untidy The shower was great but the bathroom door clashed against the wardrobe door when it was open the bedroom seemed to be a triumph of design over functionality , Staff were friendly location was good right next to railway station breakfast was excellent in Skybar Appreciated complimentary bottle of wine in room 
383175,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, View was the window was so so , Hotel is very close to Sloterdijk station which is itself just 15 minutes from the airport on the Sprinter train Access was very easy 
383176,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The breakfast place is nice and cosy and there were variations but I would suggest more eggs choices instead of the crumbled only But thats just me being picky hehe, Everything The rooms the shower the location its only one stop away from the center The staff were very helpful and friendly 
383177,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, bathroom had isolation problem due to shower and cabinet Noise isolation is not good inside noise from wc flush, Nice and new look big room and comfortable bed Kind staff 
383178,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Breakfast shoul been included I think the hotel should provide umbrellas to guests considering the bad weather, nice the hotel and the bedroom i liked the furnishing a little outside of the city center but easy to reach it thanks to the train just below
383179,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, couldn t really fault anything worth mentioning , 5min from city center by train 3 20 for journey located in excellent position very friendly staff very modern experience Will happily stay there again
383180,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, It is really complicated to get to the city central Had to buy a train ticket to go to the city The train doesn t run 24 hrs if you miss the last train have to take a taxi which is very expensive The staff was not helpful or friendly , The hotel was very clean
383181,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station,No Negative, The design of the room the placement of the hotel 1 station on train from the center very quiet area very friendly staff We would absolutely recommend it to others 
383182,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, For a delux double bedroom the bed was amazingly uncomfortable as it was two tiny matrices pushed together and one matrice was higher then the other The room was also never cleaned while on our four day visit , The location was a plus and so were the restaurant staff too
383183,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, If being super picky the bin wasn t clean in the tea making cupboard and a loaf of bread I believe from previous occupant was left in fridge but these were VERY minor issues, Everything heartily recommend this hotel 
383184,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, When inquiring about a continued stay the rate was not the same but higher , Being at the last minute the room was a good value clean and a refreshing feeling The showers were great and the beds were comfortable 
383185,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, car parking should be free and cleaning stuff are annoying while we was sleep in the monring she open the room door on us , hotel is in quite area and near to the staion just 4 6min walking
383186,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Huge booking cock up My amended booking hadn t gone through their system despite the fact that I had received confirmation from the agent The hotel had a free room so I wasn t left high and dry but had to pay a much higher rate than my booking confirmation stipulated Rather poor organisation here , Wonderful room and breakfast buffet and staff Great location for us we got the 3 day travel ticket so very easy to get in and out of Amsterdam without the noise at night 
383187,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Had trouble explaining that twin beds did not mean a Superking with two single duvets Did get it sorted but was just supplied with more bedding and had to move the beds and remake them ourselves , Location next to train station was excellent Good to be in a quiet but convenient area for access to busy Amsterdam Centre Fantastic beds once split into twin beds very comfortable Good aircon despite other reviews to the contrary Breakfast was good and breakfast host staff very efficient and friendly
383188,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station,No Negative, staff who attended us were really really sweet and upgraded us to privilege room We had amazing breakfast in the morning with amazing view Very quite place Staff in the restaurant are really sweet and greet you with broad smile which is required after a long tiring day They dint even charge us for parking was told 30euro per night but made it complimentary 
383189,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station,No Negative, The staff were extremely helpful with any question we had and remembered what we had previously done They really seemed to care to make our visit good 
383190,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Only downside was room service is not available but wasn t a huge issue, Breakfast and lunch was great great location only a quick bus ride into the city centre and to the airport both of which are free with iamsterdam card Station Sloterdijk is viewable from hotel but thankfully noise from trains etc was not an issue Lovely rooms and helpful staff Allowed us to store our luggage for free on the last day as we had an evening flight Would recommend
383191,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, They did not have our booking on their system We had to wait nearly an hour to check in waiting for the manager to ocate the booking on another system , Good powerful shower
383192,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The restaurant could have one or two more meals on the menu for dinner , Beautiful bathroom large room and window Lovely quite location and easy to get into the city etc

383194,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The mini bar had the previous persons half eaten food still in there Vile When I had spoke to the staff about it they said it would be sorted whilst I was out Only to return for it to be still in there They told me to leave it outside the room myself Overall I liked the cleanliness of the hotel however when the door is shut in our room we noticed that we could see hand prints which have been smeared down the door , The bathroom decor the bed the mini bar the privilege room the robes and slippers the location of not bing bang in the centre but easy access to the rail hub 
383195,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, We stayed here for 3 nights the room was only cleaned on the 3rd day after we requested it seemed we where missed somehow Information in the room was non existent no menus for the restaurant or opening times prices or tourist information etc , Location was great just over the road from train station and only one stop to Amsterdam central
383196,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The bathroom extraction fan probably needs a better extraction flow rate to match the shower A little wallpaper had began to peel The hotel lifts did not always operate correctly , The rainfall shower was brilliant beds were pretty comfortable and the facilities were more than adequate The staff gave you advise and tips about the area and couldn t do enough to help you 
383197,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, No air conditioning for 4 nights We asked at check in to make sure it worked as we had read in previous reviews it had not We were told it was being fixed the next day but you guessed it was not I don t think they own a vacuum cleaner as carpets throughout the building were very dirty We started to notice the poor workmanship throughout the building tiling painting wallpaper etc just not finished off like they were in a hurry Our room was on the second floor above the outside bar so noise and smoke were a problem at night We have spent 4 weeks in Europe and this place was the most disappointing , Breakfast
383198,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Wasn t a bad experience but with the hotel being so new the menu in the restaurant was pretty basic for evening meals, Hotel is brand new Very nice room and bathroom Staff obliging and friendly Easy location on train and bus to Central Amsterdam

383201,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Long list of insufficient services rooms not cleaned towels not changed lifts not working properly dirty corridors ridiculous gym dirty emergency stairs phones not working sink obstructed narrow room for a family , The only thing working fine is the wifi connection
383202,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, electricity problems not cleaning the room not refilling the mini bar no good room service some problems with room decor , 5 mins by train to the center quiet area any thing you want to pay either from the train station near by or from downtown 
383203,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Room was not ready when we checked in Again we went out and came back late evening still not ready , Good facilities easy to get to Amsterdam central 
383204,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, Parking isn t free in addition there was no way to get from the parking which is in the back to the hotel front desk so we had to carry our suitcases around That being said the hotel is still new and under some construction so that may change Also no way to mop the bathroom floor which gets completely wet after a shower , Friendly staff great breakfast which was for free probably as a promotion for the opening of the hotel rooms are big everything was clean
383205,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, nothing, reception and breakfast staff were very happy and nothing was to much trouble breakfast was great with a great view Location is good if you want to be out of the centre direct trains to centre take minutes 
383206,Mercure Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, The air conditioner was broken the city was hot and there wasn t another room available No one warned us about this and did not receive any discount this function fails because when booking this convenience contained in the room The breakfast is very expensive so stay tuned if it is included in the reserve because in one of my reservation was not included The hotel is in a very distant point from the downtown and attractions you need to subway tram bus for everything you have a Station closer and the Central Station is the next stop from subway but the subway tram ticket is expensive Few restaurants around , Staff was very friendly and this in Amsterdam is very hard The Amsterdam Sloterdjik Station is very close and it is a point with subway tram and bus If you want stay near the airport is a good option only two stops from subway The breakfast was very good
