203460,Le Cinq Codet, The way staff reacted when we had a problem There was no assistance offered or given and no management input or leadership I expect much better from a 5 hotel They made us feel a nuisance rather than a customer Hugely disappointing , The location
203461,Le Cinq Codet, Room is a bit small even after we upgraded for the Duplex, We made a mistake in the original order and eventough it wasn t a refundable deal the hotel staff were amazing and did amend the reservation and refunded us the last night
203462,Le Cinq Codet,No Negative, The hotel is super mean nicely located and has beautiful rooms People were friendly and helpful It s very good located within the city center Metro is closeby 
203463,Le Cinq Codet, we had booked 3 rooms one room was changed twice as AC bathroom water flow in bathroom was not working which caused extreme inconvenience the hotel staff told us they will compensate but till today we did not hear from them at the checkout we were told the hotel management will write to us but they did not,No Positive
203464,Le Cinq Codet,No Negative, I am a single female traveler staff was very helpful and professional with recommendations suggestions transport etc Location is central and in a safe neighborhood Room was well appointed comfortable and clean 
203465,Le Cinq Codet, The bathroom doesn t offer much space for your stuff hair dryer is not what you expect from a hotel with that ambition price range, Beautiful location very quiet and sophisticated hotel ideal for a relaxing stay in Paris excellent staff
203466,Le Cinq Codet, Payment is confusing 1 week before our stay the hotel put the fee on hold from my balance When checking out the staff asked me to pay it again After leaving the hotel for 2 days the on hold money is still pending and has not been returned to my balance , Super comfortable bed excellent location 
203467,Le Cinq Codet, Nothing Its already the best, I m in love with le cinq codet i will make sure to come back again when i go to paris thank you so much le cinq codet love you full
203468,Le Cinq Codet, Payment process was really bad Cards refused and charges duplicated If payment is to be done at the hotel there should not be so much hassle with pre authorisation and so on ,No Positive
203469,Le Cinq Codet, Standard room is sooooo small not even close to being worth the price And because they are soo small they smell like body odor Two adults cannot stay in this room comfortably Probably fine for one adult but the smell is still there They need to rip out the carpets regularly in those rooms Bathroom is so small it stays wet the entire stay Hot tub in spa was cold and the hammam smelled like dirty socks , Location Staff are very nice Spa looks nice and hammam got really hot which is awesome 
203470,Le Cinq Codet,No Negative, Perfect stay in Paris near Eiffle tower The room was tiny but well organized incredibly convenient Staffs are superb They are professional delicate and I got the impression that they really care about me 
203471,Le Cinq Codet, The room where we stayed had no space to put suitcases when you opened them Also the air conditioner has a maximum temp set for room You must speak to front desk in order for them to lower temperature in rooms Checking time should be earlier than 4 00 pm especially if you are an international travelled who is tired needs a room to rest They did however provide us access to spa to be able to freshen up The room price was expensive no breakfast provided, The room was very confortable Not too large but able to accommodate king bed which was fine We only stayed one night the hotel is very modern clean Great location next to the Invslids
203472,Le Cinq Codet, As your room isn t ready at 7 30pm and you have to wait 30 minutes more in the bar well I don t know how long we had to wait if I checked in at 3pm If I go to the reception after 30 minutes for asking if the room was ready and an explanation for the problem The front office lady said easily sorry we had a problem we had to do the evening service and had to change the towels Hey hello we haven t check in at the room so there s nothing to be changed and for sure no towels Than after the check in the curtains were electric to open and to close A really bad luck because one side was only closing So we mentioned it at the reception and the would handle it when I was on my way to the restaurant but bad luck again The curtains were in the same position as before Last but not least the day after in the morning at 9am a waiter knocked at the door for a room service breakfast Again bad luck because I haven t order no breakfast at all For a stay of 350 a night without breakfast i could find better places in the city of love , La brigade du voiturier
203473,Le Cinq Codet, The bathtub which I had asked hotel to reserve it for us was dirty and had lots of soap scale My plan was to have a good bath after flight and celebrate our special date in Paris but it turned to a bad memory BTW the hotel did compensated us 10 of the fee but the memory cannot change , Overall was nice Especially the location was great and staffs was kind 
203474,Le Cinq Codet, The only complaint I had was that my stay wasn t longer , The bed was comfortable the room was spacious and modern and the bathroom was large and bath and shower were great The location was quiet yet close to everything The staff were very friendly and helpful Will be staying here again 
203475,Le Cinq Codet, all perfect, Fabulous Perfect Location fantastic room chocolates from Angelina Tea from Mariages Freres wonderful staff exquisite design Usually staying at Hotel Costes or Pershing Hall but will surely return next time to the Cinq Codet it is divine 
203476,Le Cinq Codet, Nothing fantastic Room a little small but the furniture is intelligently designed for that , Extraordinarily attentive staff EXTRAORDINARY Provides traveling router for non French cell phones to have WiFi while touring the city Extraordinary touch Shows that they really think about the foreign visitor 
203477,Le Cinq Codet, No room slippers provided we have to go to the reception and specially take No iron and iron board in the room They have a central ironing room on 3rd floor so one has to carry all the clothes to that room in hand Breakfast is just neutral An Espresso at hotel bar is for CHF 4 which is crazy , I like this property mainly because it is very close to my customer s office Staff at the reception are friendly and help in navigating to right places around the city Technopark tram station is 5 minutes walk which connects to central Zurich so its convenient 
203478,Le Cinq Codet, Lack of swimming pool, The bed was super comfortable and the area so peacefully and quiet the staff was so helpful and nice from the concierge to the maid
203479,Le Cinq Codet, there was a bad smell in the room bathrobe was not clean there was some blood on it and the never change it AC was not good enough there is no storage space for our luggage, the decoration is modern which was a very nice i like it the location is near from Eiffel tower in very nice and queit area and completly save and full of good restuarants and coffes and near from metro very helpful staff except 2 one of them in reception it was a women i would like to thank the madam in concirge i forgot her name but i think she was from east of Asia also I want to thank Yaseen he was very kind they gave us a walk wifi which covered all area in paris 
203480,Le Cinq Codet,No Negative, We stayed in one of the Duplex suites which i really added to the experience The service and the friendly staff made this one of the best stays in Paris that we have discovered in recent years Location of the hotel is also great with many good restaurants nearby and les invalides on walking distance 
203481,Le Cinq Codet, They could have opened breakfast longer then 11 , Perfect hotel in the center of Paris Very very friendly staff Great room duplex good fitness facilities and Jacuzzi 
203482,Le Cinq Codet, The mini bar wasn t refilled everyday and one day there were dirty coffee cups left on the table that we used the day before, Very comfortable beds nice decoration very modern
203483,Le Cinq Codet, Small bath room but with separate bath , A lovely hotel with spacious room especially for Paris great design and modern features Super nice staff Very nice area and close to Metro 
203484,Le Cinq Codet, For a hotel with such high standards the hair dryer was horrible On the first day used glasses were not replaced with fresh ones The last day handtowels had to be requested But other than that a wonderful stay in a wonderful hotel , Amazing staff 
203485,Le Cinq Codet, staff were very nice but when we requested something slightly out of the usual task it took for ever to have it solved too bad for such a nice hotel ,No Positive
203486,Le Cinq Codet,No Negative, The hotel bar restaurant is nice I even invited friends to come have drinks there and had a business breakfast there My duplex room was great Hotel staff was friendly and helpful Great location close to Eiffel Tower and great restaurants Well decorated rooms and hotel common areas 
203487,Le Cinq Codet, Nothing , Very attentive staff Hotel is very modern and clean We didn t use it but there is an indoor spa with jacuzzi Walking distance to key Paris sights They have parking for a fee if you arrive by car 
203488,Le Cinq Codet,No Negative, Great service very helpful staff modern well appointed rooms quiet central location walking distance to all major attractions great valet parking service
203489,Le Cinq Codet, The room was cold and we had problems with the bathroom We asked them to fix the heating 3 times or change the room but they didn t do anything , Location
203490,Le Cinq Codet, Nothing , Beautiful studio Super location Close to the E tower ten min walk and nice places to eat The most welcoming staff Super clean and very comfortable Perfect 
203491,Le Cinq Codet, We paid 920 for 3 nights not including breakfast the breakfast I believe is over priced so if you are going to stay here I would advise to book including breakfast Our reservation got cancelled the same day of our arrival It was an error on there end we rebooked within the hour for the same duplex room but ended up paying over 100 more Very upsetting They have shower gels and creams to use as expected knowing the price you pay for your stay but our rooms where never topped up with new bottles when our rooms where cleaned Quite annoying We would recommend this hotel to others as you will enjoy your stay please book with breakfast the only reason we will not return is the fact that we had to pay extra for no reason of our own We stayed in No 214 may hear a few footsteps in the morning but nothing to moan about , We loved our room the design of the room was fab the comfort and cleanliness fab The hotel itself had a very classy modern feel to it 
203492,Le Cinq Codet, The breakfast was average the balcong view wasn t so great, The hotel staff are great the room facilities is so modern you can even AirPlay your iPhone with the room TV The bathroom was perfect The hotel is all about new technology 
203493,Le Cinq Codet, Everything was absolutely fantastic Our only feedback would be we wish the gym had a set of Dumbbells to match the new equipment As fitness users this was the only thing missing , Above and beyond service The staff are at the height of customer service Everyone is very friendly and always smiling We were greeted at the door and our bags were taken to our rooms upon arrival We were offered complimentary drinks at all times of interaction with staff Staff were always present Room service or help was prompt and timely The view from our hallway of the effiel tower is excellent The gym is modern and offers clean maintained facilities More than value for money and surpasses initial expectations perfect for business or a romantic get away 
203494,Le Cinq Codet, The night front desk person wanted me to pay the full amount before checkout The full amount was guaranteed by credit card So I found it quite harassing The other front desk clerks were extremely nice So this person must have been an exception , We had a problem with the shower and they tried to solve it quickly 
203495,Le Cinq Codet, We have the duplex room but the stairs were a bit dangerous The shower is very small and only one hook for 2 bathrobes all the towels I was taking a big shower and washing my hair then water started going out disaster Btw the shower was very difficult to switch on off especially when your hands are wet I was panicked when I realized water was flowing out but I couldn t turn it off since my hands were wet I also took a bath in the bath tubs next to the bed but it ended up I couldn t wash away the bubbles on me in the bathtub so I had to walk down to the shower covered with bubbles There were many switches in the room but apart from master switch do not disturb nothing was written complicated for turning on off the lights Their staffs were very friendly but not very well trained Like there was water at the check in lobby but they didn t propose anything when we arrived for check in There were umbrellas but they didn t say anything when it was raining The bathrobe was on the handle of the stairs for 2 days that they didn t move it For the night service they let the slippers next to the bed but in the bag I know I am picky but many details were missing It s design and trendy but not very comfortable It can be a 4 star but definitely not a 5 star The last thing when we were checking out We had 2 rooms x 2 nights 1112 4 euro But they told me they had pre charged as guarantee 556 2 euro x 2 plus 400 euro for the room services when we check in so he gave me a refund credit card receipt I used booking com many many times but I never had any other hotel made the calculation this way very confusing , Very friendly staff Public area is design trendy
203496,Le Cinq Codet, Expensive but for an all out special occasion total worth it , By far the nicest hotel I ve ever been in Staff were amazing and even saved me and my fianc e when the taxi driver got us lost 
203497,Le Cinq Codet, Very little Possibly it might need more forceful air conditioning in the summer , Bed very comfortable rooms completely silent My duplex was unexpected and a lot of fun to have stairs in the room The staff are very helpful polite and discreet Breakfast is excellent but pricey if you only want coffee and a croissant If it s included in your rate it s a bargain Basically the hotel is big and smart enough to look after you properly but small enough to feel intimate and personal 
203498,Le Cinq Codet, As of practicality I would say it was only okay The stairs made it a little bit annoying sometimes to move around the room for example when I want to go to the bathroom at night The comforter was really really thick so it was hot at night but when I got out of the bed it was super cold The living room as well as the bathroom were a bit crowded but still comfortable to use Also one thing I found a little bit annoying was that I asked the hotel to book me a taxi at my departure to the airport and I specifically confirmed with them that there wouldn t be extra charges for simply the action of booking the taxi However when I got on the taxi the driver told me there was actually charge for calling the taxi so the price I ended up paying wasn t the price the staff told me , Aesthetically speaking this hotel was impeccable I booked a Duplex room and the design of the staircase the lighting of the staircase and under bed the paintings in the room were stunning I lived at tons of hotels before but this one is by far the most creative one I have ever seen The staffs were friendly and helpful 
203499,Le Cinq Codet, Room was smallish Limited Room Service menu and weirder rules and the one who s answering delivering has attitude problem , Location Staff almost all were professional and friendly apart from Room Service guy 
203500,Le Cinq Codet,No Negative, Staff went the extra mile They even noticed our birthdays and delivered a complimentary bottle of champagne and a birthday note to our room Staff building facilities all flawless Couldn t recommend highly enough 
203501,Le Cinq Codet, Had a duplex room an interesting concept but not certain if we would choose that type again having to go up and down the stairs to get to the loo at night was not so convenient Also having a bath beside the bed was a bit peculiar Room was well equipped but just two small hooks for towels and no hooks for the bathrobes for a room of this cost these things should be thought of , The staff were friendly and attentive offering excellent service The hotel was in a quiet location but well placed for visiting the various attractions In easy walking distance of the Eiffel Tower The hotel was well equipped and the bed was very comfortable although we did not have time to use the spa There was an excellent breakfast 
203502,Le Cinq Codet, In the room down stairs we had a duplex it was not so good space To small you could not place your suitcase anywhere to unpack and it was hard to sit down in the sofa if you are tall like me , Very nice breakfast and so elegant dining hall The bed was also very comfortable 
203503,Le Cinq Codet, We stayed here for our honeymoon and this was the fancy we hotel we chose while in Europe It s nice but does not feel like a 5 star hotel We got massages that were nice but not much of a spa despite the decription The space is very small and the changing room is very tiny shared and has just a curtain to close for privacy even though this is where the shower is as well They had a hot tub but it was full when we tried to use it Really more than two people is a lot unless it s your friends then maybe four The room was interesting The stairs were intriguing at first but not so fun if you want to use the restroom at night They are small and uncomfortable to step on first thing in the morning making it a bit of a challenge Everything was very expensive but the breakfast was good and the staff were friendly , Staff was friendly Not a far walk to the Eiffel Tower Easy to find We were given umbrellas when going for a walk and it was raining Safe area 
203504,Le Cinq Codet, A bit far from touristic area, Amazing design Hotel got the duplex suite funky classy new extra clean perfect service great wifi excellent breakfast and quiet surroundings 
203505,Le Cinq Codet, We wish we could have stayed longer but were on a schedule , A very stylish hotel with very good and attentive service It is 10 minutes walk from the Eiffel Tower and 25 To the Montparnasse Tower The room was loaded with gadgets and the shower excellent 
203506,Le Cinq Codet, I think the AC wasn t working and I was upgraded to another room the AC was still not working Regardless the hotel is still one of the best hotels I have been too , I have been to 5 and 7 stars hotels around the world and this hotel is 10 years ahead of other hotels 
203507,Le Cinq Codet, Light switches of guest room are not so easy to handle because no signs are indicated , The atmosphere of guest room lobby and restaurant are very nice Staff is friendly The rooms we stayed were quiet Access from the nearest metro station is good 5min There are many cafes shops and supermarkets around the station Tower Eiffel and Musee de Armee are within 10 15 min walking 
203508,Le Cinq Codet, The restaurant was a complete rip off Breakfast for E29 per head Also I had to chase them up for cleaning the Jacuzzi which they did well Avoid the minibar as well , The location was perfect and we had one of the suites which was also good 
203509,Le Cinq Codet, Nothing the hotel was exactly what we were after , This hotel was amazing It was my first trip away with my new partner and I wanted to make sure it was special The location is spot on 10 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower and with uber being so cheap in Paris the most expensive cab we got was 15 to Gare du Nord Generally it was between 5 10 to get anywhere We had a Duplex room which I would suggest to anybody The room has Apple AirPlay compatability on both TVs so you can stream your own movies or music to the TV s a nespresso machine that is complimentary and a well stocked mini bar that s fairly priced for a 5 Paris Hotel The staff were all fabulous and extremely attentive and we came away saying that the next time we re in Paris we cannot stay anywhere but at Le Cinq Codet It s of course more expensive than plenty of the other nice hotels around but I still think it s a bargain for the experience we had I scored huge brownie points with my new girlfriend and this place really impresses For a young couple this ticked every single box Thank you so much 
203510,Le Cinq Codet, The fact that they have done a big mistake of withdrawing extra money of a reservation that we cancelled before We had to wait around two weeks for the money to be credited back , Very nice hotel
203511,Le Cinq Codet, Everything was simply perfect nothing to dislike at all and could not fault either the staff or the hotel I have stayed Paris before and this is by far my favourite hotel , I enjoyed my stay tremendously but I would like to point out that the staff were as impressive as the hotel and that is important as you can have a top hotel with poor staff and it ruins the whole experience I stayed in the Duplex Suite and it was simply magical The hotel goes above and beyond and I will 100 be staying there again 
203512,Le Cinq Codet, I think that on this level the breakfest should always be included in the price Apart from that it was all perfect , Fantastic two level room Bath in the sleeping room was amazing 
203513,Le Cinq Codet, I have stayed in the standard rooms and this time booked a better room and thought that it would be bigger , Very silent rooms for me this is the must all brand new and in perfect condition Very helpful staff nice breakfast and very tasty I go to Paris twice a year since 1987 and This is a place where the overall is very satisfying 
203514,Le Cinq Codet, Too many toggle light switches all over the place Finding your way in the room can be a challenge without inadvertently blasting the room with light and disturbing your sleeping partner Elevators are slow to respond Check in out process is very slow with only one person at the front desk , Extremely comfortable king size bed Large modern bathroom with impressive shower and separate tub Hi tech connected room 
203515,Le Cinq Codet, Basic room was smaller then I m used to that s all , My basic room was a little on the small size But was compensating with fine shower space bed comfort and lots of free room extras espresso soft bath robes bottled water and candy Smart TV and enough outlets to charge all my electronics Nice bar area not a great food menu but that s a matter of taste 
203516,Le Cinq Codet, Expensive for a standard room compared to other five star hotels in major cities but I believe this may be a Paris issue , Staff were exceptional very attentive helpful and courteous The hotel is chic and lovely to stay at Rooms are beautifully appointed The rooms were cleaned so well every day it was as if they were preparing for a magazine photo shoot The hotel was located a lovely short walk from the Eiffel Tower 
203517,Le Cinq Codet,No Negative, Amazing I loved the staff and the hard work that they put in to making us feel comfortable I loved everything about the hotel and would definitely stay there again 
203518,Le Cinq Codet, If dinner in the courtyard with large party the sound carries and can make courtyard rooms a bit loud, Clean and fresh door staff very kind and friendly great location Quiet at street Cheerful Great brwakfast
203519,Le Cinq Codet, Location We got lost several times trying to walk back to hotel , Staff were very friendly Facilities were excellent Room was equipped and air conditioned Bathroom was spacious Everything was eco friendly which was excellent 
203520,Le Cinq Codet, Firm policy of two per room couldn t tell that from the the website , I liked the two story room with the couch underneath the loft bedroom made it feel as if the room were larger The bathtub was excellent large and deep and the amenities lovely Staff was very accomodating and helpful with directions and tickets to local attractions 
203521,Le Cinq Codet, The spa was being refurbished but they did offer to give us complimentary taxi service to another hotel spa No all day room service was disappointing ,No Positive
203522,Le Cinq Codet, The staff could of given us more information when checking in breakfast the bar local areas etc, The room was amazing I loved the bath in the bedroom and the mood lighting in our sweet
203523,Le Cinq Codet, Staff where rude and made a million errors with my payments and even cancelled my first booking I was there to propose to my partner and they made it very stressful and put my whole plans at risk, Location and building
203524,Le Cinq Codet,No Negative, We stayed in a junior room very comfy with a decent amount of room Spa was lovely and easy to book Hotel is a great location perfect for our nights stay in Paris
203525,Le Cinq Codet, Black decorations Tiny lobby poor breakfast variety small room staff with no experience the location the Hotel from outside doesn t look like a Hotel definitely I would never come back again , Bathroom
203526,Le Cinq Codet, they didn t have a hanger to dry wet towels not a big issue however for a 5 star hotel they should have made smth Isolation of rooms is not very good We clearly heard people speaking in the corridors Not very fast room service Again not a big issue however , unique duplex room design So in summary it is worth staying at this hotel duplex room 
203527,Le Cinq Codet, Guests may need a bit of instruction on the room facilities for instance light setting curtains whereabouts of the useful items The shower switch is not easy to use when you have shower gel on your hands as it requires a certain force to turn which was quite embarrassing for me Lastly you should pay special attention to all the staircases and furniture as there are so many edges and I got hit multiple times , The hotel is located in a central location with easy access to the Eifel Tower and a lot of restaurants The room is well designed and all furniture are of super quality I love the bed so much The television system is super fancy with a lot of films to choose from I also enjoy the inner decoration particularly the French windows and the bathtub 
203528,Le Cinq Codet, staff service rooms noisy We arrived at friday night at 21 00 h bar restaurant closed no possibility to have meal because there was a private party Music very late next to our window room next to that party Staff very busy no time looking for tips but no extra service Tips are not standard if service is standard Prices very high but very average breakfast U can have better breakfast around the corner , location
203529,Le Cinq Codet,No Negative, The attentiveness of the staff that made us feel so welcomed at all times Also loved the contemporary arty and zen design of the reception bar and restaurant Very peaceful and relaxing haven near centre
203530,Le Cinq Codet,No Negative, The bed was amazing So was the bath Me and my boyfriend stayed in a duplex room and it was the best trip we have ever had The staff were lovely and always happy to help they can recomend anything you feel like if you ask them 
203531,Le Cinq Codet, The selection of meals in the restaurant menu , Everything was perfect I couldn t have asked for anything better differently a place to stay even if it s just for one night 
203532,Le Cinq Codet, The breakfast menu could be better and there is no breakfast tea, The cooperation of the staff to solve any problem you may have especially Jonson and Win 
203533,Le Cinq Codet,No Negative, Amazing hotel in a great locations with very friendly staff This was one of the best hotels we stayed at whilst on a 3 week honeymoon in Europe staying in 5 star hotels
203534,Le Cinq Codet, It was my birthday and I wanted peace and quiet so I could write and relax I definitely got all that and more The staff was so accommodating and polite Everytime I walked by a staffer I was greeted with a smile It isn t common in Paris to get a smile so to receive it from people when I m in my home away from home is a comfort Extra points for the housekeeping My room both the days I stayed were immaculately clean The laundry service was great too Got my clothes back in a day s time Can t wait until my next vacation back , Absolutely wonderful Will definitely come back 
203535,Le Cinq Codet, Nothing will definitely be coming back, Really helpful staff nicely designed rooms very clean good breakfast and great referral to a restaurant for a business dinner nearby 
203536,Le Cinq Codet,No Negative, the design the staff the high ceilling rooms the connectivity on the flat screen their concierge their valet parking the location the value for money 
203537,Le Cinq Codet,No Negative, Beautiful hotel the facilities were fantastic and the staff were so helpful and kind they couldn t do enough for us The breakfast area was lovely and the food was delicious so much variety We had a duplex room and it was amazing we loved it and so many friends who saw pictures loved it so I will definitely be recommending them and we would definitely book again Also the location is amazing 5 minutes from the metro station and about 10 12 minutes to the Eiffel Tower 
203538,Le Cinq Codet, Good and drinks were expensive we ate out most of the time but 16 euros for 2 cokes was steep , Bed comfy brilliant location 5 mins walk to the Eiffel tower could see hotel invalides from our room Bar and patio area very pretty
203539,Le Cinq Codet,No Negative, great location best staff you can get all super friendly and tell you best places in paris perfect rooms Duplex Suite amazing number 1 to sty in Paris 
203540,Le Cinq Codet, The price was very expensive for this hotel It was nothing like 5 I stayed in a lot of 5 hotel but this would be the worse 5 I experienced The local was ok but the room views were horrible , The hotel is rated 5 star but it doesn t feel 5 star at all It is like 3 star hotel The staff is amazing but the hotel It self is expensive and is not worth that much Deluxe rooms are very bad as it s very small and on two floors The shower was broken and after speaking to the manager he was able to upgrade our room but still the room was very small
203541,Le Cinq Codet, the fitness room is small even if it s provided with the top fitness machinery, Bathroom Room Service quality food the minibar quality the staff the high ceiling rooms 
203542,Le Cinq Codet,No Negative, The hotel is super the lady checked in us was very helpful and very kind the staff were great i like the room and the best thing is for arabic people there is a wash water in the toilet 
203543,Le Cinq Codet, The only thing I didn t like was that all tho the hotel is in a great location it tucked away down a little street and it didn t feel very safe to walk to at night and I had someone actually follow me and tried to take my bag literally 2mins from the hotel doors Not the hotels fault at all tho and it s the only negative thing I can say as I loved this hotel , The room was amazing Fantastic location The staff were very friendly helpful It was extremely clean I d 100 stay there again on my next trip to Paris 
203544,Le Cinq Codet, Nice small clean rooms comfortable beds Staff was friendly but need some more training Not 5 star hotel level Management provided a wrong information regarding a transport strike which caused a lot of inconvenience and loosing money , When the SPA had a technical problem the hotel provided an exes to another SPA inclusive transportation 
203545,Le Cinq Codet, The area where the hotel is situated is a bit away from shops and restaurants and not much of a buzz around the location Had to travel out of the area to have our evening meal Would have liked to have had access to a bath in the room but this was not available even in the upgraded room The shower however was very good The room size was a bit tight and was happy to get the upgrade as not sure if the room I had booked would have been smaller but if it was it would have been very tight for two people , The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly The bed and pillows were super comfy We were given an upgrade to a superior room Very quiet so we were able to get a rested nights sleep after a very active day The bathroom was a good size and had two sinks which was a nice touch Metro was very close to the hotel so we were able to move around Paris easily 
203546,Le Cinq Codet, I can t fault this hotel at all everything was amazing , I loved everything about this hotel Its so modern Our room was perfect very clean comfortable bed tv with new movies on it fantastic shower espresso machine high ceiling plenty of wardrobe space The staff were outstanding Very welcoming and friendly so helpful and fluent in English which was great The hotel itself is in a great location 10 15 minutes walk away from the eiffel tower surrounded by metro stations and in a really nice area full of restaurants We really enjoyed our breakfast in the hotel They have so much to choose from literally everything that one will have for breakfast It couldn t have been better I m already looking forward to my next trip to Paris and also to le cinq codet I honestly can t recommend this hotel enough 
203547,Le Cinq Codet, The top floor did occasionally heat up more then we liked and found it hard to sleep as the room was boiling but downstairs was cold, The staff were great and let us know they were there if we needed anything The hotel had everything and anything most people would need if not more It was very stylish and beautiful very clean and cleaners did a good job The breakfast was lovely too Room device was great
203548,Le Cinq Codet,No Negative, The best hotel I have ever stayed in Paris beautiful incredible staff helpful friendly and always available if you needed anything Very well equipped room and clean Impressed by its service and will definitely come back HIGHLY RECOMMEND 
203549,Le Cinq Codet, for a 5 star hotel I would either change the gym to one suiting or give it up alltogether right now it s more of a joke over 200 euro without a breakfast it s a lot, beautiful designer hotel every piece there from carpets to lamps to room furniture is carefully curated staff is incredible they personally escort you to your room give a quick tour of everything really attentive
203550,Le Cinq Codet, Considering the price of the room it seemed a bit cheap not to have breakfast included At almost 30 euros per person the breakfast is not worth it , Staff were friendly and always on hand if you needed anything Room was very well furnished comfortable and clean Excellent location stones throw from the Eiffel tower and walking distance from most attractions Metro stop a few minutes away
203551,Le Cinq Codet, The room is too small The toilet is just opposite the bed which makes me feel uncomfortable The hotel seems to be kind of not ready yet , Nice breakfast helpful staff and good location 
203552,Le Cinq Codet, Nothing , Everything was 10 out of 10 staff went out of there way for us at every opportunity and made our stay a real pleasure already recommended this hotel to friends and family looking to come to Paris 
203553,Le Cinq Codet, Nowhere to hang towels in the bathroom Not enough hanging space in wardrobe Hair dryer not strong enough and couldn t blow dry my hair with it Important for ladies Euros 9 for a pot of tea is excessive , Bed and pillows extremely comfortable Great linen Room totally quiet at night with black out curtains Shower strong and hot Lighting good Location fantastic Reasonably priced for 5 star hotel 
203554,Le Cinq Codet, Only thing is they didn t take the payment from my credit card which I used to book the hotel with straight away Instead I had to pay it by my card when we checked out which cost me 30 use card abroad fee and also the price I paid was 15 more than the price showed on my booking confirmation So extra 45 bill just came from nowhere , We absolutely love this hotel Very modern designed and clean Its location is perfect Only five mins walk to Eiffel Tower and underground The staffs were really helpful and friendly and also the room service was amazing We left the hotel at 5 30am and we got breakfast deliver to our room at 5 00am So impressed by its service and will definitely come back 
203555,Le Cinq Codet, We arrived late and tired because of a taxi strike and were told there is 24hr room service so we ordered what we thought would be quick and simple snacks pizza and pasta at about 23 20 On ordering I was told that it would take about 30 minutes or 35 max which I thought was poor for a 5 star hotel but decided to go ahead anyway One hour later nothing and we re even hungrier and tireder I call again and am told it will be ready in 20 minutes The food eventually arrived 40 minutes later just after 1 00am 1 hour and 40 minutes after we ordered it As a result we were tired the next day which spoiled the entire trip as we were only there for two days That level of service is simply not good enough in any hotel and is incomprehensible in what is supposed to be a 5 star hotel , Impressive modern design 
203556,Le Cinq Codet, Staff at breakfast made you sit where they wanted you to see it in a near empty breakfast room The bed was two singles pushed together very uncomfortable and small for a couple Not a 5 star hotel room service menu poor, Good location good room
203557,Le Cinq Codet, We booked at this location mainly because it has a spa unfortunately the sauna was under construction There was no warning on the hotel website or booking com that the sauna was not working It was very disappointing to not be able to enjoy something we were looking forward to the complete spa at the end of a LONG day of touring in Paris We also chose this hotel because of NO floor carpeting but the room was still apparently dusty , The hotel looked high end and beautifully decorated with high ceilings My husband was pleasantly surprised to have the in room Nespresso Coffee Maker and their breakfast was great The hotel is a good brisk walk of about 10 15 minutes to the Eiffel Tower 
203558,Le Cinq Codet, Small room hardly enough space to unpack our luggage The spa was closed for maintenance which we were only told about upon check in Advance notice upon reservation would have been appreciated, Beautiful interior design 
203559,Le Cinq Codet, It s far from the center of paris in a very calm area far from all main attractions very difficult to reach , Loved the design very modern charmimg Wonderful staff 
203560,Le Cinq Codet, Nothing, This really is a diamond in the rough Absolute hidden gem in Paris Would choose to stay here again everything about this hotel we loved Worth spending extra for duplex suite
203561,Le Cinq Codet,No Negative, The hotel was lovely modern and very clean all the staff were happy to help with anything and all extremely polite Whilst the hotel is a 5 star we felt comfortable and relaxed and didn t feel out of place even in jeans Would definitely go back 
203562,Le Cinq Codet, Room felt claustrophobic because there are no windows Felt like I was put in the corner room basement The staff looks at people of color oddly I didn t like that awkwardness There were gnats around the breakfast breads and omelette chef made worst omelet ever, The hotel was in a good location
203563,Le Cinq Codet, honestly and w out exaggeration none i did not like nothing to say , All the hotel facility and the staff was perfect even the staff kindness was remarkable i felt home location also was such a good to go near to everything needed 
203564,Le Cinq Codet, SPA has lack of attention from the management Good design and equipment but no water tea or anything you can drink after hammam , Nice and quite contemporary design and technology
203565,Le Cinq Codet, The room that I booked online was not the one we finally got For me it should be stated on the website that this room is not available and not mislead us like this We wanted to try Jacuzzi first they said its out of service and will be available in 10 min Nobody was there to provide us an update or more information Finally the Jacuzzi never worked so we didn t use it Again no updated provided and this was not stated on the website One guy from the staff was really reluctant to help us to book online a train ticket and print it really unacceptable for a 5star hotel , The room was cosy comfortable well equipped modern really beautiful The bathroom was very comfortable great view to invalides 
203566,Le Cinq Codet, Rooms aren t very soundproof as one would expect in a five star hotel You can hear people siting in the courtyard of the hotel talking until far after midnight Staff was not responsive when I wanted to change my room , Nice new hotel with good interior decoration

203569,Le Cinq Codet, Breakfast are not freshly cooked Bread are expired with white and green fungus This is disgusting It claimed to be a 5 star hotel but I would say it is worse than a motel service which cost me more than 18 thousand myr rooms given was very noisy near the restaurants which will only closed at 2 in the midnight awfully arrangement for guests who needed rest after a long hour exploring Paris Manager attitude was dumped and rude loud spoken manners without respect to the guests we requested a checked out in the middle of our stays due to the impolitely attitude treated by the manager , Besides the friendliness of the bell boy the design of the little 5 stars hotel Nothing much to say a yes to the review of 8 9 which make me booked the hotel 
203570,Le Cinq Codet, If I need to really look for something bad Breakfast was really good but not perfect , Wonderful hotel very innovative and modern room highly designed Everything is brand new and extra clean They are cleaning the room whenever you live it even if it is after 20 00 o clock The service was perfect nothing less You are feeling there a really VIP guest Location is up to 10 minutes walk to every important place in Paris For sure if and when we ll go back to Paris it will be in this hotel
