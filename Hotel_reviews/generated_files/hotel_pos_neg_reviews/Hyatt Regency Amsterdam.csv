440724,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, It was a distance from main attractions , Great hotel a bit of walking distance from city and sites but the walk to get there is very scenic and not too long but overall a great hotel to stay 
440725,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, More facilities such as swimming pool, Nice hotel closed to city center and museums but still tranquil and quiet supermarket and a couple of restaurants just across the road
440726,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, The price of the breakfast was daylight robbery totally over the top and in no way showed value for money , Unbelievably good staff The hotel is lovely 
440727,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam,No Negative, location is great Quiet which is important in Amsterdam but close to downtown and public transportation room and all infrastructure were great as expected
440728,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, There is nothing to dislike about this hotel , Everything was great but bathroom was wonderful My 4 year old son was always ready to take shower I had a hard time to keep him away from bathroom Staff was also so friendly that I have never seen in any other hotel during our stay I would highly recommend this hotel and will stay again Oh one more thing the cookie they served with coffee was delicious 
440729,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam,No Negative, Staff were very helpful food in the restaurant was excellent and the hotel was extremely clean Was within walking distance to the city centre without all the noise and annoyance of staying in the city centre 
440730,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, Location was a little far but only a 10 12 min taxi ride to city central , Great room Nice and spacious Everything was brand new and comfortable bedding Tram is a 1 min walk and the tram goes directly to city center 
440731,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, Great location but disappointed by service standards Bedding and supplies in room not changed for 3 days Had to ask cleaning for fresh towels each day Check in lady was very rude when she did not bother to check full name and told us that we booked two rooms for five nights and infact later found out that family name belonged to another guest in hotel She should have been careful before accusing us that we made booking not her and later she realized that she did not read the full name carefully and our booking was accurate She was not rude intentionally but a reckless in processing information before jumping to conclusion Room service day 1 Excellent I Great Guy Room service day 2 Very poor Ordered vegetable noodles and given chicken noodles despite reminding 3 times Reception was kind enough to not charge later but was very disappointed with 5 star hotel Requested adapter and waited for two hours to get it and reminded twice before getting it Gym was decent and enjoyed it Reception staff that checked in could have been little welcoming but that was not the main issue Good points Hotel is very near to Metro stop and very convenient to reach from airport Martin at reception was very polite and sincere Gym and sauna Room was ok , Location new property 
440732,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, the staff entered the room at several times even though we placed a do not disturb sign on the door we had not booked this hotel ourselves but was forced to stay there because booking com lost their reservation to our hotel when their system failed never use booking com , nothing the hotel is ugly it looks like a hospital sterile modern and joykill
440733,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam,No Negative, This hotel is located in a very quiet neighbourhood of Amsterdam but 2 subway stops from the centre of the city It s wonderful and modern and the restaurant has delicious fusion food and cocktails with an Indonesian touch Small rooms but that s like every hotel in Amsterdam 
440734,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, The wifi wasn t great but usually this is the case with most hotels , The bed was super comfy the shower was amazing and the room was beautiful and very relaxing we would definately come to stay again 
440735,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, Room s wi fi was occasionally fleeting I was still able to log on and plan all of the day s activities but sometimes I had to be patient , Spoke with four clerks three waiters two maitres d and one of the house keepers All were exceptionally courteous and helpful Room was clean quiet and comfortable Hotel is very convenient from Centraal Station via the metro Additionally the hotel is right on the tram line and trams 7 and 10 will take you straight to the Rijksmuseum the Van Gogh Museum and the Concertgebouw All of Amsterdam is easily accessed via public transportation yet the hotel is in a quiet location so you won t be kept awake by carousers 
440736,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, It s a new facility and the glitches are substantial Most aggravatingly there is apparently a motion sensor problem that makes all the lights in the room come on multiple all throughout the night It happened in both rooms they tried me in , Staff tried to be nice but they were selling an inferior product
440737,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, Nothing , Close to everything walking distance great service and very helpful TJ is ur guy Lovely food from room service Grocery Store Albert Heijn right across of hotel 
440738,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, We were on the 1st floor and there was some smell which origin I couldn t identify Could have been plastic the hotel is few months in operation or coming from the restaurant , The stuff was very useful friendly and responsive especially Tautvydas and Carlos Also the girl who checked us in Nice view from the windows to the canal behind the hotel 
440739,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, No pool Restaurant expensive with very few alternative options in the neighbourhood No quiet lounge area conducive to entertaining , Lovely modern hotel in a quieter neighbourhood Metro and tram stops very close Very comfortable spacious room Within walking distance of the Jewish quarter 
440740,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, The restaurant during bfast peak time You need more serving staff , Staff were exceptionally great Friendly and attentive Since it s a pretty new hotel I think housekeeping needs a bit of coaching They forgot to replace creamer and replace coffee capsules Restaurant during bfast was packed and I think there were not enough serving staff 
440741,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, The hotel describes itself as a City Centre hotel and it is not It is definitely a 20 30 minute walk away from the centre and a 50 cab ride to the airport , The comfy beds and quiet location
440742,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, Housekeeping seems not to have a checklist since 4 nights in a row something was not cleaned or missed general manager didn t care about any of my complains , Front office staff was great 
440743,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, When we arrived to the hotel the parking man cared for our car and parked it in the garage We couldn t start our car after a few days During our waiting for car assistance in lobby the staff proposed coffee and tea It was very nice until the bill I must pay for it , Nice room very helpful staff good location to visit in Amsterdam
440744,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, Pillows were very soft A tree was blocking the canal view Lights kept turning on and off in our room A bidet would make the bathroom more perfect , The hotel was beautiful from the lobby to the room Everything was new The bathroom was big and beautiful Staff were polite and friendly Pricey but worth it I loved it 
440745,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, Breakfast was not good Ordered Eggs Benedict and received two barely cooked eggs on top of spinich with whole grain bread I only correct ingredent was the holindase , Very clean
440746,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, Only soundproofing , The stuff was extremely kind and helpful we have booked all tickets for museums from the hotel the rental bikes are excellent the hotel restaurant is very nice the room is very clean and comfortable 
440747,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, Housekeeping although advised to reception too did not Clean ABD tidy the room Ot eda disappointing to find the room innlate afternoon as Had left in the morning ,No Positive
440748,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, Cost of breakfast was silly 28 euros each per day means we didn t bother and went round the corner for coffee pastries for a third of the cost, Really nice hotel Clearly very new A few teething issues with the cleaners around replacing dirty coffee cups etc but once they were highlighted the staff could not have been more helpful
440749,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, It feels like a business hotel that is trying to be family friendly There is a sterile air to the hotel The staff are friendly although lack a little training regarding customer service On arrival I was clearly struggling with some bags yet when I went inside the doorman was so busy chatting to and laughing with a pretty woman that he hadn t bothered coming out to help The staff were helpful behind the counter on all occasions when asked for assistance but only gave part of the answer For example Is there an ATM near here please Yes sir across the road in that direction I came back to the hotel after being unable to find the ATM only to be told that it was inside a supermarket out of sight and that I would have to go inside It would have been nice to know that the first time I asked So a reasonable travelling hotel not a comfortable one for a romantic weekend The staff need some client orientation training , It s located quite centrally to the city although if you struggle with walking you ll have to take a taxi in to the center It s clean and comfortable with good sized rooms The food is okay although not outstanding The staff are helpful but see my comments about the dislikes It was an okay hotel but there are better for the money 
440750,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, On our first morning we enjoyed the continental breakfast in the Club Room with Sylvia she was wonderful and later did the high tea with Sarah also great Being able to enjoy the amenities of the second floor Club Room made us feel special and worth the extra price for the room Then on the second day we were told that we should use the main breakfast room near the lobby instead of the Club Room for our breakfast and because we had a club suite it would be free of charge unless we ordered ala carte The coffee was great but sadly I didn t find the breakfast experience worth the price charged to those guests not staying on the second floor , Check in with TJ a guy from Lithuania and Julia on the reception desk was outstanding as they both were effective efficient and engaging Sylvia and Sarah in the Club Room were welcoming and made us feel very comfortable Wa el not sure how to spell his name also working the lobby was very helpful 
440751,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, Cant think of anything, Everything was brsnd new and dedigned to a very high standard Staff wrre really friendly and helpful Loved the bathroom design

440759,Hyatt Regency Amsterdam, Very distressing were the facts that on two of the three nights the lights magically turned on in our room several times and woke us The thermostat ticked or clicked keeping us awake We left it turned off the third night although they told us it was fixed after the first night On the second night the fire alarm went off at 1 00 am to vacate the building There was no fire , The staff were very friendly and helpful at all times Hotel is not close to popular tourist locations but is very handy to all forms of transit
