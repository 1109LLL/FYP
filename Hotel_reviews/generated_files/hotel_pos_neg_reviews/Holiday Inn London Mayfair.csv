133717,Holiday Inn London Mayfair, It shows that Holiday Inn group really needs to put some money back into the property even for their reputations sake It is very dated and the lifts take a century to use , The staff we re impeccable across the board We we re checked in Sarah who was thoughtful caring professional and quite simply amazing I wholeheartedly believe Sarah is being wasted at that hotel and that Holiday Inn should be utilising such talent to train others at the Holiday Inn group across the world Sarah is an example to all others in the hospitality industry and it was enjoyable to watch a team get along so well and harmoniously which most certainly ensured the service levels we re high The breakfast was reasonably good and the location was exceptional if you want to be in easy reach of everything London has to offer

133719,Holiday Inn London Mayfair, The Hotel furnishings while very clean and quaint need an update and the reception area and entrance to the hotel needs a make over The front entrance round about is adorned by trash containers and a dirty facade To look at the outside you would think the hotel was a 2 or 3 star when it is definitively a 4 Notwithstanding I would not hesitate recommending staying here to others , The reception desk concierge doormen and the cleaning and restaurant staff were exceptional 5 star and obviously well trained Proximity to ATM Starbucks Pharmacy Green Park Tube Bus Taxi was extremely convenient Breakfast was great Excellent location to restaurants of every sort and taste and you would find it hard to be in a better London location for sightseeing and a walk through beautiful parks and a maze of streets including Shepard s Market

133771,Holiday Inn London Mayfair, This is an old hotel with a long history Our room was a good size but the furnishings and bathroom were rather old fashioned with a shower over the bath Everything worked but the shower control took a bit of getting used to , This hotel must have one of the best positions in London It is one minute s walk from Green Park undergound station Piccadilly Victoria and Jubilee Lines and five minute walk up Piccadilly to the Burlington Arcade Fortnum s and a couple more minute s walk on to Piccadilly Circus and the heart of London s West End The staff were lovely smiling and helpful We had breakfast in our room and it arrived at exactly the time we specified and was fresh and varied

133775,Holiday Inn London Mayfair, Everything was horrible Over priced for a hotel that looks like a hotel from the 1950 s Hotel was SUPER outdated The entire hotel atmosphere is so sad the furniture was literally so old that if you would ve sat on it it could fall apart No bell man to carry out baggage so we had to do it ourselves I ve never seen a brand name hotel so horrible I would personally not recommend this hotel to anyone unless you have realllllyyyyy low standards , The only thing I like about the hotel was the location That s it to be honest

133787,Holiday Inn London Mayfair, 1 Coffee is dreadful with all 4 in my group expressing disgust both filtered at breakfast as well as the alternative machine For this price of hotel this is an easy fix and needs serious attention 2 When booking an extra night accommodation to the 6 days we had stayed I was quoted 4 times multiplier to the previous room rates Needless to say we moved hotels Demand had increased but I actually went up to a 5 star hotel 2 minute walk and saved just over GBP 200 per night on what Holiday Inn wanted to charge So no appreciation of the 6 days prior business or to incentivize a return I suggest they look at their policy, 1 Location proximity to public transport cafes restaurants Green park for outdoor activity Historic buildings and galleries Shops too 2 Breakfast met expectation given class ranking of hotel except the coffee see didn t like comments 3 Quiet bedrooms given busy location and enough space to feel comfortable to be in room if needed to work etc

133790,Holiday Inn London Mayfair, As we hadn t spoken to the reception when we left our bags I wanted to inform them we wouldn t be back till after midnight Not so easy with a Swiss mobile as they only have a premium rate number for the whole company network there is no separate number for their particular location Nightmare Finally worked for me when I dialled minus the customary 44 I associate for UK numbers Charge me more for the room and get rid of this unfriendly interface Or provide live chat , We were four ladies sharing one room and no other hotel around was offerring this Hilton has a policy for max three people Quite a surprise to arrive back at 01 00 and find Berkeley Street heaving with younger than us club goers Our room was street facing and very well insulated to the outside noise We left our bags with the concierge for most of our stay all efficiently handled There is an interesting gift shop next to the hotel and some of us went to a nearby nail bar

133797,Holiday Inn London Mayfair, 30 for one night s parking behind the hotel was expensive The member of staff on reception on arrival was unsmiling and we did not feel welcomed though our son who arrived separately and was presumably greeted by a different member of staff had a much warmer welcome , The location was perfect for our needs The soundproofing of the room was very effective 
133798,Holiday Inn London Mayfair, A bit jaded needs a complete deep clean nothing that the cleaners could do Stale damp smell in bedrooms We have stayed here before and would again but would love it to be sweeet smelling and the grout in the bathroom to be cleaned , Attitude of staff always polite and pleasant No hot water on one day for the whole hotel this was dealt with fairly politely and professionally Free drinks for all and monetary compensation no quibble Thank you 
133799,Holiday Inn London Mayfair, 2 elevators do not seem enough in the mornings breakfast buffet was so so coffee was terrible and layout of room was crowded we may have been spoiled over 6 weeks of traveling but of the 17 hotels we stayed at this breakfast was our least favorite just too crowded trying to get a piece of toast or some eggs and while we are not the pickiest this was the first hotel of our lengthy trip were the coffee was undrinkable our last morning we decided to go around the corner for breakfast at a quiet cafe with excellent coffee , Great staff from check in to concierge to housekeeping people could not have been more helpful or courteous Great location Across the road from the Ritz and Green Park We loved walking up and down Piccadilly Street The hotel is a little dated but very clean

133805,Holiday Inn London Mayfair, When we first arrived I approached reception and waited for someone to call me forward as one out of 3 receptionists were busy with a resident query I was then ignored for several minutes 2 Receptionists looked across down at me from their reception desk and continued to work at their computers Another couple then stepped in front of me and were asked how they could be assisted straight away When I mentioned it at the desk when I was eventually spoken to it was dismissed without apology I also didn t like the height of the reception for a wheelchair user it is far above head height which poses problems I couldn t sufficiently reach the card machine which could have left my pin exposed if the reception was busy As the reception was so high I felt that I was being talked down to which was a shame as all the other staff were brilliant , The concierge service were top notch They assisted us with a taxi and ensured that the taxi could cater for my wheelchair The facilities in our room were brilliant and catered for my needs as I had an accessible room the bathroom was very spacious and had taken into consideration the needs of a wheelchair user with appropriate grab rails and low level sinks

133857,Holiday Inn London Mayfair, The building seriously needs decorating and modernising as we were very disappointed with this hotel especially having stayed in other very good holiday inns I wouldn t consider staying here again as 297 a night for a hotel in this state was extremely poor value for money Left disappointed and wouldn t recommend , The staff were very good and helpful

133861,Holiday Inn London Mayfair, There wasn t much I didn t like other than the fact that there weren t many facilities at least I didn t notice things like a pool or gym But I understand this is London and such facilities are not easy to come by in hotels Although the hotel does offer a discount on breakfast for guests staying there i would have liked for it to be included free but I understand that doing so would probably have resulted in higher room charges so I guess a discount is a good compromise On the whole I was very pleased with the hotel and had a lovely stay , Staff were very helpful and friendly Rooms were very clean and housekeeping was excellent the location is ideal Just a two minute walk to green park station and a leisurely 15 min stroll to buckingham palace

133866,Holiday Inn London Mayfair, 1 of the 2 lifts was broken These things happen of course but nothing was being done about this despite the fact it was causing us fellow guests on high floors problems on a busy Saturday morning because of the long delays waiting for the 1 lift that worked we had to use the emergency exit stairs 3 times in all on the morning of our departure hence the lowest ratings for facilities comfort shown above Also the newspaper wasn t delivered outside our room When I asked about this at reception I was told 9 times out of 10 someone takes it away highly unlikely I thought because I d checked outside at 7am then at 730 before going for breakfast In fairness the paper was delivered at breakfast As an IHG Rewards member I have stayed in several Holiday Inns in the UK I was a bit disappointed overall with this stay compared with the high standards I ve experienced in the past , Breakfast good

133892,Holiday Inn London Mayfair, I do not think a bill presented with a space for gratuity when a service charge has already been taken off shows the place if in a good light At best it looks greedy at worst it looks like they re are hoping guests won t notice and will pay twice , business
