176905,Le Grand H tel de Normandie, The staff were completely and utterly rude especially on arrival the gentleman was so rude Not a very good start Staff need to learn to smile and have some manners The state of the room lower than average needs a reno Was most disappointed ,No Positive
176906,Le Grand H tel de Normandie, very small room too much noisy at nights beacause of the bar that was close to hotel and ambulances commute very thin walls, excellent location very clean friendly staff
176907,Le Grand H tel de Normandie, The view from our room was lame but you can t do anything about that at least it had a window , We loved this hotel The location was perfect convenient easy to find and right in the middle of where we wanted to be Across from the train station was perfect for our day trip to Giverny Easy to walk to shopping We arrived early before check in but the kind staff allowed us to check our bags so we could venture out and see the sites The breakfast was very good Our room was small but just right for us my daughter loved the twin beds Definitely recommend this hotel 
176908,Le Grand H tel de Normandie, I checked in at 8 30pm and when entering the room assigned to me I had a major shock It stank like horrible garbage and there was a pair of men s shoes on the floor I got scared and was confused whether or not there is someone in the room and was afraid to enter After looking around for one more second I saw a bag standing on the bed as well so ran out of the room down to the reception which cannot even be called a reception but a desk with some employee When explaining that there is someone in my room and that I was so scared and need to be given another room the employee did not even apologize to me and started calling his manager on the phone After 30mins of waiting I was assigned another room and given breakfast for free as a compensation for the trouble At least this room was not occupied and didn t stink however cleanliness was questionable The drain in the shower was full of black hair and clogged the window didn t close properly and was hence super noisy in the room as it was facing the train station The pillows were stained as well Overall it was my worst stay ever in Paris where I come at least 2 3 times a year and stay in different hotels in the same price range every time I will definitely never return and can for sure say that this is not a 4star hotel and certainly not worth the 280 a night a total rip off If you have the choice do not stay here There is 100 better hotels for this price I only stayed there because all of the hotels in Paris were unfortunately booked out , Nothing except for the location
176909,Le Grand H tel de Normandie, You have to go down to get the ironing board and they will tell you to wait as there are no people in the reception After waiting for so long thinking that they will send the iron to your room end up you have to get it yourself from the recep The kettle was not working and when u told them this they replaced with another spoiled kettle Whats more this guy of Indian descent even argue that he replaced it with new one But he did not check whether its working Duh And for storage luggage they wont help you the lady just pointed to us where to store our luggages The door knob in the toilet was spoilt and the bath tub is just for display no water stopper despite the fact that we already feedback with them and they promised that they will do something about it They could lie To the customers just like that And the toilet separate from the shower smells like urine We could not take it so i mop it myself Stayed here 3 nights as we have kids and its difficult to transfer hotel anymore But will definitely not coming back And to booking com i honestly having doubts now if the review you posted on your website are authentic , Ali the receptionist when we arrive after an 18 hour flight was a darling And the location is great
176910,Le Grand H tel de Normandie, Breakfast is not good Hotel cannot provide an ordinary toast bread because it is a holiday Lady receptionist is not so friendly not like the other 2 guys who smiles and friendly , Location
176911,Le Grand H tel de Normandie, The breakfast could be more perfect if there are more kinds of foods Also the hairdryer couldn t work for a long time and this is very inconvenient , The location is excellent and super convenient There is only one minutes from the exit of subway to the hotel And there are shops around the hotel The staff are nice and they allowed us to store our luggages there even if we had already checked out 
176912,Le Grand H tel de Normandie, The twin room was tiny and lacked any warmth There wasn t even a print or picture to lift the non discript cream walls You had to chase round the droplets of water coming from the shower head to get wet There was a mini bar with nothing in it There was no bar in the hotel There was no iron in the room Walls paper thin Couldn t sleep with the excertions from next door Breakfast was very poor coffee from a machine in France 4 star no way Basic 2 3 star at most , nothing
176913,Le Grand H tel de Normandie, The company title for the bill was wrongly issued twice spelling mistakes but then they tell me the system not allowed to do adjustment again , 
176914,Le Grand H tel de Normandie, Too expensive No service for a 4 star hotel Stayed over the weekend and no one cleaned the room tidied the bed in 2 days Had my sign make up the room hanged when I left in the morning came back at 15 30 and no one had done the room They knocked on my door at 17 asking if they could do the turndown I said I would be out in 15mn was just out of the shower and the maid said she should have been gone already she was working overtime like insisting on not doing my room I wished her good day and good luck and finished getting ready When I left after 10mn of course no one came to do the room 4 star hotel they call it Unacceptable , The location
176915,Le Grand H tel de Normandie, Bottle of water cost 4 euros and breakfast for each 12 euros are unbelievably expensive , Breakfast was expensive I was told it will be cheaper for 2 days and 2 people but it was same 12 Euro each so it came upto 48 euros not what I was told
176916,Le Grand H tel de Normandie, Fairly small room but didn t matter as we were out all the time Probably a good size for the centre of Paris , Great location next to RER and metro Staff went out of their way to help us 
176917,Le Grand H tel de Normandie, The system using a code for wi fi was a bit difficult although the receptionist helped out You have to change the code everyday and as I stayed for a week it was a bit inconvenient but not a big problem, Room was comfortable and good facilities Hotel was nice and peaceful not too big and staff were very kind and helpful I would stay there again As a sole woman traveller I felt very safe and secure Very convenient location 
176918,Le Grand H tel de Normandie, From the outside you might wonder if you made a mistake you didn t , The hotel has a great location Rooms for Paris very adequate size Yes small for what Americans are used to but plenty large for our needs The bathroom plenty large good shower free safe in room and the room was quiet Will recommend this hotel to friends 
176919,Le Grand H tel de Normandie, The breakfast area was also the lobby I would have liked a nice lobby to sit in Tea sugar and milk not replaced each day in the room as there were tea making facilities , The room was very comfortable The air conditioning worked well which was great as the weather was hot The room was always made up on time and the breakfast was very nice and served in a nice breakfast area I loved having a fridge so that we could store water and keep it cool If we wanted the mini bar it would have been stocked but I preferred to have the fridge Lovely stay nice central hotel spacious by French standards Would certainly stay again 
176920,Le Grand H tel de Normandie, Although very helpful the staff could be friendlier and could be warmer in receiving guests , Location as always was excellent And the rooms are new and clean and sufficient 
176921,Le Grand H tel de Normandie, My business trip to Paris was cancelled due to a French air traffic controller strike No flights available The hotel was completely unhelpful and rude when I asked if I could change my reservation to the following week but had no problem charging me the full room rate , Nothing
