385045,Acta CITY47, The hotel is located in a quiet area of Barcelona which is good in many ways but you will need to travel to the tourist hot spots i e the old quarter near La Rambla It takes about 20 mins and 10 euros by taxi The hotel could have provided more information about its services , Our room was quiet modern and attractive and looked out on a small park The hotel is located less than 10 mins walk from the Barcelona Sants train station This is very convenient if coming to and from the airport by train and or catching trains to regional locations The one meal we had in the hotel restaurant was simple but very good

385063,Acta CITY47, There s an issue with the showers temperatures keep on middle setting as hot water blasts can be painful Also the rooms were super hot , Carlos on reception was amazing super friendly and always happy to help The other reception staff were polite and helpful Location was excellent Complimentary items would be nice 
385064,Acta CITY47, The shower was faulty and it was kept fluctuating between hot and cold water after every 2 mins which was very annoying It use to get really hot and this should be looked into ASAP Also the WIFI is extremely slow in the rooms Its a 4 star hotel so they should definitely try to sort these out , It is located very close to the train and the metro station The rooms are decent size and the staff is very friendly 
385065,Acta CITY47, The room was very small but as we only stayed one night it was fine , As we re we re travelling by train being near Barcelona Sants was great The hotel was in a quiet street 
385066,Acta CITY47, Important for me is a great shower in the morning The shower I had was flipping back and forth from warm to cold For me very annoying Maybe only that day I only stayed one night so might be an incident Not a very interesting area mainly living apartments , Everything except the shower Nice breakfast you can sit outside close to the train station Far from touristic area s however for 10 euro a taxi easily brings you there Nice terrace on a Plaza

385070,Acta CITY47, Did not ask for a smoking room but I got one Told the reception and got the answer that there was no other room for me to chance So I had to stay in a room that smells like a heavy smoker just stayed few hours ago The air condicitonor also doesn t work well , Location is good
385071,Acta CITY47, The hotel is a bit run down The rooms smell and it needs new paint etc Does not show the standards of a 4 star hotel The breakfast is average at most , Location And the staff It was also clean 
385072,Acta CITY47, A kettle in the room with drink making facilities When we did ask for a pot of tea we were told it would be 1 5 euros However when we went to collect it it we were charged 4 50 euros , The welcome and subsequent service we received at reception Gladys was particularly helpful in giving us advice to make the most of our stay She was totally committed and is definitely an asset to the hotel 
385073,Acta CITY47, A 4 star hotel that had no in room information about any on site amenities like restaurant or gym Only a brochure about massage We went to ask about food and they referred us outside the hotel After a turbulent flight and jet lag that wasn t optimal for us We reserved a mini room which would have been sufficient for our very short stay and were upgraded But a staffer lectured us that the room wasn t really appropriate for adults more for young people traveling and warned that next time we would not be guaranteed an upgrade , Nice towels large bathroom comfortable bed Upgrade to larger room Convenience to train station Free wi fi

385078,Acta CITY47, Food standard in the cafe needs to be lifted , The staff were very professional friendly and very helpful Nothing was too much trouble Congratulations particularly the afternoon manager Pierre and the receptionist Gladys
385079,Acta CITY47, The room was a bit warm but im sure if we were able to control the temperatures on the panel it would have been fine , This hotel is very close to the train station which was very convenient for us Good value for money Friendly staff at the reception Comfortable stay Will be going back there in a week 
385080,Acta CITY47, The room was very noisy with a large gap betweem the entrance door and the floor so you could hear all the noises from the hallway We barely slept Also the shower was wery hard to use and we had to leave the water running for 10 minutes before it was hot The hotel has 4 stars but it should be rated at 3 Very basic room with highly overpriced minibar We will not return here , The location is very good near Estacion de Sants 
385081,Acta CITY47, The room was a little to hot However I think that might have been our mistake as we found the heat control when we were leaving , The bed Vey comfortable plus close to railway
385082,Acta CITY47, Very small rooms and no availability of iron or iron board which is a prerequisite for business trips This being said an ironing service was available at the hotel as part of the normal laundry service , A decent hotel in the not so central part of Barcelona Clean rooms and a nice staff Close to the Metro

385084,Acta CITY47, The toilet is very small and congested there should not be a bath tub think about old people they need to jump over to be in the tub and with slippery tiles it can lead to medical energency just to note everthing perfecto , Best smiling recepection staff The location is suberb 
385085,Acta CITY47, Very basic rooms which were not well cleaned not at all as expected from the images shown here Breakfast was poor very little choice with no English menu , Great location wifi available throughout the hotel helpful and friendly staff 
385086,Acta CITY47, Room service was undercooked and breakfast was ok but not great Wouldn t pay for breakfast to be included if I stayed again, Great links to airport and metro Very comfy and I felt very secure as a solo female character 
385087,Acta CITY47, The bed and pillows were very uncomfortable Some staff were grumpy and rude Room was smaller than images shown and was not very clean hairs all over extra blanket we told the manager and he said he had changed it but still was dirty Breakfast was very poor for a 4 star hotel There was no atmosphere When we complained all the manager was concerned about was reselling the room as we wished to move , The hotel was in an easy location The look of the outside and lobby 
385088,Acta CITY47, Room very small not as in photos No complimentary coffee or tea in hotel To request for hot water there is a service charge of 4 n they only come with sugar without teabags or coffee , Near to metro Sant Estacio which is very convenient to anywhere Nearby lots of cafes n supermarkets 
385089,Acta CITY47, The dining room was old fashioned the breakfast was cold every day The people who worked in the dining area were not very friendly U were hard pushed to get a drink in the bar due to it closing early The hotel itself was lovely but there was no pool and it was quite expensive to stay there it definitely needed more amenities The reception staff were friendly and helpful so was the manager , The hotel was nice but the eating area was very old fashioned 
385090,Acta CITY47, Rooms are very small but it s fine for a short term stay , Very handy to the train station and within walking distance of a range of amenities Happy to be relocated to another room after the first one was musty smelling and had no ventilation 
385091,Acta CITY47, The room was small and drab It s called a city hotel but it s miles from the city The breakfast which we paid for was inedible and the staff in the restaurant were not interested , Nothing
385092,Acta CITY47, There were no coffee tea making facilities in the room a small downside but would have been nice to have the option The breakfast was very poor I would not recommend including the breakfast in your stay as there are lots of small coffee shops bakery s cafes etc all around Barcelona so you will find something in no time There is a little cafe just down the road from the hotel , The staff were so helpful and friendly when we asked for recommendations The location was great being so close to a metro station 2 minute walk but in a quiet part of Barcelona so you were able to retreat back to the hotel after experiencing the hustle and bustle of Barcelona The room was very comfortable we had 3 adults sharing and there was plenty of room for us 
385093,Acta CITY47, The 5 yrs old child is charged with extra 15 euro even shared with the same bed Strongly suggest to put it in the policy directly to make it clear instead of just all child are welcome The hotel facility is a bit old but location is pretty convenient , The receiption is very nice and helpful 
385094,Acta CITY47, Air conditioning in the rooms were off although it is Autumn Poor amenities there was no comforter the hair dryer is old low water pressure from shower heads safe with keys where you have to place a refundable deposit at the check in counter , Staff was friendly Not the main station but still near a station and good location for Travellers who would like to take a train to travel out of Barcelona Cafes with decent breakfast Relatively safe and quiet surrounding 
385095,Acta CITY47, Air con not working properly shower was temperamental and burned me on two occasions no iron in the room or available without using the laundry service and the room was tiny , Good location
385096,Acta CITY47, Parking is a little bit expensive 20 euros per night but ok I understand it s Barcelona , Good and comfortable design super friendly stuff attention to details 
385097,Acta CITY47, Tiny room with a view of the inside of the other side of the internal part of the building Rather noisy I could hear the man in the next door coughing as well as his air conditioning in the night The man on reception was rather grumpy when we arrived and kept us waiting 10 minutes to check in The shower was in the bath I have stayed in better 3 star hotels, Convenient for the station
385098,Acta CITY47, About the only negative things I can say about our stay at the Acta City47 hotel is the lighting system in the room could have been a little brighter a chair in the room would have helped and maybe a plug in or two around the couch area These are not strong negative comments I would recommend this hotel to anyone and I would stay there again if I ever return to this great city , I liked the willingness of the staff to help in good English with any information that we asked about they were always more than accommodating regardless of who was at the front counter Very good restaurant staff I liked the location because of the close proximity to two great grocery stores restaurants shopping and the main train metro bus station in Barcelona Sants Estacio This hotel would receive my first consideration for a place to stay if I am ever lucky enough to return to the great friendly city of Barcelona 
385099,Acta CITY47, We brought a small portable kettle with us as one isn t supplied in the room Local supermarket to buy milk etc local too hotel So it wasn t a problem, Reception staff were friendly and welcoming Metro 2mins 10 journey pass lasted 3 days Very relaxed atmosphere plenty of space on the terrace to chill out 
385100,Acta CITY47, Nothing, We loved this hotel stayed in a few but this 1 is far the best Location cleanliness n overall fantastic Will mist deffinatly be returning here again 
385101,Acta CITY47, Room was full of dust sheep Bathroom cleanliness was just OK Some reception staff are just useless Of course some others are brilliant If you re a return customer like we were don t expect any sort of recognition at some point I said yes I know I ve been here before and the response was ah you should have told me check in would have been a lot easier I should tell you really On the last day when I picked up the luggage we had left since the morning I was asked how many bags I had 3 after which I was invited to the back storage room and picked up whatever I wanted without any check Breakfast is not brilliant TIP cross Carrer de Nicaragua and go up the street about 200 meters On a corner there is a baker tea shop kind of place where you can have a fab breakfast fresh baguettes danish coffee freshly squeezed orange juice etc for less than 5 euros a head , Location location location Spacious room with mega large bed 
385102,Acta CITY47, The power went off late Friday we were told that it was possibly the case another resident had over loaded the system It was noisey we could hear comings and goings throughout the night The area is possibly up and coming but not quite there yet I would not like to be outside after dark in this area Room was very small and bed was too , The staff Anna the receptionist in particular was fantastic Once we got our bearings the location was ok Overall style was good It was very clean 
385103,Acta CITY47, We booked a double room but we were given a twin single room on Day 1 The room was a bit too small Also breakfast is pretty average, great location very handy to Metro station railway station and bus depot
385104,Acta CITY47, Wi Fi connection does not function well in the rooms , During our stay we have dealt with very friendly and helpful staff members but also with a very rude one Location is excellent 
385105,Acta CITY47,No Negative, The staff were very helpful and friendly the hotel was clean and it was a very pleasant experience I would recommend this hotel any day Especially because of its proximity to Sants Estacio
385106,Acta CITY47, Wifi didn t work in some areas of hotel, The style of the hotel The staff were very helpful and friendly Very close to public transport facilities
385107,Acta CITY47, Long walk to the centre of blanes Bfast good but otherwise food poor Small room Rock hard mattresses , Clean and functional Equivalent to a travel inn Close to beach 
385108,Acta CITY47, The only down side to an enjoyable stay To put the plug in the bath you needed to stand in the bath , The lounge area was nice to chill with a coffee The bed was very comfortable 
385109,Acta CITY47, The hotel was in a bad location the service was not good the staff was not accommodating much less than what you would expect from a four star hotel many of which did not speak english and the room was very small with little room to move around in , It was a very nice and clean hotel 
385110,Acta CITY47, The wifi connection wasn t very good and the restaurant didn t have much choice for lunch and tea especially for vegetarians But in the grand scheme of things these were not significant issues , Staff were lovely the room was clean and it had all necessary facilities including a secure room to store luggage after checking out There was also a large selection of foods at breakfast We didn t speak any Spanish but the staff understood our English perfectly and were quite fluent in other languages too There was always someone on reception and they greeted us warmly every time we entered the reception area The location of the hotel isn t far from one of the Aerob s drop off points making it easy to get to from the airport I d happily stay here again and I would recommend it to anyone Thank you very much for a great stay 0D
385111,Acta CITY47, Everything was nice except that the noise from outside could be heard and unfortunately while we were there some constructions started in front of the hotel and we were barely able to sleep more than 7 8am , We really liked the position and also that we were able to eat breakfast on the terrace while enjoying a cup of coffee 
385112,Acta CITY47,No Negative, Nice hotel The location is just great The metro with L3 L5 station is just outside the hotel Train station Sants is 5 minure walking About the room it was fine room we had ants in the room so it was bit of a downer but besides that everything is good
385113,Acta CITY47, Construction in front of hotel made parking difficult We were told the wrong time to move our car from the free parking area around the hotel and it was towed There were crumbs and ants in the floor of the dining area , Modern room with friendly staff
385114,Acta CITY47, Rooms were comfortable with good facilities but not well sound proofed activity tv etc could be heard in adjacent rooms , As we were returning from a cruise and needed to catch a train the next morning the hotel was ideally located 5 min walk to station hotel was clean with a nice modern feel breakfast was excellent
385115,Acta CITY47, A little variation in the breakfast buffet would be appreciated Tranquility levels at night are overly dependent on the consideration of neighbouring guests i e thin walls Removing the card key doesn t switch off the air conditioning when you leave which wastes energy Would prefer the fridge to be empty so I don t have to remove minibar items to put my own in , Reliable wifi and air conditioning Good size TV Superior marble faced bathroom Carrefour supermarket and restaurants nearby Helpful reception Double glazing so a nice quiet room if the neighbours are cooperative 
385116,Acta CITY47, the wifi connection was very bad throughout the stay not being able to provide iron facilities in the room was a really low part for me and lastly i thought i had a king size bed booked instead i had to single separated beds pushed together , the highlight of the stay was the staff who were very pleasant and helpful throughout the stay 
385117,Acta CITY47, I arrived 10pm at night and it was a bit dark to walk to the hotel from Sants Estacio not from metro exit I came out from the station and tried to find my way A bit feel insecure but I still feel safe , Near to the metro and bus as well as airport Sants Estacio even though it will take some time to the city centre approx15 20 mins Nice room comfy bed clean and provide basic toiletries A few small shops if you walk from Sants Estacio LIDL and Carrefour just around the corner 
385118,Acta CITY47, The head person in the restaurant refused to allow us to use borrow a corkscrew His response was if I lent a corkscrew to everyone business in the bar would be non existent Reception was good except for one male employee ,No Positive
385119,Acta CITY47, The staff were not helpful friendly and traveler oriented that gave me the most unpleasant experience in staying in Spain s hotels The hotel is absolutely not value for money and four stars I would not recommend this hotel ,No Positive
385120,Acta CITY47, small somewhat tight quarters, Location near Sants RR station and metro stop quiet atmosphere advantage of having a branch of Mercadona supermarket around the corner friendly and helpful staff 
385121,Acta CITY47, Personally all good apart from the wifi I really hope the hotel can improve their Internet working The network collapsed all the time and sometimes you even couldn t open a new page I just used my own 3G network , The room has enough space and was clean and bright 
385122,Acta CITY47, The garage is a little tight for parking a long car if the garage is full lucky for me it was not , Location is near train station Remfe and Barcelona metro station access from Numancia street The walk across Malaga Park and you are at hotel Restaurant close by and reaso able rates 
385123,Acta CITY47, No tea and coffee facilities in our room , It was perfect for us to walk to from the station The staff were very helpful re booking trips or taxis or helping us on the computer 
385124,Acta CITY47, Walls and ceilings were a bit thin so you could hear furniture being moved above toilet flushing and shower when in the bathroom and people in the corridors However not a very busy hotel so this was not too much of a problem , Very friendly and helpful reception staff Very close to Barcelona Sants station so convenient for getting around
385125,Acta CITY47, No hotel information booklet in the room , Size of room was good staff very helpful also there was a lounge with comfortable chairs where we met with our friends 
385126,Acta CITY47, Our double bed was 2 single beds brought together When showering the water often changed from hot to cold So be careful that you don t get burnt or freeze The fridge wasn t working properly Bar drinks in fridge were not cold Room is too small And there were no coffee making facilities Over priced , Both reception and the male staff member in the restaurant was very helpful and friendly The room itself was clean This hotel is not too far from supermarkets and train station s 
385127,Acta CITY47, Wifi was really bad The very first day we had breakfast We were severy dissapointed by it as it did not include anything spanish and as well as the food was underwhelming compared to the price From next days we started eaiting at a nearby bakery which was really good Compared to the room price it did not offer any facilities in the hotel such as pool or good gym , The neighbourhood was really quite and subway was really close Room was properly maintained everyday 
385128,Acta CITY47, In middle of a mainly residential area but this offset by convenience of location five minutes from station , Convenience of location next to station Working air conditioning in bedroom Very good breakfast selection 
385129,Acta CITY47, Since this hotel does not have a consierge service it would be nice fir the front desk staff to be a little more helpful particularly when not busy with check ins , OK value fir the money 
385130,Acta CITY47, Only two things weren t ok with us the bed was double two separate beds also the the water from the shower sometimes while taking the shower it gets very hot suddenly , The room and bathroom size are good clean calm help full staff fast check in and check out the hotel location is not in the center but near the main train station and a metro station which takes you away to the center in 15 mins many supermarkets near to the hotel we really enjoyed our stay 
385131,Acta CITY47, Dinner wasn t too good at least the dishes on the extensive menu we had Moreover it s rather unfair on staff to have a woman doubling as bar staff and waitress whose command of English was very poor indeed Breakfast was much better though , Front desk staff were really efficient and very pleasant with a sound command of English unlike my Spanish The hotel is a short walk from Barcelona Santes rail station which in turn is a short hop by train from the airport The train station is connected to the airport s Terminal 2 by a long enclosed overhead walkway which is great if it s wet There is no travelator though for the older less fit or those with heavy baggage Excellently positioned hotel if staging through Barcelona or indeed staying as the nearest station on the first class city wide metro system is just round the corner 
385132,Acta CITY47, we were there at a time of change over and the restaurant was average it would seem that post 1st May the whole menu setup changes A little more information in the rooms about the area places to eat etc would have been helpful to the first time visitor, location close to railway station and metro
385133,Acta CITY47, The room was laughably tiny Just about OK for one person staying for a couple of nights but for the two of us with luggage commensurate with our four week trip round Sicily and Spain it was pitifully inadequate This would be fine if it had been advertised as a single room but it was not The view onto the cigarette strewn roof just below us was fairly enervating as well , the location so close to Sants station was very convenient for both the airport and our onward train journey to Madrid 
385134,Acta CITY47, Not in the city center Tea coffee maker in the room would be nice , Very close to the metro station L3 Green Line and main train station Sants Comfortable clean quite rooms Very useful bathroom facilities including comb toothbrush toothpaste Large bath towels which I liked a lot Kind and lovely staff they were always so helpful with my questions 
385135,Acta CITY47, Too may narrow corridors steps in the corridor so lifting heavy suitcases was difficult up and down the corridor Very small room Bed was more suitable for a child , Close to St Pancras 
385136,Acta CITY47, Went in April and weather was warm no AC available at that time because of the transition from winter to summer per staff Need to work on WiFi strength , Great Boutique like hotel quiet and friendly staff Breakfast is a plus here 
385137,Acta CITY47, despite service and food was ok in the restaurant it would deserve re design it looks cheap and slushy and it does not fit so much to the rest of the hotel, breakfast very good with many variations sweet salty cold hot coffee tea other drinks good location next to the train station and metro nice room adn comfortable beds service at reception
385138,Acta CITY47, Room was dusty which caused me a lot of allergies no available slippers or dental kit had to ask frequently for them far away from almost everything and anything Air conditioner was controlled by the hotel had to sweat all night because the heater is on and open the window I ended up catching a cold No water kettle or tea facilities in the room , Staff was very friendly and nice
385139,Acta CITY47, The worst lack off sleep ever and this from a frequent traveller due to a mattress that felt it was half filled with rags actually moved to the floor at one point it was that uncomfortable air conditioning that only blew hot air and a fridge that developed a fault midway through the night to sound like a 2 stroke motorcyle we switched it off No ironing facilities onsite which I felt was very poor for a 4 star and of no use if staying short term as we were next day paid for service rooms were also noisy and actually thought our neighbours had accessed our room at one point through the night Sort these issues out and this place could be great as the communal areas styling was very nice and the rooms good enough room 304, Good breakfast very handy for Sants train station friendly staff nice square outside to sit and a competitive price This could be a great place if they worked on the negatives that followed There is a lot of competition in the same price range location so I wouldn t think it would be difficult to beat
