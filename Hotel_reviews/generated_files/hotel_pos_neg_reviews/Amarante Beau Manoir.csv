220893,Amarante Beau Manoir, A member of the staff tried to charge us 40 EUR per night for an extra room for our son even though we had booked a family room He did however accept our arguments and we didn t have to pay extra , Great location and luxurious interior 
220894,Amarante Beau Manoir, With the price we paid I expected a better breakfast The breakfast area was cleared 15 mins before the time the breakfast should finish This is unacceptable Also the quality of the breakfast was not so good ,No Positive
220895,Amarante Beau Manoir, No tea and coffee making facilities Rooms need an upgrade as the wallpaper looked rather tired , Location was excellent Rooms were comfortable Metro is only 2 minutes walk 
220896,Amarante Beau Manoir, The hotel advertised air conditioning our room and 3 other guest complained in the middle of the night of no air conditioning We could open the windows but the traffic and construction on the building noise caused a lack of sleep This was my first trip to Paris and the experience here makes it my last Management tried to move us to a cooler room but it was broken too Then to add to the heat we had accommodations for 3 family room and the new room only had 1 bed It had a pull out sofa but when the slip cover came off the sofa looked as if a dog chewed on it because it was ripped in several places It also looked stained We are a family that likes to camp and this room was the worst than sleeping on the ground My husband was going to sleep on the couch but it was so disgusting we all sleep sidesays across the only bed It was the worst hotel , The service we received during breakfast 
220897,Amarante Beau Manoir, Staff somewhat rude Not allowing check in until it was exact 2 pm We were there 1 hour before Not even 5 minutes to 2 pm Asking us to wait Well it takes at least 5 minutes to process check in with somebody with confirmed booking Torn lounge in room covered with a grey sheet Such was the lounge which should go to junkyard not in a so called 4 star hotel Dirty chair with stains , Location only 
220898,Amarante Beau Manoir, I couldn t figure out how the shower worked it was set up in the bath Instead I just took baths , I had breakfast outside the hotel The room was comfortable and well appointed I found the Reception staff to be very helpful A nice touch was having apples available to eat near reception 
220899,Amarante Beau Manoir, No hot water on several occasions General decor very poor Lift no working on one day room on the fifth floor Staff not friendly not helpful Pre paid for a suite 780 for 3 nights rip off Better in a traveloge, Location
220900,Amarante Beau Manoir, I was staying at this hotel 24 28 5 2017 and became badly bitten by VERMIN during my stay there I ve contacted my physician directly the same day I left the hotel and he confirmed it I ve sent the message with the pictures with the marks at my body to the hotel and the person who answered me wrote that it was somewhere else I became bitten but not at this hotel Nonsense as I ve got marks already the same day as I left the hotel and the pictures are dated I answered with the e mail twice where I asked for the contact details to the owners but still haven t got any answer Being a 4 property it is not acceptable In general the hotel has old furnitures textiles and carpets in the rooms building and hotel s cleaning crevice is not the best one as for example my room remained unclean last day I was staying at the hotel And obviously VERMIN And very poor customer care ,No Positive
220901,Amarante Beau Manoir, Getting the room you book rather than having to sort it on arrival after a long day travelling, The rooms I booked were not twin separate beds as I requested I had my 3 teenage children with me who wanted there own bed This was fixed the following day but stressful when we arrived I also requested no ground floor room as they are dark and noisy from previous experiance Again we were allocated a ground floor room but we we were moved to an alternative better grade room at the same price I have stayed many times at this hotel on business trips Its location is the no 1 factor 
220902,Amarante Beau Manoir, No tea and coffee making facilities It took 2 days for an electric kettle to become available The rooom needs updating eg wallpaper looks old , Location was excellent Room was comfortable and very clean 
220903,Amarante Beau Manoir, There was no ice , After seeing some negative reviews on TripAdvisor we were skeptical But the price through Booking com was unbeatable so we gave it a try It was perfect We had three adults for 9 nights hard to accommodate in Paris but they upgraded us to their largest suite and provided extra padding for the pull out bed and everything was very comfortable and clean The staff was extraordinarily friendly and housekeeping was attentive The Wifi worked except for a couple of hours one night The AC was perfectly adequate though the weather was not particularly hot when we were there The minibar was stocked and we enjoyed the little wine bar in the lobby sitting area which is beautifully appointed with historic touches and is very lovely and pleasant The hotel could not be better located Staying near the Place de Madeleine is a perfect choice for ease of sightseeing museums shopping dining gourmet foods and transport The Metro is nearby and a taxi stand is just steps away from the hotel The taxis in Paris by the way are terrific and very affordable Many great sights including the Madeleine church Opera Place de Concord Tuileries and Louvre are also very walkable from this location We did not sign up for the breakfast preferring to venture out to the numerous nearby cafes But we did wind up spending about the same amount as we would have if we had ordered from the hotel I would highly recommend this lovely little hotel and would definitely stay there again 
220904,Amarante Beau Manoir, We had a problem with water temperature no hot water at one point That was about the only negative, The staff were lovely to us the entire time and we loved the traditional style of the hotel 
220905,Amarante Beau Manoir, The taps of the washbasin and bathtub was broken so it was always too hot water coming from the taps Although I said it to staff 3 times they didnt fix it There was no place to hang the shower It wasn t possible to even wash my face because of very hot water There was cracks on the walls of the hotel Not renovated I don t recomment it , Location
220906,Amarante Beau Manoir, I was in a ground floor room which was noisy at night with people walking past on the street, The hotel was in a good location but was a little tired in its decor I expected a bit more for a room costing 200 per night
220907,Amarante Beau Manoir,No Negative, We arrived after a flight to Brussels then a train to Paris and finally a taxi to the hotel They were able to store our bags while we walked around Paris The staff was most friendly and ready with a recommendation for dinner at a nearby delicious restaurant The room had a great set up for a family as their was a low partition between the beds We could see our daughter but she wasn t directly next to us The beds were comfortable and the room was clean I wish we were able to stay longer than one night

220910,Amarante Beau Manoir, The place looks decrepit The lights in the room did not work Impossible to see anything in the closets Mildew in the closets We should have had a curtain to separate the double bed from the sofa bed but there was only a rod The showered did not work ,No Positive

220913,Amarante Beau Manoir, The room was not as per the picture the safe did not work there was no shower and the bath tub plug did not work breakfast was poor and had no selection Overall terrible and I would not prescribe anyone to stay there Absolutely terrible all round Gbb, The room was not as per the picture the safe did not work there was no shower and the bath tub plug did not work breakfast was poor and had no selection Overall terrible and I would not prescribe anyone to stay there Absolutely terrible all round 
220914,Amarante Beau Manoir, Bathroom old cold The shower wasn t a real shower You personal have to hold it above your head while sprizz on the floor no covering no cabine Tiny bathtube The heater in the bedroom was a electric one Definetly not state of the art , Very friendly staff Room was big 
220915,Amarante Beau Manoir, The hotel room could have included complimentary water and coffee , The hotel is in a great spot Close to the metro and a 5 min walk to Concord Also if you like shopping Lafayatte mall is within a walking distance 
220916,Amarante Beau Manoir, Wouldn t say it is a 4 star hotel Little old and tatty and no extras in the room like tea coffee etc , Location is great and the decor is classic Parisian Staff are friendly and helpful 
220917,Amarante Beau Manoir, Very small room Quite dark and bathroom was very dated , Fantastic location small dark room but we ll heated Large lovely fluffy white towels Very comfy bed and linen 
220918,Amarante Beau Manoir, The toilet is so small that i could not close the door when sitting totally claustrophobic The bath tub was dirty i could not use the shower tube it was only for decorating purposes the whole shower appliance was dirty and full of calc i did not use the bathtub as i would have liked it also clogged when taking a shower the room is very small for a 4 star hotel it looks darker because of the blue walls furniture and doors are from heavy wood hard to use or push it is an old building which has been refurbished quite disappointed of a 4 star hotel , The room was well isolated it was warm and quiet the curtains made it very dark we slept very good although the bed was rather small the price quality report is good although very far from a 4 star hotel but the staff is friendly 10 min walk to the nearest metro station Madeleine
220919,Amarante Beau Manoir, Hotel is a little tattered Needs some interiors TLC updating Could be wonderful Breakfast over priced so never taken at the Hotel , Location was great Some of the desk staff were lovely Bellmen were very helpful Room sizes seemed good for Parisian Hotel 
220920,Amarante Beau Manoir, 2 single beds stuck together does not make a double The breakfast was a expensive as far as hotels go Room was very warm with no air conditioning Shower took a a lot of pulling Stained carpet on the wall No view from the window Really expensive considering the quality , Location nice but expensive breakfast Friendly staff 
220921,Amarante Beau Manoir, Not quite enough lighting in the room itself but this seems to be the trend in hotels these days , Good location at a reasonable price in the middle of the Madeleine district in Paris Whilst a bit tired in some of its furnishings the hotel was very comfortable and the staff were very helpful Breakfast was fine even though we were a bit late for it the staff were very obliging 
220922,Amarante Beau Manoir, Room was not like as displayed in the photos Not compliant with the money paid for it, I will give 10 out of 10 rank for Location Staff behavior and Hospitality Hotel staff are very cooperative and polite Thanks to all receptionists and Mr Azad

220925,Amarante Beau Manoir, I thought it was a queen bed but turn out to be a double bed The room can get stuffy as no air conditioning when we were there , The receptionist and concierge staff were very helpful and can speak English very well The bed was very comfortable 
220926,Amarante Beau Manoir, Rating could be higher if they have provided our requested baby cot They didn t even tell us before or during our stay that they have none to offer We needed to keep asking the receptionists for it and they didn t keep us updated on its availability My 9mo baby daughter kept on waking up in the nights 3 5 times because of co sleeping in our bed , Nearly Good room facilities hygiene Quaint and nicely decorated lobby rooms Fabulous cellar breakfast room great varieties of food Shame they don t do proper baguettes croissants pain au chocolates
220927,Amarante Beau Manoir, The over all look of the hotel There are a lots of technical issues AC not working leak from ceiling cleaness of the bathroom paint of roofs , The location close to madeleine and champs elys es The will from the team to please us and find solutions to our needs Waitresses at the breakfast are very kind and nice to their clients
220928,Amarante Beau Manoir, The wifi which was a specific point for us in the search of a hotel was challenging We had to get two different routers from the helpful staff at the reception but it still played up but since we were only there for three nights we decided to wait till we got back home for uninterrupted internet connection , The friendly and helpful staff and the space The croissants are also a thing to highly recommend 
220929,Amarante Beau Manoir, Wi Fi not very good without router box on second day and still a bit hit and miss Bathroom a bit tired , Air con thankfully working beautifully in 37 degrees heat outside Great location and friendly helpful staff Nice breakfast

220936,Amarante Beau Manoir, my room was a superior double room 23m with a twin bed and a sofa bed that wasnt v comfortable It was a bit tight for a family of 2 adults a child and a baby paid about 140euro per night which was a very high price for the hotel level but the booking was of free cancellation so was a little higher than normal hotel is said to be 4 stars but feels like a 3 star hotel actually wifi available but v slow in streaming was ok for browsing shower had no upper hanger u have to hold the shower head while showering the hotel elevator is very small to adults and a child would fit but hardly hotel breakfast for 20euros per person which is a bit expensive , Location was nice 5mins from Madeline metro station and the neighborhood is full of many restaurants caf s shops room serviced every day hotel staff were v helpful and available 24 7 a safe is available in the room Lcd tv was available in the room 
220937,Amarante Beau Manoir, The day shift staffs None greet us whenever we pass the reception although we said bonjour When we asked for help they so reluctant and when they speak they don t make eye contact Worse service I ever experienced in Paris, The location And the mid night shift staff They are very helpful 
220938,Amarante Beau Manoir, We were accommodated in a room where the bathroom door was aged and with difficulties to shut My son got locked in and I had to called the concierge to open it He came up and saw for himself that the door was stucked So he decided to use his force to open the door which he did breaking the lock and bits of wood The concierge told us that he was going to notified the problem in order to clarify that we did not brake the door The next day we were change to another room because the hairdryer did not work Two different concierges in different moments brought us to our attention the door which we had from scrach explain twice what happen with it that one of the concierge broke it because it was stuck The also blamed us that the telephone cord was cut which was impossible to have done it because we use the telephone and we received the call from the concierge informing us that they were moving us to another room ,No Positive

220941,Amarante Beau Manoir, 50 of the staff were rude in particular Marie Claire Photos are misleading booked a suite but was essentially a simple room with no additional space King Bed was two single mattresses pushed together so uncomfortable Photos also make the hotel look extremely well kept whereas in reality there is a lot of wear and tear , 50 of the staff were fantastic and lovely Location was great 
220942,Amarante Beau Manoir, Overpriced Not enough space in the room for 2 adults plus 10 year old Child though a lot of unnecessary furniture in the room An absence of a curtain water protective door in the bathroom is very inconvinient, Location is definitely a huge advantage of the hotel Very stylish interior of the lobby Feeling of a classical hotel with good reputation

220952,Amarante Beau Manoir, We didn t have much luck as my parents did who s stay was perfect During our week towels changed every 4 days when they were clearly dirty Dirty bathroom floor and bathtub even after the cleaning person would come I had to ask three times for toilet paper since the ones they d leave would last a day were dirty or would forget Water would sometimes go away while showering or become really cold They don t know how to properly dry clean my husband s shirt , The staff was really nice The bed was very comfortable and fluffy We had a huge variety of channels on TV Nice decorations Close to stores metro very central great location 
220953,Amarante Beau Manoir, This is not even a one star hotel I do not know how the hotel has got 4 stars The hotel corridors and doors are so ugly In addition receptionists are not kind at all and not even a little smile when you visit them On the whole it s a terrible hotel that I have ever seen ,No Positive
220954,Amarante Beau Manoir, Wifi was free but with some problems of operation for maintenance work Also access to the Internet through the terminal at the reception was difficult I hope that resolved as soon as possible , Romantic hotel very close to main attractions
220955,Amarante Beau Manoir, It s a very old hotel and the first room that they gave me was very bad located and then they changed the room upon request it was an average room as it was on the ground floor the internet was not working in the room so I had to go to the lobby to answer my mails late at night it wasn t easy and too many noise on the ground floor, The hotel was clean the staff was nice

220960,Amarante Beau Manoir, The hotel does not provide Wifi even if they say they do Beside myself i have at least heard another 3 guests complaining about it They have networks u can barely detect on your phone let alone connect to They should not be promoting their Wifi as part of the services available because it is useless , The location is defintely the best part of our stay The staff was very friendly as well 
220961,Amarante Beau Manoir, The air conditioner was not working and the Wi Fi was also not functioning properly While we were given larger rooms on a lower floor to address the heat it only made sleeping barely tolerable Breakfast food was also not very good Fortunately we only had to stay one night They also don t have showers although they are advertised , Nothing 
220962,Amarante Beau Manoir, I think booking com should have a way to investigate the self claimed standard of this kind of hotels who are claiming to be 3 4 or 5 star hotels As this hotel is being advertised as 4 star facility but I could not find a single star compatibility Rooms without WiFi and telephone very uncooperative staff poor and dirty old furniture ruined my holidays , Nothing to be liked at all
