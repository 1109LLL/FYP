319669,Novotel Amsterdam City, Location was not good I did a late check in at 18 00hrs and wanted a late check out between 13 00hrs 14 00hrs However I was informed that I will get charged 10euros extra per hour which is ridiculous Also the amenities in the hotel were not as expected , It was clean and the staff were very nice helpful and ready to help attitude 
319670,Novotel Amsterdam City, a bit far to walk the City Center but with good treain Connections to the Airport and to the City , Great Option in Amsterda Good Connections to the City Center by Train very new Hotel and confort bed 
319671,Novotel Amsterdam City, Overall service quality should be increased , It was my third time at Novotel Amsterdam City I have choose the same hotel again because the quality was higher before However my last visit was a complete disappointment I booked a regular room with bathtube however I had to change my room because the first room given did not have a bathtube They argued with me that my room was upgraded to executive type and that is the reason I thought that it was a joke because the room was not an executive room It was definitely the same type of room but without a bathtube Also I had to call house keeping to have bath robe and bath slippers We were 2 in the room my husband and I however one small bottle of water was left in the minibar and it was only for the first day This is not generous Also breakfast quality was lower than my last stay I am sure that I will not prefer Novotel Amsterdam City in my next visit to Amsterdam 
319672,Novotel Amsterdam City, A bit far from the center but can be reachable in 20 mins by tram and metro, Beautiful surrounding to this hotel and nearby tram station and metro station 
319673,Novotel Amsterdam City, The fact that when I booked was meant to have queen size bed and a sofa bed when got their was given room with 2 single beds even thow paid for queen size bed and sofa bed dissapointing raised issue with staff at hotel and was told like it or leave it,No Positive
319674,Novotel Amsterdam City, However Room Service was a bit slow and sometimes staff forgot things so we had to call reception again to request There was not a lot of channels to watch on T V which was a bit boring when you were in the room, The staff were very friendly and helpful Hotel is very clean and beds were comfortable Nice Caf to drink Tea Coffee 
319675,Novotel Amsterdam City, We booked 2 rooms with 3 single beds and were told that they were not available We were given rooms with a queen size bed and a sofa bed We had a hard time trying to get them changed As we booked the same type of room again on the 15 07 16 07 and were assured by Novotel hotel staff that we would get 3 single beds that did not happen when we checked in on 15 07 we had to go through the same hassles again Also when we checked out we were slapped with a hotel tax which we did not know about we thought that your price included all the taxes , The cleanliness and location of the hotel
319676,Novotel Amsterdam City, Wireless was not working due to a malfunction It was my second stay in this hotel and it was the 2nd time that wireless was not working what makes me believe that probably it is not just a coincidence ,No Positive
319677,Novotel Amsterdam City, In the vicinity ot the hotel there is nothing no shops bars restaurants at least we didn t find them The breakfast is very expensive It is far from the city centre , The location is near to the air port but far from the city centre although the connection to the city centre by tram is very good the station is a couple of minuts from the hotel The ATM is in the lobby of the hotel Room is nice and comfortable so is the bathroom 
319678,Novotel Amsterdam City, standard rooms were very tired Refurbed rooms cost more Frankly for the money you expect better rooms all round not just at a premium, good communal areas and facilities gym salon bar restaurants lounge area Refurbed rooms are good very attentive friendly helpful staff 
319679,Novotel Amsterdam City, Smokers were everywhere but particularly right outside the front entrance It was foul Night Bar staff and service was very slow The younger waiters seemed more interested in socialising within their shift colleagues than attending to clients There are no other restaurants nearby No balcony for fresh air in rooms , Wifi and business area was great Concierge very affable Breakfast staff were obliging Nice outdoor relaxation area The setting is more suburban business and away from big crowds However The location is excellent as the tram is only 100m away If you purchase the iamsterdam card you can get to the heart of Amsterdam and back so simply on tram 4 
319680,Novotel Amsterdam City, The problem was that they took half of the full amount out of my bank account when i specifically chosen to pay at the property To make matters worse now i have to wait a week to get the blocked money back Thats terrible Also on top of that we couldn t even get into unless we pay the full payment plus more money for deposit I have never seen that anywhere not even is hostels On top of that they never clean the room after 1 day By the time we came back and tired the room was not made so no way for them to do it when we wanted to rest Also very poor in complementary items and basic such as water They had 1 small bottle of water and we were 2 people as well as shower gel not generous at all Bad I give them a 4 out of 10 , The room
319681,Novotel Amsterdam City, The third bed in the triple room was very uncomfortable Although online it says there are three normal beds in the triple room it has actually only two normal beds and one spring bed which is more narrow and extremely soft Never book the triple room It s exactly the same as twin bed room with sofa bed , The staff are very helpful After we complained about our room they helped us change room They also helped us find our shoes left in the room Good location convenient to city center and airport 
319682,Novotel Amsterdam City, 1 A parcel was delivered but when I called at the reception a staff member could not find it so I came over to the reception and another person helped me 2 the fan in the room 352 is broken the nozzle is not connected tightly to the hose , Everything was good
319683,Novotel Amsterdam City, If you like Accor hotels you won t be wrong This hotel has this very special atmosphere only big Accor hotels have beside train stations and air ports these however are usually not that clean They make you feel like a number not a big one to be honest Perfect professionality even friendliness is well trained Just the bottles in front of my room s door didn t fit into this image of perfection The room is big enough Big enough to put several things into it starting from a mini bar an enormous flat screen TV and some more furniture I didn t know what to use it for A desk was missing but brought by staff there was still space between the table and the bed so I could more or less sit The shower was brand new the ceiling that low water did not cool down while falling on my hat as I touches the shower head which is just about 195 above the floor something even tall women have to keep in mind The breakfast room has a very special atmosphere as well It reminds me to 2nd class lounges on airports I enjoyed sitting on chairs without backrest my laptop on the table so I could play solitaire while eating my scrambled eggs The view was exceptional as well I had a great look at the backside of a Dell notebook owned by some dude in a grey business suite probably bought from H M It was a bit noisier than my ears liked but I am lucky I own noise cancelling head phones so not a big issue , Well I really liked to check out 
319684,Novotel Amsterdam City, The location, The bed was fine the bathroom was small The room felt really small especially for the amount we paid we should have got a better room with sofa bed that was promised and with breakfast
319685,Novotel Amsterdam City, Location it should say how far from the city we were thinking it is in the city miss read or miss understanding when i book, Abf is most valuable and good food
319686,Novotel Amsterdam City, The price was exorbitant in relation to the comfort offered There was a big convention going on in the RAI which was probably why they charged a 100 more than the room was worth , Personnel was very friendly and helpful 
319687,Novotel Amsterdam City, its too far from all the major attractions u either have to take a tram for 20 min or cab up and pay upto 30euro to get to anywhere, nice big clean rooms with all the frills 2 minutes walk to train n tram stations
319688,Novotel Amsterdam City, Bathroom a bit small The shower is open and the water would get to the whole floor easily and no bidet Breakfast time during weekdays till 10 a m while in weekend is until 11a m when we arrived we were warned about 11 a m time and on monday was a bit of a surprise and we literally had to run , Easy access from to airport and to the city centre Great breakfast Nice staff Good room size and confy bed Tea coffee in the room
319689,Novotel Amsterdam City, The free weights set in the gym was incomplete and the volume control on the TV before my treadmill was inoperative, The eco friendly reward scheme on room cleaning The very friendly and helpful staff The pleasant airy gym and my quiet comfy room 
319690,Novotel Amsterdam City, some of the staff personel are really not welcoming and more about mocking clients additional minibar taxes forced on us for no reason currently contacting the customer service on this matter Scandalous old musty room smells broken shower not fixed in 4 days even when asked three persons in room ONE small bottle of water ONE set of bathroom amenities broken elevator a bit annoying Feel free to contact me for details , nice bed nice location next to amsterdam RAI station airport in 9 minutes hotel bar a bit pricey but fine for relaxing nights
319691,Novotel Amsterdam City, Breakfast was quite expensive , The hotel is within 20 minutes of the Airport and 35 minutes of city centre Amsterdam The rooms were quite comfortable and the staff were very nice The bar staff were welcoming and made excellent cocktails 
319692,Novotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, The hotel is near by Station RAI All of the receptionist are so kind The lobby is big bright and clean The room size just fit for us We specially appreciated Amy that she helped me so much 
319693,Novotel Amsterdam City, TV was not working properly Had some glitch , We loved the location of the hotel Easy to commute and the neighbourhood was lovely Staff was very helpful and pleasant Made us feel very comfortable enjoyed our stay 
319694,Novotel Amsterdam City, Be aware that the ATM inside the hotel only accepts Credit Card not Debit Card Breakfast was really good with a lot of variety but i bit expensive in my own opinion 22 5 Be aware also that sometimes tax prices are not shown so expect at least 40 euro on top of your total bill Booked for 3 people we only found one bottle of water inside the mini bar , If you are travelling to Amsterdam the Novotel Hotel is a really good choice for price and location It is really close to the Railway Station Amsterdam RAI close to metro m51 orange line that goes to Amsterdam Central Nieuwmarkt or opposite way Westwijk The Metro 4 Amsterdam Central Dam and more is on the same line with a step away from the RAI train station Happy hour with cheap good cocktails are from 10 12 pm every Saturday Sunday in the hotel bar Place is big bright and room are spacious and very clean I stayed with two other friends in a double bed and sofa bed in the same room and with 1 bag each and lots of small souvenir bags there was still room left There are usb sockets to charge your Tech close to the bed so you dont even need adapters Bathroom is normal small sink few drawers but nice big shower with rain head Didn t eat there unfortunately but the menu looked really full of local and international meals Really recommended
319695,Novotel Amsterdam City, When we arrived there was a long and disorderly queue for check in This is very poor management Only two of the four check in desks were staffed more staff should have been brought in to deal with the queue It is actually quite disrespectful to hotel guests who are paying for service I don t blame the staff who were on duty who were doing their best This marred an otherwise enjoyable stay , Nice room and bathrooms good reception area very friendly staff Very convenient for the RAI station for the metro into the city centre 
319696,Novotel Amsterdam City, The checking in staff took our card payment twice and said it was void when I tried to withdrawn money I couldn t it nearly ruined our holiday as only there 1 day taking all our money luckily mangament were amazing and handled the situation really well rest of staff were poor they look st you when they can see you waiting and walk away don t help, The tram is close to hotel and cheap and take you everywhere
319697,Novotel Amsterdam City, The price is far too high and quality of food in restaurant below any standard They play eco but provide plastic cups instead off real classes and cups, Friendlyness of staff
319698,Novotel Amsterdam City, Very large hotel too many people and too few staff People pushed in front of me in queue on check in very rude big queues for check in and check out as only two people serving was served pizza that was frozen in the middle in restaurant luckily I was on the 3rd floor as lift wait time far too long so used the stairs breakfast chaotic large queues for orange and coffee Probably a great hotel when it is quiet but felt sorry for the staff who I must say were all doing their best ,No Positive
319699,Novotel Amsterdam City, ordered cheescake at night and it was HORRIBLE do not get it, Hotel was nice however not worth 532euros you could get something in the city for the same price if not cheaper although this was not too far from the city about 15 20 minute by tram and Amsterdam Rai is just opposite 5euros for 2 people not bad taxis are very expensive so try avoid that
319700,Novotel Amsterdam City, There were a couple of things missing which i expect from a 4 star hotel There was no tooth brush and no tooth paste You have to ask at the reception For the saune there were no slippers and no bathrobe If you like to go to the saune you need to go to the reception first to get the key encoded Otherwise you stand in front of closed doors That was very annoying A minibar was missing was well The room service at night is useless and the menue in the room just a fake menue So all in all it was a pleasant stay but the 4 star rating is just too high , The Hotel was of modern interieuer and easy to rech from the airport There is a very good connection from the hotel to the city by tram with direct connection to centraal The breakfast was really great and and is highly recommended 
319701,Novotel Amsterdam City, As soon as we got there they asked us for another 70 as an extra deposit and we was told we d get it all back at the end of our stay When we come to check out we was told that we were only aloud 36 back because they take off city tax and some other stuff which we weren t told about I was very angry about this it wasn t written in the small print and made our trip a lot worse because we was 70 down before we even started our trip which made us short of money for our time there and couldn t do all the things we wanted to because of being short of cash , It s was easy to get to from the airport and to the main part of Amsterdam but I was angry with what came while we arrived 
319702,Novotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, The bed was very comfortable and the city was an easy 20 minute tram ride away This hotel represented excellent value as more central Amsterdam hotels are very expensive 
319703,Novotel Amsterdam City, I paid for 3 adult in one room but one of us have to canselled because of sickness and I had made a phone call to the hotel oneday before our arrival Amsterdam to inform that but can t get through to the hotel line When we arrived at the hotel I told the receptionist what was happent asked if they can do something to upgrade maybe with free breakfast since I paid for 3 adult person Small room if its for 3 person The city tax The restaurant serve me cold tomatos soup ,No Positive
319704,Novotel Amsterdam City, Nothing , The room was great and comfortable with a nice view Staff were very friendly and the location was really good considering the price compared to city centre hotels Train and trams to the city centre are just a 5 minute walk away 
319705,Novotel Amsterdam City, The service was awful I asked for coffee creamer and was NOT delivered for over 12 hours Finally I had to speak with manager to get it delivered The person at check out desk for the member was clearly discriminatory to Indians and was very rude There was couple who was not a member was asked from another line to check out and I who had a right to be there as a member was asked extremely rudely to to step back The are paper cups for coffee One bottle of 500 ml free for two people during the whole stay and not for a day Shocking This height of money saving Have never experienced in any other international chain otel, The room was modern and excellent
319706,Novotel Amsterdam City, Staff could do with extra training on the check in process They tried charging both parties 100 euros more and even confused us of our deposit back We asked for the manager and after 10 minutes we got an apology They even charged us for drinks that we didn t even have but I couldn t be bothered to try and argue that point We had a meal in the restaurant an hour and a half it took for a burnt and cold pizza to arrive sent it back Had to wait another half hour and then they tried charging us for the burnt pizza No apology what so ever from staff either Can t pull a good pint either ,No Positive
319707,Novotel Amsterdam City, The staff were extremely rude on a couple of occasions which really put a downer on the whole trip for me and my friends The constant battle for them to try and get extra money off of us as a group eventually got us to boiling point ,No Positive
319708,Novotel Amsterdam City, The check in process was very slow with no greeting or apology prior to check in at desk There was a sock on the bedroom floor upon arrival It was there after four nights Eating in restaurant seated and waited a long time for the food order to be taken Had to make a request a spoon for the tagliatelle Had to make a request for a knife for the steak , Good range of food at breakfast Good range of drinks at the bar Room decor fittings in a good condition Excellent car park facilities The staff apologised for the very poor service at dinner Mr Anduel Ormskerk was very welcoming 
319709,Novotel Amsterdam City, The room was very very basic the bed was big but very hard there was no bath having paid so much for a few nights room was very cramped staff were not that helpful in telling me about transport etc they just expected us to just get taxis , It was ok just very expensive for quite a basic room which was meant to be a superior room location wasn t ideal but public transport was close and handy to use the room was clean and nice and fresh 
319710,Novotel Amsterdam City, Rooms a bit small Promised an upgrade and then taken away Cannot really complain as we were returned to our original room but because of the upgrade expectation felt like we had actually lost out , Proximity to RAI
319711,Novotel Amsterdam City, Be careful when booking this hotel When we arrived for check in we was told we needed to pay and extra 70 in case we damaged the room This does not state this on your booking once made After explaining this to the gentleman who works at reception he said it was compulsary But yet it didnt not have any inofrmation of this on our booking Not impressed at all the way the man handled the situation and asked to speak to a manager who sorted it straight away Also because we did not pay the 70 we was told we couldnt use any of facilites Bare this in midn when booking , Perfect location very clean hotel the bar resturant was amazing Open untill late and very very good food 
319712,Novotel Amsterdam City, Its a little far from central areas so for a tourist it would be much better to stay in central area However tramway was easy to use to go to central areas it took around 30 minutes to reach there and it stops working at midnight, clean modern spacious rooms
319713,Novotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Comfortable beds great views from the room fantastic cocktails in the bar try the Funky Monkey Staff were pleasant and helpful The hotel is located in easy walking distance to Station RAI where you can get the tram into the centre and trains to from the airport 
319714,Novotel Amsterdam City, Bathroom apparently without heating system As well after the first night there and 70 euro already paid we got two letters notifying us that our deposit was not enough to guarantee for our room We had then to wait 30 minutes at 1 00am in reception forcing us to pay the full fee before checking out A very impolite and not elegant behavior for a supposed to be 4 stars hotel ,No Positive
319715,Novotel Amsterdam City, They only put decaffeinated coffee sachets in the room and also only shampoo as if shower gel is not used that often , The staff were more than helpful and friendly room is big bed is really comfy and all the amenities are available right next to RAI Station infront there is also a tram station the restaurant has really good food
319716,Novotel Amsterdam City, Everything fine no complaints Only they charged different amounts on my credit card as stated on the invoice which were in total the same but pretty confusing , Very good stay Location is perfect if close Hotel to the RAI Amsterdam is needed 10 mns footwalk Driving to downtown by Taxi around 10 mns as well 
319717,Novotel Amsterdam City, The room windows need some serious cleaning didn t need any shades at night Shower wasn t leveled properly so after the shower the floor was soaking wet , Remodelled room BIG TV Good bed Excellent restaurant 
319718,Novotel Amsterdam City, TV in a room had hard time working but this is not very important so doesn t really matter that much The bathroom could be a bit bigger more space to put cosmetics , The breakfast was delicious especially omelettes done by the cook on demand freshly squeezed orange juice The room was specious and comfortable 
319719,Novotel Amsterdam City, Our mini bar only had two bottles of water and nothing else Even though we didnt plan to use the mini bar it was a bit strange that it was almost empty, Location was most important factor for me
319720,Novotel Amsterdam City, A bit pricey Sofa bed very uncomfortable for a child At the price we pay we should have real glasses in the room not disposable plastic I took a while for the check out with only two staff processing people leaving in the morning In addition more than a day later I still did not receive my copy of invoice through email and the hotel overcharged me by more than 67 euro once I check my credit card statement Not what you would expect from a 4 star hotel , Excellent breakfast very good location 
319721,Novotel Amsterdam City, The bar restaurant were quite expensive but with the caliber of the hotel it s expected , The staff were super friendly and helpful The hotel was beautiful and in a great location with a Tram stop pretty much outside the door bringing you straight into the city 
319722,Novotel Amsterdam City, The Novotel was situated outside of the city centre A tram was a few minutes walk from the Novotel so access to city centre was available It was about a 20 minute ride Perhaps it would have helped with the cost if we could have bought a 3 day permit rather than an hourly ticket each way daily , Staff very friendly Breakfast excellent Evening meal in restaurant excellent
319723,Novotel Amsterdam City, The TV looked great but it kept freezing and you couldn t change the channels or turn it off Some channels weren t always available which was annoying ,No Positive
319724,Novotel Amsterdam City, Even on the 15th floor there was road noise not debilitating Neighbors slamming doors in the middle of the night When will hotels install doors that don t slam , Comfortable bed excellent breakfast Staff very friendly and responsive to special requests Spacious room 
319725,Novotel Amsterdam City, Staff very unprofessional and on one occasion very hostile due to a misunderstanding , Breakfast was okay but very pricey as well as 7 euro tax charge added per person 
319726,Novotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, The beds were comfortable and staff was very polite We got a free taxi ride from the Centraal station to the hotel which saved us a lot of time We came a bit too early to the hotel but we could leave our luggage to the hotel and go shopping before we got our keys 
319727,Novotel Amsterdam City, I had the sofa bed and it was really uncomfortable The pillows were soft but I couldn t use them as I m allergic to feathers Not really the hotels fault but would ve appreciated an alternative My friends said their bed was ok though Everything else was excellent , It was close to transport links The staff were friendly welcoming and helpful Good facilities within the hotel Free wifi 
319728,Novotel Amsterdam City, I paid and asked for a room with a double bed and sofa bed and I get two single beds I wasn t impressed I also waited 4 hours to be checked in and still didtn get the room I paid for,No Positive
319729,Novotel Amsterdam City, Better ventilation system required in the bathroom , I like NOVOTEL brand Comfortable bed as usual Very professional restaurant staff in this hotel Modern very clean good located From airport only 3 stations train 
319730,Novotel Amsterdam City, Roomservice you forgot what I ordered and never came with it And you also didn t know what you had to offer One minute I was ordering pizza the next you didn t have any And an hour later I still got my pizza Make it straight And you need to fix your Cards that opens the door Stopped working a lot And maybe if you guys are offering shampoos then maybe you should think about conditioner as well Maybe even some body lotion It s supposed to be like that at good hotels Some of your taxi drivers are also crazy , Bed was comfy room was nice Lobby was pretty Even staff was nice
319731,Novotel Amsterdam City, The hotel was a lot further away from the centre than we were expecting about 25 35 minutes via tram however the tram stop was almost right at the door so it was very easy to get in and out of the city Would recommend buying a travel pass to get on the bus tram train as it saves you a lot of money , It was our first time to Amsterdam and the staff were really friendly and helpful in guiding us in the right directions and we also relieved a few little gifts with it being near Christmas and New Year As we were there for New Years Eve we had plenty of information to know what was happening and also the best way to return to the hotel Saying the bed was comfy was an understatement it was a dream and the overall hotel experience was top quality 
319732,Novotel Amsterdam City, It seems people are checking in at all hours so it was hard to get someone to speak to for little things like change or ask questions about travel around the city I ended up asking a bartender who helped me out , Location was nice Very close to the tram and trains Staff was helpful and excellent Order a veggie pizza which was superb Really nice place and would stay there again 
319733,Novotel Amsterdam City, Breakfast prices were too expensive , Nice location 3 min walk away from metro and tram 4 station Clean hotel very comfortable room spacious wc and friendly staff 
319734,Novotel Amsterdam City, Far from the city center not a good hotel if you want to go site seeing It takes 40 minutes in the tram to get to the city center , Good hotel with good breakfast Close to the business district 
319735,Novotel Amsterdam City, We ordered room service each night it got worse each time ordered 3 times food on the third night was cold , Great hotel in a fantastic location minutes walk from a tram train stop 
319736,Novotel Amsterdam City, staff in restaurant too busy chatting with each other to take order then served others before us meal arrived but not as requested, first nite in restaurant very good but second wasnt
319737,Novotel Amsterdam City, Evening meals were absolutely dreadful I ate here some years ago and vowed NEVER AGAIN but because I was tired on arrival I decided to give it another try BIG MISTAKE Expensive and disgusting food, Breakfast great as always 
319738,Novotel Amsterdam City, Nothing it was excellent , We always stay here when we come to Amsterdam It s a great hotel with great food well stocked bar clean comfortable rooms friendly helpful staff 
319739,Novotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, The rooms are spotless and the reception and bar staff are really helpful and friendly The location is perfect the tram is outside RAI station 20 minutes to central station 
319740,Novotel Amsterdam City, Room was small I have booked 3 single beds but when came to the room it was 2 single beds and fold up bed I have paid more for the room to have 3single beds specially but it was disappointing to see stay in the room for 200euros Also room was not clean carpet was sooo dirty walls had marks on them Room looked very tired and we had to pay extra for breakfast , Breakfast and staff was nice
319741,Novotel Amsterdam City, The in room TV was rubbish Not a problem if you intend to roam around Amsterdam which on this trip I did not , A decent sized and comfortable room Walking distance from Amsterdam Rai Easy access to the No 4 tram to Central Station and the city center All the restaurants that I wanted eat in were fully booked so I tried the hotel and I was pleasantly surprised 
319742,Novotel Amsterdam City, Overpriced both room breakfast Strange smell in the room Door separating one room from the other I woke up hearing the neighbour zipping his luggage Lost plastic bag under the bed all through my two nights stay vacuum cleaner does not reach that far , Nice staff good breakfast
319743,Novotel Amsterdam City, Poor food quality seems the hotel policy is only to try to charge as much cost as possible to clients doesn t much care about the clients, Near to Rai Exhibition Center
319744,Novotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, by far the best in Amsterdam Excellent access to the tram and city centre Perfect reception very polite and helpful Amazing breakfast would highly recommend just to start the day of right 
319745,Novotel Amsterdam City, The double bed was kind of small 1 50m wide I think so for two large people it was a tiny too small The closet is not very big either so if you re staying more than 5 days you may not have enough space you hang two large winter jackets and it s already full , The hotel offers any service you may need The rooms are comfortable and big enough with facilities like a kettle or a wireless speaker to play your own music It s very close to metro tram and train services so very convenient if you re going to the city center 
319746,Novotel Amsterdam City, The service we received from the staff throughout our whole stay was appalling and has put me off going to a Novotel again The location wasn t great for us either as it was a bit far from the city centre , Rooms were comfortable and had a great nights sleep in the bed 
319747,Novotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, The staff is amazingly kind The boy at the reception did deliver a perfect service I felt myself like at home Very good house mates Quiet room Good bathtub 
319748,Novotel Amsterdam City, I didn t realise when I had booked it that it was for business conferences We were visiting Amsterdam for the weekend with a group of girls but that was my fault not the websites , Rooms were great
319749,Novotel Amsterdam City, stains on carpets hard to arrange early check in without extra payment for upgraded room not much flexibility because of the booking com booking, Great Breakfast buffet courteous staff
319750,Novotel Amsterdam City, It should be MOST definitely be informed before or after booking that there will be a 70 deposit on arrival as this cut me and my partner short and we couldn t do the full activities that we listed to do because of this very inconvenient and frasutrating , The bar staff were extra helpful and very welcoming enjoyed speaking to them and enjoyed our time at the bar 
319751,Novotel Amsterdam City, The room was very small booked a superior room however this was just an average room The shower made a extremely loud noise every time it was turned on The hairdresser was not your average hairdresser and seemed to look more like a steamer for clothes than a hairdresser so was very hard to know what it was , The staff were very friendly and helpful The facilities were very good also 
319752,Novotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Breakfast and drinks at the hotel was very expensive I think 22 50 per person per day for breakfast is a bit much Ideally located tram directly across the road from hotel
319753,Novotel Amsterdam City, Staff charged extra 12 00 for city tax at check out We had to show the email of our booking that said city tax included and then staff was convinced, Very near to RAI station trams and buses
319754,Novotel Amsterdam City, Breakfast was chaos Both mornings we could not find seats and had to wait in line for coffee up to 20 mins Food was average They can improve it by allocated seating rather than letting people seat wherever they want Location was about 25mins by tram away from the hub of the city, Great staff in the bar Bed was comfortable and rooms were clean
319755,Novotel Amsterdam City, Price was very high Exchange rate wasn t on the site when booking Also did not realise a deposit had to be left on arrival, Very overpriced for the location 
319756,Novotel Amsterdam City, They debited my credit card account three times Very non compinent and non professional approach The room cleaning was below medium level And the lobby always smells of fish in the evenings ,No Positive
319757,Novotel Amsterdam City, Rooms were dirty and the security was poor as their external contracted cleaning personnel is number one suspect for stealing our money we had in our luggage within our room ,No Positive
319758,Novotel Amsterdam City, The room was small for three people Staff were not helpful Socket cables and plugs where not supportive to all devices In the breakfast bacon was very salt and it happened everyday Room service staff was paid and did during check oit we were asked the same bill meaning he did not pay The capert on the floor is smely, It is near to Train metro station The location and surrounding environment was really good 
319759,Novotel Amsterdam City, Is to ask me to pay 70 euro on my arrival as axtra payment This information wasn t provided to me when I was booking It looked like you have hidden prices Because I was informed it was going to be refunded however 10 euros was taken away from me , The hotel had good breakfast
319760,Novotel Amsterdam City, The 3single bed setup was not the same as in the picture that showed 3 beds of same height In our case the 3rd bed was much lower than the other 2 Not a big deal but still it is not fair , Breakfast buffet pricey but I was glad about the freshly squeezed orange juice Machine and cook to order omelettes Also just 5min walk to tram that takes us all the way Central station in 20min 
319761,Novotel Amsterdam City, Just too far from the city centre however access to the city by public transport was excellent Too expensive for its location 23 euro in a cab from town , Breakfast was excellent Staff were very nice and really helpful 
319762,Novotel Amsterdam City, Tiles in the bathroom need a good scrub to remove the stains otherwise overall clean , Excellent breakfast buffet Staff are nice and helpful Very good location to go around plus 17 minutes only to the airport via Metro 
319763,Novotel Amsterdam City, Nearly missed my flight because I had to query mistakes on my bill i had to take a taxi Instead of a train which cost me more Night staff not particularly helpful especially older staff seem to be secure in their job maybe time for retirement for some Wrongly charged deposit on my debit card which also contributed to my nearly missing flight my 5 year old daughter is autistic and was served absolutely scalding hot pasta that came from children s menu we didn t complain as the waiter was nice but she got a nasty mouth burn and refused to eat it I blame the chef in this instance , Not a lot
319764,Novotel Amsterdam City, The carpet in the rooms are very old with dirty marks on We were told that the renovation work has started , Very freindly and helpful staff Tasty fresh and various choice in breakfast Near by transport to city center 
319765,Novotel Amsterdam City, Reception service and furnatures, 1 No service to take the languages to room after the check in 2 Big hotel with few people in the reception to assist customers 2 furnitures were very old and room very small compared to Novotel den haage suites This hotel shall be rated 3 stars and not 4 stars and shall be removed from Novotel hotels network 3 the tap for the bath room shower was missing and was very difficult to use the shower 4 I booked and paid for two a triple bed rooms but the 3rd bed in both rooms was not prepared We found the sofa and then we asked housekeeping to provide the bed sheets and blankets in order ourselves will make the bed 5 reception and housekeeping took so much of times and frequent calls to remind them to bring the bed sheets and the blankets to prepare the sofa bed 5 hotel doesn t serve daily free water bottles as minimum 
319766,Novotel Amsterdam City, The staff here were really rude and not helpful We had a few issues and they did not apologise or even check everything was ok after I would never stay here again and would not recommend this hotel ,No Positive
319767,Novotel Amsterdam City, In a 200euro room I dont expect stains in the carpet My room needed a new carpet for sure this needs to be updated, Perfect location as for starting point to visit amsterdam Tram Metro 400 meter walk Super breakfast Friendly staff Nice bar Fast wifi Privat Parking 
319768,Novotel Amsterdam City, For the price we paid and for a 4 stars hotel I wouldn t expected a provisional charge of 70 refund at the departure for the mini bar composed of just 2 bottles of water sparkling and mineral 3 25 each Plastic cups and some small bags of tea and instant coffee just 1 bag of sugar but plenty of milk Shower water pressure kind of low took about half an hour to fill in the bath tub Room kind of noisy late in the night and early in the morning heard everything happening on the hall no way to sleep more I wouldn t rate this Novotel as 4 stars the price is proportional with the reputation nothing more For a weekend or 2 3 nights the hotel is just OK good to have a clean room and cozy bed after spending the whole day walking in town , During the weekend free parking around the hotel calm neighbourhood Very nice staff and very helpful Confortable room very clean and very soft bed About 2 minutes walking to the closest tram station leading to downtown 2 90 ticket 1h valid though Good location 
319769,Novotel Amsterdam City, We checked in at 4 pm but the room was not ready So we left our luggage and went out came back around 10 30 pm the room was still NOT ready we ve asked the reception which had a multitude of people to deal with with only one or two staff about it and asked for another room as we were really tired and didn t want to wait No no other triple I guess room s available so we had to wait Given the circumstances they could ve given us 2 double rooms if no triple room availab le We wanted to buy some water from a vending machine No the only water available for purchase that time of the evening was from a little fridge at the reception for 3 50 euros for a small bottle which was the same as the ones at the room fridge A vending machine was available for chips nuts etc but not for water , Nothing
319770,Novotel Amsterdam City, Lifts were a nightmare to wait for and sometimes would not stop on the correct floor despite passing by that floor Luckily out room was on level 3 and most times we ended up taking the stairs , The staff were all particularly helpful well mannered and always greeted us with a smile 
319771,Novotel Amsterdam City, The hotel is too big There are not enough elevators at busy times and although the breakfast room is large there are too many people trying to use the buffet Long queues to check in and out for no apparent reason , Well located at the end of tram line 4 for easy travel into the city centre Plenty of parking on site but not free Friendly and helpful bar staff
319772,Novotel Amsterdam City, The bed is only queen size and the baby cot does not come with a proper quilt just a bath towel , Location is good the room is nice and comfy Breakfast is not included but it s worth paying for Front desk is always busy the staff are nice 
319773,Novotel Amsterdam City, They don t live up to their commitments I was being mentioned that I will get a complimentary mini bar in my room but when I checked in they told me I will get it only if I upgrade my room for more money which is very unprofessional for an international hotel like Novotel to do , it was well located within the city quite approachable from the attractions and spots that we covered 
319774,Novotel Amsterdam City, room is small location is far from center breakfast is expensive, iron coffe maker hair dryer kettel are all available
319775,Novotel Amsterdam City, I applied for the early check in to be told I couldn t get it The staff were very cheeky towards me after having to argue and prove I got accepted got the early check in as I had an event at 2 so I couldn t check in at 2 had to get ready in the tolite It was a disgrace of a hotel won t be back , Not much Was not what I was expecting rooms were very old dated needed done up 
319776,Novotel Amsterdam City, Pricey , Location which is in the quite side of the city yet connected to it because the train station is next to you RAI station as well as the tram which is next to it staff breakfast location again 
319777,Novotel Amsterdam City, The breakfast was CAOS the lady on the front desk very rude We were surprised to se this CAOS as we stayed last year at Novotel Handburg and althogh it is also a very big hotel it is well organized Front desk breakfast etc Novotel Amsterdam had fissapointed us that much that we will never try a Novotel again ,No Positive
319778,Novotel Amsterdam City, Far from the center also the train that took us from near the hotel to the center was so slow But it s so hard to drive by car in the center, Their was nothing at night you can do near the hotel very dark out side no life But you will have gd sleep no noice i give it 10 of 10
319779,Novotel Amsterdam City, Too busy breakfast room Staff are too busy to listen carefully Small deluxe room Location far from city centre Quite a bit of walk to the nearest metro or tram , The concierge desk was very helpful

319783,Novotel Amsterdam City, We booked superior triple room online but they gave us superior double room and there was a price difference in between them there were no slippers and tooth paste in the room , it was clean staff was friendly computers downstairs are good and useful
319784,Novotel Amsterdam City, The tax charge which I was charged and the reception did not explain on advance that there were charges, The rooms were excellent and the staff were very helpful will visit again
319785,Novotel Amsterdam City, The breakfast was good but the person in charge for checking the guest like a police checking the ID s , The reception staff were friendly and helpful
319786,Novotel Amsterdam City, we arrived early but couls not get a room till 2 30 the load in the reception is too much they need better management with the high demand on the hotel, best breakfast ever clean quite one of my favourite hotel in Amsterdam
319787,Novotel Amsterdam City, Nothing, The hotel is far closer than the hotel states I would say 5 min walk not 10 We go there at 10ish to early to check in but was offered an upgrade that was reasonable and I could go in to rest straight away The bar staff were really friendly and recognised us every night we went in 
319788,Novotel Amsterdam City, Breakfast was 22 Euros so we bought breakfast from a local supermarket, Location was excellent for our needs Short walk from Amsterdam Rai train station and at the start of the Number 4 tram line which never had to wait long for

319790,Novotel Amsterdam City, Communication poor didn t get told breakfast times had to ring down to find out and dint tell us when to check out had to ring down again This info is normally told as you check in Because we didn t get told breakfast times differ at the weekend we missed breakfast on the Monday really let down the whole stay , Good breakfast room service is quick
319791,Novotel Amsterdam City, Everything , This hotel was horrendous Said it was 8 min drive to city centre absolute rubbish 22 euros everytime from the hotels taxis into city centre was over 20 min drive water bottles in the room fridge had been open and drank from Air con didn t work so we where given a fan for the room that sounded like a tractor Tv didnt work called reception 4 times in our 4 day stay to sort the tv and not one member of staff appeared absolute joke Food at the bar what a terrible service if theres more than 4 people at the bar they say its busy hence the 20 min wait for a drink and the 40 min wait for chips I would advise people NEVER to book this hotel ever allround terrible place and staff who walk about brain dead 
319792,Novotel Amsterdam City, We found some kids bracelet under the bed so i guess they dont clean to well atleast under the bed The staff in the reception were terrible one receptionist was checking in guests for over 20 minutes the other was on the phone the entire time the third was standing in the members vip checking and doing nothing so since we arent vip we waited over 20 mins to check in and once the we got to the 2nd receptionist he picked up the phond and carried on making calls arrangements while cheking us in dint seem to care to speak to us I guess if you are a member of novotel then its good but for us non members it seems like we arent wanted there , Modern fresh and roomy nice sized rooms quiet rooms good ac 
319793,Novotel Amsterdam City, Abrupt reception staff member when I was checking out Did his best to ignore me However all other staff members I encountered were pleasant and helpful , Clean and comfortable rooms 
319794,Novotel Amsterdam City, Hotel security needs to be improved The bag was stolen during breakfast time inside the hotel restaurant Hotel staff has helped us to search information from the video recording but no hotel representative was accompanied us to the police station maybe because we can speak English , Good location with tram train metro station in 5 mins walk Room was clean Buffet breakfast has different food variety but costly 
319795,Novotel Amsterdam City, Staffs were rude the triple bed room was too small changing of beds sheet not done first time came to know if you want your luggages to be taken to your room you have to pay one day the shift manager came in front of all staffs and guests and she said we have to talk shower inside the bathtub really surprised to know for the first time that shower must be taking inside bathtub so I thank her for the valuable information staffs sometimes will come inside the room without allowing them just one nock at the door then you will find them in front of you When checking they told me to pay for 4 days breakfasts while my reservation was without breakfast Finally am I going to book in this hotel again the answer will be NO , Really nothing except it was near the tram 
319796,Novotel Amsterdam City, N a, Lovely hotel and only 10 mins away from everything it s in a quiet location perfect for the metro trains or buses and has really comfy beds
319797,Novotel Amsterdam City, Parking charges at 22Euro which were not mentioned on the website of booking com the hotel agreed to pay for it Rooms are so small I booked a triple room which was hardly a room Paid 257 Euro for the night including breakfast This is a business hotel and has bus loads of people staying here the breakfast area is a like an arena Delayed checkout costed more They refused to accept loyalty cards of Accor saying all bookings on booking com dont qualify which was new to me All other hotels alway accept that The room hardly had any walking space The toilets could do with a makeover This place is 25minutes away from the the main city and you need to walk 10 min to get to the train station add another 7 5Euro per person for a day ticket to travel to the room charges At this price you are better off anyhere else, Breakfast was good

319813,Novotel Amsterdam City, There was a cockroach in the room which I had to kill I didn t have enough time to inform the hotel I was surprised as this is a 4 star hotel The tea cups in the room were plastic which is a bit of a shame The shower bathroom was standard The TV remote was difficult to use you have to go out of your way to point and change the channels Most of the staff were friendly however some seemed not interested at all , The bed pillows sofa were really comfortable memory foam There was a good view from the room Room was quiet spacious

319824,Novotel Amsterdam City, I was told I had to pay the hotel 70 as a deposit for any extras I wasn t aware of this before arriving so I refused to pay it I was told it was on booking com terms conditions If it was then it should have been on my confirmation It was embarrassing for me in front of my partner , Comfy bed and the Bluetooth speaker
319825,Novotel Amsterdam City, Room wasn t cleaned I moved bin in the bathroom and found there used condom its gross disgusting And duty manager just offer me breakfast I am so disappointed for the services shame , Good location speciouse room
319826,Novotel Amsterdam City, We came at a really busy time so we were waiting for quite a while to check in The trip from the tram to city centre was long enough When we got there we were asked to give a 70 deposit that I wasn t aware of but have and when leaving I was informed I had to pay a city tax and was only given back 55 which would stop me coming again as I already payed 298 for the room Too expensive , I liked that the property was so close to the train station and so close to the tram that gets you to the city centre The view from the room was amazing 
319827,Novotel Amsterdam City, Fridge did not work Coffee making facilities very basic Kept getting my name incorrect, Staff were friendly and helpful exceptionally so Rooms relatively big

319829,Novotel Amsterdam City, lots of stains on the carpet bathtub still had some ex guest hair in it towels were clean but smelled wierd on our last day a small little critter made its way in the sink roomservice is very limited at night, staff is fluent in english staff tries to help or aid any questions you have
319830,Novotel Amsterdam City, It was quite a way out of town but suited me as my partner s event was in the holiday Inn next door Breakfast was quite pricey so did not use There was was a constant like ticking noise which changed in speed and loudness most of the night may have been running water from other peoples bathrooms put my earplugs in so did not disturb me , Did not really use anything other than the room It was clean and tidy
319831,Novotel Amsterdam City, clean and comfey beds, It was close to the Rai so good for work Not so good location if you wanted to be based for the city center although the tram stop is close Typical clean soulless hotel though that you find near exhibition conference centers
319832,Novotel Amsterdam City, I would have liked to have seen the addition of a couple of wine glasses in the room and also china cups My husband brought a bottle of duty free Champagne but there were only plastic cups in which to drink it , Breakfast was exceptional with many choices Staff in every department were friendly and couldn t do enough for us I rate this hotel highly Thank you for making us feel so welcome

319834,Novotel Amsterdam City, The location of the hotel just a little far from Amsterdam City , Enjoyed the breakfast There was a good variety of food to choose from Something for everybody 
319835,Novotel Amsterdam City, View from room was dreadful Breakfast too expensive No cafes or shops in immediate area , Near the train station and tram stop Nice rception area 
319836,Novotel Amsterdam City, The service at the check in desk was inefficient to put it mildly First of all checking in took ages because they had to produce vouchers for breakfast for everyone in the group 10 persons for every day of our stay 4 nights so 40 pieces of paper with names and dates handwritten on each one like they used to do it last century They did have a computer but it didn t help much There was a complete mess in their system as regards pre payment and dates of stay One of the guests was denied access to her room in the middle of her stay because the hotel required a guarantee of payment for extras worth 70 euros though the credit card had been authorized on day 1 Checking out took as long as checking in as they had to print out every single invoice for each of the guests accommodation separately from breakfast and tax fees though the entire stay of the group had been paid in advance by one credit card in one go They tried to shuffle off the blame onto booking dot com saying that if the booking had been done directly via their own system everything would have gone smoothly But I sincerely don t see why the quality of service at a four star hotel should depend on a booking company , Breakfast was very good 
319837,Novotel Amsterdam City, We had booked a triple room and our room could barely fit two people Staff at reception were completely unsympathetic and unhelpful Would never stay here again and never recommend it , The breakfast selection was good
319838,Novotel Amsterdam City, Some more Tv channel would have been lovrly, All very good I did like the location Accessible to central and airport easily The breakfast was awesome The waitress checking that you were ok all the time
319839,Novotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, The staff were extremely friendly polite and helpful the hotel was very nice clean and the bed was really comfy the room was a good size as well The bar and restaurant was good to 2 minute walk from the tram and metro which was handy as only took 10mins to get to the city centre I finally got the pat on the back of my friends just like they do on the booking com advert 
319840,Novotel Amsterdam City, Once the housekeeping done halfway only ie cups not washed changed towels not changed Maintenance works done right outside the room without notice drilling piping repairs , Staffs are helpful and friendly
319841,Novotel Amsterdam City, Very Noisy room Expensive for what you get Little poor toilettries Cardboard Cups for tea Coffee Disgraceful Dirty carpets, The location near to the tram into Amsterdam
319842,Novotel Amsterdam City, The rooms could have been a bit bigger A bit cramped for 3 people , Liked the convenience of the location The food n the friendly ever smiling staff 
319843,Novotel Amsterdam City, The size of the room could have been bigger for the three of us Also there was a leak in one of the rooms which caused disruption to our floor and we did not have water This obviously could not be helped but it would have been good to have been informed of this issue beforehand However we were told after we could use the gym facilities so not all negative , The bed was comfy and the hotel was plush 
319844,Novotel Amsterdam City, Should not be called Amsterdam City as it is on the very edge of it D does not take more than 20 mins though by Tram to get downtown , close to the RAI Good Public Transport and Motorway access Parking at the Hotel 
319845,Novotel Amsterdam City, When replenishing the towels remember there are three people in the room , Perfect friendly the beds super comfy and extra long Plugs next to mirror Perfect 
319846,Novotel Amsterdam City, Breakfast was expensive although free for kids There was a wide choice at the buffet but we didn t want to eat the amount which the price would have justified The alternative Coffee Corner kiosk had no opening times shown and had a single person serving which meant long weights around 10 11am when main breakfast had closed and everyone wanted more than a coffee , Good location at the end of the tram line and quite near a whole street of restaurants Staff all very friendly and helpful rooms a good size We had booked 3 rooms for 2 families and were allocated next door rooms at the end of the corridor perfect Option to skip housekeeping and get a bar voucher was appreciated 
319847,Novotel Amsterdam City, Was slightly further away from City centre Having said that was able to travel into City centre via tram service which were quite frequent , Staff were extremely helpful and very friendly and every thing about room was spotless No problems whatsoever 
319848,Novotel Amsterdam City, Having to pay a tax on arrival I booked through you at booking com and you took full payment for my room within 24hrs of making the booking however I was advised upon check in that I had to pay an extra 18 10 for local tax Check in Staff have told me that booking com clients are complaining about this all the time they showed me on your confirmation in very small extremely small font that you say this however that is not good enough you need to make the client aware upon booking with booking com, The Bed was very comfortable
319849,Novotel Amsterdam City, Was a little bit too far out city centre but trams are cheap and just outside hotel , Breakfast was the best we have ever seen or had it was fantastic beautiful hotel clean classy hotel would highly recommend 
319850,Novotel Amsterdam City, Nothing , The hotel is located next to the Rai Easy to get there by car as well Friendly staff The room was very clean bed was good and we were able to make tea coffee in the room 
319851,Novotel Amsterdam City, Room service didn t deliver my food I was charged and not refunded There are charges that not appear when you reserve through booking making the price go almost twice the indicative one , Beds were comfortable 
319852,Novotel Amsterdam City, There was construction on my floor 8 floor the hotel did not seem so busy that I had to be given a room on a floor that was being worked on, Restaurant was very nice Especially the server of the meal He stood out as making an extra effort
319853,Novotel Amsterdam City, The location is not central to all Amsterdam attractions as stated it s a 25mintue tram ride Breakfast is not great and a 22 00 each is not value for money , The staff where good helpful and friendly 
319854,Novotel Amsterdam City, Male toilets for urinate for public at the lobby are a bit too high for me, We have good view from bed room comfortable bed very friendly helpful staff the food is good 
319855,Novotel Amsterdam City, I really disliked the WC paper Too hard and rough Also we didn t know how to heat up the room It took few hours to try this and that and only after then we called the reception and we found out that the heating control was somewhere else and we should not use the air conditioning system Qute bizarre experience I wished they would tell us that at our arrival that the airco is separate from a heater , I liked that the room was very quiet and I liked the sauna facilities Staff was also friendly and helpful 
319856,Novotel Amsterdam City, Some construction happening on the floor of my room It was noisy and smelly The carpet was not cleaned , Near the metro good restaurant good facilities
319857,Novotel Amsterdam City, no major issue noticed but ask for the sauna entrance card in advance if you plan to use it there is not too many to share , big variety for breakfast helpfull staff 
319858,Novotel Amsterdam City, I asked for my baby s bottle to be heated at the bar the only area open at 8pm and I was told to wait three times while my baby was crying in pram as we had just got back from visiting I had to keep asking it took 20 mins and I was made feel like a nuisance Very disappointing , Breakfast great
319859,Novotel Amsterdam City, Nothing, Apart from the very good location of the property all the staffs both day and night were fantastic They make u feel at home immediately u step into the reception area The bar guys are fantastic breakfast is the best I have ever tasted in any hotel I have stayed Generally u have the feeling of a home away from HOME 
319860,Novotel Amsterdam City, I did not like the fact that when I booked the hotel through booking ie for 288 and when I checked out of the hotel I was charged 310 I was totally unaware that these charges would be added to the bill I was unaware that I had to give them a security deposit but it is standard for hotels to do that so I didn t mind but my card declined even though there was enough fund available to take the 50 security they asked for another card to pay this so my girlfriend used her card to pay this When we arrived to Dublin airport we tried to withdraw money from my girlfriends account but could not do so as they had taken 370 from the account aswel as 310 from my account resulting in us been stranded in Dublin for 6 hours until we could get money brought to us I am totally pissed over this stay and will never again stay with them I would like some sort of return as I feel I have been totally ripped off,No Positive
319861,Novotel Amsterdam City, Nothing Negative to say about this hotel , Breakfast was really great Hotel was a tram journey out of the centre about 20 mins but this personally suited us to get away from the hustle and bustle at night Tram stop a stones throw from hotel Metro the same Nice toiletries Comfortable bed Free internet access printer in the Foyer 
319862,Novotel Amsterdam City, The only thing I d say what I didn t like was the policey on weed smoking which your in Amsterdam it is obvious for a 20 year old to try it I just felt I was judged walking in by the security staff and I had to walk out of the grounds of the hotel which is fair enough but to then getting a look up and down isn t what I want every time , This was my 3rd time at the hotel I love the rooms and just how comfortable they are The staff was more than willing to help us with any request we have at all times of the day and night They made a mistake with our order and in 5 minutes we had a fresh one with no debate The hotel is a 2 minute walk to get the tram straight to the centre of Amsterdam I will be defiantly keeping the hotel in mind for the next trip to Amsterdam 
319863,Novotel Amsterdam City, Being woken up at 9am by workmen on our floor or waiting over half hour for more tea and coffee Paying a 70 euro deposit on the room for it to only have two bottles of water in the mini bar , Easy access to the transportation in amsterdam
319864,Novotel Amsterdam City, When checking in at the hotel my credit card was preauthorised extra 70 EUR then I booked the room there was no information about some extra fees Obviously I asked why it was so I got the answer that they are sorry that booking com and some other service provider do not inform the clients about this Frankly to me it looks a bit different I believe that the hotel does not give a full info to booking com I was told that this 70 eur will be released 2 days after I do not see a big problem about it only be decent and update your info and don t look for an excuse , Good location You can go to the city centre by a tram or metro the station is nearby or walk on foot too 
319865,Novotel Amsterdam City, It is almost impossible to be unhappy here , Very helpful and energetic staff even the hotel was full of people because of Christmas Location is not that bad a 15 mins tram journey far away from the city centre Rooms are quite good 
319866,Novotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, Right from check in to check out we felt that the entire staff liked what they do and that is make their customers feel like the most important person in the whole hotel 
319867,Novotel Amsterdam City, Location almost outside the town and the charges for parking , Everything except for the location which was too far from the center Hospitable staff ground floor facilities the newness of the building and more than all the breakfast 
319868,Novotel Amsterdam City, Some of the staff did not explain all details on check in process and one of them even answer our question quite rude Facilities can be improved as the gym and sauna room is small A bit overprice considered these factors , Clean and quite comfortable
319869,Novotel Amsterdam City, We weren t aware we could upgrade to a room that had better view for NYE At least to the opposite side to see the fireworks Also since we had small children wish the staff member would of mentioned the city had a fire work show prepared for that night instead we had no idea and ended up going to Dam square with a taxi to turn around and come back to the room Since fire crackers were randomly being thrown , New Years day morning I spoke to some great staff members that were helpful and professional 
319870,Novotel Amsterdam City, I requested a double bed for me and my partner and when we turned up we were put in a room with 2 single beds and told there was nothing they could do Even though I d booked 3 months prior to visit Also after paying for the room I had to also put a 70 deposit down aswell as nearly 500 for 2 nights which I thought was ridiculous ,No Positive
319871,Novotel Amsterdam City, The tram into Amsterdam centre took nearly an hour the first night Better off cycling but know where you re going , The breakfast was great Staff were very helpful and nice 
319872,Novotel Amsterdam City, Location was a little further out from central amsterdam than first realised but it was easy to get around, Friendly staff welcoming feeling Food was amazing overall 10 10 hotel
319873,Novotel Amsterdam City, The location is really far away from city even quite far from tHe closest train station, The facilities of this hotel is great But the room for 3 persons is quite small 
319874,Novotel Amsterdam City, The room was so ad and smelly and cost 175 euro epwhen it was only worth 50 euro Do not stay there Paid 175 for rubbish room and 45 euro for breakfast Discusting,No Positive
319875,Novotel Amsterdam City, All the dogs that were staying in the hotel at the same time , Breakfast was excellent Bed was comfortable Close by Metro and tram and only 10 mins from the airport
319876,Novotel Amsterdam City, Didn t like paying for Parking , Almost everything the location food breakfast room was great Bar had a great selection of drinks A bright vibrant busy Hotel Easy access to city Centre 
319877,Novotel Amsterdam City, We arrived one hour before 2pm They did not want to give the rooms When we arrive at the late evening it took more than 15min to get the key and the room was already occupied by another person Very embarrassing for all of us We had to get to the reception to get another room , The guy that took us our luggage was extremely nice and pleasant
319878,Novotel Amsterdam City, Wasnt made aware of the 70 euro per room deposite booking com problem not yourselves , Got upgraded to the executive suit for a small fee which was lovely
319879,Novotel Amsterdam City, Dinner was rather ordinary on the one noght we ate in the hotel We were three and ordered two different main meals The Surf and Turf and the Lamb Roast Daily Special both were very disappointing overcooked and overpriced in comparison with other restaurants in the local area where we ate for subsequent lunches and dinners , Proximity to Train and Exhibition Centre A very comprehensive breakfast buffet and the freshly prepared omelettes were perfect 
319880,Novotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, The food in the restaurant was amazing The hotel is beautifully designed lots of nice areas to hang out Their conference facilities were also great 
319881,Novotel Amsterdam City, Don t forget take your credit card with you to declare insurance blockage And in my case it took time to refund at the end , Amazing breakfast loved it Easy transportation to city center and airport both 20 mins Free Mac usage at the lobby I even printed our boarding passes for free Baggage drop off is also for free before check in and after check out Most of the services requiring payment in other hotels was free in Novotel I loved this place I d like to stay here again 
319882,Novotel Amsterdam City, The triple room was very small for 3 people Quite limited supply of tea and coffee put out in the room and would have been nice to have biscuits too , Cleanliness was excellent Nice restaurant and bar area Staff very friendly and helpful 
319883,Novotel Amsterdam City, Reception personell not interested Check in took really long I saw later option to check in also online so really suggest As well as check out , Breakfast
319884,Novotel Amsterdam City, The triple occupancy rooms we got had a double bed with a sofa cum bed doubling as the third bed That wasn t very comfortable We thought we would get three beds in each room The view is not worth paying extra for We got it as an upgrade , We booked last minute and got a decent deal when most hotels in town were full We wanted two triple occupancy rooms There was a delay of over an hour during checkin the front desk gave us some complimentary bar coupons as compensation and upgraded our rooms to the ones with a view The breakfast was pretty good We enjoyed it 
319885,Novotel Amsterdam City, for the price 570 EUR for two Executive Double Rooms I think its too pricy, perfect situation close to city neatly clean very friendly staff some the staff at the restaurant were stressed and not friendly great food and nice staff at the reception an the bar great view from the room
319886,Novotel Amsterdam City, We booked a superior triple room but it was really a double room with a sofa bed It was far too small for three of us Also the toiletries were for one person not three All very annoying , The Hotel was near the metro
319887,Novotel Amsterdam City, Its too far from centre and the tram it takes too long to reach to the centre and metro is always crowded and its as well 7 8 stops away from centre and tram it has may b 15 16 stops before u reach centre, The hotel is good and clean but its too far from the centre you need 45 mins to reach the centre
319888,Novotel Amsterdam City, Waiting at reception as too many check ins and less counters, Offered an upgrade at a cost and we found it value for money Restaurant also had good food
319889,Novotel Amsterdam City, Very expensive hotel Had to pay 70 euro security deposit on card but got it back on checkout in cash, Pasta party night before marathon good value for money
319890,Novotel Amsterdam City, Got kicked out of the hotel for the fire accidentally being knocked by my friend jumping on the bed we where given no chance to pay a fine we were just left on the streets of Amsterdam with no money because we had spent it all on this hotel,No Positive
319891,Novotel Amsterdam City, Deluxe room is spacious but not Deluxe this room is highly overrated bathroom was not clean on arrival this hotel is heading towards a 3 star rating, nice kingsize bed WIFI parking
319892,Novotel Amsterdam City, When checking in i was using a credit card that wasnt mine due to me being just 19 The member of staff was very rude and wouldnt let me use the card despite phoning and asking whether it would be okay I had to use my own savings to pay and the man was not very apologetic despite me being clearly distressed by the situation , It felt safe
319893,Novotel Amsterdam City, They cancelled my booking before I got there after a 6 hour drive Told them a rough arrival time we arrived at the hotel early but they still managed to cancel the room and then told us they sold those rooms an they have none left,No Positive
319894,Novotel Amsterdam City, The thing with having to pay a security deposit was a total surprise as it was nowhere mentioned on our booking confirmation You will be asked to pay the room price 70 EUR extra Money will be released upon check out However if you pay with a debit card money will be released in 3 4 weeks after checkout For credit card they are released after 3 days , Nice location very close to metro Spacious and clean room 
319895,Novotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, I enjoyd the whole stay Very good breakfast Easy to come to the center of the city Quiet room Friendly staff I have been at the hotel many times before from 1995 to 2011 
319896,Novotel Amsterdam City, Rooms are very small location is quite far from Amsterdam city center and no supermarkets in the near by , The hotel is close to the airport and clean staff is helpful gym room available 
319897,Novotel Amsterdam City, Not a bad experience but having to take your own bags to and from your room when checking in or checking out , Location information front counter staff excellent
319898,Novotel Amsterdam City, Bathroom a bit small , Hotel is better for business than leisure but there is a tram no 4 very near to the hotel that takes you into the centre in reasonable time Comfortable bed and good breakfast Staff very helpful 
319899,Novotel Amsterdam City, The children policy stated in the website is not true They only allow one child under the age of 16 to stay free not two Even though this is the global policy stated in Novotel s website the reservation staff confirmed that it is not applicable to Novotel Amsterdam Need 30 min tram ride from central station , Clean and comfortable room Good breakfast Video game room for kids Free PC stations with printers Supermarket opposite to RAI

319902,Novotel Amsterdam City,No Negative, This was an ideal location for our family on a short break to Amsterdam just a short train ride from the airport early check in as we had executive rooms very helpful staff on Reception who gave great advice and so close to the 4 tram to get in and out of the centre Breakfast was great with long serving time and lots of choice Really can t fault the service or hotel all staff we spoke to were very friendly and helpful Obviously it s quiet at night as there s nothing to do in the area and no nice views as in the business district but the service hotel and ease of travel more than makes up for this Highly recommend this hotel 
319903,Novotel Amsterdam City, Check in hour 14 00 It was really painful for us We had to wait 3 hour to hotel check in although we offered extra charge for early check in but your customer service representative failed to do this , overall is good my children loved the hotel cleanness and service we also enjoyed the very near Station Rai and Tram 4 terminal

319907,Novotel Amsterdam City, Far from city centre tram 4 to central station directly but there are more than 15 stops and 25 minutes travel Long queue for check in and check out at peak time High price for Europe but reasonable for Amsterdam , Excellent service and good guidance for Amsterdam The Gym is small but with everything in it Extermely fast net is a surprise comparing to hotels in France and Italy
