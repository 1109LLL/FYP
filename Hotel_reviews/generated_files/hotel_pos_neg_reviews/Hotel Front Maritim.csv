398257,Hotel Front Maritim, I didn t like 1 the door lock was broken You had to literally push the doors to opened them and very hard to pull if you wanted to close it And when you closed it you could see that it wasn t closed porperly you could see partially opened doors The cleaning lady also left them opened not locked porperly because she didn t know that the doors were broken At the beginning we also didn t closed it fully and then our cards were diconnected and we couldn t go inside When we went to the receptionist we said what the problem was and he was so flegmatic that he didn t said anything and he did not do anything about it I was so angry because someone could stole from our room if we or the cleaning lady keep left them unproperly closed Such a negligence Not safe 2 The receptionist were so flegmatic They didn t listen to us and ours problem at all Also I think their English was wery poor and they didn t even understand us I had a feeling that the whole staff was very bad in English 3 there was not wc brush in the room 4 there was only one socket outlet working in the room 5 there is no pool only welness and fitness 6 in the bathroom the shower floor which was made of plastic was bending inside when you stepped on it And also was making funny noises 7 in the edge of the shower you could see small spots of black mold 8 on the courtain was a hole 9 when we arrived to the room there were 2 big yellow spots on the bed sheet in the middle I have written to the cleaning lady to change them but she didn t do it So we were sleeping 7 nights on the stained beed sheets Never seen that in the 4 stars hotel 10 there was no closet for the dresses Only few hangars thet you put them on 2 metal sticks 11 the window lock was also half broken It was almost swingin when you wanted to open or to lock the window 12 there were no maps of public transport or map of Barcelona in the room , I like the outer look of the hotel and nearness of he beach 
398258,Hotel Front Maritim, Poor ventilation in my hotel room 2701 ended up with headaches and nausea Had to leave the hotel room repeatedly during the day and night to get fresh air , Great location 
398259,Hotel Front Maritim, Location was terrible absolutely nothing around you could hire bikes if they had more than 4 for 15 euros per bike what a joke should have been complimentary as we were so far away from everything Paper cups in room for tea and coffee powered milk what s wrong with proper crockery and proper milk All I can say is we won t be going back ,No Positive
398260,Hotel Front Maritim, The breakfast was a little less than desirable for 9 euro the wifi was very slow If i wasn t on business that wouldn t have mattered but to try and do some work in the hotel it was tough, The location was nice
398261,Hotel Front Maritim, Breakfast may have more vegetable options No slippers found in the hotel room The curtains were dirty Room was a bit noisy due to the traffic outside , The front desk staff was so friendly and helpful The bed was comfortable Easy access to public transportation and shopping mall 
398262,Hotel Front Maritim, No aircondition only hot air No noise insulation next to a busy street Bad wifi Cheap plastic mattress protector making sleeping uncomfortable NB Similar comments by many other reviewers so obviously management is not taking action, Friendly reception

398264,Hotel Front Maritim, Limited choice of breakfast for vegetarians and vegans Rooms are very small compared to the pics also the hotel gave us a twin beds despite us requesting for double bed , The hotel staff is helpful
398265,Hotel Front Maritim, We got to our room and it had not be cleaned properly Hairs in the shower and the floor was dirty The size of the room was small and for the amount it cost I would have expected a little bit more Our card didn t work for the sauna and fitness suites We had a noisy hotel guests next to us and when reported was told why did you not just call down next time you should call down to security was really disappointed with this hotel It advertises itself well but in reality it s not great , The hotel location is great for the beach and close to the metro to access all of Barcelona
398266,Hotel Front Maritim, The air conditioner did not work We were out during the days and our room was quite warm when we returned It was cool at night so we left the window open The bathroom sink did not drain well but the shower was fine We did not report either of the problems but hope they will be fixed for future guests , The front desk staff was wonderful Albert was very helpful with our questions and with having Andre print our boarding passes Gracias The room was cozy and the bed was comfortable We liked the area and proximity to the Hop on Hop off Bus 
398267,Hotel Front Maritim, With its proximity to the convention centre this should be a business hotel but the facilities are beyond poor The wifi was intermittent they don t have an iron or ironing board in the rooms and they only have 1 iron in the entire hotel There are no wardrobes in the rooms Their were only 3 hangers available for clothing I would never stay here again Poor facilities for a business visit surprised it s a 4 property , 10 min walk to Convention Centre
398268,Hotel Front Maritim, Limited access to hotel facilities No refill of tea coffee cups without asking , Location of the hotel was perfect if you want to be away from the business of the cry while enjoying all its advantages
398269,Hotel Front Maritim, Old looking bedroom very basic tv arm was broke so it didn t turn towards the bed very noisy with the road room was with sea views but from the first floor you cannot see the sea as trees are there bed not very comfortable breakfast was very basic wifi kept disconnecting while price of room was very expensive Hotel was more a 2 stars than 4 Will not be staying there again , Nothing
398270,Hotel Front Maritim, I changed the rooms first one was in a different building quiet but terribly cold had to turn on A C to warm it up Second room too hot A C was not working at all It had view to the sea but it was very noisy as close to the street , Location is great very close to the sea and like 30 minutes from city center Good places to eat nearby shopping moll by 10 minutes walk Staff is friendly 
398271,Hotel Front Maritim,No Negative, The location right next to the beach was lovely even if it was December 15min walk to all the nightlife and casino It was 10 15 euros in a cab to Las Ramblas 12 lads on a Xmas Market tour in Barcelona

398274,Hotel Front Maritim, The bar staying open beyond midnight would be good and please put some chests of drawers in the bedroom very little storage space for clothes, Upgraded to sea view rooms as this was a special birthday celebration Friendliness of the staff and breakfast choices were all great 
398275,Hotel Front Maritim, Only community area was sometimes dirty but is not cleaner fault only customers don t respect sometimes cleaning service job , Great personnel on reception Helpful and nice Rooms are clean and comforting Bathroom very good and shower amaizing Thank you for all stuff in bathroom Hotel nice and have close metro bus service and market beach is 5 min walk from hotel Thank you for this weekend 
398276,Hotel Front Maritim, Only 4 hangers and no wardrobe but a 12inch wide recess in the wall to hang shirts and dresses even worse was the fact that there were no draws in the room so all the clothes had to stay in the case in my opinion this hotel is more for conferences rather than holiday makers the hotel is slightly out of the city but does have a metro only 5 mins away, The reception staff were very helpful from a small repair in the room seen to immediately to sorting out our best travel arrangements in and around the city The maids kept the rooms very clean Breakfast had a good variety catering for most nations
398277,Hotel Front Maritim, very expensive for the quality offered Not really clean outdated unfriendly staff breakfast room was super small and it was difficult to find a seat Not recommended , was close to convention center
398278,Hotel Front Maritim, I couldn t believe I got charged 5 Euros to have 1 shirt ironed because they don t have irons nor bathrobes inside the rooms I also didn t like the different levels of operating the elevator with no signage for directions The fitness area remained locked I had to continuously ask for it to be opened , Housekeeping came promptly to restore my room and had it good as new without disturbing my belongings Location was perfect to stay by the beach and to eat some local dining 
398279,Hotel Front Maritim, Extremely overpriced for the value AC was like having a tractor in the room notified staff but nothing happened in 4 days Toilet flush broke notified staff 7 hours later in the middle of the night had to get back to them communication between them seems to be non existent Def not 4 stars 2 at most Wifi connection was horrible not good for business traveler , Location Breakfast
398280,Hotel Front Maritim,No Negative, Professional looking hotel that any international traveler would appreciate Full amenities available Very close to beach with nice view Away from hustle and bustle of main tourist areas but close enough to access Decent dining options available within a short walking distance 
398281,Hotel Front Maritim, The food every day the same the cleaning staff very unfriendly and unprofessional no place to put your wet swimwear and towels cheap and slippery a mattress protector very expensive hotel because of the location only , The location
398282,Hotel Front Maritim, tea coffee facilities in the room not there and there are maintainence issues in the room , well located for the conference centre with very helpful staff 
398283,Hotel Front Maritim, I reserved a room for non smokers but there was a strong smell of smoke in the room Even though I addressed this with the staff no action was taken I m not very sensitive but it is extremely unpleasant to smell of smoke as a non smoking person I had to keep myc clothes in a plastic garbage bag protect them from the smell of smoke Still my colleague was wondering if I had taken up smoking Also cleaning of the room left a lot to ask for There was still plenty of sand on the floor after cleaning ,No Positive
398284,Hotel Front Maritim, The room is not four star It has a four star bathroom but the living area is cramped with two single beds that leaves a small 3 foot wide lane in front of the bed and a small 6 x 4 area by the window Other than a ryokan room in Tokyo this is the smallest hotel room I have ever rented It seems like the designers of the building sought to maximize the number of bodies that could be crammed into the available real estate There is only one chair to sit in and a small desk The television is a small 32 inch that is hung on the wall to save space It did not have a closet but rather two bars to hang your clothes on that are in a recessed space approximately 10 inches deep behind the room door There is little in the way of shelving With its low ceilings and small square footage the room feels cramped and even claustrophobic , The location is good if you want to go to the CCIB Conference center or lounging on the waterfront beaches The room was clean and the beds were comfortable The staff was courteous and helpful 
398285,Hotel Front Maritim, no minicoller no facilities for boil water mold on bathroom and ceiling of the room no ventilation in the bathroom window not close well MAX 3 STARS , friendly staff good breakfast near beach 
398286,Hotel Front Maritim,No Negative, I stayed for a few days on a work trip and found the location ideal for the convention centre and to relax at the beach when not working The reception staff were very welcoming and accommodating I had an early check in and was also upgraded to a sea front room which was lovely many thanks 
398287,Hotel Front Maritim, Really hot bedroom the air doesn t work properly and there is no option to open the windows Really poor internet Poor breakfast no fruits and everything looks like from the nearest supermarket Really small towels , Excelent location easy access to the beach 
398288,Hotel Front Maritim, We had no balcony thats about the only bad thing i can say here , The location of the hotel is the nearest to the beach You have a big shoping mall 5 minutes away You have a metro station near And there are lots of restaurants near 
398289,Hotel Front Maritim, the quilt was not so comfortable and too thin , very close to the beach also quite easy access to the center of the town the metro station is just less than 10 min walk away breakfast was various and easy to park your car 
398290,Hotel Front Maritim, nothing , A lovely hotel our room overlooked the sea perfect The staff were very helpful and friendly Great carpark underneath The breakfast was good a choice of breads cakes fruit and even 3 choices of eggs hot bacon and sausages What not to like

398293,Hotel Front Maritim, Room was very small and no mini cooler inside the room Room was not being cleaned every day we had to ask every time for it to be cleaned Towels offered had stains on them Bathroom was dirty Amenities that were advertised on web site Sona Turkish bath were not available at all We stayed there for 7 days and the sheet covers as well as the pillow covers were not changed the whole time , The Hotel location was great very convenient and near almost everything The area is very safe and clean transportation is available 
398294,Hotel Front Maritim, The hotel is located offside in a local residents area There is nothing for tourists The rooms are so small and a minidouble bed for midgets Breakfast has very little to offer, Nothing Only the bathroom was ok
398295,Hotel Front Maritim, 1 Air conditioning in the room Only noise 2 Failed to provide an iron Only by laundry services charged 3 Lousy breakfast e g cold eggs ,No Positive
398296,Hotel Front Maritim, The room smelled like sewage the entire stay The A C never cooled the room lower than 26 degrees Celsius it froze up in the middle of the night stopped working altogether Room was advertised as sea view but the building only has two floors not 28 as listed so you see nothing , Good location that s about it Walking distance to the beach subway and the mall Front desk was nice they let me keep my luggage in a storage space for about 8 hours for free 
398297,Hotel Front Maritim, Rooms are getting a bit tired could do with some painting Fitness center could be expanded folks these days like to work out and there s ample room in floor 1 to make it bigger and better, The location is fabulous Excellent value for money
398298,Hotel Front Maritim, The rooms are very dark made worse by the decor it cried out for some brighter colours There also does not seem enough investment on the cleaning staff who work single handed and struggle to get the cleaning done Our room was cleaned last every day and this was not until 6 pm on most days which was inconvenient when getting ready to go out , The location is ideal being close to the beach and with easy access to the city via the nearby Metro The staff as mentioned by others are friendly and helpful 
398299,Hotel Front Maritim, Disappointing facilities for 4 star No kettle no fridge no facilities in the room Air condition was not working at all in that heat 35C and started leaking from the ceiling couldn t get into my room so had to go to reception for about 4 times to get it open really bad experience , great location some of receprion staff really nice 
398300,Hotel Front Maritim, The nearest metro exit is about a ten minute walk Didn t really mind it too much though If you re lazy and don t like walking or carrying a lot of luggage this might be an issue We took a cab from and to the airport anticipating this though so we didn t struggle at all , Located far enough away from las rambles and Barceloneta beach to be quiet at night but close enough to get everywhere very easily by bike or metro We rented bikes from the hotel one day very basic bikes but get the job done I m not picky and rode to Barceloneta beach and loved it Relaxed had lunch relaxed more rode around had dinner and then rode the 15min ride back to the hotel We got everywhere else by metro Their was also a calmer beach right in front of the hotel 
398301,Hotel Front Maritim, The breakfast buffet didn t have the assortment you would expect in a four star hotel Also we didn t get refill on soap so we had to ask for more at the reception The rooms were quite small and the wall paper started to come off in certain places , The hotel is within walking distance to the beach and it s possible to use the hotel s beach towels 
398302,Hotel Front Maritim, No kettle no fridge no facilities in the room at all You have to go to the reception to make a hot drink but the close at 11pm About a 30min walk to the entertainment but was not bad as I enjoyed the walk and views , Nice property beautiful sea view you have to request this 
398303,Hotel Front Maritim, We paid more for a sea view but although we could see the sea it was first floor and not worth the extra money Restaurant was ok but the waiter was very rude and started to clear my husbands plates whilst i was still eating When i commented on this he ignored me and addressed my husband We finished quickly and left , Lovely bed and nice room The reception staff were very knowledgable and friendly
398304,Hotel Front Maritim, The only negative point was that hotel didn t have hair conditioner but other than that everything was perfect , The location was excellent by the beach with easy access to centre also whether by bus taxi or metro all very very close Rooms very clean and comfortable and most staff quite helpful and pleasant 
398305,Hotel Front Maritim, Breakfast too expensive for what is offered With 9 you can get a better one at the bar nearby hotel , Perfect hotel for attending a conference at the CCIB Close to the metro and to main bus stops Good location also if you wish to spend some time at the beach

398308,Hotel Front Maritim, No sleeper no bathrobe no botle of water no tea no biscuits at the room no fridge the view was horrible the room terrible the colour ridiculous the toilet makes a lot of strange noises I ask for the see view but they didn t give me the see view , I didn t like nothing at this hotel
398309,Hotel Front Maritim, Nothing Everything was perfect , The bed was really comfy and massive The room had a lovely view of the sea The hotel gave me a bottle of cava as a gift to celebrate my birthday Was a very unexpected and I really appreciated it The staff were amazing I would gladly go back to the hotel and have not stopped telling my friends and family how much I enjoyed the hotel and the beautiful city of Barcelona A must see city and the Hotel Front Maritim is the perfect hotel to stay in while you explore 
398310,Hotel Front Maritim, Rooms very basic no tea coffee making facilities in room Main road outside was very noisy in the mornings Hotel is a little further out from main area then first realized but ok if you don t mind a walk The room with a sea view was more of a peek of the sea through trees , Very welcoming staff room was ready when we arrived rooms were basic but Clean nice beds just a few minutes from the beach 
398311,Hotel Front Maritim, I couldn t connect to the wifi the whole stay I had to fix the toilet in the middle of the night cause it wouldn t load more water The staff told me I could ve called the 24hr reception though which is great she was very nice about it but maybe a bit of maintenance could avoid these situations , The bed and shower were perfect In general it was a pleasant stay The room was very comfy 
398312,Hotel Front Maritim, The room walls are paper thin and not sound proofed you can hear everything that is happening in the next room and outside , The view was lovely and rooms were a decent size wifi was good 
398313,Hotel Front Maritim, The price but to be fair all hotels in Barcelona were expensive that week, As I was working on Carcia Faria it was a very convenient location Staff were extremely friendly and professional I would definitely use this hotel again
398314,Hotel Front Maritim, TV not working and the sink in the bathroom not working but once reported these were quickly fixed The water in the vending machine was extortionately priced for 8 a bottle Other than those minor niggles a really pleasant stay , The hotel was clean most of the staff were friendly and no complaints in this regard a lot of secure parking as well Although the hotel was a bit out of the way from town there is a bus H16 and metro station Selva de Mar both within ten walking minutes also easily accessible by car on the Ronda Litoral B10 Also close to the beach 
398315,Hotel Front Maritim, Don t belive the photos There is only two rooms in hotel with balcony 4 stars there maybe was 10 years ago General cleanliness is way off Bar restaurant staff don t speak english and are not very helpfull Computer in library is from 1990 same as air con in rooms Pretty loud traffic in mornings Breakfast just ok , Helpfull and friendly staff at recption and maids Great place for vacation on the beach Alright price Wifi was ok Quite neigbourhood 
398316,Hotel Front Maritim, no atmosphere in dining room my wife and I stayed a week and out of the 7 days we were the only2 in restaurant menu did not change either very dark rooms ended up checking out as it was depressing, close too the sea
398317,Hotel Front Maritim, There was a party in the hall beneath our room The music was unbearable they went on untill 1 33am went to complain of the noise at the reception the receptionist told me the party was booked months in advance long before i made my booking so it was my fault that i chose to stay on the first floor there was nothing he could do the problem is that i was given the room i didnt choose it and if had i wouldnt have chosen that room in view of the impending party , Bed was excellent especilly the pillows breakfast and food was ok 
398318,Hotel Front Maritim, That I paid almost 50 more for the same type of room as my friends simply because I booked a few days after them This makes me feel ripped off Also despite requesting vegetarian breakfast options there was little on offer , Comfortable beds Great shower 
398319,Hotel Front Maritim, We spent 7 days in the hotel for our honey moon We specified this is the reason but there were no decorations in the room like they were advertising they have for honey moon periods The room was very small there was little room for 2 persons We asked to change it with a room with sea view assuming this would have been bigger but it was also small and the sea view was limited by trees and buildings not at all looking like in the commercial of the hotel There was no fridge mini bar in the room This is not acceptable for a room of 100 euros per night There was no drawer in the room to place your clothes There was no heat in the hotel I asked at the reception to turn the heat on and they said this is not possible they will bring an extra blanket Decaffeinated coffee was not available for 7 days during our full stay Overall for the money we paid 750 euros for 6 nights the hotel did not raise up to the expectations felt more like a 3 stars hotel I regret staying there especially for our honey moon mainly because of the poor quality of the room , The breakfast was well balanced The location was very close to the beach and the subway Selva de mar metro station
