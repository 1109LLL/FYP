129312,The One Barcelona GL, Requested early check in not possible but then room wasn t even available at 3pm when check in was due Didn t receive our room key until 6pm Requested a phone call when available didn t receive Had to go and ask 3 times Noisy with window open Although very nice nowhere near enough space on rooftop terrace for size of hotel, room pleasant
129313,The One Barcelona GL, You have to come early to the pool to find a space to relax and prices for drinks are very high , Very well trained staff extremely friendly and helpful good room size and amenities
129314,The One Barcelona GL, Unfortunately the food and drinks of the roof terrace were pretty expensive 10 euros for an Estrella is the most expensive beer I ve ever had The same beer at the most expensive hotels in Barcelona were even cheaper than this 40 euros for two beers each for me and my partner is a lot It s a shame there is no discounted rate for hotel guests as I understand you pay a premium for the view but I don t expect to have to spend that much when we are already paying a premium to be a guest It did frustrate me but it wouldn t put me off staying there again I would just drink water Another thing is the price of the breakfast Only once did we dine at the hotel restaurant for breakfast A relatively small breakfast for 2 cost over 70 euros one of the most expensive meals we had in our entire stay The waitress ordered a coffee for my boyfriend when he actually said he didn t want one and automatically poured us both orange juice without asking they ended up being 7 euros for just one glass so 14 euros each for something we didn t even ask for I assumed it was part of the breakfast deal until I saw the bill Their set menu s are great value but because my boyfriend only wanted one dish off the menu and I wanted only one part of another set menu we decided to order individually to reduce the waste If we had shared one set menu it was have just been 30 something euros instead of 70 The pricing just doesn t make sense as we had far less food for double the price It s safe to say I was shocked when the bill arrived A small bread basket with a mini croissant roll and couple of other tiny pastries was well over 10 euros It s best to head next door literally to the most incredible bakery and have an overflowing bag of pastries for just a few euros And great coffee It seems like the negative outweigh the positives but that is not the case , The hotel was so beautiful and the staff so helpful I went with my Boyfriend for his birthday and we got a bottle of Cava on arrival and another on his actual birthday It was such a sweet thought and absolutely wonderful to receive The staff were so friendly and the concierge very useful We used them for all of our recommendations and it definitely paid off The pool is gorgeous and rooms so luxurious and modern I loved the USB ports next to the bed and the beds were super comfortable I would go back in a heartbeat already planning my next trip An unforgettable stay 
129315,The One Barcelona GL, The room is ideally designed for 2 people so adding a 3rd one on the pullout made things very tight , Breakfast includes a great bread basket fresh orange juice a variety of fresh fruit The window coverings create a nicely blackened room for sleeping 
129316,The One Barcelona GL, We thought 10 euros for a very small glass of wine was rather expensive and feel we would have loved to have more drinks at the roof top pool but for me it just didn t warrant the drink portions If the glasses were large I would have been more tempted , Although it was expensive to stay at the hotel the staff and facilities were second to none Everything was amazing The staff very helpful and friendly they all made us feel like royalty even though we had just come from a festival in benicassim and didn t quite look our best Was a great end to our holiday and would definitely book again 
129317,The One Barcelona GL, The only problem we found were the jets not working in the spa pool that was it , Amazing place The room was finished to the highest standard and facilities were super modern Very impressive The spa gym in the basement and pool on the roof were beautifully finished and a good size especially being in the centre of Barcelona The breakfast was probably the best I have had and they catered to our requests happily Last but not least the staff were brilliant and their recommendations were fantastic It made our Engagement weekend even more memorable 
129318,The One Barcelona GL, We had to pay our room bill already up front which I find quite unusual an made my first impression rather negative I had to pay again when checking out open room service bill so do not understand why we had to pay when we just arrived apart that it s apparently company policy , Very nice hotel room clean friendly staff
129319,The One Barcelona GL, Having to wait for two hours to check in when I d requested an early check in The deluxe room disappointing with a view of a wall Prices way over the top re roof top dining Even for 5 star hotel, Loved the comfort views and beauty of the suite
129320,The One Barcelona GL,No Negative, Lovely staff beautiful room easy valet parking excellent hot breakfast made to order beautiful property quiet but easy short walk to Passeig de Gr cia Loved it Would stay again 
129321,The One Barcelona GL, My mom and I liked everything your establishment offered and I have already recommended your hotel to three friends , As an expert in etiquette and protocol I enjoyed the handwritten note with the welcoming note next to the dark chocolate tablet signed by Peggy Your hotel met our every expectation thank you 
129322,The One Barcelona GL, I could not fault one bit, The staff were amazing meeting our every need From a polite friendly personal greeting as soon you walk through the doors to the brilliant concierge Nacho whom when above and beyond for us during our stay Nacho is a credit to the hotel and made our stay that much more enjoyable and easy He made brilliant suggestions for attractions and restaurants within the city The waiting staff were also brilliant from breakfast right through until evening drinks in the rooftop bar I have never experienced service like it It s the best I ve ever received The maids were fanatastic cleaning and restocking the room three times a day replenishing the water and towels It was fantastic service and provided such a clean and welcoming environment I would definitely revisit the hotel and will 100 be recommending to others 
129323,The One Barcelona GL, We had two rooms One of our rooms encountered noise problem with the shower drainage twice in the middle of the night but the hotel moved us the next day , The size of room is typical for any new hotels It s in a great location The staffs are very friendly and helpful The breakfast is a la cart not buffet Their masseur at the spa is excellent 
129324,The One Barcelona GL, No special remarks to raise , The overall set up quality of the hotel architecture facilities service food location and most importantly the professionalism and availability of the staff 
129325,The One Barcelona GL, Nothing , This is a brand new contemporary hotel that my wife and I thought was outstanding Bed was truly king sized and perfect All of the people we interacted with were exceptionally gracious and helpful We only stayed one night after a cruise before heading back to the US so we ate breakfast and dinner there Food was excellent although if you order an omelette instruct them to put the vegetables and cheese inside the omelette rather than on the side 
129326,The One Barcelona GL, My room was small definitely not 30 sq meters advertised as Deluxe Room It also did not have a bath tub which seems odd for a 5 hotel The no disturb button by the bed was so bright that I had to cover it with a towel to be able to sleep The pool opening times are unideal for business travellers closing at 9pm and opening at 11am Gets hard to enjoy it if you are arriving late after business day and have to depart early in the morning Breakfast menu is beyond expensive Paid ca 50 euros for one person breakfast a la carte and there is no buffet , Location is very nice Well equipped gym Friendly staff SPA area rooftop pool 
129327,The One Barcelona GL,No Negative, Class boutique Great little gym and spa Rooms a bit small but well dressed Nice rooftop and plunge pool service friendly but slow Classic Spain though 
129328,The One Barcelona GL, Space dedicated to the wardrobe is a little small just take in consideration , This hotel is brand new location is great only 5 minutes walking from Gracia avenue and 10 15 to Sagrada Famiglia Concierge service is one of the best I ve ever seen Their recomandation was more than perfect Rooms are very comfortable and design is perfect So are the beds and bathroom Definitely will stay here next time
129329,The One Barcelona GL,No Negative, 5 Star service in every way Everything was done with such a smile that it literally felt like we were at home They have spared no expense when it comes to the service and comfort of their guests Even the towels in this hotel were softer then I have ever had The spa was beautiful and relaxing and so quiet and enjoyable Everything is so clean with fresh bathrobes and slippers brought every morning Oh I wish I was back 
129330,The One Barcelona GL, Cottons comes out from the carpet under the bed and from towels and sticks to ur hair , Great location Very welcoming crew elegant rooms tasty breakfast and i liked that they respect the guests by adding options like toilet hoses and arabic channels 
129331,The One Barcelona GL, Was obvious the hotel was new as when busy everyone seemed a little out of control The breakfast menu should have been broken up into individual dishes as the two options were too much food The lifts could be a problem and had a mind of their own when trying to get to the terrace and pool Around the pool they should have had a couple more beds instead of table and chairs , The location was perfect and the hotel was new and clean The pool bar and restaurant were great and the staff very friendly 
129332,The One Barcelona GL, The room design is a little unusual whereby the entrance area to the room is sort of part of the bathroom Little or no possibility to hang things up , Very welcoming and helpful staff comfortable rooms and hotel interior Well located for us in that it is in a fairly quiet area but not far away from everything we wanted to see and visit We were very happy to not be in the excessively crowded central city areas 
129333,The One Barcelona GL, slightly disappointed as my cashmere disappeared from my luggage , Rooftop terrace and super comfy bed was a bonus as well as great location to all the action
129334,The One Barcelona GL,No Negative, The staff is excellent Domingo and Dennis are great and very helpful The hotel s location is superb well located footsteps away from top sights The rooms are cozy comfortable and alway kept clean If I ever come back I will surely stay at The One GL again Definitely recommended 
129335,The One Barcelona GL, I didn t know how to choose a room properly and my view was an alley Overall though the hotel is excellent , The hotel staff were extremely nice and helpful The food at the hotel restaurant was amazing The bartenders knew their stuff 
129336,The One Barcelona GL, Not many other reviews has said this but for us the extras were too expensive 36 for breakfast was just not justifiable so we didn t bother In Barcelona you have fantastic food readily available so this didn t spoil things , Beautiful hotel and very friendly staff 
129337,The One Barcelona GL, No negative comments at all , The best city break hotel I have ever stayed in Excellent staff and recommend the breakfast Overall excellent experience 
129338,The One Barcelona GL, View from my room it was a wall The breakfast is not great cheap and you can not choose la carte but not very tasty , Clean room a comfortable bed staff is amazing 
129339,The One Barcelona GL, Room appeared to be small Maybe they could do without the large reading chair in the room , This is a new modern hotel in a superb location The staff are friendly and helpful The hotel is clean and well furnished For breakfast you can choose from two set menus There is so much to eat and the food is nice Never mind that it is not a buffet We had dinner at the hotel restaurant one night and the salad and pasta were so delicious The restaurant recommendation by the concierge were great quality food at reasonable prices 
129340,The One Barcelona GL, There is nothing to dislike, The hotel is new and rooms beautiful and spacious Staff excellent Abdul in particular always asked how our day was Marc Denis and Nacho were extremely helpful in booking restaurants directions sightseeing basically any assistance that was needed they were able to assist promptly I met the manager on the last day of our stay and he was very welcoming Love the line of products used by the hotel

129346,The One Barcelona GL,No Negative, The One offers an exceptional level of comfort personal service in a luxurious refined ambiance The guest rooms are well designed and very functional The hotel definitely has the potential to be among the top 5 properties in Barcelona 
129347,The One Barcelona GL, The welcoming at reception was not really professional Very basic and poor for a Five Star hotel , The rooms and the beds are fantastic as well as the design Concierge are very friendly and helpful 
129348,The One Barcelona GL, n a , Hotel facilities atmosphere and service Everyone that we met in THE ONE was great We didn t try the breakfast but late night room service was good 
129349,The One Barcelona GL, I did not like the breakfast set up that much with pre prepared menus I prefer a buffet where you can take what you like This could be complemented with the menus for those who like to get a special treat , Overall very nice and stylish hotel Very friendly staff Excellent location 
129350,The One Barcelona GL, The pool could have been a bit bigger but the guy who is in charge of it compensate that disadvantage Super nice and friendly , Exellent brand new hotel opened in Jan 2017 Very much liked the location 100 meters from Casa Mila La Pedrera The stuff especially Marc the Concierge and Emilio from the restaurant were super helpful and extra polite

129352,The One Barcelona GL, Nothing at all, Won t stay at any other hotel in Barcelona in the future This is a wonderfully put together hotel in terms of design service comfort and location footsteps from Passeig de Garcia The attention to detail and style of the hotel is impeccable I just had to ask who the designer was Jaime Beriestain to find other works he s done Beautifully executed The service was highly attentive and always with a smile Everyone from the doorman to the receptionist to the wonderful folks in Somni delicious food the detox juice during breakfast is a must have been more than great I stayed at the City Facing Junior Suite it was a space you can t help but loosen up and chill in neutral colors and lighting and perhals one of the most comfortable beds I ve slept it just gives this room top marks All in all this hotel gets 10 easy not a score I usually give often
