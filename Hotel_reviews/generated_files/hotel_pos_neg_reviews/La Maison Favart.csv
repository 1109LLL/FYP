203717,La Maison Favart,No Negative, Lovely hotel near Opera We walked down from Gare du Nord as it was a beautiful day and went through the old covered passageways Verdeau Jouffroy and Panaramas which was an interesting stroll Greeted at the hotel by Stefano who immediately got us a drink and was very helpful with information we needed We had room 16 which had a tiny courtyard seating area No view but a secluded place to sit and have a glass of wine Didn t use the spa as we had lots of things booked and the heated pool wasn t needed when it was beautiful outside Breakfast was good and had all usual things Very close to Metro station Overall a very nice stay Thank you 
203718,La Maison Favart,No Negative, Gorgeous decor linens comfortable beds and the most helpful staff I was traveling alone extending a business trip and they were so helpful in suggestions for dining and where it was safe to go as a woman alone 
203719,La Maison Favart, AC unit VERY WEAK during my trip stayed at hotels that were much less expensive with much better AC units Manager told me was likely due to the heavy curtains in front of unit verified unit was working properly even with opening curtains was hot in room,No Positive
203720,La Maison Favart,No Negative, The staff are incredibly helpful the rooms are beautiful and immaculate Breakfast was excellent I was traveling alone and they took excellent care of me 
203721,La Maison Favart, There is no sink in the toilet room and the pool is quite tiny enough for a family to enjoy it but not with lots of others , The staff were very family and also provided many information that we need The location is excellent Very closed to the metro about 3 minutes walking and many restaurants are around If you like to walk around it is about 5 minutes to the opera house and 20 minutes to the Louvre 
203722,La Maison Favart, far overpriced Expensive parking in the neighbourhood had to park the car far away and was still expensive room was micro overlooking an inner part of the building not very inspiring there were hair on the floor when came in which gave impression the room was not properly cleaned, The tiny pool underground was very nice Location was very central next to the stock exchange and Opera
203723,La Maison Favart,No Negative, The La Maison Favart staff was incredible They were so kind and helpful We felt welcomed and they took excellent care of us from finding a physician to obtaining drivers and recommending restaurants The hotel was charming and the room was roomy for Europe and comfortable The property is within walking distance to most tourist sites The breakfast was delicious and just what we needed to begin our fun filled days I would highly recommend this hotel and hope to return there someday 
203724,La Maison Favart, Breakfast could improve Not enough lights in the room considering the fact that dark wall paper used on the walls No hand washing facilities in the toilet as it is separated from bath room, Friendly staff comfortable stay great location
203725,La Maison Favart,No Negative, The breakfast was awesome and so does the room The staffs are super friendly You might hesitate seeing the pictures on social media but it is nothing same to them Highly recommend
203726,La Maison Favart, No real room service I was told an hour wait for a chicken sandwich as they have to order in 19 too Room was very small with little natural light , Beds very comfy shower excellent staff friendly Gym and pool small but nicely done out 
203727,La Maison Favart,No Negative, The concierge always went above and beyond to help get tickets arrange transport even to help find a grocery store carrying a specific kind of milk for our toddler

203730,La Maison Favart, I wanted to to surprise my wife for our anniversary cause she liked so much hotel when she saw it on the internet and then nothing was the same terrible, I liked just pictures from the internet I changed two rooms and there were very different from the pictures Rooms were dirty 
203731,La Maison Favart, I just wish the room was bit more spacious and was missing peg to hang jacket and not having to put it in wardrobe, Beautiful sweet small hotel in very quite square but just 100m from very vibrant streets and area in general perfect to relax and to have fast access of anything you need restaurants bars shops would come again for sure 
203732,La Maison Favart,No Negative, This is a truly fabulous hotel We went there to celebrate our mini moon and we had the most wonderful time The hotel is beautiful and spotlessly clean the staff were friendly and incredibly helpful Also the hotel is well located and not too noisy The rooms were warm decorated very comfortably and chic This is a great place for a romantic get away and we can t wait to return 
203733,La Maison Favart, Because it is such an obscure location most of my cab drivers had a difficult time finding it even with GPS One driver gave up and left , La Madison Favary is one of the nicest hotels I ve ever stayed I ve traveled abroad to many countries over many years I have stayed in the Plaza Hotel and the Waldorf in New York City I would take the Hotel Favart over them both The staff is topnotch They truly treat you like family as soon as you walk into the door The decor is clean and modern and chic The breakfast was pricy but it was just enough for my daughters and I I plan to return whenever I can 
203734,La Maison Favart,No Negative, The bed and especially pillows were amazing The room was delightful and the pool in the basement was incredibly cool Our concierge Boris was extremely friendly and helpful and made getting tickets to various venues a breeze The nearest subway entrance is about a block away and really is the way to get around the city We were thinking about our next stay here before we even checked out

203740,La Maison Favart, Nothing jumps at me , I particularly liked the friendliness and helpfulness of the entire staff I also found the ambiance comfortable and easy to settle into And you can t beat the close location to restaurants and tourist sites all well within walking distance

203756,La Maison Favart, The TV only had one English channel it would have been nice to have a choice of channels , The bed was very comfortable and the shower was large and of a high standard 
203757,La Maison Favart, I feel bad putting anything in here but I suppose it might have a bar as opposed to drinks being available from an honesty bar That said given the size of the hotel that is a very sensible compromise so it is not really a complaint , Wonderful attentive and friendly staff Extraordinarily well run hotel exceptionally clean and well appointed rooms Great design and significant thought has gone into the theme and layout 
203758,La Maison Favart, Breakfast area is nicely decorated but the buffet is too small , The staff is very kind and helpful They made us feel as if we were at home First day they sent us a complimentary champagne which was a pleasant surprise Location is good and you can reach everywhere by walking The pool and the sauna were relaxing 
203759,La Maison Favart, Not the slightest negative point to report , The atmosphere of an elegant French hotel particulier with 21st century comfort and amenities Outstanding staff from the concierge to the cook in charge of the breakfast and afternoon treats Ideally located within walking distance to Le Louvre Musee Grevin Place Vendome and Galleries Lafayette 
203760,La Maison Favart,No Negative, Staff were very friendly and gave us complimentary champagne on the first night Hotel was clean and tube station was at the bottom of the road so quick and easy access for travelling 
203761,La Maison Favart, Overall staff were lovely friendly and polite A couple were awkward when trying to organise taxis and room service saying it couldn t be done and you would have to pay them a charge which put a negative slant on an otherwise perfect stay , Location is excellent Rooms and overall hotel decor is beautiful Spa is lovely would be great if you could block off spa privately like other hotels in Paris as it is so small 
203762,La Maison Favart,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helped with everything from booking restaurants to arranging taxis and providing directions And there was a lovely cake each afternoon

203767,La Maison Favart, The elevators are a bit slow and the rooms could be a bit larger but the deluxe room is all right The cost of snacks is ridiculous so I walked the 5 min to a supermarket at rue 4th September and rue Ste Anne and bought at a much more reasonable rate , Almost everything especially the wonderful hospitality of the staff and the comfort of the bathroom and the room The convenience of the hotel for accessing Galleries Drouot and the antiques area around it and the Asian food area on Rue Ste Anne is great The pool is really cool 
203768,La Maison Favart, none, The atmosphere at this hotel is lovely it is truly charming with wonderful staff lovely rooms and staff that really help especially the concierges It works for business due to location but equally well for a romantic break 
203769,La Maison Favart, The pool was small and perfectly formed but it was too cold Too small to swim in so really it should have been heated like a hot tub then would have been perfect Similarly the sauna didn t seem to heat up to a very good temperature at all , Charming little boutique hotel with pool Beautiful individually decorated rooms with opera themes Loved the duplex suites 
203770,La Maison Favart, Size of room but this is a complaint I have in Paris generally , Hakim the concierge was above and beyond Made you feel like he was only looking out for you Would love to hire him 
203771,La Maison Favart,No Negative, Loved the decor one of the main reasons for choosing the hotel The service was great friendly welcoming staff who did their best to please and to accommodate requests We had 2 rooms on the 2nd floor and they had lovely high ceilings The breakfast is really good for a small hotel Echire butter good jams cold cuts neatly cut and arranged good tea selection hot milk a different fresh tart each day all quite refined The complimentary tea coffee and tart in the afternoon was a real plus Small details make the difference Wifi is fast and no need to re sign in throughout the stay which is great

203775,La Maison Favart, Room was small but this is a city centre hotel so that s to be expected and it was big enough for a weekend Couldn t find fault in anything , Excellent staff very friendly A very classy small boutique hotel in a good location 
203776,La Maison Favart,No Negative, Loved the decor service and great location This is a lovely quirky boutique hotel within 15 minutes of the Louvre close to the Metro and plenty of excellent restaurants 
203777,La Maison Favart, Pool closes early Carpet was stained Towel warmer missing a piece No breakfast included No iced tap water in the evenings Room service food was truly terrible penne Didn t feel like a luxury hotel , Pool is amazing Rooms are nice love the windows Bed hurt my back by the 3rd night and comforter is not luxurious at all Honesty bar is good Michel was great 
203778,La Maison Favart,No Negative, Went with a girlfriend who was visiting from the states The customer service provided from the staff was one of the best I ve ever experienced We were given information for all kinds of things an outstanding high end restaurant the address to an English bookstore hours to the Jimmy Choo store storing boob milk I was pumping storing my milk in the fridge but on the last day our train wasn t leaving until the late afternoon and then when we came back I wanted to pump one last time before boarding the train but the spacious public bathrooms at the hotel didn t have any plug ins so when I told the concierge he set me up in an actual room for privacy and comfort Now if that isn t service I have no idea what is My husband found the hotel and did all the research so he set it up for us Now I understand why they are rated so high 
203779,La Maison Favart, Location was just typical Paris side street , Gorgeous hotel near Opera w stunning indoor pool and gym beautifully appointed and decent sized rooms we got a 2 bedroom duplex petite maison fantastic breakfast and very kind and helpful staff Location is just typical Paris but close to metro lines and not too far walk from shopping air conditioned So really a gem interior and amenities high 4 5 star Would definitely recommend
