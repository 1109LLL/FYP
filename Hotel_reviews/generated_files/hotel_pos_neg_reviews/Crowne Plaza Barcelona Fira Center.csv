279688,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, Breakfast was terrible Cold plates led to cold bacon eggs and sausages More staff is needed I was fed up waiting for food trays to be replenished ,No Positive
279689,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, Never thought that I would have to pay extra to use the pool My daughter was not able to use it One you have to pay extra to use the pool Second your payment to use the hotel pool is only for adult usage Breakfast not the most appealing and tasteful We were seated at the restaurant and while getting our food the same host seated another family at our table I had to move our drinks to another table and was extremely upset Infact my daughter was eating and this host sat this family at our table ,No Positive
279690,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, Only one very slow coffee machine serving two cups at breakfast that either jammed on one side or ran out of water at least every morning and wasn t monitored closely enough , Our room was comfortable and quiet It was close to the Olympic Stadium for the concert our daughter was attending and an easy safe walking distance The A level lounge where we could have tapas and a glass of wine was most appreciated after a long and hot day of touring as were the very knowledgeable and helpful staff who manned it during our stay 
279691,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, Might be slightly far off from the centre if that s what you re looking to explore , This hotel is located in Fira which might be considered to be slightly far off from the centre itself which is Las Ramblas I only stayed here for a night and loved exploring everything they had in the area The Magic Fountain was a 5 minute walk from the property and so were many sights you would love to walk around The Arenas mall was also just a 10 minute walk great to grab a bite to eat or to shop 
279692,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, Long queue for checkin same for checkout as well had to wait for 10 15 minutes , Overall good facilities and well maintained Rooms were spacious with large television Breakfast spread was decent 
279693,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, The outdoors pool was not available yet only pool in spa but children not admitted , The rooms are very comfortable and clean and the staff very polite and helpful It is located very close to tourist landmarks Placa Espanya Art museum Poble Espanyol Parc de Montjuic Easy commute to the rest of the city 
279694,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, Making reservation for the hotel via Booking com was a complete mess We ended up paying extra 30 on arrival on top of already paid price Booking com staff very unhelpful disorganised and inexperienced in dealing with issues on guests arrivals ,No Positive
279695,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, We stayed in a suite and altho comfortable the colours were rather sombre in the Catalan way It was more like a office suite albeit a comfortable one , The TVs were large and thank goodness they had the Eurosport channel so we could watch the televised ski racing Breakfast was excellent and the staff very helpful and friendly 
279696,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, Some pillows were bit uncomfortable but overall nothing to compliant about , Location friendly staff interior design breakfast and room service dining 
279697,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, Some pillows were bit uncomfortable but overall nothing to complaint about , Location friendly staff interior design breakfast and room service dining 
279698,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, Pillows Few pillows are bit uncomfortable overall nothing to complaint about , Location friendly staff interior design Breakfast and room service dining 
279699,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, The quality and choice of the food is not great the interpretation of italian pasta was below average , The room 611 was specifically chosen by the staff so that we can enjoy the NYE celebration from the room Excellent though limited view of the fountain and firework The bathroom is a delight to enjoy 
279700,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, Location was big put off its quite far 15 mins walk one side from closest tram stop metro bus stop to center of the city Its very big let down if you do not intend to take car everywhere Very long walk with young kids to anywhere Breakfast though good but its always same which gets very boring , Hotel staff and over all comfort including room size
279701,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, That we wait for the room until 3pm then when we get there the room that we got is ready for family so the luggage staff have to close it , Not so clean the room and so slow to check in
279702,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, Pillows were hard as a rock The Spa don t waste your money The breakfast was good too but keep the salt and pepper shakers filled Also they start to clear the restaurant too soon before breakfast is officially over limiting food selection and places to sit It was also very distracting while we were trying to eat It made us feel like we were being rushed out , The rooms were very nice
279703,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, The location was perfect for the conference I attended but not so convenient for shopping The taxis were not so expensive however , The executive lounge was great Fantastic breakfasts especially 
279704,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, I asked for sparkling wine m strawberries and chocolates package on arrival as a surprise for my wife but it was not carried out Very dissatisfied Also the fact you are expected to pay for the use of the pool is an extra that should not be there I find on top of the price it s extortionate , The restaurant staff very friendly looked after us well Reception very good as well
279705,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, I was double charged I had prepaid the room but when I got my credit card statement noticed I was charged again Trying to get a credit as we speak , Location was excellent People were very helpful and courteous

279708,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, The area is not very exciting Mainly a residential area which means it is low on tourists but also short of cafes restaurants Unless you are interested in Barcelona s efforts to get on the world stage it may not interest everyone , Comfortable bed Close to Mohtjuic Park which is where the MNAC gallery and Fondacio Joan Miro It is also close to both the site of the 1992 Olympic Games and the 1929 World s Fair The Park itself is very nice if hilly Very close to Sants railway station

279712,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, If you are not here for a convention at the Fira then the location has little to offer Restaurants in walking distance are mediocre at best I walked for 1 hour through the neighborhood and didn t find anything appealing I ended up at the hotel restaurant If you are not accustomed to the Spanish meal times here is the next surprise The hotel restaurant opens for dinner at 7 30 PM and for breakfast at 7 00 AM Both is not very convenient if you have an early start i e flying back to the US early morning Breakfast is outstanding though Front desk staff was very friendly but relatively slow Due to a rugby tournament I paid a hefty 500 per night , Its a very comfortable modern hotel The rooms are large very clean again modern The hotel is located in a quiet street very close to the Fira If you are here for a convention at the Fira it is a great location 
279713,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, Room service was not good they did not provide us the bath and shower set on the second day we had to ask for it There was only one slipper in the room again we have to ask for another one , Room was good 
279714,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, Well it is a bit off the beaten track but that was not really a problem , The comfort of the rooms with attention to detail baths have handrails Most European hotels have very unsafe baths but this is very safe Shower stall had antislip safety guard on floor Beautiful full length mirror in bedroom Coffee maker in room Really the list goes on Someone did a lot of listening to guests needs The bathroom is awesome Huge cupboards Breakfast was simply amazing Everything you could want and more Even Oriental dishes

279725,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, A four stars hotel should have some hairdryers available as the ones in the room are not suitable for long hair Too many children at breakfast definitely too loud , Nice stay rooms are big and have all comfort Hotel also as all you could need from gym to spa to business centre Close to metro station

279734,Crowne Plaza Barcelona Fira Center, Breakfast was the same each day no variety and not enough choice for vegetarians Certain things were available on request but we weren t aware of this need more transparency On the first occasion someone should talk us through everything eg how to use the toaster Also not happy with the separate breakfast and car parking charges should be included as a given for such a top brand hotel and the price that you charge Furthermore one of our rooms hadn t been cleaned before we entered , Great location staff were very helpful and friendly
