163653,Eccleston Square Hotel, The breakfast service was an utter joke At 14 per head we had to ask for milk juice ran out of apple plates and fruit salad The service appeared disorganized and what we got was very poor value for money ,No Positive
163654,Eccleston Square Hotel, Rooms are rather small the medium sized room we booked would be the minimum for most western travellers for a 5 star hotel techy rooms are nice but panels lighting up at night without noticable reason might disturb some whilst getting to sleep Staff was very friendly and helpful but seemed overwhelmed in some situations all in all it is tiny issues that separate this hotel from a true luxury hotel, Perfect Location quiet spot just in the middle of city very nice ambiance helpful and friendly staff well designed ambiance access to big and beautiful private garden included Cozy breakfast area
163655,Eccleston Square Hotel, Leaving, Queen room we stayed in was a fabulous use of the space yes this type of room is quite bijou but they do make this clear at the outset Fantastic location but don t tell too many people about this secret 
163656,Eccleston Square Hotel, Difficulty in locating my booking Problem with correct name , Very comfortable hotel but staff had difficulty locating my booking and never got my name right 
163657,Eccleston Square Hotel, Room size even in the delux double was tiny There was little signal in the room for phone calls and the handy gadget they supply was having technical glitches The staff where forgetful and not very well informed Over all this place is trying unsuccessfully to be something it s not I found it to be a waste of time and money and wouldn t stay again , Location was good 
163658,Eccleston Square Hotel, The room description was totally misleading The room WAS TINY barely at a squeeze was there room to get around the bed and no other space at all in the room not even space to put a suitcase The wardrobe and cupboards were pathetic in space and layout There was no complementary tea in the room and ordering using the mind boiling i pad system was just ridiculously complicated and with no way of knowing if you order had gone through eventually resorted to using the telephone when the tea tray arrived there was not even a table or place to put it other than using the bed A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT and very misleading especially for the price , The Hotel was around the back southside of Victoria Coach Station whilst the staff were very welcoming and generally helpful 
163659,Eccleston Square Hotel,No Negative, Loved all of the modern amenities available in the room Bed was very comfy Very quiet safe and central neighbourhood Friendly and helpful staff Very cozy boutique like atmosphere 
163660,Eccleston Square Hotel, The room was very small only just enough room to navigate around the bed and nowhere to really put bags etc For the price I expect more and not to mention that the pricey breakfast was also not included , The bed was huge and very very comfortable and the vibration option was a lot of fun 
163661,Eccleston Square Hotel, Because we came at a strange time of year April so spring into summer the hotel which aims to be fully eco had not transferred into summer ops yet This meant we couldn t use the aircon unit in the room to regulate the temperature nor open a window and ended up feeling quite hot as a result especially after a shower But since we weren t spending our days indoors this was a minor inconvenience ,No Positive
163662,Eccleston Square Hotel, Horrid tiny room awful massage bed that makes more noise than anything hotel has spent a fortune on all all the latest gagets but lacks comfort space Over priced with little in return charged you for dirty laundry bag Was kept waiting at reception at check in Got told complimentry bar only to be charged on debit card when left Requested balcony at booking having spent over 280 a night without even breakfast Through my experience of having stayed in top nationwide hotels worldwide this is one of the most worst Dont bother to complain the management put themselves Right first you as a customer second ,No Positive
163663,Eccleston Square Hotel, Our room was very small in fact too small for us when we arrive in the evening we found out that there was no on site chef in the evenings , Very helpful staff and very high tech 
163664,Eccleston Square Hotel, The room s size was okay but having to side shuffle around the bed to get to the wardrobe and the window side of the bed wasn t ideal Slightly awkward and disappointing as previously I had stayed in a lower spec room which didn t have these space issues , The gadgets in the room are a nice touch once you get to know them Added to the fun 
163665,Eccleston Square Hotel, On the first night we checked in to our room and turned the bedsheets down we found a big brown stain on the white bed sheets , The staff was extremely helpful and responsive to our needs and requests On our first night at the hotel we found a stain on the bed sheet We immediately reported this to the front desk manager who did everything in his capacity he changed out the sheet himself to make sure we did not have to sleep on a dirty bed sheet that night The next day we were moved to a different room that not only had clean bedding but also more square footage 
163666,Eccleston Square Hotel, When spending a fortune on decor ensure the guy hanging the wall paper understands what a repeating pattern is most annoying to see not one length matched on the staircase , The most amazing shower ever with smart glass for sharing the experience the pair of us enjoyed ourselves immensely
163667,Eccleston Square Hotel, I didn t dislike anything at all , It was my birthday weekend away and they surprised me with a birthday card an lots of little deserts on a slate with happy birthday written on it It was amazing 
163668,Eccleston Square Hotel,No Negative, The room was very clean and chic The black out blind was a great addition and along with the fabulously comfy bed ensured a great nights sleep We loved the high tech details in the room very 007 The staff were attentive but not intrusive There wasn t anything that we disliked and we would definitely re visit the hotel again 
163669,Eccleston Square Hotel, I was extremley disappointed with the members of staff who had not lived up to the grandure of this exquisite building It started from the moment when my partner and I walked in from the reaction of the staff member who supposedly greeted us felt a vibe instantly and that we did not fit the profile of the cliental that he is acustom to He then proceeded to ask regarding the settllement of the bill Astonished by this question asked more or less straight away whether I would be using the card which the room was prebooked with I will not use names but this member of staff is aware of who he is and that his conduct was appalling it could of possibly ruined my celebrations He stated that another member of staff will come up to the appartment and demonstrate how to use the gadgets in the room with in the next 5 minutes We had allowed 20 minutes to pass as we getting ready for dinner reservations It resulted to my partner going back down to reception to be told that it was change over and there is no one to assist as they were busy someone will show us when we returned back to the hotel My partner who clearly pointed out that this was not feasible as we would be coming back the early hours of the morning wished not to be disturbed to be shown at that time the functions Returned back to the hotel whereby a member of staff gave a brief outline how to use the TV I had asked is there anything else to be made aware off response no it was not mentioned regarding the phone benefits that I read up on their site as a feature not described or even spoken off with making free calls locally and selected international lines Advised just dial 9 for outside line if required reception I had hoped that the ordeal would have stopped but it continued to the point of the breakfast order could not be physically taken down by the member of night staff jwho referrred to just update on the Ipad , Enchanting room that offered high tech virtual reality with functioning the lighting and other electrical services Bonus with having a balcony lit with fairies lights made the moment that more special for celebrating my birthday over looking the refines of the square tranquility
163670,Eccleston Square Hotel, I must say that I had very high expectations about this hotel and this stay was one of my most disappointing accommodation experiences Most King rooms are so small you can not even open your suitcase properly it is impossible to open a window without calling someone from maintenance or even to prepare your own cup of tea for some reason you need to use an ipad located in the room to have them prepare one and bring it to you Also they have different size rooms for the exact same price of the same room type so when you book try to ask for the larger rooms if you need some space front desk manager was only kind upon my leaving and in general it felt like almost everything that could have gone wrong went wrong For such a techy hotel I found the fact that there were no indicators on the shower faucets very odd as well since there were 4 of them and it was a riddle to figure out how to get hot water for a shower I ve stayed in less fancy much better and friendlier hotels in this area , The bed and pillows were very very comfortable very good wifi connection elevators were pretty quick
163671,Eccleston Square Hotel, The queen room is too small I recommend to book a king standard room , The staff is very nice and helpful The location is superb Victoria Station is nearby I will definitely come back 
163672,Eccleston Square Hotel, Bigger Room and a bath in the room would have been nice, Good location near to Victoria Station Nice Terrace in room 103 good cooked breakfast Lovely Boutique hotel Staff professional and friendly 
163673,Eccleston Square Hotel, It was a bit too high tech the iPad kept making noises in the night and as a couple with two large suitcases the room was far too small , High tech room comfy bed great location 
163674,Eccleston Square Hotel, The view from the room Next time will ask for a room with a better view of the city , The location was excellent Three blocks from Victoria Station The bed was comfortable and the amenities in the room were above average The room was small but perfect for just myself Loved the fact that there was a mobile in the room that one can use with data to help with navigating around the city Plus the Ipad concierge located bedside for any requests to the front desk 
163675,Eccleston Square Hotel, Booked standard king room but it was the smallest hotel room I ever stayed There was hardly any room around the bed tiny storage space The bathroom of this size I only seen on the aeroplanes or boats Toilet was dirty Breakfast buffet was limited served with terrible coffee There was a Nespresso machine in the room I wonder why not upgrade your breakfast room coffee machine , Location was ok 
163676,Eccleston Square Hotel, We would have like breakfast but found it a bit pricey , The bed was amazing and so was the ipad touches to order fresh We were very relaxed one of the best hotels we ve stayed in location amazing
163677,Eccleston Square Hotel, The Lack of Transparancy about the Description of each Type of Room The description of the room King Superior should be oriented to the front with or without a balcony and should have a desk to work did t correspond to the room I got 307 My suspiscious is that the room I got 307 is not a King Superior but just a King Standard and the Prices, The personnel mainly Lisa and Ol via The technology and the fact that is anti allergic
163678,Eccleston Square Hotel, Food offering is not satisfactory beyond breakfast While room is cleaned well during the day the refilling of complementaries not always taken care of i e no sugar refil also rooms should be checked every day to ensure that lightbulbs all working window door knob functions and remote control has battery Part of running the hotel should include some supervision that all amenities are working all the time , Normally dislike hotels in the VS area as they are often slummy Not this one Liked the gizmos in the room nice lighting huge tv power shower Having a room with balcony helped make the tiny room with big bed seem larger 
163679,Eccleston Square Hotel, It s not that close to Victoria train station if you have a suitcase with you Rooms are small and the shower bathroom was very small would not recommend for an extended stay High tech room is great but they cast a lot of light at night , Nice high tech room and friendly staff The loaner phone was handy but not a great phone a loaner sim card would be better 
163680,Eccleston Square Hotel, Rather basic mini bar Could do with small wine spirit selection Desk chairs not ideal for working more pretty than practical , Great location a short walk from Victoria station Underground Good shower well kitted out with L occotaine products Fast reliable Wifi 
163681,Eccleston Square Hotel, Room size of a box supposedly upgraded twice to their largest room Cleanliness poor Aircon didn t work Breakfast poorly staffed Pricing Excessive never 5 star 3 star at best If you don t book directly and you have a problem they ll not offer a refund arguing it s nothing to do with them they ll offer a bottle of wine or the excessive 14 for Breakfast, Location 5 minute walk from Victoria Station
163682,Eccleston Square Hotel, I don t know who gave such high value to this hotel I booked it just because I saw the reviews but when I checked in I felt so desperate the room is super small even no room to open our baggage the bathroom door is just 20cm to the bed nothing near the hotel we need to walk like 10 mins to find a small store really disappointed , Nothing 
163683,Eccleston Square Hotel,No Negative, I have stayed here before and the surface was incredible hence why I chose to say here once again Although the room reached our expectations again there were a couple of small glitches our TV didn t work and by the time we got seen there was only one person working the night shift we were far too comfortable to move to another room 
163684,Eccleston Square Hotel, Rooms were way too small Not even a chair only place to put clothes was on the floor Always hot and too noisy to open window , Staff was wonderful Location was good 
163685,Eccleston Square Hotel, The only complaint is that the TV faces the wrong way in the bathroom , Excellent hotel and excellent for breakfast meetings This is now our CEO s favourite and he wants to only stay here when he is in London Top marks 
163686,Eccleston Square Hotel, Their Ipad ordering system breakfast room service didn t work but could still use phone , Extremely comfortable with beautifully finished large modern ensuite
163687,Eccleston Square Hotel, Very very smal rooms and bathrooms Nowhere to sit and relax in hotel or in the room , Good design Very comfortable bed Good location Quiet Nice breakfast 
163688,Eccleston Square Hotel, Couldnt work the lights for a day hahaha, We loved loved how modern and clean in was We also got along great with the fromt desk woman named olivia She was very kind knowledgable and new how to make us feel more confortable I would reccomend this hotel and her service 
163689,Eccleston Square Hotel,No Negative, Absolutely everything The staff were incredible fantastic superb and nothing was to much trouble We felt like James Bond with all the gadgets in the room The bed was the most comfortable bed we have slept on and with my wife constantly suffering with a bad back it did wonders for her Once again I have to compliment the fantastic and wonderful staff once again and can t wait to stay there over and over again and are already thinking about the next time that we stay there 
163690,Eccleston Square Hotel, AC not working or working but not cold enough Probably because we stayed in summer time , The size of the room is quite good The showers are nice too High tech room 
163691,Eccleston Square Hotel, There is nothing not to like trust me , We loved the location quiet but yet with caf s bars and restaurants nearby and so is Victoria station with only two stops to Oxford Circus The hotel itself is a dream magnificent beds and rooms and all staff were eager to assist We ll be back 
163692,Eccleston Square Hotel, No free parking if you travel in car, Great location with easy access to transport and the west end Bed is very comfy Room is equipped with smart home system Minibar prices are reasonable and coffee quality is great 
163693,Eccleston Square Hotel, I m not sure why there is a TV above the WC a bit baffled about the logic of that , The rooms are small but comfortable and very high tech Excellent English breakfast 
163694,Eccleston Square Hotel, Breakfast could have been included at this price but I suppose this is quite standard for London hotels , Great hotel with very friendly and helpful staff who offered an excellent service at all times The room is small but very comfortable The complimentary tea delivered to your room was a bonus as well as the use of an i pad and telephone The best hotel I have stayed at in London and would definitely stay here again 
163695,Eccleston Square Hotel, Nothing , I have been lucky enough to stay in some beautiful hotels in the world and the Eccleston square is definitely going in my top 5 Amazing stay comfortable gadgets are a nice touch 
163696,Eccleston Square Hotel, Found the technology too complicated There was a button and remote for everything From the TV to the blinds All a bit confusing at times , Location was great overlooked a wonderful square and was close to some lovely independent shops 
163697,Eccleston Square Hotel, WOKEN UP IN THE MORNING BY MEMBER OF STAFF WHO DID NOT REALISE THERE WERE GUESTS IN THE ROOM KNOCKING ON THE DOOR FROM HOUSEKEEPING 20 MINS LATER REPORTED TO RECEPTION WHO SAID MANAGER WOULD BE CALLING NO PHONE CALL AS YET , good shower comfortable bed 
163698,Eccleston Square Hotel, The size of the room we booked could have been better and the shower was too small make sure you ask for a bigger room, The staff were very friendly and helpful the bed comfortable pillows nice and soft large TV hot showers and all within walking distance to underground and coach station
163699,Eccleston Square Hotel, We asked to keep the room for a while longer because of a night flight and instead of charging us a half day as we expected the hotel said it is their policy to charge a full day if you need to keep the room anytime after 4PM, The hotel is very well decorated and the room is of a decent size when compared to London standards Each room is set out in a different way and when we asked to change the room assigned to us we were promptly moved to a different room with a much bigger bathroom The hotel is conveniently located at a walking distance from Victoria Station 
163700,Eccleston Square Hotel,No Negative, Location is great Very central only a 15 minute walk to Big Ben London Eye etc and Victoria coach station only 5 minutes away the room was a perfect size and the staff were very friendly and helpful as they held our bags for us throughout the last day overall was perfect 
163701,Eccleston Square Hotel, Lack of storage in room Breakfast , Stylish comfortable if small room Comfy bed Excellent shower Quiet room as requested Friendly staff Location convenient for Victoria Station
163702,Eccleston Square Hotel, Nothing, The gadgets in the room and mini patio plus the overall design of the building It s great for overseas visitors as you are given a mobile phone you can use for data and calls throughout London 
163703,Eccleston Square Hotel,No Negative, Staff always smiling very welcoming Fabulous gardens available to guests Quiet location comfortable beds Our room was upgraded for my birthday cakes were left for us on arrival Very special touch We will definitely return 
163704,Eccleston Square Hotel, it s actually not my favorite part of London i thought I was booking a different location but did it in a hurry the night before That s not the hotel s fault though and if you do have to be near Victoria then this place is fab , The room was great Very small but they have designed it in such a way that it s not important The rooms are superb 
163705,Eccleston Square Hotel, Shower crevices could have been a little cleaner less mildewy, Super comfortable beds more gadgets than you can shake a stick at TV in the bathroom is a winner and brilliant quiet location Really close to the station museums and underground 
163706,Eccleston Square Hotel, Nothing It was better than perfect , Incredibly friendly helpful staff luxurious bed and facilities The shower has 3 separate jets and is so refreshing Massive tv free pots of tea Great hotel 
163707,Eccleston Square Hotel, The room was cramped to large a bed for the size of the room the bed was over rated The air conditioning did not function on my second night The TV system was over complicated , The hotel was in an excellent position for my visit the staff were very helpful and very polite The hotel was very clean and with modern facilities 
163708,Eccleston Square Hotel, Bedrooms and bathrooms extremely small and no baths available throughout the hotel whatever category room you booked , Comfortable adjustable beds room service tea free of charge parking on site 
163709,Eccleston Square Hotel, Nothing it was perfect , Beautiful hotel Wonderfully decorated absolute luxury Awesome technology Had the best shower of my life at this hotel Staff went above and beyond 
163710,Eccleston Square Hotel, The only thing that could have made it better was the bed was very comfortable but the pillows were shocking Thats my only minor gripe from an excellent stay I would thoroughly recommend, Loved the customer service at reception the room was modern with lots of added comfort extras and breakfast was very pleasant
163711,Eccleston Square Hotel, Minor but would be nice to check in a bit earlier, The technology of the hotel the view the staff the shower facilities the bed everything My favourite hotel
163712,Eccleston Square Hotel, I paid 30 for breakfast for myself and my boyfriend but because I was running the marathon we were given a runners breakfast this turned out to be a sandwich I asked for toast because realistically runners don t eat ham and cheese sandwiches before a race a banana and coffee No water despite asking A bit miffed that it cost me so much I could have brought all of that from home , Beautiful room with lots of fun gadgets
163713,Eccleston Square Hotel, Although room and shower were very small the clever use of storage space made it fine for a short stay , The bed was comfy with various settings including massage Top floor with small window but overlooked the square The area was quiet despite being close to Victoria Station 
163714,Eccleston Square Hotel, Room was small and not good value for money Although advertised as a five star hotel it skimped on basics There were no water glasses tissues and not enough room to swing a cat We couldn t get the air conditioning to work Overall it was disappointing and there are better alternatives nearby , Staff were friendly and efficient 
163715,Eccleston Square Hotel, Not much but if being picky the room was on the cosy side , The room was compact but more than adequate very hi tech and an extremely comfortable bed This is a first class hotel in an ideal location 
163716,Eccleston Square Hotel, I found a few small touches overdone and perhaps unnecessary The in house Tapas place is adequate but considering you are in the epicentre of good food places it certainly wouldn t stand out enough to stay in for dinner , This is a great small hotel with some well thought out details It is based in a great location 5 minutes walk from Victoria Station and therefore not far from Piccadily and Green Park on one side and South Kensington and Knightsbridge on the other A residential road so noise is to a minimum and in a road full of B Bs this hotel is defs a gem Great cocktails and super friendly and professional staff 
163717,Eccleston Square Hotel, Modern gadgets used in the hotel were aged and at times simply did not function We had problems with both the blind in the room and the air conditioning Although the size was fine the slanted ceiling of our room on the 5th floor made our stay difficult for two tall individuals I also received emails from the hotel intended for other guests which was slightly unprofessional , Eccleston Square is a great location very close to Victoria station and conveniently close to the Chelsea area 
163718,Eccleston Square Hotel,No Negative, Great location very easy to find and close to the tube Beautiful hotel room a lot more than I expected Amazing technology we were having a great time working out what button did what All round great experience 
163719,Eccleston Square Hotel, We had dirty towels in our room and a hair on one of the robes We ate in the restaurant and the food was a bit strange the starter wasn t what it said on the menu so I sent it back and then it came out as it should have with all the right ingredients which is quite odd Wonder why they didn t give me that in the first place , The staff were amazing so friendly and polite Great location and nice modern rooms
163720,Eccleston Square Hotel, Only thing that obviously cant be helped room could have been bigger, First impressions fab Very clean and modern Lots of gadgets in room Fantastic bed and shower
163721,Eccleston Square Hotel, Room and corridors a little small for very pregnant person like myself Breakfast had potential to be great but just wasn t up to scratch , Tea service 
163722,Eccleston Square Hotel, The size of the single rooms can not possibly fit two people It s incredibly small and extremely difficult to walk and move around There was no room to store the luggage in order to use it Also it s a bit noisy if anyone tries to walk the hallways the entire floor makes a sound , The staff was very helpful and I liked how the rooms were high tech The design is also beautiful a modern touch in an English town 
163723,Eccleston Square Hotel, Limited facilities The bathroom was poorly lit and small , The staff at the hotel were excellent They were helpful and responsive Much better than some established five star hotel chains 
163724,Eccleston Square Hotel, Too many gadgets in the room which didn t work properly Linen a bit below the quality you would expect from a 5 star hotel , Good location Nice staff Overall nice place
