312809,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, The breakfast was egregiously expensive for very little 8 euro for orange juice The light switches didn t work for some of the facilities Ice was hard to come by , The staff were really lovely and very helpful The hotel is well located though difficult to get to by taxi as the roads are very narrow The towels are soft 
312810,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Cant fault it, Beautiful boutique hotel located in an excellent and stunning part of Barcelona I would recommend it to friends family and colleagues alike for leisure or business and I personally look forward to staying there again in the future 
312811,Mercer Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, One of the best hotels I have stayed at and not only in Barcelona Excellent staff great design Rooms are compact but beautifully arranged with wonderful high ceilings Truly a 5 hotel 
312812,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, The pool is small and can get a little crowded if there are families of children Perfectly adequate for a quick dip and the garden surrounding it is lovely but don t expect to be able to swim , An oasis of calm in the most interesting part of the city the Mercer is elegant comfortable and beautifully designed The staff are uniformly wonderful giving a friendly and personal service at all times and the food is excellent Quite simply the best hotel we ve ever stayed in 
312813,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Eggs florentine were cold both times I had it , The service was a cut above It s not always that a boutique hotel can give such good personable service The hotel itself is just stunning and we felt extremely welcome It s also perfectly situated in the Gothic quarters and the staff know all the best places for whatever it is you want to do 
312814,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, The room furnishings could ve been more comfortable The room was an ample size and would have benefitted from comfortable chairs or a sofa , The 2 concierge s were fantastic Great restaurant recommendations they took care of everything during our stay The bar and restaurant are intimate and lovely We had an excellent dinner one night at the restaurant very good service 
312815,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, In retrospect I would not advise having a cab pick you up at the hotel The streets are really too narrow and passage is slow Carrer Laietana is a major road just a couple of short blocks away even with luggage I d advise walking over there , Truly impressive property built on top of Roman ruins quite visible in sections The architecture is a blend of medieval arches paintings spanning several centuries and modern design from the noted architect Rafael Moneo The rooms were spacious and elegantly furnished ours had a modest balcony facing a narrow street in the Barrio Gotico The location is perfect relatively quiet yet a short walk from all the centers of activity The staff is extraordinarily helpful and engaged 
312816,Mercer Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, The staff was exceptional Small but comfortable room Outstanding location I would highly recommend but be aware of 2 things 1 we needed to arrange private transfer as the taxi s don t want to or can t navigate the small roads It with a private transfer through the hotel they were able to connect with the hotel and meet us at the bottom of the hill with luggage cart the concierges were outstanding and coordinated everything perfectly 2 the rooms are very dark poor lighting But honestly the staff service beautiful in room extras robe slippers etc for this small hotel far surpass any brand name 
312817,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Nothing, Really great staff extremely friendly welcoming and helpful Really well designed hotel modern design in classical setting Fantastic tapas Great location for walking to lots of different areas
312818,Mercer Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, incredible quality of staff who attended to every single detail the complimentary beverages in room were an excellent bonus the room design decor and ambiance was tranquil and pleasant an exceptional stay 
312819,Mercer Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, The accommodations are spectacular the restaurant amazing and the staff were the friendliest most helpful courteous of any 5 start hotel in which we stayed during our travels Can t say enough about how pleasant our stay was BRAVO MERCER 
312820,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, We had issues with the AC fan not working on our first night and had to be switched to another room the next day The air as warm and stale all night It was very uncomfortable We had just arrived after 14 hours of flying I couldn t get comdortable And the pillows were overstuffed and firm I was struggling and regretting my 300 Euro a night stay at that point The staff upgraded our room the next two nights for free which was a nice gesture The next room had a heavy glass shower door that kept coming off the tracks which was scary as well as anexpresso maker that had functionality issues The ceiling in both room were extremely thin and we had very noisy guests above us the second and third nights of or stay One guest was much of the night walking in heels and dropping things on the floor right over our bed and the other guest was up incredibly early to check out I was kept awake through it all I slept poorly all 3 nights of my stay which is really my only negative remark An upscale hotel should be a sanctuary to rest and refresh That certainly didn t happen during my stay , Location and breakfast staff were great Breakfast is very expensive however but it s an excellent treat 
312821,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, taxi drivers don t take you to hotel directly leaver far away when you have to drag bags Hotel arranges taxis right in from of the hotel While booking they should mention that please call up hotel to give instructions to taxi driver or so , location concierges 
312822,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, As the hotel is small it didn t have a gym which my daughter would have liked It would have been perfect if the Mercer could have special arrangements whereby guests could use a gym somewhere else Also we found the hotel tapas bar to be a little disappointing as it lacked atmosphere , The best things about the hotel were the fantastic location in the Gothic Quarter the excellent high standard of the rooms and the staff who were all lovely and friendly The two concierges in particular were very helpful about all sorts of things from booking restaurants to giving advice and practical help when my daughter was taken ill Thank you to all the staff you are a credit to this hotel 
312823,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, The option of a bit more lighting in the bedroom would have been useful , Staff were always very friendly and helpful with any request The bedroom was kept clean and replenished with a discreet turn down service The food was superb both at breakfast and throughout the day Lovely intimate hotel highly recommended Once you got your bearings the location was ideal for many attractions and to be part of the buzz of the gothic quarter although once inside the hotel it was very calm and quiet so you were never disturbed by the festivals The nearest metro station is only a very short walk away in order to visit those attractions further afield We were able to reach La Sagrada Familia very quickly from the location of this hotel 
312824,Mercer Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Everything was amazing The staff are the best I ve ever seen in all my travels They were very nice and helpful The breakfast was outstanding I would defenitely recommend Mercer Hotel Barcelona 
312825,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, i can t think of one, the staff were brillant very helpful on how to find our way around Barcelona the breakfast was lovely the cocktail was sensational what an amazing building hotel
312826,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, There is a coffee peculator in the room however there is no provision to make tea which we feel should be included rather than rely on room service , WOW WOW WOW We were treated to a glass of Cava on both our very warm welcome and departure at the Mercer Hotel The Mercer Hotel is steeped in history and is situated in the very picturesque and interesting Gothic district which is the nicest part of Barcelona because of the general atmosphere although Barcelona is lovely wherever you choose to stay The Mercer Hotel is very intimate and the staff are exceptionally friendly professional and helpful and willing to go that extra mile without being asked You should experience at least one meal in the restaurant what a treat 
312827,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, I thought is very overpriced for the standard of accommodation The breakfast was mean too to have to pay a supplement for some items on the menu including bircher muesli was absurd given the expense of the hotel , Location and staff both excellent 
312828,Mercer Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Staff excellent old hotel building modernised graceful elegant small touches Right in heart of old It s Jolt into walls A bit of living history 
312829,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Breakfast expensive but lots of nice cafes around , Comfortable room great staff Good Tapas restaurant great location although taxi drivers do not go there easily 
312830,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, The first taxi driver couldnt find it, The staff were amazingly good friendly and efficient The location was perfect and our room in a Roman Tower was outstanding 
312831,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Service at breakfast was a little inconsistent , Fabulous location The Concierge and reception staff were very helpful and knowledgeable and made us feel very welcome 
312832,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Rooms have almost no natural light but that is the price paid for staying in the Gothic Quarter Courtyard facing rooms might be better in this regard 28 EU Breakfast was a bit excessive The breakfast was lovely but essentially fruit pastries and eggs , The staff were really warm and accommodating Rooftop terrace is lovely Beds are great and decor is very modern and not too Gotov as some of the other luxury hotels are spaces are bright and airy The fact that the building incorporates Roman Ruins is just amazing In many ways world class 
312833,Mercer Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, This hotel is magnificent Located in the bustling Gothic district with great shops and restaurants all around it is a quiet gem in the midst of it all The rooftop pool spa is a great place to unwind after a day of shopping hiking Monjuiic or site seeing The staff are at the ready to help you plan any outing or adventure you seek The service is above and beyond Unforgettable 
312834,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, The location in old town doesn t allow for access by car and bike and even taxi struggle with a drop off Be prepared to carry your bags or make arrangements with the hotel but therefore one is directly in the old part of town in between dozens of restaurants and shops , The staff were super and very helpful the property is extremely well maintained and designed They made me a Spanish interpretation of a burger a burger was not on the menu as I was tired of tapas after a week in Spain and it was phenomenal 
312835,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Only negative is temperature of plunge pool Too cold to dip at night Difficult for a taxi to drive directly to hotel entrance as its in heart of the Gotic, The concierge was wonderful They saw it was my birthday and had beautiful surprises in the room upon arrival The bed was SO COMFY we felt so relaxed The terrace is a great oasis for a quiet break really wonderful staff all around 
312836,Mercer Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, I booked this as a last minute surprise for the final night of our stay on what felt like a very epic adventure around Europe It was myself and my partners Honeymoon and and we had been backpacking for a fortnight Nimes Toulouse Carcassonne and last but not least Barcelona so this was a real treat And oh my what a treat it was We arrived around 11am check in is 3pm in the centre of Le Gothic a beautiful part of Barcelona to very friendly staff who took are bags and handed us a glass of something sparkly while wishing us a very happy honeymoon We asked if we could wait by the pool until our room was ready to which there was no trouble at all We sipped on beautiful fruit cocktails on a stunning empty roof terrace with a stunning pool looking at the roof tops and blue sky of a stunning city that we love And relaxed like we never knew we could Our room was ready soon after that 12 30 We loved the old stone walls mixed with the modern sleek design and the amazingly large bed with beautiful rose petals scattered around it and with complementary everything everywhere Then a surprising knock at the door with desserts and champagne We really did feel so spoiled and fussed We had lunch at the Bistro and it was so stunning we ended up having dinner there too Breakfast was also a real treat After traveling for so long it was lovely to spend our last day in real luxury and bliss Thankyou so much and we will definitely be back again hopefully every anniversary 
312837,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, That we had to leave , We were on our mini moon my 30th and we were looked after so well We had been to Barce before so we just got to relax and we were spoilt A bottle of cava on arrival with a yummy tart and the same for my birthday Cocktails yummy food location is amazing and Roof terrace and pool is great when it is so hot And also free marshmallows at reception 
312838,Mercer Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, The staff was EXCELLENT and the bed was super comfy Location of our room not that great our view was of lower income housing and hanging laundry but besides that the room was great The outlet in the bathroom for the hairdryer needs some work because the plug kept falling out while I blew my hair dry which was rather annoying But location staff breakfast and room overall were GREAT 
312839,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Rooms were a little small and bathroom was almost non existent , Loved the location and the hotel was beautiful and staff were very friendly and helpful 
312840,Mercer Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, One of the best hotels we have stayed in The Concierge was most obliging A drink and tapas at the roof top bar was a relaxing way to finish a busy day of sightseeing Mercer is a quiet stylish oasis in the miiddle of bustling Barcelona
312841,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, BATHROOM WITHOUT DOOR BASIN JUST BEHIND THE HEADBOARD THIN WOOD WALLS WATER LEVEL POOL ONLY KNEE LENGHT DANGEROUS NEIGHBORHOOD AT NIGHT DARK STREETS USED AS BATHROOMS , BREAKFAST ALTHOUGH EXPENSIVE 
312842,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Pool on roof terrace is really exceptionally small , Excellent location and helpful staff giving excellent guidance on restaurant options and places to visit 
312843,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Only thing is price is too high in my opinion Although room service and location ate all 5 stars quality i feel it s expensive for a hotel that do not have the extra facilities 5 star hotels have Taxis were not willing to go to the tiny street where the hotel is , Fantastic luxury boutique hotel best staff i had in 10 years of visiting Barcelona Location is great for cafes shopping restaurants and sight seeing Breakfast was great and they catered to my gluten free needs although i didnt notify them in advance 
312844,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Noise of the central inside sitting area raises up and into rooms above, Location and decor History of the property well worth asking staff to show you the historical value
312845,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Bed and pillows Comfort didn t match quality of hotel Pillows were flat after putting your head down to sleep , Superb location and super staff 
312846,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, The price of the gin and tonics Otherwise there was really nothing to dislike at all , Very comfy bed and pillows Superb breakfast though poached eggs a little too runny and friendly and efficient service
312847,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Food was very good but not worth the silly cost breakfast on a lovely terrace served on lovely china but food nothing special The affiliated tapas bar adjacent was excellent however , The staff was one of the best we have ever experienced in helpfulness friendliness and going above and beyond to make our trip incredible The location was ideal and the building both ancient and modern gorgeous 
312848,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Everything was perfect however one small thing that I did not like was that they heavily perfume the common areas I really dislike that in any hotel that does that , Staff were amazingly kind helpful and attentive The hotel s design and fit and finish are perfect 
312849,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Small point but extremely uncomfortable toilet seats , Beautiful hotel staff extremely welcoming and helpful Location fantastic for access to all the main sights in Barcelona Extremely quiet despite being so central Rooftop cocktail bar and pool great to come home to after busy day of sightseeing We tried food in main restaurant tapas bar and breakfast all excellent 
312850,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Open bathrooms may not appeal to everyone But still immaculate well set out and well equipped, Le Bouchon cafe at the front of the hotel food comes from the same kitchen as the signature restaurant inside the hotel and the food is brilliant 
312851,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Wish that breakfast was included in the room rate as at EUR34 per person it seems a bit much However we found lots of good options nearby , Great location in the Gothic Quarter away from the busy streets Hotel is beautifully minimally decorated on roman ruins The staff are very helpful and provided great tips for what to see and places to eat 
312852,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Lack or organisation from staff and some who need training especially for a 5 hotel which I believe is overrated for what you get for the price breakfast is a mess and confusing with an abundance of chocolate and lack of choice to what breakfast should be very strange and very very expensive for what you get Service generally very slow and staff forgetful of orders 16 for 2 small glasses of orange juice for breakfast the hotel needs to make many changes to hold its 5 status I wouldn t go back However the cleanliness is outstanding and some staff are really nice Need to turn down the air fresheners in the hotel as its so overpowering it makes you want to run to your room to escape the potent stench ,No Positive
312853,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, The price , Very friendly and helpful staff Excellent central location but still peaceful High standards of cleanliness and comfort Slept well there 
312854,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, The fancy restaurant at dinner wasn t good Food not hot served in bizarre fashion note it s not a good thing for the waiter to put food in one s mouth and not impressive Prefer to have walls on bathrooms , Great breakfasts superb staff esp the concierge nice bar and terrific bistro Beds comfy 
312855,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Bed a bit lumpy and room was small even cramped for a five star hotel The shower also was small and they really should put in a few useful shelves for shower items Not even a coffee maker Not a USA five star for the room , The service was outstanding and the location perfect with easy walking to many sites Beautiful hotel architecturally very interesting Climate control excellent 
312856,Mercer Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, We appreciated the very helpful concierge staff They were extremely accommodating and provided excellent advice The bathroom was well designed The rooftop terrace was beautiful They were very responsive to our requests before we arrived 
312857,Mercer Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, The staff were friendly and welcoming always aiming to please Very comfortable beds and spacious room Interesting and historical building tastefully restored Perfect situation in Barcelona to explore and find excellent restaurants in the vicinity 
312858,Mercer Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, It was peaceful and discreet near shops restaurants and the metro The staff were charming and attentive everything of top quality and well designed We enjoyed relaxing on the roof terrace in the afternoon Didn t try the restaurant but the tapas bar was handy 
312859,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Only issue is that most taxis won t take you to the front door not an issue for us and part of the charm of the narrow streets of the gothic area , A perfect stylish boutique hotel to treat my wife for her 40th birthday The staff were exceptional champagne on arrival more plus cake for my wife s birthday and so many good ideas from concierge The junior suite was big and stylish with chaise longue and enormous four poster bed 
312860,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Over spraying with air freshener which was overpowering staff addressed it quickly in our room but corridors were still drenched No tea coffee facilities in the room I was told it s not the Spanish way but if I d told them they would have provided some which is fair enough , Hotel is very peaceful yet couldn t be better located in the heart of the old city Easy to walk everywhere you want to Lovely room helpful staff and good if expensive breakfast
312861,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Nothing It was a lovely stay , The service was as good as anywhere we have been before We were offered a complimentary drink on arrival and taken on a short tour of the premises by the concierge including to the hotel library which is set in ancient Roman walls It was my boyfriend s birthday and the hotel surprised us having a bottle of cava and ice bucket set up in the room with a personalised note encouraging us to enjoy our stay The room was exquisitely decorated and had a feel of genuine luxury 
312862,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Could do with a nespresso coffee machine in the room please , A fabulous and charming little gem nestled in the old part of town Probably the best staff we have ever encountered anywhere in the world they genuinely cared that our stay was the best it possibly could be 
312863,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Nothing, Location is really unique In a secluded lane in the gothic region Great ambience very special for a quiet holiday Humble and yet a touch of class I have being to many holidays in Europe My stay at the Mercer and the surrounding make it unique and very memorable 
312864,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, The cab from the airport would not go down the old cobblestone streets and left us outside the old city to negotiate our way to the hotel with five pieces of luggage Leaving was a breeze because the hotel uses cabs that go that way all the time , Absoutely wonderful hotel Built on the ruins and the walls it incorporates part of the 14th century with the most modern materials and design It is exquisite The staff is fantastic most especially Joan Manel He single handedly helped in every aspect of our stay 
312865,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, There were a couple of small niggles all nit picking but things I expect to be sorted in a hotel of this calibre The toilet roll holder was remarkably low which meant I kept pulling it from the wall It was unusable for a man standing There was some damage to the paintwork on the wardrobe door One of the drawers in the desk didn t open properly my husband fixed this There was a soft closer on the inner toilet lid but not on the outer one , A glass of cava offered on check in a fabulously comfortable bed and a wonderful shower The room was very quiet We had a wonderful stay and would definitely visit again The list of niggles were simply that and didn t detract from our overall enjoyment of the hotel 
312866,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Difficulty for taxis to drop off as most will not drive right up to the hotel and late at night it did not feel safe to walk up the alley alone , The atmosphere is fantastic and the staff are extremely helpful and friendly
312867,Mercer Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Everything about this hotel is fabulous from the moment you walk in staff are so friendly the decor is excellent the food in the bar and the restaurant was delicious and beautifully presented 
312868,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Hotel needs a fitness center, Friendly staff Staff member Bogdan went out of his way to give very interesting history of the area and our room It was very special 
312869,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Better lighting in bathroom for shaving service at breakfast is erratic but food is good , This was our second stay everything still as good as before Great room with a fantastic bed and all the extras you need 
312870,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Nothing, This hotel is amazing the location the interior and the design However what sets this hotel above any other is the staff They genuinely cared about our stay and experience One of the best hotels I have stayed in and I have stayed in quite a few 5 
312871,Mercer Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, A beautiful hotel and a great location in the Bari Gotic area of Barcelona The staff was so helpful they went above and beyond our expectations The breakfast in the hotel courtyard was delightful delicious plentiful and served with style and grace we loved our stay at Hotel Mercer and highly recommend it to travelers 
312872,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Would ve liked if the pool to be heated Beyond that everything was perfect , The staff were amazing So helpful and made our honeymoon and my birthday extra special The room was gorgeous So quiet and comfortable I loved the area as well it wasn t crowded it was so nice and so close to everything you need Loved our stay would definitely go back 
312873,Mercer Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Located in the Gothic area within a few minutes walk of places of historic interest great bars restaurants and relaxing plazas The hotel has been beautifully renovated is modern yet remains linked to its Roman ruin past The roof top pool and bar are a welcome oasis after a day spent exploring the city s back streets and museums Helpful friendly staff and a knowledgeable concierge Try the tasting menu in the restaurant for a gourmet delight 10 out of 10 
312874,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Breakfast left a bit to be desired in comparison to the rest It is not the usual buffet breakfast but I imagine that is because it is a relatively small hotel At any rate the efficiency and friendliness of the b f room staff more than made up for any real or perceived lack in the breakfast , Excellent staff very friendly and extremely helpful from the receptionists to the concierge to the doormen and the waiters and waitresses Location is as good as it gets if you appreciate historical centres even if most taxis will only get you close to the hotel but not right up to it The property has been most professionally renovated and our room was very comfortable indeed and cleanliness was impeccable We look forward to going back to the hotel and renewing our new friendships 
312875,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Location great once there but finding by car is a nightmare but called the hotel who sent out staff to fetch us and park our car Wi fi non existent in our room but available downstairs Non bath or b day in the bathroom , Staff were fantastic and attentive Location within the old city is great for wandering the narrow streets with shops and restaurants 
312876,Mercer Hotel Barcelona,No Negative, Great location Super friendly and helpful staff Great small tapas bar off lobby Beautiful roof terrace although we didn t use Very quiet Oh and fabulous breakfast 
312877,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, Restaurant was just ok Too expensive for what they are offering considering all the great food in the city , Great service they even upgraded our room with champagne and roses Beautiful room 
312878,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, The hotel is in a very small alley don t try to drive there , The front of house staff were excellent going above and beyond to help The pool terrace is a perfect oasis in the city
312879,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, The reasons for not giving 5 stars on the comfort was because the toilet was rather wide and I nearly fell in several times at first Also the pillows were slightly too soft for my taste which would have been solved if I had just asked for another pillow to put under my head I used my 2nd pillow to cushion my knees so didn t have a 2nd pillow for under my head I have no doubt the staff would have accommodated me had I thought to ask Minor points and nothing that would prevent me from returning next time I visit Barcelona , The facilities are beautiful and the service was impeccable Upon arrival Florencia provided us with all the information about the hotel and she helped us with suggestions for places to see and directions for wherever we wanted to go The breakfast every day was tailored to our liking from the first day when Noemi was the server of my French egg white omelet for which I am grateful to the chef as well Noemi proved helpful in many ways other than serving breakfast and we looked forward to starting our day off with her and Alesh who also helped facilitate our unexpected last minute check out when he brought us room service our last morning We also enjoyed the roof top bar especially talking with Albert about Spain as well as the delicious smoothie he made The doormen including Paolo and the Ukrainian who speaks 7 languages were also helpful and friendly and we enjoyed seeing them every day I must also thank the doorman who helped us with our luggage all the way to the Cathedral when our air transport was unable to pick us up any closer than that He was great I also loved the Molton Brown Deep Cleansing Mineral Face Wash and am disappointed to find that I cannot buy it anywhere but can only get it from a hotel Any you can spare me 
312880,Mercer Hotel Barcelona, not always easy to find when returning in the narrow streets, Comfortable bed very good breakfast very peaceful lovely relaxing area on rooftop
