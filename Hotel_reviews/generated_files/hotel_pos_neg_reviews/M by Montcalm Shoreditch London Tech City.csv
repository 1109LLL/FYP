57597,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Odd one but the overwhelming smell of air freshener both in the main hotel and the room I get it you have a spa and use Elemis products but it was just too overpowering I m tech savvy but the TV is over complicated make it simpler , Friendly and welcoming staff nicely appointed rooms love the Nespresso machine comfortable bed and very clean and tidy overall a great find

57602,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, For 180 a night I would have hoped that a full English breakfast be included we got a continental breakfast but it was very limited , The room was perfect Everything we needed Great views Clean Tidy 
57603,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Nothing to quibble really but maybe a booklet with brief notes about hotel and times of breakfast spa opening would have been handy , Not sure what genius perks are Bed very comfy Good facilities with nespresso machine etc Didn t use mini bar Room very clean and stylish Loved bathroom and fantastic shower Loved spa facililities Wished had had time for some wellness treatments maybe next time Breakfast tasty liked that staff filled up coffee cup without asking Staff very professional and friendly 
57604,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Couldn t complain about a thing , Stunning hotel had everything I could have asked for staff where great and would have loved to have stayed longer to enjoy all their facilities spa etc 
57605,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The staff speak with very strong French accent English which I have a little problem to listen to 3 people stayed in the room but only provided 2 people s robes and toothbrushes and slippers A 5 star hotel should have prepared for us However the service is incredible so I don t find this too disappointing, The bed is extremely comfy The natural lighting is perfect The room design is very elegant and modern The staff is very friendly The room has all the equipment i needed 
57606,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Loved everything , Amazing modern rooms and very friendly staff Great breakfast with lots of choice Hotel was really close to the tube station so very easy to get around London Having a coffee machine in the room was really nice and the dressing gowns are so fluffy We were also given a 20 voucher to spend in the bar which was a really nice touch and I would defiantly stay again 
57607,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Very loud neighbours Sound proofing of rooms isn t great Woken at 3 30 in morning to voices and giggling Huge TV with terrible sound Not a great service when we left We weren t asked how our stay was or thanked , Excellent bar staff Very clean Friendly service 
57608,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I booked a cot for my one year old When I arrived at the room at 7 30 They had made the sofa into a bed I complained and it took an hour to resolve By which time my daughter as very tired and upset I had to make three phone calls to resolve First to housekeeping then to reception and another to housekeeping I booked into the hotel on return from Paris so that my daughter wouldn t be late to bed Which clearly was not the outcome Ps small pot of M Ms 6, The level of room technology Comfort of bed 
57609,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Staff were very polite and friendly Room was comfortable had a really good nights sleep Shower was powerful Coffee tea facilities better than most 
57610,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The bed seemed to be two singles pushed together so it had a weird dip after some time of rolling about in it The TV peaks volume level 25 which can be annoying if someone is showering while you are watching tv Food at the hotel is craaaazy high we ordered food in the area there are so many places to eat in shoreditch, We stayed at the weekend and there is totally free parking on the side road all of Saturday and Sunday It s also not in congestion zone so we left by 8 30 with no parking charges The room was super high tech and totally entertaining The spa is basic but clean and fun with lovely fresh infused water available 
57611,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Check in could have been faster , Stayed here previously as the location is close to where my son lives and therefore very convenient Hotel is very modern and staff very friendly Check in seemed to be a little slow but we were offered a glass of Prosecco as we waited We booked a Club double and the room was spacious clean with the usual mod cons Wouldn t hesitate to stay again 
57612,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The only downside was the spa being half closed on the Monday morning without any notice And not that it was a massive problem but the tablets that control all the lights and Aircon in the room all crashed once during the stay but I managed to sort that , The room was stunning the service was excellent and I loved that the room came with a complimentary smart phone to use throughout the stay And as if all of that wasn t good enough the spa was amazing
57613,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Room took a while to cool down warm up, Beds and pillows were heavenly Fixtures and fitting very high end Staff extremely welcoming and friendly Great pool and gym
57614,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Totally disappointed had been recommended this hotel booked the restaurant for the evening meal daughters 21st birthday actually only to be told on arrival it was closed an noone could locate our booking had to find a taxi and go elsewhere not towels available in the swimming area and upon our arrival of a pre booked booking reception insisted they need to see out card we booked with which was at home had to ask our son to send a picture of it do fail to see the relevance of this 
57615,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Breakfast did not impress Three types of cereal milk and toast from Tesco for 16 GBP I would expect a nice continental buffet from a place at this level, Excellent room comfy bed friendly staff
57616,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Technology in the room was not particularly useful or helpful and didn t always function properly , The hotel stay was enjoyable the location is great and the staff were helpful and always polite Fitness facilities excellent the bar area was pleasant and busy morning and evening 
57617,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Nothing , Good location Close to Old street subway only 3 mins walk Easy to get to King s Cross Neighborhood is good with a lot of eateries Upscale neighborhood 
57618,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Breakfast was rather pricey so we ate elsewhere , We liked just about everything at this fantastic modern hotel Our room was generously sized and very clean with lovely comfy beds tasteful decor and all mod cons Bathroom was also much more generously proportioned than most other London hotels I have stayed at Staff were very helpful and friendly We took a dip in the swimming pool which was small but very nice and clean Shoreditch isn t tbe most scenic location but I would definitely stay at this hotel again 
57619,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, It was a triple room but there were only 2 proper mugs and insufficient milk cartons , A high tech room with touchpad lighting and temperature controls and a huge tv The beds were extremely comfortable A great shower and a proper coffee machine too 
57620,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The staff had no idea what they were doing the ipads in the rooms did not turn off so I had to put something on them to get a dark room at night and the breakfast that is included is a sad excuse for a breakfast , Nice new hotel
57621,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Not quiet Noise from street felt like you were on the road and I was on the 5th floor Air conditioning is either hot or freezing Not comfortable Spa is anything but a spa , Comfortable Beds 
57622,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I can t find anything to complain about , I liked everything about my stay from the check in to the check out everything went perfectly We can feel the house is very well kept everyone was warm and professional it was extremely clean design and for the price especially in London it s an extremely good deal The SPA and swimming pool are a big plus 
57623,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, I think its difficult to find such balanced hotels in terms of Work Leisure I stayed 8 nights at this property and everything was exceptionally good During my entire stay not a single instance i felt any lack of service standards or any hassles like calling reception for iron board or something not working which is very common while staying at hotels The staff was very co operative and the rooms were modern and equipped with all the facilities 
57624,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Welcome at reception seemed a bit unprofessional We paid for the room upon arrival and where then asked whether we would like to deposit a second amount transaction for extras The invoice however was only issued after check out Why do you have to bother me twice The towels weren t clean Can happen but won t if you check The door didn t close You would think a modern building would have working doors but it seems that this skill hasn t reached Tech City yet , Location is great and its a modern place 
57625,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, in general the hotel was lovely until we got locked in our bedroom before checked and had to have the staff to break the lock to let us out this was very stressful for my partner
57626,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, We planned to use the restaurant on the top floor that had views over London but disappointed that it was shut No mentioned of this anywhere not on website nor any notification in hotel We just found the doors were locked when we went to check it out , Curtains heating lighting media all controlled on central unit Comfortable bed Staff were very polite and helpful Spa area was clean and enjoyable to use We were given a small refund when we complained about the top floor restaurant being shut 
57627,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Couldnt operate the tv Or figure out how to connect my phone The shower was a disabled room when i am not diabled Would have prefered a normal shower not a wet room Not same pictures advertised on line for the extra price , The fine details The style of the hotel The mood lighting The staff helpfulness
57628,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, We weren t able to play music via our devices It was USB only which was pretty disappointing and impractical, Amazing hotel very modern Amazing location The beds are super comfy The spa was amazing and really relaxing Moodlighting in the room was a really nice touch 
57629,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The touch screen device was a tad laggy and could have been better Toilet isn t very clean as well , The room is pretty clean The functions of the room are controlled by a touch screen device and that is pretty cool They also provide you with a hotspot device which you can bring around and tap on its network That will be very convenient for travelers who do not have access to the local network services 
57630,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The lighting can be a bit dark at night if you want to do your makeup The lighting isn t great, Great location Couple minutes walk from a tube station Beautiful rooms comfy beds The staff are very friendly 
57631,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Stayed here many times Staff always helpful a Spanish lady who is always on reception is always very helpful when I arrive To the point of finding me umbrella when it was raining cats and dogs outside Last stay had disabled access room which I d didn t like as the bathroom facilities were to low One quick call to reception and a new room was made available and the keys brought to the room Great service 10 10
57632,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, In busy periods as was the case during our stay the morning breakfast included with stay could be a bit better staffed organized There were not enough tables staff to wait them at times , The staff clearly endeavor to make their guest s stay an enjoyable one All the little extras are thought of Really well appointed rooms Very clean modern 
57633,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, No tea or coffee machine in the dining hall, Cleanliness How fast the staff responded Location Breakfast Comfort of the beds and the room Coffee and tea maker in the room as well as the complementary water every day Free mobile phone during our stay 3 min from old street metro station Ironing board and the iron Great hair dryer Slippers in the room

57635,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The TV signal wasn t great it was through the internet and was very patchy But all else was great , Excellent hotel and wonderful service We loved our stay and felt very well looked after from check in to check out 
57636,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Picking at hairs it would have been good to have some basic info in the room about what time breakfast was and what time check out was There may have been something in the room but I couldn t find it anywhere It was easy enough to call reception and ask though , The staff were all very helpful and friendly The carpets had that thickness to them that show a quality establishment The beds were super comfy 
57637,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Check in was slow TV didn t work fully needed maintenance man to fix sound which was distorted Didn t have all channels was supposed to be fixed but never was Booked a 1 hour hot stone massage took over 24 hours to respond via email I confirmed booking via email within the hour and arrived for massage at discussed time to be told the booking had not been confirmed The junior staff member wasn t very helpful had an attitude and rather than discussing the issue immediately escalated to manager Manager was apologetic but offered no compensation other than a complimentary massage the next day which was no good as we were leaving the next morning Not the service I d expect at a so called 5 hotel , Scented room was a nice touch
57638,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I can t fault anything , The hotel was amazing the staff were so friendly and helpful the hotel bar was a great place to drink The spa was beautiful and I can t wait to return 
57639,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Everything was very disorganised a booking of 2 rooms caused great confusion and my husband and I were given a room key for the room where our friend had already checked in we walked straight in on him thankfully dressed They did give us complimentary breakfast to apologise which was nice but it did confirm that I would never pay the full price for the breakfast it was very average and they charge something like 25 per person per night Service in the bar was very slow and breakfast was also slow service hard to get a coffee for example They then overcharged my credit card and I had to call back once I realised to get them to refund the difference Lots of style with not a lot of substance unfortunately , Really nice looking hotel with lots of high tech gadgets Comfortable bed decent bathroom and close to tube station and restaurants bars 
57640,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The organisation in the spa Not enough information on the lockers in changing room And very small changing room space , The building is amazing The staff very helpful The rooms are totally brilliant 
57641,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, We had problems with the cell phone that is provided by the hotel Charger in the room wasn t working properly so we were not able to fully take advantage of this otherwise lovely perk , Front desk staff upgraded our free continental breakfast to a full English breakfast buffet which was awesome and had a great selection of items We also got free coupons for the lounge which we enjoyed Location is close to Tube and walkable to city centre St Paul s Thames Tower of London Weekend markets etc Great restaurants nearby Jamie Oliver s Fifteen is literally around the corner Concierge booked us dinner at a nearby restaurant called Jones Family Project which was one of the best meals of our trip Highly recommend the prime rib for the table Overall had a great stay at M by Montcalm Shoreditch and will book again next time in London 
57642,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Came here for my friends hen party Staff were very friendly and the room in absolutely comfy and modern Had dinner at there restaurant on the 1st floor tonic remedy lovely Also got upgraded to a full English breakfast 
57643,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, TV reception quality was awful Some of the electronics in the room just failed every time you tried to use them Some of the staff members were unhelpful and patronising No bath robe in my room as standard so I had to call down to reception for one No obvious way of calling reception so I had to do it from my mobile after google ing the number , Nicely decorated good location and one helpful staff member Nice pool and jacuzzi
57644,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The spa department needs more information available Messy and little organized Lady in front desk need to learn how to treat customers servicetraining Sad that the restaurant on top was closed , Very nice hotel and comfortable rooms Simple but good breakfast Very nice staff in the restaurant Easy to get to the center around with the tube 
57645,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I didn t like the manner of the first receptionist I met I found him brusque particularly when I queried why the conversion rate of accommodation cost had gone from 589 to 621 overnight literally 32 I was annoyed when I got back in the evening and my room had not been serviced There was no compensation for this even though I had paid for the service , I loved that I requested a quiet room as this booking was for work with 6 30am start each day The room was really quiet for a busy central location in location I liked that the problems that I had were quickly sorted 99 of the staff I met were lovely and couldn t have been more helpful The room was lovely 
57646,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Most everything horrible reception claimed I had no reservation sent me to the lounge which was closed Maybe for younger tech people way too futuristic and complicated fir my taste, location spotless
57647,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Staff is not helpful No car park offer and slowest reseption ever Its our 3rd stay there and Always had a problem with booking reservations i think they are not well trained for the job Also car park shouldnt be that complicated , Hotel tech is superb and also size of the room is quite good
57648,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Requested early book in unfortunately didn t get booked in till 2 05pm Room Service didn t answer phone for over an hour of calling have stayed before so put it down to a busy weekend in the hotel , Nice Hotel
57649,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I checked twice about using the spa the next day after checkout and was informed we could use the spa until 2pm When we arrived we were told that was not the case Eventually after a discussion spa staff agreed to let us use the facilities , The hotel was wonderful rooms were modern and spacious with lovely facilities Hotel staff were incredibly friendly Reception staff upgraded us to include breakfast as we were there for a special occasion which was a really nice touch 
57650,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Couldn t fault anything , The staff were extremely helpful and ungraded us on arrival The welcome drink was lovely and it couldn t have been a better stay Breakfast was delicious and plentiful I d definitely recommend staying at this hotel 
57651,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The 8oz rib eye steak was 25 and I felt this was quite over priced for what it was especially as fries were not included neither was a steak sauce More variety of food such as different steaks would improve the room service dinning experience , The hotel and rooms uphold a stylish presentation The staff were friendly and approachable Room service was delivered in a timely manner and presented beautifully Amazing bathroom Spa and pool an excellent addition to the hotel stay 
57652,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The hotel look good if you don t look too close For a luxory hotel 5 star we were missing the detail care everthing was aranged and without love Looking on the surface everthing was shining but if you were looking behind the doors or some parts of the furniture it was dirty and looked worn and loveless The same is the pool and Spa area The showers behind the pool and all the other parts of stainless steel are rusty because it is the wrong material It is A2 and not A4 If you look behind the shower doors it is dirty moldy and greasy We choosed the hotel also because it has a roof top bar but it was only open for private events And some of the waiters told us it is going to be closed anyway It would have been good to mention it on the homepage The service personal is very good and fiendly nothing to complain The rooms are nice and comfortable the only thing which is missing are the toilet brush in the bathroom The breakfast is not worth the money The position of the hotel is excellent , The position of the hotel is excellent The service personal is very good and fiendly nothing to complain 
57653,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Some of the SPA facilities weren t working properly, It was our second stay at this hotel and to be honest for whatever reason it wasn t as good as the first one Everything was very good but not exceptional as during our first visit 
57654,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Every member of staff encountered was absolutely lovely and they couldn t do enough to help even when help wasn t requested they were quick to offer to carry bags and go the extra mile to ensure my stay was great
57655,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Quite upset as booked the hotel with the main purpose to use the pool jacuzzi spa When we arrived they said it was closed until 9a m the next day Same problem the day after therefore did not serve the purpose Could have booked a closer hotel ,No Positive
57656,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The massage was very light and pretty rushed Some of the spa facilities were unavailable on our visit , We stayed here for my wife s 30th birthday weekend I told the hotel in advance of the celebration and Charlene did a great job with decorating the bed with balloons and flowers and giving us some absolutely delicious pie and fruits It was a lovely added touch and surprise for my wife The room was on the 9th floor with a nice view It s all pretty high tech with touchpads to control the lighting and electric curtains although sometimes it can be a tad temperamental The room and bathroom was clean spacious and comfortable The hotel is in a good location just a short walk from Old street station 
57657,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The lobby is quite small It s quite a distance from the airport but close proximity to down town if you need to be close to where the action is , This is an excellent facility in the heart of the city Room was very convenient and high tech Internet was very stable and fast I did not manage to try the breakfast due to lack of time but I m sure that it must be great too considering all other aspects of the hotel 
57658,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The place seems to be very understaffed and the staff that are there are not terribly helpful and perhaps poorly trained It took a very long time to get a room service menu The reception telephone seems regularly unstaffed as it rang out quite a few times The room is also filled with these ridiculous gimmicky controls that are not terribly good The lights and air conditioning for example are controlled by tablets and ours did not work very well and crashed a couple of times Give us the tablet by all means but also give us light switches as an override Also it was 10 30 pm and the roof restaurant was closed and the bar not staffed , Very comfortable bed and pillows The location is good for Shoreditch 
57659,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The spa is always very busy so if you re after a relaxing break this is not the place to visit Pool are is always very packed so much so that there aren t enough loungers for everyone I even overheard the receptionist say they had ran out of lockers Again if you re looking for a relaxing break STAY AWAY,No Positive
57660,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I should have been offered to check the account before asking for the final amount to pay and had to ask for a receipt, the use of the health spa after a long long journey The staff were very friendly in the food areas and front of desk

57662,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Immaculate hotel great location Staff approachable helpful friendly In room gadgets which impressed the fella a beautiful spa which we both relaxed in for most of the morning We didn t eat at the hotel so not able to comment on food Beds amazingly comfortable Would recommend this hotel whether it be as a base to explore London or a chilled out overnight weekend break

57666,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Didn t warm to receptionist who checked us in a little curt Also housekeeping tried to enter to clean our room on the day we were checking out despite the fact we had the do not disturb light on and we were nowhere close to checking out time, Always have trouble with comfort of bed and pillows but both were excellent here Wanted to take a pillow home with me 
57667,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Didn t like booking com hiking up the price Could have saved 20 on the booking by booking direct and got breakfast which would have cost an extra 50 if done on booking com , Great hotel great gadgets 
57668,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Not all of the equipment in the gym was working, The staff were extremely helpful The room was fantastic and the views breathtaking from the 15th floor The bed was super comfy Overall a wonderful stay in London 
57669,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Hotel takes a one night stay deposit several days before check in without authorisation Staff at the hotel didn t know when or how it will be returned and it still hasn t but full rate charged as well Rooms are good but that s it Not good value for money in the hotel category and there are better options Won t return , Good rooms and fitness centre
57670,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The double beds were two single beds put together which has little dent in the middle so if you roll over there s a bump which wasn t great , The spa was so relaxing and the hotel room was modern clean and comfortable 
57671,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The TV had poor signal and the food from the restaurant was bland , Great central location super modern clean rooms and bathroom and friendly staff Prosecco upon arrival when checking in as well as stylish spacious rooms

57673,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The tech in room was awful crashed slow and pointless Staff gave poor info didn t say had to wear robes to spa then we didn t even have any in the room Having tech faults and that wasn t up to expectations at all , Location and size of room nice bathroom
57674,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Jacuzzi was out of order which was a pain, Wasn t able to rate the hotel restaurant as well as restaurants near by as we had a reservation in Mayfair However our stay was amazing A massive thank you to Charlene whom I spoke with prior to coming She arranged an amazing set up in the room for my partners birthday which is thoroughly adored Another thank you to Victoria who welcomed us then took us to our suite Great service Only thing was the jacuzzi wasn t working which I really wanted to use However I swam instead the pool area was exceptionally clean Although there was a lot of people at the hotel the spa area wasn t to busy or noisy which was perfect for me to relax Definitely going back sometime i
57675,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I requested a quiet room due to landing from an extremely long and stressful night The parking situation was comepletely inconvenient and staff were rude and useless Quite frankly if it wasn t for the location and the discount offer via booking I probably wouldn t stay again , The bed was comfy and the room setting and lights were wonderful 
57676,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, There is an ongoing construction right across the property and when you open the curtain it feels like you are about to chat with the workers on site , The touch screen for everything The night light And the comfy bed 
57677,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, This hotel s customer service exceeded my expectations The housekeepers were always friendly and helpful and said hi when I passed them in the hallway From time to time they even asked me if I needed anything When my coffee maker was having issues the housekeeper promptly called for a maintenance specialist who was just so courteous and helpful And when I left an item in the room and came back a couple of days later to retrieve it they had kept it neatly tucked away for me Really outstanding keep up the great work 
57678,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, No bathrobes even though it said it would be included in the room Otherwise good and clean with a lot of practical details I would recommend anyone to consider this hotel for business trips but on my next private visit to London I will probably try to find a more boutique like hotel or a more classic one with more personality ,No Positive
57679,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Nothing, Fabulous hotel Everything from lights to curtains operated by iPAD type remote control Room was amazing free afternoon snack and rose petals on the bed 3 minute walk to Metro Underground Definetley recommend
57680,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Pool spa facilities were out of order both days we were there and this was a big reason I chose the hotel in the first place I was only offered an alternative 10 minute walk to another location s pool on the second day in the evening so that didn t help much The first day it was implied we would get some complimentary drinks food to make up for it but we didn t receive this either Considering how crucial the wellness area was in my decision to book the hotel it was very disappointing that it wasn t available and even though I know unexpected issues and maintenance can happen I would have expected an effort to make up for it , The hotel is beautiful friendly staff high tech rooms 
57681,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Under 12 s could not use the pool My son is 11 so just missed out They could perhaps have set times for children Unfortunately this was a facility I felt was paid for but not useable , The welcome drink A nice touch 
57682,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Well the room s card was not working properly and we needed to replaced it few times but it could be related to the specific room , The hotel staff was friendly and very helpful the room was big enough for 3 adults it was well capacious the beds are great and also the bathroom and the shower Location is great a lot of bars and restaurants are in the area and also central transportation services The neighborhood is great and it was so fun to walk around When I ll come back to London I would definitely take into consideration to return to M hotel 
57683,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I was hoping to get a bit more info about sightseeing tours even after specifically mentioning some all I got was the hop on off tour Very very minor complaint though, Extremely nice staff accommodated special requests including a free room upgrade the room was pristine and high tech room controls were a nice surprise Everything was as you d expect from a top class hotel
57684,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The temperature in the bathroom too cold The misunderstanding about the use of the voucher for breakfast Breakfast good but regular not a 5 one, The room size 3 adults fit in very confortably The beds the Amenities The cleanliness The view
57685,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The fact that I spent 10mins trying to get my iPhone to pair with the air freshener because I thought it was speakers , Great hotel with easy access from Old Street tube station Rooms were very well appointed with almost every gadget you could think of 
57686,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Only slight down fall was the continental breakfast didn t have much of a range of foods However was still lovely food , Staff were very welcome room was beautiful bed was amazingly comfy We felt very comfortable even in such a modern posh place It s a great place to stay for a romantic weekend away with plenty of bars and restaurants nearby 
57687,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The windows don t open but that wasn t a big deal , All staff was extremely friendly and helpful and took us in last minute after the British Airways incident They didn t even charge a ridiculous amount for the room as many other hotels did Room was very modern and spacious The continental breakfast was healthy and served in a cozy restaurant that offered an amazing view over the city 
57688,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I can t think of anything I didn t like , The staff and the service was amazing The M by Montcalm is my favourite hotel I m always looked after when I stay 
57689,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The tv was preset to not go above a certain volume which wasn t loud enough and the tv had no guide to tell you what was on, The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was very mondern with touch screens for lighting and aircon and curtains 
57690,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The view from the room was on the building being constructed hope that will finish soon Bar of the hotel closes too early at 11pm , The room and the spa are very clean and comfortable room service food is great Stuff is very friendly and helpful 
57691,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I felt slightly worried about using the lockers in case by bits got stuck in there as the combination system had no instructions and you only put the code in once Changing rooms were on the small side The hotel bar closed reasonably early by 11pm The night time room service food menu was rather small and limited with no nibbles , We have been to many luxury premium style hotels in and around London and often avoid larger ones and instead opting for smaller boutique style hotels however this hotel way surpassed all of my expectations by putting in all the little luxury touches that you could expect from a boutique hotel Positives Our first contact was with front desk where the member of staff was polite helpful welcoming and informative He couldn t be any more helpful and was a great first impression The reception area is clean modern and comfortable Fruit seating lighting furniture and air fresheners all ensured that the hotel had a luxurious feel The hallway looked glamourous and modern clean and air conditioned Our room had lovely modern furniture and decor Towels and bedding were great quality and the bed and pillows offered superior comfort and a great nights sleep There were Elemis consumeable products in the bathroom as well as an excellent hairdryer and even an umbrella There were also dressing gowns slippers and a mobile gadget that you can use as a tour guide if needed Free in room safe iron and ironing board too Complimentary and premium quality teas coffees as well as a well stocked mini barvwitb transparent pricing There were room and bedside options for the excellent air con system as well as dimmable room and bedside lighting under floor heating mood lighting night lighting curtain operation and TV including Sky Sports The mirror in the room and bathroom were thoughtful touches often missing from other hotels and a great size desk and lounge chair with footstool The spa was equally lovely with complimentary towel dressing gown and pool side flip flops to use during your visit and refrigerated water by the pool The shower also had complimentary Elemis products for use Pool sauna and steam room of a fair size and small Jacuzzi too Breakfast was delicious with very attentive staff and great view onto the street below 
57692,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The pads used to control the lighting keeped slipping out of the WiFi so we had get to get help from reception to turn them of to sleep but the staff was extremely helpful and quick to get it sorted , The you went to check in I got given a glass of presseco which after a long day traveling went down a treat The room was beautiful spacious and clean I could not fault it the bed was comfortable and so big had very good night s sleep there was no noise from outside either As guests we got to use the spa and pool after a long day was so relaxing and just what u needed the staff are helpful and show you where to go and provide u with towels robes and slippers to wear We even got a free complimentary breakfast I would definitely stay here again

57697,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, View of the construction site hence had the curtain closed all the time The reception could have told me about the handyphone with free wifi local and international calls are for guest to use I only found that out as I was checking out , The little details like the fresh fruits cookies and hot beverages were most welcome Clean and comfortable room 
57698,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Not much if I have to rack my brain then I would comment that the Bathroom goodies were a little sparce no hair conditioner I expect that in a 5 star hotel , The views the gadget city approach to everything The spa it was a lovely way to celebrate my daughters birthday
57699,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Having made the booking 6 or 8 weeks before was upset to be told when checking in at 2pm that we had been moved to another hotel when the man checking in next to us had booked online 20 minutes before and was given a room We made a fuss and were allowed to stay Long delays at check out and check in In spite of a do not disturb sign sign we had a cleaner knock on the door at 8 15 and a man at 10 who told us we had checked out and they needed to clean the room Not true , The property was very convenient for Moorfields Eye Hospital where I was having an operation

57704,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The bathroom had a shower over the bath rather than a walk in shower the TV didn t work properly , The bed was super comfortable The views are spectacular especially at night 
57705,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, English breakfast via room service was not warm enough , Great tech in the room although my wife couldn t work out how to turn the bathroom light on in the middle of the night 
57706,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Honestly there is very little I didn t like It s a great hotel One negative The breakfast was a continental breakfast and to get a hot breakfast you had to go downstairs and pay an extra 7 euro to upgrade , Amazing hotel I asked for an early check in to get ready before my graduation ceremony and they had a bottle of sparkling wine and a note congratulating me in my room So thoughtful 
57707,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The only bad thing is the tv is very pixelated and not many channels to choose from , The picture don t do this hotel justice Absolutely amazing hotel with a gorgeous spa The staff were very lovely and kind upon arrival we shortly discussed it was my partners birthday and they instantly arranged something for him The bedroom was very clean and the hotel facilities were all immaculate 
57708,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, There was nothing not to like I d reccomend this hotel any time to anyone , Staff has upgraded our room as it was a first visit gave us all the instructions and directions to navigate around the building The stay was absolutely amazing And the fact that tube station is literally 2 mins walk and about 10mins walk there s a number of really nice places to grab something to eat that makes it even better Looks exactly like on the pictures Beautiful hotel 
57709,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Televison kept buffering and the the picture pixelated The twin beds were too close they need more disatance between them, Beds were good lighting was great as some hotels are too dark the lights were ajustable from an ipad which meant you could adjust to how you wanted them important when doing makeup 
57710,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, The staff at this hotel are very welcoming and friendly nothing is to much trouble The hotel is immaculately clean and the rooms are lovely Travelled for my dad s birthday there were cakes and a balloon for him in the room A very pleasant enjoyable stay We will be back Thank you
57711,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Customer service nobody answered the phone when ringing the front desk The air conditioning kept on resetting to heat to 24 degrees , Nice Pool and sauna Modern
57712,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Prosecco on arrival The staff were friendly and helpful Feel completely shut off from outside world Lovely clean and modern room Big swimming pool Jacuzzi sauna and steam room are a bonus 
57713,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Although the continental breakfast was really nice the tables were really small but still thought it was great, Really friendly staff complimentary prosecco in the reception area

57715,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I had a late check out at 2pm but still had two different house keepers knock my door at different times after 12pm they should of been informed that I had a late check out as this was disturbing to me and my partner trying to relax , Greeted with champagne on arrival bed was super comfortable
57716,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, 20 minute check in process which was ridiculously over complicated especially as we had already paid The room was all digitally controlled and annoyingly randomly switch all the nights and tech on at 5am and again at 6 The receptionist didn t seem to care , Bed very comfortable
57717,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, One of the iPads was hit and miss Didn t work properly for our stay and the Maintenance team visited a couple of times to establish issue never really solved it during our stay They were polite and also the hotel offered some wine to make up for inconvenience But we will go back to stay here think we were just unlucky with our particular tech in our room , Friendly concierge Charmaine guest experience Arrange a little chocolate treat balloons and dresses room with petal fit husbands birthday All complimentary South a nice touch 
57718,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, It was excellent to have a gym there but for a modern hotel the gym could have been better equipped for example it was very small and not many weight machines although the cardio equipment was fine The fact that breakfast wasn t included in the room rate was a real downside for us As we are vegetarians vegans we never make full use of everything in a buffet style breakfast anyway so we were not willing to pay extra for it, Really liked the comfortable bed one of the most comfortable i have ever had in a hotel also liked the modern technology and feel the big shower head in the bathroom friendly staff and the location
57719,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Didn t have breakfast this time as it was more expensive than other hotels, Huge bed so comfy and the pillows were the best ever Staff brilliant Complimentary glass of Prosecco whilst checking in Don t usually like modern but the room was fabulous Fantastic shower rain shower or off the wall option also powerful Would stay there again

57722,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, See above expensive breakfast, Very nice hotel and a great experience however the breakfast at 25 pp was extortianate so didn t bother which is a shame if it was around the 10 mark we would have gone for it 
57723,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Personally I feel this hotel is over priced I booked this hotel because of a special offer on booking com the price for a deluxe double was reduced from 300 to 167 The price I paid I think was fair for the room but if I d paid 300 I wouldn t have been very impressed It s a nice room but I wouldn t say it was superior to hotels which charge 150 200 a night Especially as that price doesn t even include breakfast Given that it is a tech hotel we would have expected the TV to be better quality The picture was blurry the sound was distorted and buzzy and it was difficult to operate the remote buttons weren t very responsive , The staff here are very helpful and polite Check in was easy and we were offered a complimentary glass of prosecco a nice touch Our room was on the 6th floor a good size with a nice bathroom We liked the tech touches which consisted of 2 tablets by the bed to control curtains and lighting night light desk light bedside light mood lighting etc a tablet by the bathroom to control lights air conditioning underfloor heating bathroom only They also offer a complimentary smartphone with unlimited 4G which you can take out of the hotel and with you for the duration of your trip There was also a Nespresso machine kettle selection of teas and coffee and a minibar although a little empty The bed was super comfy and warm one of the best nights sleep ever We also liked the complimentary bath robes which were soft and cosy and complimentary slippers We walked to the hotel from South Bank to sight see and it took us around 45 minutes at a comfortable pace The location is fairly central you re minutes from Old Street Station 
57724,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, No bath in room, Comfy bed complimentary prosecco on arrival coffee machine an added bonus lots of really nice touches in room and everything is controlled by touch screen 
57725,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The room lights A C TV door etc control software had numerous bugs The room had to be rebooted by the staff at one point , It was the most high tech room I ve ever stayed in 
57726,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, No big issues to complain about but for the price 282GBP night 2 persons me and my 14y o son the included breakfast was kind of a little too simple there was an option to pay 29EUR person day for some more breakfast but I did not choose that There was no light in the room wardrobe area One of the all controlling tablets was not working , Really nice and responsive staff ready to help with each issue Special thanks to Victoria at the front desk Hotel is modern and cozy Great location nice surroundings I wish I had more time to enjoy the hotels SPA pool and gym There was a coffee machine in the room with complementary coffee capsules as well as tee and some biscuits Great to have slippers and dressing gown provided

57732,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Bedside table slightly dusty but it was a room swap so maybe it had been vacant for a while , Originally given a disabled room and found the sink too low but this was quickly rectified by obliging and helpful staff Wonderfully comfortable bed and first class facilities Extremely quiet and full blackout curtains Given a glass of fizz on arrival which was a nice touch Definitely go back

57759,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The technology was confusing as didn t notice it initially my partner operated it and then in middle of the night I couldnt find a light switch TV technology wasn t working properly either My main gripe is that I made 3 separate bookings for various family members We had difficulty in getting payment made on separate cards and some bookings were billed twice prompt refund made on complaint but worst of all two couples checked in and gave in their cards but were shown to rooms occupied by other people One couple was given a new room fairly quickly but the other couple had to wait over an hour at around 11pm 12 midnight after a long tiring day before a room was found for them No compensation offered , I liked the decor design and bedding although it was a bit corporate in style The foyer and breakfast room were very attractively styled and the breakfast food was excellent The staff were very welcoming

57776,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I like complete darkness when I sleep but that was made impossible by the countless tech appliances in the room Particularly annoying the tablets fixed to the bedside lamps with screens that never really turn off same for the mood lightning which didn t help the mood at all , Location cleanliness comfort 
57777,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The location is bit far from central london but you have Shoreditch to enjoy Not really a negative but if hipster culture is not your thing then maybe central london would be a better location Other than that the place was amazing , This is a great hotel and deserves all 5 stars The staff was helpful and friendly My boyfriend had a birthday and they have decorated the room with balloons and brought the cake before I even asked The rooms are digital which is quite cool The beds are super comfy We absolutely loved it and would go back next time

57787,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Underfloor heating didn t work It seems that all the room functionality such as interior lights tv etc being controlled by a single screen device is technology for technology s sake and prone to problems Just finding out the check out time was impossible and in the end had to ring the front desk who take ages to answer but are very good when you re face to face , Clean comfortable and modern with great bed and shower The robes were very squidgy which was great as I spent two days recovering in a darkened room from the eye surgery I d had at Moorfields across the road The low light options were also a bonus for my particular situation

57816,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The architecture creates a very high tech fasade and esthetically that is pleasant to look at from the outside but for the staying guest the rooms get very small windows and it can be suphocating The Samsung TV did not work properly it was often freezing screen The Spa stuff lacked organization and one had the feeling that they were not communicating well with the reception stuff I found the hotel room prize did not match the quality even if the quality was good for the most iPad is Ok but iPad to switch on and off every light not necessary , Good location helpful stuff good bed quality relaxed atmosphere chic architecture in an up and coming neighborhood Good proximity to Old Street station gives easy transportation Very helpful city guide I Phone in the room a big bonus but the concierge was very good too

57818,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, This hotel is trying too hard to reach the 5 stars level but it looked more like a 4 stars hotel I would not rate it more than 4 stars There were a few things which we disliked 1 the bed was very uncomfortable there is an extra mattress put on top of the 2nd mattress which is very bad for the back and very wavy we had to remove it in order to sleep 2 the idea of having ipads to control the lights is stupid especially since the ipads are always on at night they are showing the clock and cannot be turned off so again very difficult to sleep with the ipads light next to your head at night , The location was good close to the metro stop Old Street 
57819,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The TV is slow and not responsive Half for the channels are not in English I expected a bit more from a 5 star hotel , The bed was very comfy and the room layout was something different which I liked The technology within the room was very good

57831,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The guy that checked us in didn t explain everything clearly to us where everything was etc The room was freezing cold at night had to call reception to heat it up and it then still didn t get warm until the next morning And for a 5 star hotel there should of been a mirror in the lift It s more of a 4 star hotel I would say , Loved the spa it was beautiful And the surprise birthday balloons and cake the hotel staff left in the room for our birthday stay And the champagne you got when you arrived on entrance Was really nice Miss the mornings at the spa was really nice

57836,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Sadly the technology lets this hotel down They seem to be going through quite a problem with it I ve stayed twice now and it s been a major problem both times TV didn t work properly this time and didn t work at all the last time i stayed Had to move rooms because the room controls for lights etc on the panel in the wall didn t work There are no normal light switches the whole room is controlled dependent on wall panel technology and bedside tablets ipads which also suffers from a time lag when you tap it and is not user friendly Staff were fantastic in trying to compensate for the inconvenience but there is sadly only so much they can do even the IT maintenance guys They outsource the hotels TV and room controls etc and it is this company that needs to be changed sort it out sacked ,No Positive
57837,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Small reception area can get a littlie bit crowded if busy, Hospitality at its highest level modern rooms good location and most importantly great value

57841,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Using the spa with approx 7 people taking constant selfies and photos in the spa area It s quite a small area so we were aware we were in quite a number of their pictures in our swimwear It was really uncomfortable We didn t realise until afterwards that they are banned but despite staff walking through constantly they never told anyone to put them away Also I stayed two weeks in a row The first week there was no robes in the room The second quite a lot of the toiletries which had been there the first week weren t there Plus we had to wait 30 mins after check in for our room and it still wasn t even ready We had to be allocated a different room , The hotel was in a good location for bars and restaurants The staff were lovely 
57842,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The shower could ve been a tiny bit more powerful but it was alright And maybe a birthday message from the hotel would ve been nice on the day of my birthday Didn t think I d have to request it , Just about everything The bed was the most comfortable thing I d ever felt 
57843,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The TV didn t have many of the basic channels also the connection kept going The pool facilities was too busy full of young people making too much noise Also we had a treatment in the spa the room they put us in was near the reception which was no problem however the amount of noise the staff were making outside the door laughing i didn t get a chance to enjoy my treatment , The room was amazing the bed was one of the most comfortable i ve slept in The equipment they have to control the facilities in the rooms are fabulous you don t even need to step out of the bed to close the curtains

57845,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Both check in on Friday afternoon was pretty chaotic with only 2 people initially on the desks and several concierges asking you questions adding to the confusion Suggest more reception staff and fewer concierges Saturday morning check out looked dreadful with 15 20 in multiple queues but the team did move this through well to be fair At the moment the hotel is next to a building site Due to excellent double glazing you don t hear much but our room on 15 floor looked almost eye to eye with the crane driver Something to be cautious about in the morning , The huge rain water head shower in the bathroom was amazing and easy to use and the wash basin is designed with space all the way round it to put out toiletries and wash bags etc which so often is a problem in newer hotels Very quiet and comfortable hotel despite the building site next door and the 12 noon check out is welcome at the weekend The cocktail selection in Tonic and Remedy was brilliant with some fascinating twists on standards like Manhattans and Aperol Spritz and the service in the bar was extremely professional and friendly

57849,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Pillows could had been firmer covers were all over the place room was too hot and the spa is always fully booked when the whole trip was for the spa but disappointed, The design of the building
57850,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The wait for toast could ve been better they should let customers do their own Also the mushrooms and tomatoes should be kept away from the bacon and sausages as people were using the same tong to pick everything However because everything else was superb this was not enough to downgrade the hotel in general , The bed was amazingly comfortable I felt like booking an extra day The spa facilities the hot stone massage again amazing The hotel was gorgeously looking nice bright very modern The staff were very friendly right from the moment I stepped in the concierge offered to take my bag bubbly was offered at the desk the gentleman that checked me in gave me a nice room on the 15th floor because it was my husband s birthday All in all it was a very enjoyable stay my husband loved his surprise 
57851,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, On this occasion there were not enough toiletries in the bathroom No conditioner at all And no macaroons to great me But this is very minor and all I can find fault with , I enjoyed everything about my stay and regularly return to Montcalm The spa is wonderful staff courteous and the beds super comfy

57853,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I normally go to Montcalm for relaxation and luxury with great value for money I love to spend time in the spa this time round I took my son I booked via booking com and did not see anything in the comments about Spa age limits I have been to montcalm before and seen children in the pool so thought this was not an issue on the first night of our stay my son and I went swimming he is such a good boy aged 10 the next day we went to go and use the spa and I was told he was not allowed to enter when asked his age I told them 10 they told me he was under age This was very disheartening as my main reason for stay is to use the spa facilities my son was upset as he was allowed to use the spa the night before with no questions asked I think the hotel need to be more clear on there spa limitations especially for people who travel to this hotel as families , I love Montcalm and I stay there often This time round I had the best room ever it was bigger than ones I have had before with amazing view and huge windows I love the spa as this is the highlight of my stay

57855,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Though the high tech gadgets were kind of cool they didn t always function that well I struggled quite a bit with setting the air con to the right temperature and turning off the lights and I m normally quite tech savvy A big issue was that the display on the various gadgets wasn t very sensitive responsive Still a cool idea though , The bed was amazing and the decor was a real plus 
57856,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, They have introduced a smartphone in the room with free Wi Fi etc to take out with you during the day great idea However it was not charged when we got to the room and did not work once charged Brilliant idea if the handset was functional , Room with tablet control is amazing and spa facilities are lovely
57857,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Rude reception staff On arrival I was asked Why are you here in a very unfriendly manner The whole check in process was cold and uncomfortable , Really lovely room and gorgeous spa area 
57858,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Only one thing the wardrobes were very dark and could have done with some lights, The hotel exceeded our expectations it was fantastic Location was great Will definitely stay here again and already have been recommending to friends 
57859,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The upstairs restaurant had a very limited menu ended up going out for dinner but theres plenty of choice nearby, Extremely comfortable bed and such a clean luxury room with a lovely bath
57860,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The room has a lot of shiny black surfaces that show every mark and fingerprint In general I don t like rooms with lots of shiny black because you can see all the previous guests marks No matter how good housekeeping is at the cleaning job its impossible to get black shiny surfaces perfectly clean The room service was a problem at first with a guy on the phone who was absolutely clueless The room service menu was in transition so 4 things on the menu were no longer offered But the head chef could not have been nicer and corrected the problem pronto Very nice guy , The suite was nice and quite large The view was great The bed was very comfortable The special disco colour lighting was funny but of course I tried every colour The hotel staff was very nice and in general helpful and accomodating But I felt some of them are still in training The concierge for example recommended a restaurant in the neighbourhood that had just 2 stars on Yelp Not a good call on his part All said I would return to the M 
57861,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Everywhere was exceptionally clean and modern The spa was beautiful We were warmly welcomed both days and couldn t be more thankful for a lovely birthday stay 
57862,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, no onsite parking They have a few spaces at the side of the hotel which are always taken There are two ncp car parks but only one is 24 hour which is the one we had to use and was 55 a night , Hotel overall was exceptional You get champagne on arrival and the concierge is very helpful The hotel room had gadgets that allowed you to turn off change lights tv etc and bathroom had under floor heating Very clean and modern 
57863,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The spa changing facilities females were too small no hooks to put your stuff not enough benches no one cleaning up towels on the floor excess water everywhere no mirrors other than by the sinks This is one and only critisism of our stay , Staff very friendly and attentive facilities really good room was amazing 
57864,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, The property s decor was very modern and great to look at and the facilities were great The bed was very comfortable to sleep in I would stay again Overall i was very impressed 
57865,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Our pillows were too soft for our liking and the waterfall shower wasn t that powerful , Hotel was very modern and staff were very helpful and friendly We used the spa which is open to all guests Our mattress was extremely comfortable and breakfast was delicious 
57866,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, silly touch screens instead of lightswitches and couple of bits of poor service let the place down slightly still liked and would consider a return if necessary , nice room overall ideally located for our particular needs on this trip 
57867,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, All good aside of Expensive cocktails, Staff were extremely helpful especially the general manager Facilities excellent Rooms exceptional and cleanliness great Cocktails a little too pricey so maybe look at options of promotions so that guests stay in the bar 
57868,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Room 1519 smells a tad like old cigarette smoke which the air freshener did not completely mask There was a weird incessant thump thump thump noise in the room when I stayed there , Location is good Guys at concierge are very friendly and helpful Room is fairly spacious modern and well appointed 
57869,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The tv could have had better signal but otherwise everything was great , The spa was amazing so was the bed All the staff were friendly and helpful Prosecco on arrival and departure was great I loved it all even the room was very upgraded 
57870,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Breakfast buffet is not what I am used to in hotels that level and price , Size of rooms stylish fit out great SPA and very good sky view restaurant and frindly staff
57871,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Breakfast could have been a bit better and not have taken the juice away first when tidying up as I wanted something to drink just before I left breakfast , The hospitality of the staff in making the weekend special for my partners birthday and were very accommodating
57872,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, On arrival the receptionist was rather rude he made a fuss about payment as though my card had declined when in fact his wireless keypad was losing signal and the transaction was made several times, Gym and leisure facilities were lovely
57873,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, There are several missing tiles in the steam room Not a good look Internet was often slow odd for a tech hotel We put the clean room sign on twice in one day but housekeeping never came Soap dish in room 407 chipped in 3 places and clearly needs to be replaced but hasn t Brightness level on TV way too dark The heat produced by the mini bar is quite high and tends to warm up the snacks on the shelf on top of it melting those made with chocolate Temperature controls on the bathroom panel very confusing The tablets and room control panels in the room were laggy and often unresponsive If your hotel claims to specialise as a tech hotel it needs to work flawlessly The Eccleston Square Hotel near Victoria where we stayed 3 years ago has mastered the use of in room technology It is better integrated and you can do many more things from your in room tablet Maybe time for a research trip M Hotel , Excellent value for money For international travellers there is a smartphone you can take with you with data included to help you navigate and make the most of the city Location in zone 1 London 3 mins away from a tube station Check in time is at 2 and check out is at 12 This is exceptionally good for a large hotel Most hotels need 3 4 hours turnaround instead of 2 Nice sky lounge on top floor with lovely views Big TV in room Absolutely 0 light pollution from curtains Pillows very comfortable No noise complaints even with a vast amount construction going on next door Hotel is new so most things are in good condition Beds huge even in entry level rooms Large sized rooms well above average for London Room service very fast Gentleman in charge of downstairs bar extremely friendly and knowledgeable Thank you for a great stay Would definitely stay here again and would recommend to others 
57874,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, staff were polite but could have been more friendly, The bed was really comfy and the room was to a very high standard very clean and very modern would definitely recommend and will return
57875,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Although the tablets were cool and modern they didn t turn off properly at night so it took a bit longer to get to sleep at night Also heating took a while to heat up but when it was it was great , Everything was clean we loved the spa facilities and the room was cool using the tablets to operate everything and the bed was really comfy Staff are always on hand if you need anything Overall our stay was amazing 
57876,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, The bed was very comfortable Breakfast choice was good and tasty Staff were very polite and helpful We only stayed one night and didn t get chance to enjoy the facilities We would stay here again though in the future 
57877,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Gadgets in the room were a little slow at working wifi wasn t the best , Lovely and very helpful staff Clean and comfortable and very smart A lovely stay
57878,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, That our room was not ready at 15 36 When check in was at 14 00 It was disappointing to know that I had paid from 14 00 12 00 and my room was not ready and we was told we had to wait 30 mins Very disappointed Had to call for the manager who was able to facilitate a room however he just authorised a room change and walked off without apologising Customer service we did not expect to experience here, The spa area and the up to date technology in the rooms
57879,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Music in the room would be nice to have port available to hook up my phone to play music but tbh the staff got me speaker dock So it wasn t actually problem at all , The room was spoitless and clean it had all the modern gadgets no light switches everything controlled with master control pad And the staff were more than happy to help show me how to work them 
57880,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I stayed 4 or 5 times at this hotel each time something shampoo water etc is missed out in the room the check in is very lengthy at the reception , Location pool
57881,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Everything was wonderful right from our welcome with a glass of prosecco the frielndly helpful staff and the perfectly equipped and comfy room The location is perfect for exploring Shoreditch The added bonus cakes fruit and balloons for the birthday boy delivered with a smile Only wish wed booked for longer to make use of the spa Will just have to go back 
57882,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Nothing , The hospitality My booking went wrong with M by Montcalm and they moved me to this hotel We were given a free bar an upgrade and also complimentary breakfast in the morning It was nice for an mistake to be rectified so beautifully Thank you x
57883,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I was unhappy about the system not being able to connect to my phone to play music but besides this it was perfect Still worth it , The pool facilities and spa were perfect Room was great exactly what you d expect of that standard and staff are extremely polite 
57884,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Everything was fantastic especially the incredibly comfortable beds The staff were amazing and really looked after us The hotel is a quiet oasis in the centre of the city We are local and decided to shut ourselves away with use of the spa Great views of the city too Highly recommend 
57885,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I think a Continental Breakfast could be included in the price I know it s central London and everything is on another scale wrt cost but a glass of juice some coffee and a crosient wouldn t break the budget In any case there is a really good Pret a Manger 15m from the entrance, Great hotel modern clean with high tech bedrooms befitting London s Silicon Roundabout Lots of facilities pool Spa etc My visit was connected with Moorfields Eye Hospital which is directly across the road so location could not be better for my purposes 
57886,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Made a special request on my booking and hotel did not provide No toothpaste in bathroom View was construction site , I liked the technology in the room and the different light settings 
57887,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, One family friend travelled hours to meet us Left a message at reception he was in the area After leaving the hotel 2 weeks later we found out they never gave us the message , The wifi was top notch easy to access and ultra fast 
57888,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The chairs in the bar area are trendy but not the most comfortable The dining room had chipped tables and breakfast was self service not quite high star expectation We did not appreciate a service charge being added on the bar tab but the option to take this off was taken away from us as they charged our card BEFORE printing off the itemised bill If food is NOT being served in the bar in the evening then menus etc should be removed from the tables Our room had an interconnecting door and we could hear the neighbours and their TV , The location was good 
57889,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Made to feel a little uncomfortable when asking about the pool spa facilities with a child in tow Also wasn t able to get a table at Tonic and Remedy which was a bit of shame as it was our son s birthday and bar staff restaurant staff not very friendly , A great high tech high spec hotel Lot s of great facilities nice and close to the tube 
57890,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The only thing that wasn t good about my stay was check in Somewhere along the line booking com had missed a trick and not shared my booking with the M by Montcalm reservations team Because of this it took 30 minutes to check in which made me late to the birthday dinner I was attending around the corner Also the heating was a bit tricky to get my head around I don t think the under floor heating worked in my room , Everything was honestly fantastic
57891,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Room service was poor they rarely answered the phone and then offered us a 45 minute wait for a salad at an off peak time We gave up on it in the end , The bed was exceptionally comfy and the room was huge and very clean The spa was lovely 
57892,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, A welcome book in the room with instructions not a techy couple so took a while to work everything out , Great welcome soft robes aroma box hi tech experience room comfortable clean leisure facilities were clean and calming 
57893,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, No Mirror in room the rest of my party had full length mirrors 1206 doesn t have one, Really comfy beds luxurious rooms spa area Helpful and friendly staff
57894,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, When I arrived at the hotel it seemed as if they had overbooked for that evening as they asked if I would move to a different hotel As my friends were staying at the M I was not keen to move and so the position of my room was not so great right by the elevators , The room was nicely decorated with a big tv The bed was very comfortable and I really enjoyed used the tablets to open and close the curtains and change the mood lighting 
57895,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Breakfast was good even though we had to ask for milk more tea coffee toast and when we got there we wee told that we didn t have breakfast even though I had already spoken to reception and was told the same and then the ladie said yes we ok to have breakfast now she had checked so was a bit embarrassing 
57896,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Didn t try the breakfast but for everything we did try couldn t fault it , Going to go with the recommended here the bed was definitely like a fluffy cloud The lighting in the bedroom was fun and made you really feel comfortable without it being too bright and in your face Under floor heating for the bathroom just yes 
57897,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The iron in the room leaked on my clothes it was broken However I called concierge and they replaced immediately , The hotel was amazing very clean and extra confortable beds I proposed to my girlfriend on this trip to which I gave a heads up to the hotel They went above and beyond to make our stay special and even upgraded us to a better room Ive stayed in many hotels across London but I couldn t recommend this hotel enough We very much look forward to returning on our next trip to London 
57898,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Excellent friendly and very helpful staff at reception room very comfortable Very nice room especially for London standards Perfect location for the Hip part of town 
57899,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Room was a bit cold and controls didnt seem to heat it up much, Overall was lovely bathroom and room technology was 1st class Super fast wifi in all areas Excellent breakfast which was brought to our room as well
57900,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, nothing, the room was excellent staff attentive and helpful gave us complimentary cake and bubbles as it was my wife s 50th birthday location fab 3 mins from tube 
57901,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Very high tech Probably due to our age but we struggled to get the TV to work and also the lights turning them off was an interesting experience providing us with an exciting light show when we were trying to switch them off , The bathroom and size of the bedroom were good Breakfast was nothing to write home about and the coffee was fairly uninteresting Staff were mostly very friendly 
57902,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I paid 75 for parking which was ridiculous I think it s a big shame and downfall that parking isn t provided The spa was average The steam room wasn t working , The hotel room was amazing and I was very happy 
57903,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, No complimentaries in the room tea biscuits or water fully booked spa with no warning this would be the case , The hotel was gorgeous very impressive tech 
57904,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, For a hotel that charges over 300 per night I was disappointed by several things Most importantly the king sized bed had two mattresses both were of exceptionally poor quality but one of them had s massive hole in the middle after my boyfriend and I sat on it to watch TV for 30 minutes and neither of us are big sized people We couldn t use that side of the bed at all and ended up sleeping on the other side We did not have a good night s sleep which was a key reason I had been willing to pay this amount of money in the first place Secondly the room had no slippers or dressing gowns I d expect this to be standard for a hotel in this price range Lastly the hotel has an elaborate electronic system to control lighting hearing curtains and the TV Impressive at first look until you realize that it s very hard to use and it s impossible to get a light or temperature setting that s actually comfortable It would have been far better if this money had been invested in good quality mattresses , Spa facilities are nice as was the warm welcome by the receptionist however three showers were insufficient and after waiting 10 minutes to use one after my swim I gave up and went back to my room wrapped in towels as the spa didn t have robes available 
57905,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Our room wasn t clean after the 1st night we stayed 2 nights Bathrobes were missing and never arrived We had to show the same credit card used to book the room it was a gift by another person we had to call him over embarrassing , It s really 2 minutes far from the tube station 
57906,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Well the tv s didn t look bright enough maybe because of the adde frame to it , The look and feel was very impressive Modern day technology on point Cleanliness can also be mentioned 
57907,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I thought the staff were a bit rude They were standing at the desk laughing and holding a piece of paper up over their faces so no one could see what they were talking about Made me feel really uncomfortable however I was there simply for a nights stay so the staff didn t bother me, I loved the rooms They were so so lovely The location was good for us as we were going out in shoreditch
57908,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The staff were not very welcoming they don t understand English Rude restaurant manager on ground floor went for dinner at 22 30 he stopped using at the bottom of the stairs as we were entering the restaurant to tell us have grazing at the bar he didn t even allow us to enter before telling us that The receptionist was rude at checkout in I ask what time was breakfast and which floor was steam room she responded I told you previously so rude She had a European accent most staff were European even that restaurants manager no courtesy at all they all need customer service training Upon entering the room is observed that the bathroom floor was soiled I rang them they send house keeper up who told me it s damaged tile I ask to move to another room However after I had move to the next room went to the steam room upon return the keys could not open the door once again had to take it back to front desk to reprogrammed The hotel has too many high tech with no ambience also high tech that is inadequate television doesn t work properly I was happy it was one night stay I will always use hotel with English speaking staff who are very courteous and professional I paid for a service not to be treated in that manner , Nothing
57909,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Showers in the spa are broken with lime scale Only 1 towel provided in the room shower room We requested a high floor room but were given floor 3 the room wasn t very nice although they assured us it was an upgrade it was very small and cramped The staff were cold and stand offish We informed them that we did t like the room and it looked much smaller then the website they replied that the images on the website are only a guide Which I think translates to they show larger sample rooms then what s actually on offer , Location 
57910,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Small power cut but we didn t let it effect our time, Staff were nice especially one gentleman who gave us a late seat at breakfast and really helped up out I don t know his name he seemed like a bar restaurant manager with a French accent Really took care of us 
57911,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Breakfast was abit chaotic First morning it took about 5 requests for coffee but this improved , Bed very comfortable Room nice Electronics lighting etc a bit baffling but we got there in the end Lifts good spa and gym good 
57912,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The fact that we were automatically charged a discretionary service charge of 12 5 for a self service English breakfast already priced at 22 per person The most expensive English breakfast I have encountered in a London hotel We did have the service charge refunded on request , The room was excellent and very modern One of the best we have stayed in The bed was extremely comfortable 
57913,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The bed was lumpy on my first night due to the mattress topper I asked for it to be change and it was done almost immediately , Everything This place is just incredible The automated lighting curtins underfloor heating They check up on you during the day if you require anything It was great 
57914,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Cleaning women every day forgat to add shampoo or towel she manage to forget even her cleaning equipments in the room on our suitcase Two mornings fire alarm went on very loud and twice all lights went off in the room nothing was working very modern sistem but they corect it very quick, Nice hotel modern room nice personal at the recepcion 
57915,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The fines in the rooms was down And staff took too long to answer which was annoying plus there s a lot of workers there that can t speak English which was annoying, Took my partner for he s birthday he was impressed from the rooms to the food And we ve rebooked to go back Defo worth the money 
57916,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Breakfast was very busy and hectic but food was nice Sound quality was not clear on the tv in our room , We liked the technology in the room The evening meal was very nice good quality of food Bathroom was lovely and our room was very clean and comfy Staff are friendly 
57917,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Staff slow or unresponsive Had to call reception multiple times to have a simple question answered but there was never a reply Check in was very slow, Very spacious Comfy Gadgets were great
57918,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Absolutely spectacular hotel amazing features and brilliant staff Everything was very high tech but easy to use You definitely get what your paying for We very much enjoyed our stay at the Montcalm and look forward to coming back soon 
57919,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Room service menue is quite pricey and limited , Room is electronically controlled like the lighting heated bathroom floor etc The bed is comfy and everything was clean Best hotel I ve stayed in so far 
57920,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Breakfast very limited spa area not very clean rooms are small and all this fancy technology with operating lights totally useless Our bed was the most uncomfortable bed I ve slept in The crowd in the hotel was mostly young people and very loud in the corridor at around 1am We also had a fire alarm two days in the row one at 2am and the next at 8am Our stay therefore wasn t as relaxing as we wished , This is not a five star hotel Staff is very friendly though
57921,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Nothing, Everything Beautiful hotel amazing facilities and very helpful staff Big rooms big comfortable beds huge shower lovely desk area and Large TV Loved the touchpad controls really adds to the rooms Would reccommend to anyone and I will most defo be coming back 
57922,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, the toilet is not designed well with the water does not flush very well , Bed is very comfy the hotel is very modern and high tech and very convenient location as well 
57923,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, New stylish fantastic hotel I will recommend anyone to stay Here That staff was friendly helpful and best of all was peaceful Will I stay again Hell yes
57924,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Unhealthy room service options eat fish vegetarian was not told Xmas parties in whilst booking so could not dine from restaurant or order room service off the menu no one seemed to know if restaurant open to guests asked 5 different people Asked for new key as mine faulty was not asked for name etc just my room number , Great rooms
57925,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I think information given at reception about the hotel could be better I was just told my room number and to go round to the right to the lifts No information regarding food the bar WiFi check out time spa or gym facilities , The bed was very comfortable and the shower was good the location was also good 
57926,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The service from the front desk staff was absolutely terrible with no greeting poor service and causing me to speak to the manager to address the poor level of customer service , The gym and spa facilities were very nice 
57927,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Due to the hotel system we have to move another place Till now I have not received electronic bill and the credit card is still not released , Reception is very professional 
57928,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Loved all the gadgets in the room the bed was so comfy and the coffee machine in the room was a nice touch I will definitely be returning to this hotel Ps free prosecco on arrival
57929,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, On this occasion I decided to drive 210 miles when I arrived 9am rush hour time the parking space had been coned off so I could not stop outside the hotel to unload baggage With no option I had to park in the taxi bay whilst I ran in to concierge when I returned a taxi driver had been blaring his horn at my girlfriend so it was quite a stressful arrival When I called to enquire about the bath butler service I was offered a room with a bath which I accepted But when I arrived in the room the bath wasn t really big enough to really enjoy the bath butler service PLUS we didn t have the usual amazing walk in shower Also we were unable to use the upstairs bar due to a private party I STILL THINK ITS A GREAT HOTEL BUT IT WASN T AS WONDERFUL THIS TIME AS I KNOW IT CAN BE , Staff are always excellent and make you feel like a returning friend they speak to you as an individual The place always smells nice The rooms are immaculate
57930,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The Air spray which kept going all through the night and was far to strong, The bed was extremely comfortable and staff friendly and offered excellent service
57931,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, The room and spa were amazing and the breakfast catered for everyone complementary champagne and room upgrade to a junior suite was a fantastic surprise 
57932,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, That some guests were offered prosecco we weren t and made me feel not good enough to be offered a glass I was a paying guest the same as the others checking in , Everything in the room was amazing the high tech gadgets and complimentary water and fruit in the room was a lovely treat and then there was fruit and flavoured water in the totally amazing spa 
57933,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Service slightly slow in initial bar area but I think they had just opened, All of the staff were friendly from the moment you walked in the facilities were faultless and it was so easy to find because of the amazing external look of the building 
57934,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Slow check in and having to wait for the room , The spa and rooms were amazing and the location was fantastic right near the tube station and easy to find Not far from Kings Cross on the tube 
57935,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, It was disappointing to have the overly complex lighting system break down immediately on arrival in our room it took some of the joy and excitement out of our stay Secondly re the food in the restaurant the food was very expensive for the portion size I ordered cod fillet as a main course and got a starter sized portion, Location great Building is a design classic Pool lovely Room great Slightly Let down by the lighting system not working which meant we had to be moved to another room However the situation was redeemed by us being offered a refund of the upgrade charge 50 
57936,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, out of choice we would have prefered a room away from the lifts however this was only a minor thing , the check in and overall manner to us was excellent Polite friendly and very professional The room was clean and warm upon arrival and our case had been taken to our room earlier Breakfast was good and very relaxed Look forward to returning here again soon 
57937,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Staff are totally incompetent Faulty Towers has nothing on this place I endured a catalogue of errors including money taken from my account not once but 3 times The net result was that they totally ruined my birthday The clearly don t care because i m not the first to complain about staff competency I was also less than impressed to be staying at a hotel in London on a Saturday and being asked for my last drinks order just before midnight When I questioned why it was so early I was snapped at by the rude little man who frankly was a shade off aggressive I had another stay booked for March but I will be cancelling it , Hotel is amazing very modern and well equipped
57938,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, not sound proof in the room as promised TV was taking too long to load buffering issues for the standard of the hotel no signage outside the lift to the pool side resturant etc swimming pool was cold water for both days that i used it not well thought out changing room for the spa area , Friendly staff across the board Nice warm room Easy to get around the hotel 
57939,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, iPad controls in room did not work well annoying TV temperamental Fire alarm went off very scary it was a false alarm, Dinner in the restaurant was very good good location 
57940,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Seemed like technology was in the room for the sake of it the TV was hard to work there was some weird humidifier I couldn t work out and I think for the price some kind of music player should be included in the room, Very stylish
57941,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Honestly the room was not super clean since it is a 5 stars hotel compared to hotel standard 5 stars hotel I have been in many countries around the world Furthermore the buffet breakfast was really not so wide choice , free fresh fruit in the room and in the common areas of the hotel Useful in room free breakfast snack corner 
57942,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Nothing really , I loved the spa It was a lovely touch and we got upgraded because it was my birthday too The suite we were in was lovely The skyline bar was a great touch as well 
57943,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, A brief guide on how to use the facilities in the room and hotel would have made this the perfect venue , Genuine 5 star quality with excellent rooms and outstanding service and all at a reasonable price for central London Electronic controls in the room worked perfectly and bed was very comfortable 
57944,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Pillows were not comfortable so had a terrible sleep The water from the shower had very little pressure even when adjusted to the maximum The all so tech gadget that runs the lights and air con etc froze and crashed a few times so I couldn t even turn the light out or put my air con on The tv signal kept on scrambling so I couldn t even watch a movie , Modern looking apartments but that is all everything else was poor
57945,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The in room switches and controls are very high tech one night wasn t long enough to figure out how everything worked , The architecture is stunning The room was very comfortable Top two floors bar lounge and restaurant are amazing 
57946,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Live in north west London booked for a romantic night close to the action Awful check in experience ruined our stay I had asked the hotel to allow my partner to check in as she was arriving before me via booking com unfortunately the gentleman on the desk couldn t help her he said he couldn t see the note fair enough but you have my card and you have me on the phone with the booking number etc it s a one night booking and you have the power to charge the card anyway as you would if I hadn t turned up I rushed from the other side of the city only to find my girlfriend sat in the lobby almost an hour later perhaps the hotel could have given her a tea or somewhere to change for our evening out When I talked to the lady who was now on the desk she was baffled as to why the person my partner had dealt with while I was also available on the phone had not just charged the card on file and let her into the room All together the knock on effect was that I had to conduct my business activities planned for Friday afternoon on Saturday meaning that we didn t get to enjoy the facilities we missed our evening reservation at a restaurant in Hoxton and my treat for my other half was essentially ruined by a lack of competency from the man on the front desk The hotel made absolutely no attempt to try to make things right You will see from my other reviews that I am balanced and fair in my feedback , The room was clean one of the cleanest I have ever seen and comfortable The Hotel s location is great 
57947,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, TV not good kept streaming and freezing up on the screen Very disappointing considering all the other hi tech stuff The TV has to work Other than that I couldn t fault the hotel,No Positive
57948,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, My room was not ready until 2 so we went and had something to eat and went back at 2 then it still wasn t ready they said they would come to us at the bar when it was no one did we had to go to the desk about 4 times to ask for them to keep saying it was in progress annoying when we had tickets to go somewhere and needed to get ready and freshen up ended up rushing about and been 5 mins late, The tablets beside the bed and the spa was excellent
57949,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The check in could have been quicker but it was busy so it was slightly understandable, This hotel had no faults Everything was perfect from the staff to the spa Worth every penny I was given complimentary cupcakes and wine for my birthday such lovely people Thank you for such a pleasant stay xx
57950,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, However this time the attention I received was very poor The check in took very long I asked for a room with separate beds and they asked to wait for them to prepare the room accordingly they proposed us to go to the spa in the meantime we decided to visit London and at the end of the day when I went to my room I realized that they have done nothing The beds were still not separated I called the reception and they told me that my room didn t allow have separate beds I asked then to change room and they told me that the hotel was full at breakfast the waiter was too distracted I had to constantly call him to bring us the coffee the toasts last time I stayed that was done proactively and the clients didn t have to have their hand raised all the time Some of the touch screen on my room don t work which was quite uncomfortable to switch on off lights The spa was not very clean and smelled humidity and the cleaning of my room was also very poor I was recommending this hotel to my work colleagues but definitely I will not recommend this hotel anymore , It s not the first time that I stay in this hotel I like the spa and the confort of the rooms location is also good close to the subway and a lot of bus lines 
57951,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Very poor meal in the restaurant service average at best when we said our meal was just ok due to very tough steak and poor description of the meal we received a blank look no apology The couple on the next table had the same problem as seafood wasn t listed and the customer was allergic Food very inferior and over priced compared with some amazing places in London , convenience of hotel to moorfields 
57952,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, One of the best hotels I ve stayed in Staff were so friendly took our luggage as soon as we walked in and escorted us to our room The rooms were always spotless every time we returned and the technology side was amazing we were so fascinated The bed was so comfortable we did not want to leave I will be returning for sure 
57953,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Room wasn t quite ready for 2pm check in may have been because the extra birthday suprise, Breakfast was delicious pool was fantastic along side spa facilities comfy bed great view amazing technology free cupcakes and procesco as if was my birthday
57954,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, M has bet big on tech The room is wired and everything works via ipads Unfortunately this can also make things cumbersome sometimes like turning on lights and when it doesn t work like my TV didn t work you end up with two remotes , M is a real full on hotel The views from the lounge are great and the staff are keen to help 
57955,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The android tablets in the room used to control the lights heating curtains etc I want to put this as a positive feature but sadly they were terrible to use very slow response and kept crashing Heating was hard to control would either get too hot or cold and couldn t just choose a temperature and let the room maintain it had to keep changing whether I wanted it heated or cooled every hour or so The TV was very unclear slow to respond and kept crashing every 3 4 minutes became completely unusable , Informed hotel it was my wife s birthday and was surprised to find balloons and cupcakes in the room Really sweet Staff were all pleasant and attentive Felt taken care of 
57956,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Over complicated controls for everything via iPad which didn t work well and I do own an Apple iPad Tv didn t work properly couldn t get the guide up poor signal We were allocated a disabled room which we didn t want The shower was fiddly and poor pressure , Bed was good and general room layout size The bar down by the lobby was good staff very friendly and knowledgeable Alberto gabby prices quite high though 
57957,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The room was nice but the view wasn t the best Other TV was not working properly we asked to change rooms but was told no and someone would come fix the TV Still didn t work properly , Beautiful hotel Stayed here for 2 nights for my boyfriends birthday the bed was sooo comfy Lovely welcoming staff The spa was beautiful Definitely would go back Location was also good lots of places to eat No parking for free or even a decent price 
57958,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Breakfast wasn t very good Choice was very poor Quality of tea served was poor Definitely was not a 5 choice Serving staff were just ok , Room was spacious clean and very modern It was very high tech My son really enjoyed his stay Reception staff were very friendly and very helpful View from 16th floor lounge was amazing 
57959,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Great location 2 mins from Old Street tube Excellent service from the minute we walked in the door the staff could not do enough for us plus the comfiest hotel bed I ve ever stayed in Will definately be going back again 
57960,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Some white stuff all over wardrobe only one dressing gown asked for another It it never arrived super long wait at check in and nobody said sorry, New trendy hotel great bars 
57961,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, We went for brunch to the top floor restaurant and they had absolutely nothing for a vegan and weren t even apologetic My friend asked for avocado on toast but everything had cream and butter in I would have expected someone to run downstairs to Sainsbury s for an avocado , Check in is quite long and busy but the free glass of prosecco was a lovely touch We were here for a bridal shower and they sent up a free bottle of prosecco to our room 
57962,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Technology in room was poor lighting was slow to respond to the touch pad which was frustrating The Information delivering aspect of the TV led nowhere and as there was no other way of finding out about the spa dining options etc we resorted to googling Just give us an in room brochure for god s sake The staff tried hard but lacked training On arrival we were given a room to discover a different name on the room key folder On informing staff this we waited in the room to be told what to do receiving a phone call to say there was a computer glitch Luckily we didn t avail ourselves of the facilities as another couple arrived and let themselves in the room shocking for them and us On arriving at the breakfast area we were not offered tea or coffee for ages This happened both mornings Despite our full English breakfast being included in the price we paid I was told that if I wanted porridge that would be 7 extra Yes I could have had ham cheese pastries as well as cooked breakfast which looked very nice but the only cereals on offer were bran flakes and special K I then waited 10 minutes after asking 2 staff members for a cereal bowl argh Confusingly 15 floors above us was another breakfast area for those receiving Continental breakfast again not initially explained by staff or room info Unfortunately although this hotel has the potential to be great it was not good enough for five stars and we won t return the quest for the perfect London hotel continues , The room was lovely good comfy bed great shower etc The hotel is in a great location for enjoying East London and still being accessible for the West End and South London which is what we were looking for when visiting family in London
57963,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Noticed the cups in my bathroom had not been changed making me question how thoroughly the room had been cleaned , Extra fluffy comfortable beds Staff very obliging and happy to give me a free room upgrade Spa is amazing complete with a pool sauna steam room and ice room for cooling down Great for beating that London chill 
57964,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I couldn t really find anything wrong with the rooms or the stay in the hotel , The bed was extra comfy and the facililties were amazing My favourite thing was how everything was controlled by tablet Staff were really friendly 
57965,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Everything in the room is high tech touch pad ultra modern Bed was super comfy shower fabulous Close to subway station so very easy to go anywhere in London Ps they always have a big bowl of apples and oranges on the reception desk 
57966,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Staff where unaware of what time the bar closed bar staff and reception poor communication we had to check ourselves as reception didn t have much of a clue when the pool closed either , Beds where comfy facilities are good
57967,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I was never made aware of the fact that if we were to use the mini bar in the room that we had to pay at the end I was confused as to why I paid a fair amount for a room for one night and that the mini bar was not included it needs to be made more clear to guests about the mini bar because it wasn t a nice surprise when it came to leaving the hotel and that I had to pay quite a bit more , The room was amazing and the shower was very very nice Being able to control the lighting from the bed was also a massive bonus The room as a whole was lovely 
57968,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The media station didn t work in our room and nobody came to help us even though we asked 4 times One staff member didn t even seem to know what I was taking about when I told her it was nt working Not ideal when it s part of the reason you booked the hotel We also got asked 3 times if we wanted to move to their new hotel in a different location which we didn t and it became annoying being asked I just wanted the room spec to be what it is described as and for things to be working or fixed , The bed was really comfy The electric curtains were a nice touch and I loved the mood lighting The TV is a good size 
57969,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, This is a personal preference but the bed was so soft it was uncomfortable What really put me out was that everything was controlled by touch pads There were several in the room that glowed at night enough to bother me Furthermore these did not work properly when I arrived and were only fixed after calling maintenance who restarted the system twice On my third night the power completely went out only in my room and since I couldn t call down I went downstairs and then couldn t get back in the room since the card reader didn t work either Lastly I didn t like paying up front for the entire stay This didn t give me a choice if I wanted to switch hotels or if I was staying with a friend I did book a refundable room , The hotel spa has a nice pool and hot tub It s walking distance to Shoreditch and Liverpool Street 
57970,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Some instructions on how to use the technology in the rooms would be a big help , Decor facilities attention to detail The room was well equipped and the bathroom spacious and very comfortable 
57971,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Check in was a bit difficult Our daughter paid for the accommodation prior to our arrival Seemed to be an issue and even after copies taken of our passports and a credit card given for further expenses our daughter was required to provide her credit card that she had used and hand it over for an impression plus provide evidence of her identity We were then asked on leaving whether we wanted the accommodation bill to be emailed to us Didn t make us feel like 5 star customers , Excellent facilities
57972,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The chair in the room had some hairs on it which leads me to think maybe it wasn t cleaned properly but that could ve been a minor oversight, The hotel and facilities are very nice The stafff is friendly and accommodating I can t wait to stay here again
57973,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I travel often to London for business and have to say this is the worst experience I have had at a hotel The television wasn t working the tablet for controling the lights was laggy and the phone had to be repaired twice Something as simple as the number to call reception was nowhere to be found Also reception was not very friendly , The only decent thing about this hotel was the location 
57974,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The Spa should be a place of tranquility The hotel needs to stop people using mobile phones there and especially use of cameras, Superb room and faciliries
57975,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Rooms are not A S l argentina ad in otterrai hotels we stayed, Room very confortabile with many gadgets like handy a free mobile device
57976,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The TV channel selection was very bad and the reception wasn t great so it kept cutting out The bed could have been bigger , We were upgraded as it was our first visit which was a nice touch Staff were very friendly The spa was lovely and was at no extra cost 
57977,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The high tech aspect was fine but a bit irritating not to be able to simply flick a bedside lamp on at night glow from iPads round the room annoying Pillows disappointing for quality of room, Comfortable room great shower appreciated nespresso and excellent coffee selection Great cocktails

57988,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The room audio system It should work better in 2016, Gimmicks in the rooms for electrics are cool but don t work One light would not switch off Also the sound in the tv was poor 
57989,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Some of the cleaning staff were abit clueless as i had asked them where the spa facilities were and they responded unprofessionally The TV speakers were abit faulty and the maximum loudness the tv could go was 25 Was quite difficult to head the TV as it was quite far from the bed however its a minor issue , From the moment we stepped into the hotel one of the staff took in our baggaging while we checked in and brought it up to the 15th floor to our room excellent service If you want relaxation the spa facilities is perfect Ideal for couples highly recommended

58014,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Small niggle but the pillows were very uncomfortable would benefit from providing a pillow menu like some other hotels or a least a couple of other spare pillows to accommodate guest needs The touchscreen tablets weren t the most responsive things in your universe which made simple tasks like turning off the lights rather taxing Also lots of building work going on next door so not the greatest immediate view but we could see beyond to the Gerkin from our window As I said only silly niggles , Very modern and impressive building High tech room with features like lights mood lighting curtains and media centre controlled by touchscreen tablets Mobile phone provided for use whilst out and about in London if required Lovely spa facilities Fab views of the city from the bar restaurant Cool location in Shoreditch out of the hustle and bustle of central London but within walking distance of great restaurants and places of interest such as Spitalfields and Brickyard Markets Excellent value for London

58039,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Bath was a bit low but shower was great , Room facilities were grey however floor heating in bathroom didn t work bedding and robe slippers were comfortable The spa facilities were great Enjoyed a deep tissue massage steam room and sauna also the pool jacuzzi were great 
58040,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The bathroom facilities were not as good as I was hoping for no bath and the view from the window was a construction site So in the morning not only did we have the sun coming through the curtains due to them being to small but we had the noise from the builders working for 6am , Very clean and Morden 
58041,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Could not criticize at all Pool spa fantastic Recommended , The hotel is absolutely second to none if you like modern high tec modern hotels We did even though we are getting on Fabulous alround You can lay on the fabulous comfortable bed and control everything via a tablet Spotlessly clean and attention to detail Recommended 
58042,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The food prices in the hotel were extremely expensive the pool has no deep end making it difficult for those who want to swim , Enjoyed my stay at the hotel the room was excellent and so was the swimming pool the room was very clean and modern bed was also very comfortable 
58043,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The only things that let this hotel down is the staff We re rude on arrival and not very helpful tried to call reception four times during our stay because our iPad was not responding but nobody picked up Asked about a late check out was happy to pay more but the girl who served us just didn t seem to know anything said we could stay tell 2 but I was concerned so checked with another member of stuff who told us we had to call the next day All very strange to me that such a high rated hotel stuff have such poor knowledge skills and attitude , Spent the weekend here for our 2 year anniversary Was in a great location and easy to get to Our room was nice and clean and the pool spar was just what we needed after a busy night out in shoredich 
58044,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Food though excellent was expensive as were the cocktails but 2 for 1 happy hour eased the pain , Excellent location for the Northern Line from Euston Hotel is distinctive and modern in design The lobby was attractive modern with clean lines and gorgeous flower decorations which added to the sense of class Booking in was easy and the concierge services efficient The room was splendid So much attention to detail which makes such a positive difference From the extra king size bed to the underfloor heating in the bathroom to the high tech tablets to control lighting and the temperature everything was lovely Extremely impressed and will definitely return 
58045,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Need more parking options Also for disabled Breakfast could be a touch better , The pool area Late swimming available Cleanliness modern Room controls mood lights 
58046,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Think they should do something a little bot more spectacular with their spa Was relaxing however boring , Everything was top notch Staff were very nice and welcoming 
58047,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Room was not made up by the late afternoon When we asked them to do so we had to wait one hour TV did not work all the time One of the hi tech control units in the room did not work,No Positive
58048,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I booked a double room and expected a double bed however I got 2 single beds with 2 covers just put together, Really enjoyed the view from the room the room itself and most of all the swimming pool 
58049,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I was lied at check in that a deposit would not be charged that only the pre booking on my credit card for the first nights stay would be charged and I paid the balance when I checked in However the hotel had charged the full stay on my credit card as well as blocked another full amount despite the booking being no deposit and me being assured that no deposit would be taken I get charged interest until hotel decides to release the money and it pisses me off that I wasn t told about this Otherwise good stay , Excellent location cool looking rooms free android phone for the duration of the stay with Internet credit and as we got a good deal then excellent value for money also 
58050,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, This was my second time coming back to the Hotel as me my partner love it so much It s such a good price you most defiantly get what you pay for An absolutely beautiful laid out room spa swimming pool open until 9PM Really good location also a nice get away if you want to relax esp by the spa all day it s perfect 
58051,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Apparently the pool is not for swimming just for walking inside breakfast was nice apart from the sausages could be more cooked Breakfast could do with more juice or smoothies considering it is 29 per head , Great staff good location nice rooms
58052,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, 2 things 1 Wifi was a bit dodgy at times 2 A c via the tablet control was a bit delayed But both worked great for the most part Other than that amazing , I booked this hotel last minute after an Airbnb fell through It is the best hotel I have stayed in anywhere and will be my new got in London Here are some reasons why Location Shoreditch is an awesome up and coming area of London surrounded by great food and a great night life Trendy hipster and authentic people abound Nespresso machine in room Free top line coffee in room each morning with biscuit Perfect after a Shoreditch night Fully automated room controlled by tablet All lights A C tv curtains are controlled by a tablet both at the front of the room and in your bed Forget to hit a light before getting in bed No worries Handy telephone provided Hotel provided a cell equipped with 3G capabilities to use around the city for free Amazing for international travelers trying to get around without data service beautiful facilities for good price The size of the room and bathroom and quality of all was amazing considering a price around 200 Incredible deal 
58053,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Ordered Room service the person who took my order sounded exasperated with me for confirming my order was correct, All your staff were excellent apart from one
58054,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, My partner and I had another lovely stay in M by Montcalm while we celebrated his birthday I let the hotel know in advance that it was a special occasion and when we arrived we found our room had been upgraded and lots of special touches added Adorable As normal our room was not only clean and comfy but huge too We re a big fan of the way everything can be controlled by the tablets and love how everything you could need is available in the room already We also made sure to take advantage of the pool and spa which is a really brilliant addition On top of that the hotel is in such a handy location meaning we were never far away from where we wanted to be We couldn t have been happier with our stay and will be back sooner than later 
58055,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Room service Not top notch but the hotel were very apologetic and made an amendment to my bill , The architecture of the building is amazing I liked the fact that there was a pool and spa but didn t get up early enough to use it 
58056,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Old street underground being closed Can t fault the hotel at all, Great staff very friendly Electric curtains were a nice feature The hotel is also an amazing building which added to the experience

58058,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, A warm welcome when we arrived the staff couldn t be more helpful the facilities were excellent I would recommend this hotel to anyone which I ve already done will defiantly book again and look forward to returning
58059,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Room service extortionate prices Was upset to find the rose petals I scattered for romantic effect were hoovered up by the maids whilst we popped out Also certain staff members were rather snooty when enquiring about the late check out I was entitled to with my booking , The facilities location design are all beautiful 
58060,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Few bleach stains on the marble in bathroom but amazing none the less, Went for birthday and the staff were amazing and upgraded our room for us The bar provided a complimentary drink as it was a special day
58061,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The reception service was poor never knew the answers to our questions when we phoned up Also both on check in and check out waited a long time to be served welcome could ve been warmer for a 5 hotel ,No Positive
58062,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Nothing All was great except for the light on the magnified mirror didn t work , Stayed here as a young couple for our anniversary The bed was so comfortable After a mix up with our early check in they resolved it by upgrading us which was good The spa is lovely and more than what we expected Great breakfast and service all round Loved the mood lighting 
58063,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The breakfast is not amazing because the quality of the produce could be better and is also highly overpriced , As always the amenities in the hotel are top notch 
58064,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, If you charge for 3 adults you should accommodate for 3 adults There was 2 of everything in the room eg towels robes cups etc , We paid for a room for 3 adults but were given a room with two beds and a sofa bed which was very uncomfortable 
58065,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The technology in the room was overcomplicated and took too long to figure out The bathroom lights for instance stopped working during the stay giving us a technical error A light switch and a remote control would have been absolutely fine The hotel kind of lacked personality , The hotel was what you would expect from a hotel at this standard Very clean luxurious good service 
58066,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Considering the hotel prides itself on its electronics the Internet was sluggish , The bed was so comfortable and the electric curtains and panel controls were fun 
58067,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I ordered a suite for my wife to have a weekend away instead she was given two rooms Tried really hard to get a refund on the unused room Got nothing Won t be going back , Great room s 
58068,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Quite cramped no balcony and had a view of a building site Breakfast was over priced at 29 per person Had cool gadgets but for a tech hotel there wasn t much of the latest tech aa, Food was really lovely
58069,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I didn t like being charged 12 5 service plus tray charge for room service It should be one or the other , Comfiest bed I ve ever slept in Pillows are divine I ve already ordered them for home Fantastic club sandwich on room service menu Had it twice 
58070,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Check in dull almost unfriendly Full English breakfast cold to the point of being inedible Still waiting for our toast , Location is excellent Concierge staff very helpful and courteous 
58071,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The staff promised to leave a surprise in our room for my panthers Birthday when we ve popped out for dinner but failed to follow their promise as there was nothing when we returned , The stuff were very professional and welcoming The facilities available are excellent and worth the stay 
58072,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The fried breakfast was a little dry as it was buffet but hey no big deal I simply went back and got myself an extra delicious croissant , We have stayed at quite a few hotels in London which were all very nice However M by Montcalm was by far the best I like to treat my partner to a London break every now and then but some hotels just feel wrong No matter how glorious they are for us it s all about how you feel M by Montcalm made us feel great Like meeting an old friend again We will definitely go back The staff were superb all round and upgraded our room simply because the room was available The room was great with fantastic views across London However I am really intreaged to see the views from the point at the front of the hotel Next time we visit we would like to stay two nights and eat in the hotels 17th floor restaurant as well as we did in Hoxton again The location is perfect for a young couple as its in the heart of trendy Shorditch with lively bars restaurants coffee shops and night clubs at your feet with luxury when you return back to the hotel Literally can not fault this hotel M by Montcalm is perfect 
58073,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, The hotel made extra effort as it was my birthday we got upgraded to a bigger suite and they decorated our room with birthday surprises Staff were really welcoming and helpful 
58074,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The fact I paid for the biggest room and got the smallest there s no way to play your music on speakers like most other hotels which was annoying as half the th channels didn t work Waste of money, not much but the lights
58075,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, No towels and the tea coffee etc hadn t been replenished from the previous stay when we got to the room but a quick call to reception and it was sorted quickly, Pool and steam room was a nice bonus staff really friendly and check in very efficient
58076,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, We left our bags with the concierge when we checked in but when we returned to the hotel the bags had been put in the wrong room It took the staff 45 60 minutes to find them and on two occasion s told me they were in my room I was there and the abs weren t there , The room was great the control panel that controls everything in the room was brilliant
58077,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The breakfast service was not very good It ran from 7 11 and we got there at about 10 20 It was unsurprisingly busy and they seemed a little understaffed and the buffet was rather depleted , The pool was great
58078,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, When we arrived there was a slight problem with checking in for a triple room No extra bed was in the room I was under the impression we were meant to have a double room with 2 double beds However this was rectified and when we came back on the evening the bed was made , The tablets in the room are a wicked addition to lighting and air con control The concierge staff are very helpful 
58079,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Service at breakfast could be better Had to keep asking for things like coffee toast etc not offered, Very comfy beds and nice roomy shower Good new spa
58080,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Would be nice to have either a manual or better help screen via TV in order to understand how to use tablets etc I could work it out but I could see that those who are less tech savvy might struggle , Comfortable hotel with good spa facilities You get given a mobile that has free calls and mobile Internet which would be great for international Travellers The spa is free and has a great swimming pool sauna and steam room 
58081,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The reception staff was initially rude but the rest of the facilities and staff members made up for this , The bed was comfortable and I had an amazing nights sleep 
58082,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Dreadful view from our room Couldn t work out how to use coffee machine in room and cups too small for a decent cup of tea, Friendly helpful staff lovely spa and toiletries comfy bed 
58083,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, More bathroom facilities Only 1 toothbrush , Staff attentive and friendly Bags and coats taken as soon as we walked in Large comfortable rooms Wonderful view Quick room service Real luxury 
58084,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Nothing , Me and my girlfriend went for her birthday When I told them that they decorated our room with balloons cakes and put champagne on ice Very nice people and an amazing hotel Great location close to the train station and plenty on bars and restaurants Definitely will be returning soon 
58085,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The breakfast was 22 No Stop that , Everything perfect and a must for techno geeks this is Starship Enterprise created for James Bond The food absolutely incredible 
58086,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, We had a early wake up call all 3 days although we asked to cancel it Must say the staff apologized and sent us wine macarons and fruits , Great location close to the tube old station Rooms nicely designed very comfortable and welcoming 
58087,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I didn t like the height of the bed because I am quite short , I liked the size and layout of the room The stylish decor and modern design really appealed to me 
58088,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The chair was in the way of the curtains so they didn t close properly my bed side table was stiff to open and shook the whole table when opened There were water marks on the shower head there were only two tea cups when they knew 3 of us were staying and we were locked out of our own room for 20 minutes as our key stopped working , The bed was extremely comfortable and the high tech facility s were amazing
58089,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Be great if even a small breakfast could be included in the price , The ipad control system the pool and leaisure facilities the bed the coffee machine the location the safe feel of the hotel the dressing gown and slippers the high quality of the shampoo and little toiletries The bar and restaurant was brilliant too 
58090,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, They brought complimentary cupcakes fruit and a bottle of water to the door We enjoyed the hand held device to close the curtains and control the lights and television We had a really nice time
58091,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The location was a bit poor in my opinion due to lots of drunk people and and lots of anti social behaviour that took place around old street , The shower was excellent it did not make my skin dry i think there was no chlorine in it and it felt soooo good First time in my life i never had to use cream on my body to moist it Excellent 
58092,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The key card to the room failed more than 5 times to our rooms which was a real inconvenience being on the 15th floor , Nice clean modern hotel
58093,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Cost of extras such as breakfast and bar prices exceptionally high even by London standards Location is convenient but Shoreditch Hoxton is still a mixed area where modern meets grimy Currently building a major residential business development right outside , Very well designed modern rooms and excellent facilities Good pool and spa 
58094,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Had to call down for teabags in the morning The breakfast was EXTREMELY overpriced and the front desk told me I had settled my bill on arrival which turned out not to be the case and I had to go through the process again to pay for the breakfast which they had left off the bill first time round , Nice rooms Excellent location
58095,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Very new and modern hotel Super clean if you re picky about that which I am If you get a good price this is an awesome place to stay Love the tablets to turn things on and off Bars and restaurants right around the corner The service is close to the Ritz Carlton 
58096,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, No hand soap Chip crumb from previous occupant Had to work out how to use all the hi tec stuff only found out about the tablet by looking at reviews Requested a vase container for fresh flowers HK said none available, Great welcome at reception very comfortable hi etc room 6th floor so good views over London Lovely spa costume provided Complimentary tea coffee etc plus tassimo coffee machine
58097,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, A room with a better view would have made the stay perfect but other than that I m super happy with everything else , Beds are so comfy staff are very attentive and kind 
58098,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, It was superb, Staff were friendly welcoming and extremely efficient Also special mention to the charming French girl at the bar my apologies for not remembering your name at the moment who recommended the pink pepper gin it was lovely Also special mention to the reception staff and porters who were more than accommodating And also the housekeepers the room was flawless and the lemon cupcakes delicious 
58099,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Difficulty with the the TV initially , Rooms were spacious Bathroom was clean and enjoyed the higher technology for lighting Good location and good environment in the bar area at the weekend 
58100,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Can t fit two plugs side by side Hairdryer not great cap kept falling off , Very comfortable and clean room nice bathroom products Was quiet Coffee in room from a pod machine Gadgets 
58101,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Staff is a little bit unresponsive if you try to contact them via email to check if you may have left your sunglasses in the hotel 3 days and counting In addition I left the hotel in a super rush overslept and making a mess including breaking a plate for which I guess I was charged additional charge on my card appeared but again they haven t responded for three days so far so leaves me wondering , Super clean new so the facilities are excellent plus it has a small pool such a rarity in London Location is also really good close to station Pret next door etc 
58102,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Maybe a bit too much technology for some people as everything is touch screen, Staff and concierge very helpful Lovely rooms had an issue with plumbing but were promptly moved to another room which we appreciated Good area close to tube and many nice restaurants around
58103,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Credit Card most likely skimmed in nearby Old Street Underground Station ticket vending machine If visiting London get an Oyster Card before leaving home , The free mobile phone Although we didn t take it out of the hotel the inbuilt London guide is a great idea Basket of fruit delivered to room makes one feel special The hotel location is convenient for London City Airport 
58104,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Loads of gadgets to use but sometimes a light switch is far simpler, Staff were very polite and friendly The room was lovely and clean Bed was super comfy And a nespresso machine was a bonus 
58105,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Tv sound wasn t great and controls a bit fiddly , The tech in the rooms was amazing just what I m looking for Touch pads are cool and so is electric the curtains Loved the look of room and shower was ace 
58106,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Long queues at reception seemingly throughout the day Very slow and packed lifts Too much IT in room to operate basic things kept crashing so something as easy as changing the TV channel became impossible Poor temp controls , Location good Nice bar Quirky building Nice views from top floors Good buffet breakfast 
58107,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Wed been upgraded so got breakfast included however when we went for breakfast we were turned away as wed been told the wrong times at check in, The room was amazing

58110,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Breakfast wasn t value for money at all not a lot to choose from I was really upset to realise the sky bar was closed as that was one of the main reasons for the stay, Beautiful wishes I booked a longer trip Facilities are great the spa is amazing 
58111,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, More staff to make cocktails at the bar very slow service for my daughters hen party guests Breakfast was very busy on sunday morning but apology from manager in the restaurant and a complimentary prosecco made up for it , Comfy beds and lovely spa 
58112,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, When we check in the staff told us that the breakfast is included But in the next day they told us we don t have breakfast included This mistake makes me very unhappy about this trip , The facilities are quite nice 
58113,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Not a lot to be honest if I had to find something I would say your location but it served my particular purpose Need to be closer to West End but then I suppose the prices would change, Interactive modern facilities Cosy welcoming room Excellent price for London used to paying between 250 500 Pleasant helpful staff relaxed atmosphere no pretence Room service food was very good also
58114,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I really got pissed off with the house keeping and I don t think they are trying Never the less the supervisors are doing a good job by putting them in Oder , The staffs are very friendly the spa is superf and I love the complimentary fruits everywhere in the hotel The services no doubt is very Good 
58115,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The staff messed me around with the booking and payment they mis informed me and wasted my time There was really bad communication between the reception staff during our stay We couldnt work properly because there was no ipod dock or way to play music in our room which was stated on the list of amenities within our room Staff were then unable to get us a lead for the tv and unable to locate us a dock or speaker system Curtains were full black out but as they didnt fit the window properly light distrubed us early on , bed was comfy swimming pool was lovely too
58116,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, It was all great , Being upgraded The use of a phone in room to find places to eat Very high tech rooms The pool sauna had a very good atmosphere and immaculate Being able to charge phone with hotel s charger Close to tube station and great places to eat such as The Blues Kitchen and The Breakfast Club
58117,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Nothing to dislike apart from working out how to use all of the technology in the rooms , Very modern and luxurious The Club rooms on 16 floor are spectacular First class staff and service Great showers 
58118,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, the way to turn on off light is way too sophisticated and the control display is a bit slow curtains doesnt close completely breakfast is overpriced for what is available to eat, modern luxury superb spa area with huge swimming pool for the area super comfortable bed and 2 feet from old street tube station lovely staff amazing hotel architecture looks like a modern flat iron nyc a real modern 5 
58119,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I struggled to make the TV work but that was probably because I d been in the bar til 0130 User error, Superb room Effortless check in and out Top quality for a very fair price Great atmosphere in the bar 
58120,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Touchscreen lightswitches are very fancy but an actual lighswitch would deb much quicker and easier Had to ask twice for coffee and toast at breakfast even though was quiet , Good decor nice little extra touches like the free mobile phone to use during your stay good breakfast 
58121,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Without sounding tight my only suggestion would be to change the price of breakfast 29 for a breakfast is very steep , The staff were very attentive as I booked the bath butler service Gigi was very helpful from the moment we checked in assuring me when the room would be ready The room itself was very modern and had one of the best beds I have ever slept in the late check out of 14 00pm was even better 
58122,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Further out of the city than I had thought so taxi fare to the hotel was higher or at least a good 30 minute walk to the embankment Not a major problem but wouldn t necessarily describe the location as good , Hotel was very clean and we got upgraded which was a very pleasant surprise Staff were very friendly and bar prices were good for London 
58123,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The weather Breakfast is a little pricey There are easy alternative next to hotel for a fraction of the cost , Staying here for business makes work easier Well located near tube Modern and the design all works well 
58124,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The room was slightly smaller than I thought the mattress was too soft really soft the Spa didn t have many beds to relax around the pool the shower gel and shampoo were quite masculine but if I had too choose one thing was the vegetarian breakfast if you have the English breakfast the vegetarian is practically everything except the meats there were no vegetarian alternative to those which is a shame as everything else was good , We loved everything about it specially the customer service of the lady that welcomed us the girls that work in the spa and the Italian waitress that served us breakfast Gianluca I think it was really nice and professional the SPA is really nice the room was nice loved the welcome fruit and macaroons the gym is well equipped the towels really soft Loved the sour dough bread and coffee at breakfast 
58125,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, In room service running out of food taking too long to come To much notice from cleaners in morning Iron was dirty got stuck to my clothes Not enuf beds in pool area no availability for hotel residance for treatments , Tv room atmosphere
58126,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The curtain in my room was broken and I was unable to get an appointment at the Spa even though I stayed a whole week you need to book well in advance , Awesome service and generally just a lovely hotel I especially enjoy the facilities on offer 
58127,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Staff were all friendly apart from one occasion were I think it became apparent that we were eating breakfast in the wrong location we had eaten there the previous 2 days and the young women did not Deal with her stress of the occasion well her manner was to blame us for being in the wrong place not redirect us the manager however intervened and sorted is into a table and looked after us well , Staff were friendly welcimg and customer focused Bar and restaurant on 17th floor has great views over London Great travel links 
58128,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Fantastic hotel staff were amazing nothing to much trouble excellent room fresh fruit and bottles of water we were on the 10 floor lovely view across the city we went for our wedding anniversary had a great stay 
58129,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The key cards This is the only thing i found wrong with the hotel i had to go to reception 5 times because my key cards got whiped and blocked me from entering my room The location of the hotel isn t really that up market but with london it dosn t matter to much because you re always near a tube stop , I liked pretty much everythin with the hotel Having tablets that control everything in the room is now a must for me whne staying in hotels now The staff are excellent and always had a smile on there faces 
58130,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Television did not really work got stuck at certain channels and it just hung did not bother to ask someone to fix it Nothing much happening immediately near the hotel especially restaurants and grocery shops Could use a cheap uber ride though 16mins walk to Shoreditch area according to Google map One of the two bathrobes had a bad scent as if it was not cleaned , Very new hotel so it was clean and good facilities Comfy bed and nice bed linens 2mins walk to Old Street station Good value for money London standard hard to find as good alternatives at the same price range
58131,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Nothing, Vibrant hotel friendly staff felt very welcome cleanliness 10 10 and gigi made us feel very welcome on arrival we will be definatly staying again
58132,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Location was just a litttle further from the centre than i would have liked but only 2 minutes walk from the nearest tube station which took you into the centre within minutes , Large room Comfy bed Friendly staff Good location 
58133,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The location wasnt too good but was okay It was more the tube station old steet than the hotel tube wasn t direct into central London but it was close to kings cross, Everything about the hotel
58134,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The pool was either full or closed due to short opening times also they had no shirt pressing facilities which was a bit of a pain, The bed was super comfortable staff were more than willing to help woth every query we had extremely clean

58139,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Nothing of note If you re being picky perhaps the view depending on which side of the hotel you stay at as there is currently some building works going on obviously not the hotel s fault , Room was lovely couldn t fault it Some might not like controlling most of the room via a tablet but I personally found it quite fun and enjoyable Staff were polite and friendly 
58140,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The tablet screens never fully shut off so I had to use the menus etc to fashion a screen so I could get to sleep Not enough hooks in the spa to hang your robe lots of people had to put theirs on the floor so surely they would get wet , Good breakfast and lovely spa and pool Great shower and comfy bed 
58141,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Bit of confusion when checking in due to four rooms being booked and paid for by one person Reception staff couldn t seem to understand that it was all one booking , Good location fantastic rooms and gadgets to play with

58149,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The air conditioning was not working on our floor so unfortunately this led to an uncomfortable night We were not informed during the course of the evening as we were offered to move at 2 30 am which was not ideal , Loved the decor through out Staff friendly and helpful The Bar area in the front is superb Turn down service very much appreciated as a lot of hotels do not give this service

58160,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Breakfast and staff confusion , Breakfast poor quality Can learn from Radisson blu View not great but considering location can t be helped Confusion as to what i booked and paid for Annoying running around from 16 to first floor Just as well had proof confirming breakfast included

58162,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Mini bar prices 2 50 for a packet of crisps Also when we arrived there was a lot of people checking in The staff didn t cope well Some people who had been in the pool before checking in thought it was ok to join the rest of the people they were with in the queue by pushing in It wasn t ok when others had been patiently waiting their turn in the queue for 20 mins or more , Hotel amazing great location for u g or walking 
58163,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I just wish you could open windows, The spa is just lovely and the rooms are very hightec and easy to use bed was comfy and the room had plenty of space
58164,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Building site as the view from our window Duvet cover was ripped and had a hole in it At 11pm someone was shouting in the corridor then it expanded into swearing in the corridor this continued for 30 minutes A wake up call at 7am which WAS NOT requested and as such woke us up The television signal was very poor it continuously broke up and sound was awful was not watchable , Breakfast was lovely and the staff were friendly as you would expect views from room could be great if on the right side of the hotel 
58165,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The interactive TV didn t work properly meaning no music to get ready to in the evening But they did provide a little speakers to plug my phone into , Electric curtains in the hotel room and a spa to die for one of the best 5 star hotels I ve visited for the money in the UK On the 13th floor having sex while looking over London was a real treat 
58166,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, The bed more importantly the pillows were incredibly comfortable Awesome TV loved the posh coffee maker Luxurious toiletries the softest of bathrobes 
58167,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The attempt to use tablets to control lights curtains and temperature was often malfunctioning and many of the hotel staff do not speak very clear intelligible English I think many of them are perhaps French Nevertheless they need to upscale their attempts to be upscale and hire a few Five Star Consulting Services to show them how its done because they often fall short of the price they charge , The hotel is very uniquely designed and has an incredible pool sauna experience It s a business travelers dream as far as amenities 
58168,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, We were Upgraded to a junior suite which was lovely I liked the smart technology An excellent hotel all round would definitely stay again if in the area I only wish I had had time to try the pool facilities during my stay

58171,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I was woken up by loud music from one of the rooms It sounded as though the sound proofing needed to have been better , I Loved the fact that the staff went the extra mile to make me comfortable

58173,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I get the iPad controls for everything from the lighting to opening the curtains it bills itself as a tech hotel but it wasn t possible to turn the iPads off fully at night flooding the bedside with blue light Mad I asked to be high up in the building but was only on the 8th floor maybe there wasn t the right kind of room higher up but this was disappointing , Comfortable clean a decent sized room Good location 
58174,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The automatic room scent perfume dispenser which turned itself on in the morning No apparent way to turn off other than to unplug it which we did a scent we found unappealing and a rattling noise , Lovely room with nifty touchscreen features and a wide range of personal care entertainment and food drink supplies 
58175,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Informed by reception the spa was open til 9pm they neglected to inform us you had to be in the spa before 8 15pm We arrived minutes after 8 15pm and refused entry Very disappointed as I was celebrating my wedding anniversary and birthday , Good location Excellent rooms spacious

58177,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Nothing disappointed, Beds very comfortable shower room excellent room good size full size TVs with full Sky range Restaurants and bars first class with super views over the city Check in out v efficient Leisure suite looked excellent although we didn t use
58178,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Pillows are way to soft I kept waking up At first think they questioned whether I was in the right place possibly because my hair was a little wild from my spa So at first I did feel a little uncomfortable But once we got talking everything was fine and from there on out it was a wonderful stay , Staff were very attentive and very smiley Everything is super clean which I love It was peaceful and quite homey you were instantly comfortable in your room Just loved it 
58179,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Check in took 10 minutes Last time I stayed at a Premier Inn it took 10 seconds and cost 10 of the price The room was connected via tablets and an Android powered interface none of it worked I couldn t have a shower when I arrived because I couldn t turn the bathroom light on An engineer was sent to fix it In the middle of the night it cut out again stopping the aircon and causing me a hot uncomfortable night s sleep There were no instructions on how to use the phone Reception didn t answer when I called Then when I finally got hold of them they didn t know if they offered a pressing service It s a real shame and somewhat ironic that the flagship hotel of London Tech City as they proudly brand their gowns can t provide technology that works To compound it all although admittedly not their fault there is a huge construction site next door and I was awoken at 9am on a Saturday by hammering and drilling Overall a very disappointing and expensive experience , In theory this is a smashing hotel A gorgeous building and modern to a fault Unfortunately in reality it is a great concept badly executed The room service was excellent however 
58180,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Tv instructions Lack thereof Not handy for theatre got stuck in traffic Finding the front door , For my work in the city perfect breakfast lovely dinner upstairs fab Lovely staff Beds soooo comfy Rooms lovely Except needed a bit of time to work out tv

58182,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Unclean in dining areas, The technology in this place is great the hotel is impressive and sticks out a lot from the rest in the area for it modern look for the right reasons
58183,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Our keys to our room did not work and there was a big q for reception luckily a maid let us in We paid an extra 24 50 each for the breakfast for the convenience and it was nothing special so if we stayed here again we would eat out locally Our TV kept freezing and the sound was distorted , The lovely Hermes bathroom goodies and robe and slippers The spa was a bonus but a bit on the small side The fun of the gadgets
58184,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Staff didn t even crack a smile as we checked in Almost felt like our stay was a bit of an inconvenience to them , Rooms were super trendy and high tech Loads of gadgets and super clean You can tell this is a new hotel

58187,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, not much variety on the in room dinning menu, The food in the restaurant was very nice the sea bass was crispy and moist and full of flavour the burger which I did originally order with turkey bacon was great The bed was so comfortable and the shower was very clean Tech City did not fail to please us as a young couple with controlled curtains lighting and other features within the room that made the stay enjoyable would definitely recommend this to a friend and I have done so 
58188,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The courtesy call I was told that someone would come and show me how to use the coffee machine No one came and also there was a bad sour smell in the wardrobe no one came also to clean it up I also asked for a newspaper it never came either ,No Positive

58191,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, pre authorization on CC required 150GBP deposit which is ridiculous that s quite a lot converting to EUR or USD They also incorrectly charged my CC instead of my coworker for her pre authorization charges at the end of our stay without notifying me I had to call and escalate to a manager who finally helped and cleared up the problem but the front desk and first billing coordinator were not helpful Also rooms were stiflingly hot as were beds comforters so I did not sleep well the entire week I heard two other women in the elevator complaining about their room also thinking their heater must be broken in the on position Would consider staying again but would first call to ask about alternative bedding options , Cool modern clean great location great amenities decent cost

58195,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Service in the bar was a little slow and the range of bar food is quite limited , Good location and easily accessible by tube Very comfortable room especially the huge bed with excellent quality linen Loved the high tech gadgets and glossy finish to the decor Breakfast was ok and not expensive for London prices All staff were helpful and friendly 
58196,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The price of breakfast was too pricey 29 for a an English breakfast is pretty steep , We had an issue with noisy neighbors in the room next to us within 5 minutes someone had knocked on and asked them to keep quiet Excellent service 
58197,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Reservation system for online booking i think it could be better In sauna area are needed hangers for bathrobes , Breakfast was good excellent restaurant Urban Coterie SPA facilities Attention in solving problem from night manager Daniel Parnham Although in the beginning we had problem after positive intervention of manager everything was as we expected from a 5 Hotel Definitely we will come back with first occasion

58199,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I thought the breakfast was lacking in choice for the price I would have expected a hotel with such luxury that the breakfast would also reflect this but I was quite disappointed , The standard all around the hotel I thought was top class and very enjoyable especially liked the leisure facilities 
58200,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Breakfast was abysmal cheap ingredients and extremely expensive The cocktails were undrinkable and again hugely over priced Such a shame as the hotel itself and the staff are fabulous , Lovely spa area and great check in staff

58209,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I wouldn t bother upgrading to a club room The room wasn t overly large and the only perk of the club lounge was complimentary continental breakfast The Hilton Executive Lounge is far superior , A comfy stay The shower was amazing and It was fun to use the iPads to alter the lighting and close the curtains

58212,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Small problems with room key not letting us in I returned about 9 keys by the end of my stay bathroom light in triple room stopped working in night expected as the hotel is so technical and everything controlled by ipad including lights and curtains It was a little strange to have an electrician in the room at 8am to fix the lights but we were given another room while he worked During our issues the staff were very helpful apologetic and professional I requested an Upgrade for breakfast for my party and this was granted Parking is an issue There was a maximum stay of 3 or 4 hours but it was really Expensive The night before was fine as we parked on a Sunday but moved the car to a pay and display bay on Monday morning Next time I wouldn t drive unless Saturday to Sunday but all of the above would not prevent me from returning I m not sure what standard double rooms are like I imagine they re quite plain as I think we were moved to one when we had the lighting issue My suite was plain but had all I needed so I can imagine a simple double would be even plainer I would recommend a club room as a minimum room as it pays due to the voucher and possibility of a free upgrade One of my favourite hotel stays and I stay in about 10 a year or maybe I was excited for my first girls night away , Beautiful clean modern hotel with polite staff Beautiful place to to stay We booked a double room and a triple room Double room was upgraded to a king suite which was beautiful Both rooms had Hermes bathing products and robes Upon check in I had a call to the suite to ask if all was ok and was brought up 5 cupcakes and a bottle of alcohol maybe because I mentioned it was my birthday Also we were given a 20 Pound voucher per person per room to use in the casual lounge upstairs As there were 5 of us we spent nothing that night As we had fish and chips or burgers in the lounge fish and chips recommended When I looked at this hotel online I was not too sure about the location or facilities but you have to see it to believe it it is lovely Views are of the local city and mostly traffic but rooms and facilities were really good so views did not matter to me and I pay a premium for good views usually I went for the spa and it was lovely a small pool and jacuzzi but ample space for the people who visited Behind the pool is a dry steam room and wet steam room with showers I think there s also a gym which I didn t get the time to use There is a relaxation room in the spa area with a few lounge chairs I feel it was very Cosey and fresh cold water was available I would however say that me sister and I accidentally went into the mens Changing room as there is a faint Image of a man and a woman our bad I suppose Montcalm is really good overall and I loved it and I will return I originally found out about this hotel on a friends social media and instantly enquired about it Website doesn t do the hotel justice it s amazing As explained with the vouchers and upgraded breakfast we spent very little for our 1night stay 
58213,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, not that techy as hoped just having tablets in the room as controller doesnt mean it s techy Usability was poor , well located clean friendly and helpful staff
58214,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Every thing was fine Room was excellent and the toiletries were replenished , The hotel was lovely and the staff was very friendly and very professional Location perfect as only two stop from St Pancreas and was able to walk to Covent Garden
58215,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Electronics in the room unfortunately didn t work so well couldn t seem to watch movies or connect the laptop to the system to watch a film Just a small thing really Price of a breakfast is frankly absurd asking 31 in an area literally teeming with great cafes and hipster brunch spots where you can get lovely brunch for less than half of that seems just silly , Fancy looking modern building Good location short walk to old street station some nice bars and places for food near by too Nicely furnished comfortable room and bed 
58216,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, There was a black hair inside the bed The breakfast wasn t very hot and the sausages were dry No one showed us up to our room Just felt let down and expected a bit more considering the price of our stay , The bathroom was lovely and has a wide range of facilities

58219,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, The location was perfect so close to Old street underground station which was only a few stops from Euston and really close to Shoreditch for the bars and restaurants The staff were all super friendly helpful Loved all of the mod cons in the room the bed was so comfy I just wished I d known about the spa so I could have brought my swimming costume Hopefully I ll stay here next time I visit London so I can check it out 
58220,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Nothing major prices for room service were a little high but that s understandable as it s London city , I m so happy to have booked this hotel had a fantastic stay The staff were really pleasant and helpful while checking me in The room was lovely extremely clean and well presented Everything is controlled on ipads which was really fun you could customize quite a bit with the lighting curtains and room temperature underfloor heating etc The bed was extremely comfortable and we both slept really well The bathroom was spotless and the shower was great the Elemis products were a nice extra The location was great too the underground is right outside and it s also cheap enough to get a cab after hours Overall you could really see the quality in the room from the full size hairdryer to the high quality selection of teas will definitely stay again 
58221,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, It s a fun hotel in a hip part of town but doesn t deserve 5 star rating We ve got the last minute deal via booking com The staff was friendly but we clearly caused a lot of problems They were unaware of the late check out for geniuses offer and obviously weren t taking our word for it it wasn t easy to find on the confirmation email but we managed in the end It was the longest check in process we ve ever had we ve cleared the transatlantic security quicker than that They made a copy of my passport an impression of my credit card the room was already paid for then we were asked to fill in the registration form and again for the the credit card and pin to pre authorise any spending on the card The design is great but then they clearly tried to save on builders everything is is assembled rather cheaply Bits don t necessarily match and there s glue visible between the parts of the design features The lights in a hallway and in in the club bar are flickering There was a 3 inch gap between blackout curtains and the wall next to the head board so you wake up at 7am with bright light shining onto your face whereas the rest of the room is relatively dark , Location design 
58222,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, we didnt take our swimmers so we didnt get to use the pool facilities the fact we didnt book more days , location to all the areas we wanted to get to very professional and helpful staff both at reception and the bar

58224,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, They didn t take payment of my card so went to London with just cash that nearly ruined the whole tripe the mini bar to expensive 3 00 for a can of lemonade , Hotel new great little gadgets very nice rooms the spa was amazing 
58225,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Reception area far too busy should be away from guest trying to exit and enter room in peace without bobbing and weaving, Enjoyed the luxury and comfort of the hotel very welcoming staff Treated my boyfriend to a birthday stay we thoroughly enjoyed great experience
58226,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, TV is ridiculously hard to use control The breakfast is not worth 25 each We only ate as we got it complimentary due to problems booking through there website , Couldn t fault the staff and there customer service The hotel is lovely and well worth staying at Little bit annoyed that we booked in advance and it was then 30 cheaper if I d have booked on the day but that s booking com and not the hotels fault 
58227,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, There was no remote control for the tv in the room so couldn t relax immediately This small issue took about 45 mins to an hour to resolve with a few phone calls to receptionand waiting for house keeping Other than that a great stay , Accommodation and staff great 
58228,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The room s high tech gizmo theme is very nice but it would be amazing if everything worked properly The remote tablet kept on crashing and took me forever to turn on the AC Television kept on having some glitches as well , Loved the vibe of the hotel the rooms had a nice feel to them The staff were extremely helpful 
58229,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, We arrived at 1 and was told that checking in started at 2 and to come back then Upon arriving at 2 we were told our room was ready However after complaining about the inconvenience the manager upgraded our room free of charge good service Upon checking in I was told there would be a 100 deposit to be taken I was not made aware of this prior to my visit, Staff and facilities were brilliant room was clean and really well laid out everything you needed nearby 
58230,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The touch pad system for lighting television underfloor heating etc was very temperamental Breakfast 24 pp is ridiculous Being picky but they need to install hooks for towels and dressing gowns in the pool sauna area Jacuzzi far too hot at 43 degrees , Comfortable beds good location 
58231,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Second visit and I really like the hi Tec aspects of the room where everything is controlled by touch screen Very helpful hotel management We did have an issue with the room and they were only too helpfully in changing the room They also followed up with an email asking how our stay was

58237,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, tiny room badly distributed clearly overpriced also not sure why booking asks me to re rate my stay i already gave a low vote it s not going to change even if they keep asking, amazing looks from the outside nice lobby
58238,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The TV didn t have an easy way of getting a guide or info button on the program I felt the bedding was s little heavy The quality of the coffee was poor so I had to pay extra for one from the coffee machine, My husband and children loved the gadgets I loved the skyline and the breakfast room on the 16th floor It was very relaxing 
58239,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Would of had breakfast if buffet style For prices charged think breakfast should be included, Lovely clean hotel very pleasant staff comfortable facilities
58240,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Very little food selection for room service and no alcohol , The spa area was really nice and the hotel was just minutes away from the subway station Nice spacious room and bathroom 
58241,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, The staff were amazing Very nice and helpful I was asked on arrival and departure if I wanted help with my bags I was called once I got in my room to ask if there was anything I needed I travel atleast 3 days a week and stay in hotels more than my home and by far this was the best hotel I ve stayed in 
58242,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, I have to say I was very impressed with the quality customer service offered by the staff and the quality standard at the hotel is incredible the high tech just wow 5 
58243,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, On check in we asked for booking details to be changed for when we paid and received an receipt When we checked out they had lost the details we gave the night before and couldn t change them all as requested and then took ages to do the changes they said they could make , The bed and pillows were extra comfy Love the underfloor heating 
58244,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Lack of hotel info in room info sourced via tv not uploaded up to date Electronic keypads to control room services lit up all night as were some other lights we were unable to turn off Room doors close heavily ensuring disturbance via corridor , The bed and pillows A few extra t v channels than seems usual for some reason Window soundproofing good for city centre Good standard of catering at a fair price Friendly helpful and interested staff Contrary to other reviews the hotel was exceedingly well staffed Well serviced bathroom

58248,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Breakfast is too expensive We have eaten at local restaurants but I would prefer to stay in the hotel If there were an option to have a cooked breakfast for 12 15 that would be more affordable Also the brunch menu is filled with a range of things I don t eat so not my preferred option , 2nd stay in 2 months and I absolutely love this hotel The decor the friendly and professional manner of staff Everyone is so helpful I am so relaxed during and following my stay The spa facilities are peaceful and very calming The chill out room is a special touch comparable to any spa I ve ever been to The technology in the rooms are a treat The turn down service and the special touch of leaving fruit in the room I just feel special when I stay at M by Montcalm Shoreditch

58251,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Nothing , Fantastic hotel in a great location beautiful contemporary decor excellent spa comfortable clean high tech rooms and wonderful staff Minutes walk from some great restaurants and bars in Shoreditch and a couple of minutes from Old Street tube station would definitely stay again Thoroughly enjoyed our stay 
58252,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Not much Everything is controlled through tablets that are a bit slow and sometimes freeze The ip tv is slow too I would expect a greater variety of bread and fruit at breakfast , Very confortable modern high tech hotel Awesome bed Close to the oldstreet subway station 
58253,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The situation is perfect for Shoreditch area however not so good if you are looking for tourist sites , Not the first time at the hotel I ll surely repeat Amazing atmosphere nice room incredible lobby

58259,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Would have been nice to have a bigger window and better view TV was fiddly to use as there was no on screen guide or easy way to change channel Good selection of channels when you could figure it out though Hotel wanted a 100 deposit during stay if you have the minibar in your room which feels very excessive , Great breakfast Staff very polite and provided complementary drink when our room wasn t quite ready Room comfortable with a very nice bathroom Excellent location 
58260,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Shame that breakfast isn t included but there s a Pret next door and plenty of places to eat nearby , Spa area is fantastic Located a few steps away from Old Street Station Room was great Good value for money compared with other places in London

58263,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Nothing, I told them it was my daughter s birthday and they filled our room with balloons and left cakes for her it made her day Such a lovely thing to do will definitely stay there again Pool is beautiful 
58264,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I was originally given the wrong room to the type I had booked It wouldn t have mattered but I specifically paid more for a twin room rather than a double The staff were quick to respond and move me but also did admit that all they do anyway is separate the beds which takes them about 5 minutes so that s what I paid extra for Interesting Also there were out of date crisps in our mini bar which in my opinion is totally unacceptable There was also an issue with a pre paid amount for extra drinks and food whilst you are there The bar told me I need to pay as I hadn t made this pre paid arrangement They even rang down to reception who confirmed this As it turned out I had paid and again it was their mistake When I complained about the above issues the guy on reception seemed to find it fairly amusing and smirked Not really 5 behaviour or service I m afraid , The room was nice Very clean and spacious The shower was amazing The gym was better than most hotel gyms 
58265,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The bed was awful far too soft and no support plus the room was cold and did not warm up with the air con turned up to 24 degrees all night Too expensive for what it is , The view is great
58266,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, the tablets didn t work properly throughout my whole stay If everything is controlled by tech pieces you need to make sure that they work perfectly, the room was amazing
58267,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I requested for something to be arranged by the customer experience manager and never didn t even though I got a call to confirm my reservation and I mentioned to the staff Ridiculous I was willing to pay for the service to make it special but I didn t even get contacted , Nice Rooms linen and accessories Comfortable rooms great location
58268,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The rip off breakfast buffet Order from the menu it s cheaper, Best value in London Rare cleanliness and big fluffy new beds We had a great view of the east this time Exactly what you expect from a 5 star hotel but cheaper and newer than elsewhere

58277,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, On arrival had a pint of Heineken and a glass of prosseco somewhat shocked at bill of over 19 there are far better bars close by that charge significantly less,No Positive
58278,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Breakfast is not great hardly and choice And not hot either there is no toast at the buffet have to ask the waiter so while ur waiting the food gets cold Had a drink at the sky bar did not know they added service charge onto the bill lucky i brought abit extra change out The area the hotel is in is not the best you can jump on the train if need be Would help if there was instructions for coffee machine in the room Also a speaker with usb ports but didnt have a clue how to work it , Staff at the hotel are extremely friendly even just walking around u are greeted When we arrived we had rose petals and balloons in the room as it was a occasion Very nice touch Also macaroons Bottled water and fruit Spa area was very clean and there is a fridge where u can help your self to water and fruit Locker keys and towels are also given once down there A short time after arriving house keeping came round to see if we needed anything but we were fine Under Heating floor in the bathroom is nice but takes a while to get going The room is basically controlled by the tablet ours switched off but someone soon came to fix it
58279,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Bar staff and staff in the restaurant were sometimes slow and inconsistent in their level is service The bar was table service but this was slow and frustrating and I would ve preferred to just go to the bar , The reception staff were lovely and welcome and staff were generally attentive The rooms are lovely with lots of mod cons 
58280,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, 26 each for breakfast even in London that is a joke , Spa pool And the technology in the rooms Also an arrival call from guest experience was lovely and they gave us cupcakes and wine as it was a special occasion 
58281,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Massage treatments expensive at 95 , Building structure is amazing Lots of bars within the hotel nice views Great food and they have games evenings on sundays Spa was beautiful too Hotel rooms full of tech TV and tablets for lights and curtains All technology based
58282,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, It s annoying to have to go from the hot breakfast area back over to the bar area to get bread The fact that I have to be so ridiculously picky to find a negative should be an indication of how well our stay went , Great staff very comfortable room bonkers looking building Good breakfast love the area 
58283,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, No humidifier weak water pressure no fresh fruit veg in the breakfast wobbly desk in the room, Good access to the City 2 stops from Old Street to Bank station very smooth wi fi comfy bed

58285,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Big unit over the tv causes a lot of glare on the screen due to extra layer of glass Can t see the point of it apart from it makes the tv look like a giant iPad , Friendly staff great location for getting to Alley Pally and central London great high tech room with nesspresso coffee machine very bouncy carpets very clean 
58286,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Reservation made via Booking com with usual personal details submitted online and secured via the company Credit Card I was then asked for photographic ID during the Check in process When the receptionist was questioned on the need for ID she was unable to give me a reasoned argument and then suggested that it was just part of the process they had to follow A little concerning given the amount of personal data exchanged by simply checking in to that hotel I was then told that payment was required on arrival as the booking was secured via Booking com which was not a problem but I was then informed that I couldn t use my personal card because pre authorisation had already been made via the company card and which was taken prior to me even arriving at the hotel In addition After declining the 50 pre authorisation per night I was abruptly told that I could not use the mini bar My entire experience of the hotel was tainted within 15 20mins of arrival It is disappointing that the hotel cannot replicate their local competitors customer experience Perhaps less of a security grilling and more a warm welcome would be more appropriate , Comfortable room with a view 
58287,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I thought 28 for breakfast was excessive so went around the corner and had a full English for 5 95 I also couldn t find anything in the room about wifi access or passwords etc for that price I expected this to be free and obvious , I loved the touch controls in the room once I understood them 
58288,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I can t think of anything I didn t like , The effort the staff made to make our anniversary special really made our stay they put balloons rose petals and macaroons in our room for us to enjoy The spa was lovely and very clean all the staff were friendly and wished us a happy anniversary The breakfast was great also a nice selection

58292,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Nothing not to like , Courteous attentive staff and superb facilties Great cocktail bar and very obliging concierge excellent We had to resort to the internet to find out what some of the more obscure cocktail ingredients were which was actually very interesting and they all tasted good

58301,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I was greeted by the staff and told to pay for my room upon arrival I do not think I have been asked for payment in advance usually a bill at the end of the stay Didn t make it feel very 5 I did not know that I would have to pay an additional 50 00 charge just in case I decided to eat or drink some items from the bar in my room I told them I did not intend to take anything from the mini bar nor eat at the hotel so therefore I did not want to pay I was then told the mini bar would be emptied and good enough someone came to empty it Not very trusting of your guests I wasn t made aware of this when booking the room , Location to where I was working 
58302,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Power occasionally went down and seemed to instantly reset which was a little annoying , Mood lighting was beautiful the futuristic technology with tablets Nice bathroom and in room design big bed was comfy in room service was delightful and well presented friendly attentive staff
58303,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, One of the tablets for controlling the room electronics was out of order All three access cards to the room were out of order on the second day and had to be re activated in reception It would be better if the water supply for shower can be stronger Not much choices in the buffet breakfast but the quality of food was good , The sofa bed for the third person was very comfortable better than those in other hotels I had been to House keeping was prompt and efficient Completed early even on a Sunday morning Toiletries bathrobes slippers bottled water etc were of very fine quality 
58304,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, There s nothing to dislike, Everything Service food and room were all exceptional They thought of everything Even a umbrella in your room Sauna pool steam room and hot tub a must All electricals controlled by a iPad type gadget
58305,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The seemed a little too high up and the touch screen systems that control the lighting were a little to slow and sometimes had to reboot or not respond at all But overall an amazing experience, Everything

58312,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The dark bedroom caused by the quirky facade treatment that limited the glazed areas where functionality has been sacrificed for aesthetics Hi tech control pad malfunctioned twice and was slow to respond to the touch screen , The design both external and internal fitting for its Shreditch hi tech neighbours 
58313,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, A longer stay A room rate for frequent users , Didn t have chance sample much of the hotel due to working But room was great very comfortable clean and great place to rest at the end of a long day Will be using this a my base each time I visit my London office
58314,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The bed was not great too soft and was two beds pushed together which meant we kept ending up in the gap in the middle Also the touchscreen for turning on the bathroom light was a bit annoying after the initial coolness wore off , Hotel is excellent in nearly all aspects location staff facilities Our room was on the 10th floor offering spectacular views of London right from our bed 
58315,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, No info about dining or the spa when checking in and no info in the rooms either Door look didn t work Didn t have the breakfast at 29 00 per person Computers in reception off line for both days no bother for me but as its selling itself as a tech hotel it may bother other guests , Lovely room excellent value for money Would definitely book this room again Twin room comfy beds nice bathroom Had dinner in the bar restaurant very nice Staff friendly

58319,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I had lunch one day The restaurant was very quiet and the menu was limited Perhaps these things are related , As on my previous visit the staff were pleasant helpful and welcoming That to me more than anything makes for a good hotel 
58320,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The staff let the experience down Their English wasn t good enough so I had to repeat myself everytime that I spoke to someone which grew really tiring The food at breakfast was good but the organisation of it was awful Staff didn t know who d been seated where spilt coffee over guests and I had to ask for some toast three times one morning With the right staff it could have been a perfect trip , Facilities and rooms were amazing 
58321,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, If you need to sleep in complete darkness take an eye mask The ipads on the wall which control the lights in the room glow at night also there s light bleeding in from the hallway and on the TV and clock so annoying if you struggle to sleep with lights on They take the payment for the room twice Once on booking com and once on arrival so be aware of this The release the payment 3 days after you check out , The room was lovely and the spa facilities were great You get a robe and slippers plus all the essentials you need The coffee machine was a nice touch and the view across London was awesome The shape of the building is so unusual and the gin bar downstairs is also amazing 
58322,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, There was nothing I didn t like , Everything The decor the style the amazing staff The birthday cake they put in our room complimentary The best nights sleep I have ever had All the extras in the room My partner was so impressed with the tablet controlled curtains opening and the size of the tv The bathrobes and slippers A great price for a central London 5 star hotel so close to an underground station We were at the shard in 10 minutes 
58323,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, One member of staff that we checked in with was very Unhelpful and very grumpy clearly didn t want to be there His english wasn t great and didn t tell us where to go for breakfast what time it finished etc maybe I should of asked other than that cant fault the place , Excellent facilities room was amazing touch screen gadgets are cool look after baggage even after you check out I know some hotels can be funny about that breakfast was amazing lots of variety and friendly waiters waitresses 2 3 min walk from Tube Lots of pubs clubs local for a 5 star for tghis price I will be going back again Thank you
58324,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The mattress topper was smaller than the mattress the pillows were too soft The room hadn t been cleaned thoroughly there were nuts under the bed dust on the desk grime around the shower base These are only minor complaints we have already booked our return stay , Loved the technology there was a wide variety of soft drinks alcohol snacks in the mini bar The coffee machine was a nice surprise 
58325,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Just parking facilities would be great, Facilities and staff were great and excellent room facilities room was everything you needed for a good nights sleep 
58326,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The tech in the rooms played up yet again on this my second visit Why not just have a normal light switch , The location close to Old Street station the trendy Shoreditch is perfect with free on street parking right outside the hotel on weekends 
58327,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The curtain was broken in our room and would not close properly I had to ring down for our luggage as this was not in our room We had a full English Breakfast included in the price and when we went to the restaurant on Sunday Morning a lady member of staff told us we had not booked and paid for the breakfast and did we want to wait somewhere quiet I felt very embarrassed in front of everyone one in the restaurant I showed her my booking and she said she still didn t have us booked in Everyone else they escorted to a table but not us We did eventually get our breakfast Without an apology for the embarrassment they caused us This was a special stay as we were celebrating my Husbands 50th birthday I will not be recommending this hotel or staying there again , location didn t think it was 5 star
58328,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Couldn t find anything to criticise , Staff were very attentive and helpful They were also keen to not keep you waiting Best service I have had in a hotel in a while 
58329,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Breakfast was OK but for the standard of the hotel the service wasn t great and didn t reflect the rest of the hotel Tea was served from flasks and was slopped into the cups and stewed why not a teapot we are in the UK after all , Hotel was a good choice would stay there again Great location rooms excellent
58330,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Breakfast was chaotic People didn t wait to be seated and sat where they pleased As a result larger parties weren t accomodated as parties of 2 were sat on large tables A sign is needed please wait to be seated Having said that food was good and staff were very polite, Good rooms and the executive room was brilliant
58331,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Even with activated Don t Disturb sign The room service tried to open the door more than 10 times claiming that they missed a Radio device I think they re under training Second day room service some towels weren t changed , For our wedding anniversary The reservation was upgraded to Jonior Suite They prepared macaroons and fruits Comfortable double bed but it would be better if its King Size Nespresso Coffee Machine Smart room using the Android Pads bathroom underfloor heating 
58332,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Sauna out of action or not turned on jacazza jets were very weak no list in bedroom of what coffee pod was what , Handy for city comfy room Very good shower good make up mirror
58333,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, First Floor Restaurant staff were unhelpful and slow to provide service at 4pm We wanted to grab a quick bite before the train but they wasted our time so we got up and left , Great rooms and very friendly staff We really liked the attention to detail in the rooms and the very friendly Front Desk and Concierge staff 
58334,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Being used the country I found it a little noisy at night but that was my only problem , on the way to the room we happened to mention to the women it was my birthday and she insisted on giving us complementary gifts which were cakes it was lovely The breakfast and room were fab aswell 
58335,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, very little to moan about maybe a swimwear dryer would be handy in the changing rooms, pillows were extra comfy breakfast was realy tasty and pool was amaizballs 
58336,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The staff We had been told when we checked in the hotel that the pool is open from 8AM till 9PM we made sure we got back to our hotel at 8PM so we could have an hour or so in the pool we got in the lift to go downstairs to the pool the lift always stops half way at nearly EVERY stop on the way down as someone else will press the button finally we got the pool and the lady had turned around said oh the last check in was 8 30 and its now 8 32 HOW RUDE IS THAT 2 minutes I was more than shocked We had recently spent two nights at the shard Shangri La hotel the night before and decided we wanted to stay another 2 nights in London so we stupidly chose this place never again We were allowed to go into the Shangri La hotel sky pool even 5 minutes before it closes so why the hell did it matter if we were 2 minutes late because of their stupid lifts I complained to the lady all we got offered was a complimentary free drink Which we did not want We wanted her to turn around just let us in the pool for 20 minutes The next day we got breakfast room service in our room which was amazing But the second morning we had ordered it took an hour to come then we didn t even get a choice of which toast brown white Scrambled egg fried which we got offered the first morning The guy then came into our room with the breakfast had said oh I came in at 7 this morning and I had to make your hot chocolates myself which was NO excuse to us And the drinks were cold as an ice drink when we checked out we where then CHARGED for room service but our breakfast was included They had also charged me 127 deposit without even letting me know Luckily I checked my bank statement I had to even call up a few days later to make them refund it to me as it took 5 days From going to the shard to this hotel was the worst mistake of my life , The room was very modern absolutely beautiful Also the pool and the spa on the ground floor was so lovely 
58337,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Breakfast was ok but could had more choice for vegetaians ie veggie sausages for the hot meal More fruit choices , Staff are very attentive always said hello and offered help Very welcoming feel room was lovely and the heated floors and tablets added a nice touch to the stay 
58338,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Nothing really if I was being really picky then check in was a bit slow, The style the staff the gadgets they even had a scent machine upmarket air freshener Breakfast was good as well and the bar on the ground floor is great you even get a metal straw with your g t 
58339,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The bed was not good very uncomfortable the tablet to switch the lights on broke down making going to the bathroom dangerous The breakfast was very plain and cost to much , Very clean and tidy staff are great lots of them the spa was good 
58340,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, I was actually moved to Montcalm The Brewery as there was an electrical fault at Montcalm Shoreditch The Brewery was superb Fantastic service super comfortable rooms and friendly staff 
58341,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Curtains didn t meet as a few hooks missing , Fabulous room Comfortable bed amazing bathroom Not our first visit won t be the last It was our 2nd marriage anniversary and we received 4 macaroons with a fruit bowl which was a wonderful surprise 
58342,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Pillows were a tad too soft for me I like em hard If i m being really picky breakfast sausages would have preferred cumberland, Touch screen everything Great mood lighting Nice powerful shower Beautiful pool and jacuzzi with lights Attentive staff congratulated us on anniversary Scrambled eggs at brekkie 
58343,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Hotel is beautiful extremely stylish with excellent facilities the spa is a very nice feature for the price The rooms are very spacious and clean with the nice little touches with the lighting and gadgets Breakfast was delicious and all freshly cooked so no limp eggs or bacon all very tasty ingredients too Staff were also very pleasant and accommodating Great location with a sainsburys lock next door and 2 minutes to the train and lots of nice bars places to eat Will definitely stay again 
58344,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Everything is ran off of a tablet which sounds cool but I can assure you it s faster to hit a switch than to tap the screen find the light you want and turn it on The tablets never actually turn off so they are kind of a pain to sleep next to They try to make the rooms smell real good by putting some aroma therapy box but it s REAL strong and we had to have it removed from the room as it was way to overwhelming With all the technology the room has to offer the TV has no tv guide after a long day touring London we had to flip through every single channel to find what we wanted to watch Super annoying , It was close to the underground The pool and hot tub were nice The bed was super comfortable 
58345,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, On check in I was advised that the hotel was suffering technical problems on 2 floors so I was offered accomadation in a smaller room on a sofa bed or transfer to Marble Arch Montcalm as all of my weekend was east based I decided to stay the room was still ok but a full bedroom would have been more comfortable, Service was very good
58346,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, You over tech d the room with touch screen lights Isn t needed and a pain in the night Whilst you have an excellent sized TV the picture and sound quality was awful Picture may be due to being only SD and size of TVs huge and sound quality is because it s in a glass cabinet , Staff swimming pool location
58347,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Sadly the adjoining door meant we could hear the girls partying in the next room at 2am but we ve all been there , We were lucky enough to have a corner room so really enjoyed the view Good location nice bar excellent breakfast 
58348,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Overly complicated systems not everything needs to be electronic a light switch works just as well Having said that my boyfriend did like playing with the curtains on the iPad , Great location easy for the tube if people don t know the area well but great if you do as it s so easy to walk everywhere 
58349,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Bedroom spacious and very well appointed had fun with touch screen controls Large bathroom with terrific shower Staff very friendly and helpful Unfortunately didn t have time to use leisure facilities but they looked excellent 
58350,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Top floor bar was never open and the spa bath didn t work on either of the days we visited rooms very noisy due to doors shutting in corridors , Chocolates on arrival for my birthday very nice touch thank you
58351,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Poor customer service and customer experience, The hotel had a miscommunication with my booking This has not yet been handled or rectified to my satisfaction 
58352,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Member of staff Theodora was absolutely amazing and went above and beyond to make our stay special organising champagne in are room on arrival and personally meeting and escorting us to our room 
58353,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Om my sheets were black hairs I had no bathrobes band and on my towels was black hair my table was full of dirt but as I was ill I just wanted to make my way home, The staff was wonderful and helpful I was very ill early hours Monday 25Jan suffered a migraine attack with sickness with it my husband went down to reception and asked if we could leave our room a bit later than 12 as I was poorly which they said was fine I didn t get to use spa as planned or swim in morning so left feeling quite disappointed as I was so poorly
58354,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Very poorly trained staff Breakfast service was a disaster food was good but getting toast coffee etc from the waiters was a challenge Spa changing room floor covered in water and nobody came to mop up Front desk clerk barely could use the computer maid only came when called Overall they need a better manager and to train these people , Nice room with lots of techie equipment lighting Nice pool spa area downstairs and tasty breakfast 
58355,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Nothing , We stayed here as it was my girlfriends birthday and upon arrival they noticed this on her driving license and upgraded our room and bought some complimentary refreshments which was a lovely touch to a great hotel we look forward to staying there again 
58356,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, throughout our stay the staff were really friendly and made sure we were happy with every little detail I had contacted them beforehand to ask for a few little touches to be added to the room to make it all the more special and they fulfilled this in the loveliest of ways rose petals on the bed cupcakes and a card We loved the way the room functioned through tablets and couldn t get enough of the lighting in the bedroom and the underfloor heating in the bathroom It came with everything we could need and more Not only was it stunning on the eye but also especially comfortable and clean too We had a hard time leaving this spot of luxury behind so will be sure to stay here again 
58357,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Technology in room didn t always work and was overly complex eg 3 buttons to turn on a bedside lamp breakfast set up made it crowded when trying to get a coffee lifts take ages our booking wasn t registered when we arrived All relatively small things but for a 5 star hotel it didn t feel that special It was fine but more like a 4 star which is disappointing when you want the wow factor , Breakfast was good spa staff friendly pool etc relatively quiet 
58358,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I didn t think breakfast was as nice as it could be for a 5 star hotel Not the food it was excellent but the whole set up wasn t that relaxing but wouldn t put me off staying again , How high tech it all was and clean We also liked the spa very much 
58359,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Rooms control system which controls everything broke down lots of times and was a real pain as it controlled the lights tv AC etc, Lovely designed hotel comfortable and very stylish room 
58360,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, A We got a room with an interconnecting door and the noise coming from our neighbours was quite considerable We could hear everything B We were allocated a fully accessible toilet and the bathroom floor was completely covered in water every time we took a shower which was very annoying , The pool Spa staff and Location
58361,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, iPhone could not connect via Bluetooth to tv and music system not that it didn t work it couldn t , Staff were fantastic Very helpful great deal on price 
58362,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, The room was very comfortable and the staff very friendly and helpful We had a good meal in the evening and the breakfast was excellent I would recommend this hotel 
58363,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The Spa it didn t happen , The room and the staff could not be bettered The Guest Services manager could not have tried harder to put right the shambles of the Spa booking I will return as a result but not to the Spa 
58364,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Firmer bed would have been better personal Choice of a back sufferer although no ill effects on this one night stay, Overall a relaxing stay in comfortable surroundings Of
58365,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Amazing place me and my partner stayed for the weekend to celebrate our anniversary they made it extra special but having a rose heart on the bed and a few complimentary muffins and fruit What can I say the room was amazing along with the extremely friendly staff Couldn t recommend this helpful enough Me and my partner will defiantly be returning
58366,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, We had problems with our key A few times it kept needing To be refreshed and after a long day of walking about bit annoying getting to your room and the key not working and also the room never seem to get warm wasn t a problem for my boyfriend but was for me as I hate been cold , The food was amazing the room was also amazing 
58367,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, I had a surprise planned for my partner to stay at the M by Montcalm hotel The surprise was to propose so this was a very special occasion and will live long in the memory especially due to the excellent experience The staff were amazing We got a complimentary bottle of Prosecco and cup cakes sent to the room which was a huge hit with my now fianc e I highly recommend staying here and we will be back on our anniversary 
58368,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Cannot fault anything, Brilliant property Very comfortable Awesome breakfast Superb customer service Rooms at very nice and comfortable Overall excellent
58369,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Very friendly and attentive staff Very nice spa leisure facilities Superb panoramic views of Londons skyline from upper floors Excellent location to explore Londons sights 
58370,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, There was a problem with room heating corridors was warmer than the room Since it is a five star hotel there should be halal salami sausage or at least smoked salmon in the breakfast like the other five start hotels , Very new and comfortable hotel spacious rooms very good staff good breakfast 
58371,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Amazing hotel The staff were very friendly and very helpful Also gave us some vouchers for the club bar as it was my 30th birthday Very nice touch 
58372,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Nothing, I have stayed a few times now and fall in love each time It s such a beautiful hotel it s always spotless and I would recommend it to anyone
58373,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I got woken up by the maid at 7 45 trying to clean my room Very unimpressed I then got bothered again at 10 30 when I was trying to leave the hotel and get ready I had the do not disturb sign on but she took no notice of it , The room was lovely and comfy the pool and spa facilities are also a really nice touch and make the deal value for money much better 
58374,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Rubbish niggardly coffee selection in the room No fresh milk in the room Bad tv sound Speaker in the bathroom not working Cold breakfast dishes, The location and the comfortable bed Most of the staff were very friendly Fantastic shower
58375,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, We loved everything from the staff on the front desk the concierge the room was exceptional The modern touches were great I m 34 my girlfriend is 27 we are from DC and we both thought the hotel great Our initial reaction was that the online info did not do the hotel justice All for a great price too There s no doubt we would stay there on our next trip 
58376,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The customer service was poor the room was not cleaned up to standards I am asthmatic and I inhaled a lot of dust which was disappointing The food levels for nut allergy sufferers was to a minimal and the chef did not really help with the options that were available , I liked the hotel and the facilities it had 
58377,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Breakfast is good but not worth the price Very limited selection which I would rate below average Ok for a one night stay but not for multiple days Personell at the bar is not pro active and service oriented , Nice hotel with good vibe Great pool and SPA area Nice roof top restaurant Proper rooms with great beds Located very close to station which is great Shoreditch location is also really nice 
58378,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Wet room style shower takes some getting used to and price was high although not uncharacteristic compared to typical London prices , Very friendly staff and excellent facilities Modern and comfortable 
58379,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Some of the prices for things were a little bit too expensive but I guess being a high end hotel it is expected , The hotel was very inviting and immaculately clean the staff were very professional friendly and helpful I stayed in a deluxe double room and it was amazing great size and the bed was very comfortable also the decor was sleek and didn t feel like I was staying in a basic hotel The spa facilities and pool were very relaxing I will definitely be staying here again in the future 
58380,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, There s no parking around the hotel the nearest ncp is a 15 minute walk However it s free parking after 6 on back roads and free on Sunday s so I guess you could time it right to be closer to the hotel The guy at check in was a bit clueless and I had to help him out I spend a lot it time at hotels for work to speed up the process I also find it bizarre to be in London and people do not understand me while I m speaking English Everything else was fantastic, The hotel is gorgeous The rooms are spotless and stylish the food is great the amenities are next to non and it s a walking distance to local bars restaurants I definitely will go back and stay a lot longer 
58381,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The technology could maybe do with an update A little slow and unresponsive at times , Friendly welcoming and helpful staff Great facilities and a Great location for access to central London
58382,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, This hotel is first class great value for money Staff were so friendly Theodora in particular was so helpful welcoming We were given a free upgrade our room was really comfortable beautiful decor very high tech which is very much the theme of the hotel Fantastic night sleep the bed pillows were so cosy The hotel also benefits from a fantastic spa facility As it was my wife s birthday the hotel decorated our room with balloons some complimentary cupcakes We will definitely stay here again again as it s great value for money in such a good location 10 out of 10
58383,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, I stayed with a few friends for a birthday treat The staff were so friendly and accommodating and the spa was beautiful and spotlessly clean The bedrooms also immaculate and very comfortable beds I would definitely recommend this hotel and hope to stay again soon 
58384,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The pool spa was closed in the morning when we went for a swim after breakfast although when we checked in we were told it was open all day , Staff were very welcoming Hotel room was excellent 
58385,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Nothing , The building itself met all the requirements and expectations It was clean comfortable and very well presented throughout Adding that all the staff were welcoming and friendly 
58386,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, As it was a Monday evening the rooftop bar was closed we were redirected to the first floor bar the staff there redirected us to the ground floor bar This was a slightly frustrating experience felt like the staff weren t fully briefed to ensure guests didn t get the run around in search of a drink , This was our second stay really enjoyed it The rooms are comfortable quiet 
58387,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, the TV didnt work that well and the ipad s whilst a great idea seem to lack flexibility in regards to control oddly , staff were faultlessly helpful and the place was spotless and comfortable
58388,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The view wasn t great as opposite was a building being built we didn t mind though as we was too busy sight seeing during the day , The staff were really friendly and did everything they could to make you feel special and make your time there as great of an experience as possible Theodora was the receptionist who signed us in when she found out it was a special occasion our room was upgraded she was very helpful The hotel room was amazing the rooms are spacious and everything is high tec We had a few problems with the lights kept on going off as everything is controlled by a tablet but we rang reception and was fixed within minutes Very close to Old Town station so in Central London within minutes I would 100 recommend this hotel to anyone who would like to make there stay as relaxing as possible in the busy city of London The spa is also worth a visit great atmosphere and very clean facilities We didn t buy breakfast but we wish we did when we booked it as could of got it for much cheaper Great hotel in a great location 
58389,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, No music facilities to volume limited to 25 not loud enough from the bed at all Considering it is a Technology Hotel with curtains lights and heat air con all controlled by a tablet I couldn t sync my iPhone to the to for music that s a far more basic technology than that of the hotel yet it couldn t accommodate , The location was great and the room was clean and tidy 
58390,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Staff weren t so friendly as I expected No parking down fall considering it s a 5 , I love the hotel overall very modern and updated Love the food also 
58391,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Sauna wasn t a sauna no stove to make steam if the whole of Scandinavia can see past the Health and Safety niggles why can t we Health questionnaire prior to use of pool steam etc Check in totally labourious tortuous too many questions signatures and that old fashioned imprint machine Your receptionist s spoken English I couldn t understand Room mechanics despite much crowed tablet controlled everything couldn t stream our own music couldn t find internet TV couldn t work out any of the Media Centre functions No bedside table and reading lamp on one side No headboard to bed, 17th floor Bar Bed Shape and view from room v unusual and almost Lost in Translation 
58392,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, We didnt expect to be sleeping on a sofa bed at the price this hotel charges The least I would expect in a hotel room is a proper bed very disappointing , Great location stylish hotel
58393,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Location is perfect for Shoreditch area Hotel is modern touch screen interfaces for everything in room Spa and pool amazing for London Staff extremely helpful and polite 
58394,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The only thing I can say was bad was the uilding work out side was noisy from 8am but he not the hotels fault at all, Absolutely beautiful hotel friendly staff really nice food drinks definitely highly recommended
58395,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Arrived quite late as we were out with investors checked in at 7am Requested for a late checkout which the hotel gave till 2pm which was great Checkout did take around 20 minutes which imho is just way too long Was awaken by a construction site RIGHT next to the hotel at around 8am which we weren t even told about That went on for a good few hours I was then woken by room service at 11 30am even though i requested a late checkout and had pushed the button to not be disturbed Had to go to the door and explain I was then woken up AGAIN at 12 30pm by room service and had to explain The price you pay to stay here you d expect way better service No apology at checkout either It s a real shame as the hotel really is great , Great hotel Great integration of tech Awesome building in an ideal location 
58396,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, We stayed at the hotel for two nights Our expectations according to the cost level was obvious very high After a day out we came back at 4pm and found our room uncleaned We had to spend half an hour in the reception waiting while the room was cleaned We were offered a cup of coffee as compensation Day two after a breakfast outside we got back to the room and our key didn t work Down to the reception again and listened to I m sorry sir Our conclusion is that this hotel don t live up to their description and i vigorously over priced , The hotel has a super modern design but 
58397,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I thought the control pads were a bit gimmicky and could do with being updated The showers in the sauna needed descaling and the controls were broken so couldn t get cool water montcalm content on the inhouse television system was laughably poor and the IT department should be ashamed of themselves Literally no information on each section of a rather primitive user interface , The room was great Friendly helpful staff Maintenance man arrived very quickly when I asked reception 
58398,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Only stayed 1 night wish could ve stayed longer , Great hotel staff very helpful and friendly Room was fantastic very comfortable with all state of the art facilities Would definitely stay here again 
58399,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Technology to manage lights etc could be challenging for a non technie person but there were instructions, Got a very good last minute on the day deal Wonderful room with soft carpet super comfy bedding and bed and super bathroom facilities 
58400,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Most of the staff have very weak English Public areas are dirty and sticky Room can be cleaned even as late as 3 4pm Sometimes they might simply skip your room The hotels address are being printed wrong which for me personally make missing post situations The Club Room looks more like bistro very unconftable very average In bar there are no offered peanuts all tho for even average five star hotel there should be at least three different types of snacks Restorana will charge you even for bred To room service prices they will ad 2 50 and after that another 12 5 of bill Technology in rooms is braking down every single day so maintenance team in your room wouldn t be anything unusual In bigger picture at the moment it can be rated as average 4 hotel , Grate location Worm interior Waiting staff are Italians that s good marc of quality All tho this is not a concierge that will get you last moment tickets they are most helpful with there limited resources Beds are more confutable than in average hotels 
58401,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Was really frustrated on Monday evening when we tried to go to the sky bar on the 17th floor for a drink around 10pm to be told it was closed when we arrived we were then advised that there were bars on 1st or ground floor Then when we went down to the 1st floor bar the staff there advised it was closed and escorted us to the ground floor Where we finally got a drink , Really love the location so convenient the rooms are excellent and so quiet This is the second time we ve stayed here this month and will be using it for future business trips
58402,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, No parking Expensive NCP down the road But that s not the hotels fault , Food from room service Amazing The awesome comfy bed Concierge we spot on Everything
58403,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, All small stuff here but things to take note 1 Some of the tech is overkill and has glitches when you just need to simply hit the lights off but this area Shoreditch is known for being a tech hub so its understandable what they are trying to do 2 Also alarm in spa kept going off because they had i big red button in the steam room that people kept pressing thinking it would create more steam Terrible design and I m sure its going to get fixed after the incident 3 Construction is taking place next door so depending on the room it can be noisy 4 Not the hotels fault but there were some rude snobby guests It seems to attract a crowd that thinks they are much cooler than they really are 5 Not really much of a view or open light Windows were slivers but that said it didn t seem to intrude on the comfort and feel of the space , 1 Overall Chic cool fun vibe amazing location really new hotel 2 Amenities Overall the spa is very cool waterfall in the pool hot tub saunas chill room etc and comes complimentary to all guests The accents Nespresso machine complimentary teas etc all top notch 3 Room The shower bathroom was elite and modern very comfy bed romantic customizable mood lighting all great 4 Service was also exceptional and manager was extremely accommodating to us 
58404,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, The hotel is swish and modern the location suited us but I would not choose for a trip to London unless I needed to fe in this area The staff at the front desk great the staff in the bars poor Also we had to ring twice to get our bathroom clean upon our arrival 
58405,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Only complaint was that when we went to the bar in the evening we were spoken to with a bad attitude was very different to receptions attitude towards us, we arrived at the hotel at 10am having a full day out in London planned we wanted to drop our bags off at the hotel they managed to get us checked in early wich made the whole trip a lot easier
58406,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The pool was cold and the pool changing rooms weren t tidy at all , Loved the room thought it was disappointing having to pay for the snacks in the room and they were way to expensive 
58407,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The cost of breakfast was just silly So many places to eat round about , We were very well looked after and I loved the hotel We were givin a free upgrade and I was so delighted with our room It was a special weekend for my husband an I 
58408,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Hotel has amazing new design with technology in rooms Amazing very comfortable spa with gym room pool Very close to restaurants public transport,No Positive
58409,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Although I love the tech aspect of this hotel I feel like it s a bit overdone and doesn t work as quickly as you d expect based on current tech standards I suspect I wouldn t pay the full price for this hotel though if I d not got a great deal on booking com Just my opinion and nothing against the hotel but more about my general guidelines for what I ll pay for hotels , lovely room great bathroom and shower and very comfortable bed I like how quickly the hotel dealt with fairly small issues I reported upon check in
58410,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Trying to be ultra modern but things didn t work properly such as bedside tablet room control kept freezing so couldn t turn bedside light off TV kept coming on at all hours un prompted Bed in middle of room No head board to bed pillows kept falling off Too much gloss black chrome and glass maybe better in a cocktail bar , Good location and nice and clean
58411,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The TV reception was a little off and you could hear some noise from other guests Staff in the restaurant weren t very helpful we visited for dinner and breakfast , Staff were friendly and attentive All the furnishings are top quality down to the salt and pepper mills at the breakfast table The room was very nice and light very nicely 
58412,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The only thing I would change next time I stay is request a room which wasn t specifically made for someone in a wheelchair as the sink was very low and not comfortable to use Apparently all rooms ending in 18 are built that way , Staff could not have done more Love the touch pad tech automation in the room which controlled the curtains underfloor bathroom heating A C lights night lighting very nice indeed Bed very comfy Also loved the high quality M for Montcalm branded merchandise dotted around Bar downstairs was wonderful too made a very nice G T indeed 
58413,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The check in staff need to sort themselves oiut and hotel needs to change their policy I dont understand how they can not let a business traveller check into a room which has already been paid for by the employer unless the card used is present The room was already paid for and there was a booking confirmation Never had this issue anywhere else in the world , The hotel and its facilities are amazing
58414,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Booked multiple hotel rooms child I was a nightmare all rooms were booked under the person stayings names Reception would not allow any one to check in as they did not have my car why would they have my card Will never stay at this place again A complete embarassig situation,No Positive
58415,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, The hotel s location is excellent with welcoming friendly staff The decor throughout is modern the technology used in the rooms is advanced future proof 
58416,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The room was a bit small For the amount of money breakfast should have been included , I liked the modern facilities the amenities and the location The staff was quite helpful and friendly I would stay at the hotel again and certainly recommend it to others 
58417,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, The hotel was very friendly modern and sleek The room was very comfortable and the pool steam sauna was fantastic We were given such a warm welcome and even given an upgrade and some cakes as it was my birthday One of the best hotels I have been to 
58418,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Sometimes if the pad controller stop working it gonna be hard to switch on light at night time when you really want to go wc , Great hotel friendly staff first choice for next time 
58419,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The touch pad controls are a nuisance to have to walk to the other side of the room to turn a desk light on The tech isn t an optional feature We were OK with it but I know it would infuriate others, The touch pad controls for the curtains and the lights were a hit with our 7 year old daughter Great location for the tube but not so hot for parking which is a good five minute walk away Nice views from the 15th floor suite Top floor restaurant is doing OK by provincial standards but is bit weak for London 
58420,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The staff were useless They didn t have a room for us and tried to fob us off with marbel arch We stood our ground and within 2 minutes they had a room We left our charger there and it took 3 phone calls an email and one week later we finally got it back , Great bar and room 
58421,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The bar staff were not friendly and came across as being very rude and there were certainly two members of staff who were not bothered about customer service Im not usually one to ever complain but waiting 40 minutes for a drink while they serve others was not acceptable The bar staff were a let down to the rest of their team , Very well kept facilities were great The reception staff were very efficient and very helpfull 
58422,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The breakfast was AWFUL Probably the worst I have ever had All buffet style stale greasy sausages old fried eggs with skin on them and cold beans cold beans that takes some doing We couldn t work out if there was or wasn t fresh coffee available and the staff we asked just wafted their hand I eventually found a coffee machine and had a rubbish latte Three cereal options were available upon asking where the sugar was on the table It was but as sugar lumps We also couldn t find the toast I would have asked the staff but we had given up by now and they seemed too busy gossiping I can think of NO reason to ever have breakfast here think sainsbury s 3 99 breakfast but far FAR worse I should add this was at 8 in the morning kind of a normal time for breakfast We stayed on a saturday we arrived back at 1 30am and the bar was shut that just about sums it up lovely building but clearly the guests are an inconvenience , Nice location and the room was comfy good nespresso machine mini bar etc plus fancy ipad controlled everything 
58423,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, tv was a little lagging or at times bad connections, outstanding location not far train journey to central London the room was very well laid out and kept in pristine condition 
58424,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Apart from the checkout staff at reception the staff in the bar breakfast area and answering the internal phone all seemed to be unsure of their roles or the hotel very unexpected ,No Positive
58425,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Although I booked breakfast for both nights when I arrived they told me that they could not see it in my booking and that I should pay extra After me instisting that I did they realised they made a mistake saying that their system was not updated In order to apologise they upgraded me in a better room which is nice but still one expects more from a 5star hotel , The hotel itself is amazing The spa facilities and the rooms are great The breakfast is also really good 
58426,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Prearranged for a bottle of wine to be in our room on arrival wasn t there which was very disappointing and never showed up , Modern tech nature of the room

58428,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, But looked like the hotel staff need some more help with their system took me about 15min to check in No kidding , Looks like a brand new hotel and well located if interested in heading out at night 
58429,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Resturant staff let the side down Very poor service having to ask for tea and coffee on more than more occasion and no one asked if we wanted top ups Staff seemed more interested in their personal conversations Hi tec room didn t always work with the system continuously needing a reboot A real shame , Very friendly reception staff Both room were vey clean and a good size 
58430,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Massage was expensive not value for money wasn t the best treatment I ve had , Brilliant hotel great staff delicious food amazing drinks lovely spa Perfect

58434,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, No basement carpark Street parking can be tricky in this area but then thats just London If you re travelling by car and arrive on the weekend be safe in the knowledge you can park on a single yellow line but not a double yellow , Great location a stones throw from the tube and a short walk to a great array of restaurants and bars music venues and markets 
58435,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, We didn t like that you had to stay in a club room to be able to use the club bar for drinks the sky bar wasn t open you was not able to buy swim wear for the spa Staff in the bar downstairs were very rude and unfriendly considering how new the hotel is the room was also very dusty , We liked all the modern technology in the room proper coffee machine touch control for lighting tv curtains etc the comfortable bed and the overall modern feel of the hotel
58436,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The only tiny issue was at breakfast there seemed to be some new equipment that some of the staff were unfamiliar with which meant that we had to wait for a short while for coffees etc It was no big deal though as everything else was fantastic , This was a 40th birthday trip for my partner and the hotel offered us a fantastic welcome a complimentary selection of fruits cake and a bottle of wine to acknowledge the celebration A brilliant weekend and we will certainly return to the M by Montcalm 
58437,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Pristine hotel very modern facilities and one of the cheapest roommates we found for that night The staff acknowledged the fact that we were there celebrating our 1st year wedding anniversary by leaving us a note along with a fruit platter and cakes in our room which was a lovely touch Brilliantly located for Old Street Tube Station and Jamie s Fifteen restaurant where we had reservations Lovely bar which was very lively late on We stayed on the 13th floor and had a very peaceful night sleep Would definitely return

58441,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I do feel the price of breakfast for guests is excessive and relatively poor value As a result we went out for breakfast all but one morning Lunch dinner however was excellent and very good value , Staff nice room v clean and comfortable 
58442,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Hotel and staff was perfect especially Teodora which was with us all the time on our visit We are really pleased that she was very helpful in any situation on our stay 
58443,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, It was quite expensive for just one night however I extremely enjoyed my stay and I m glad to have paid that bit extra for the quality and care from the staff , The pool and sauna was amazing and the staff were extremely helpful throughout our stay Theodora showed us to our room and made us feel welcome from arrival 
58444,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, We had a couple of noisy neighbours but nothing that was the hotels fault The management sorted the issue straight away and it was fine , The facilities were excellent especially the spa We stayed in the deluxe double and it made you wonder why you would pay any more to stay anywhere else The touch screen remotes were fantastic and the modern decor was very tasteful The bed was comfy and the bathroom facilities were also excellent as well as clean The staff were very attentive and friendly 
58445,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Facilities poor jacuzzi was coldro looked out onto car park and back of other flats TV broken when arrived Doors don t close automatically only that TV repair man told us you need to be sure the doors close otherwise your room will be open whilst out , Location and staff were exceptional
58446,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Poor evening night staff Taking us up to our room as our card didn t work three times and Did not apologise walked off for 2 minutes with no explanation and got out his phone and used WhatsApp while handling our issue , Facility was great fantastic location just off Old Street underground station 
58447,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Poor selection of food for breakfast Expensive Poor customer service rang reception 3 times and no reply Staff not all fluent enough in English, The carpets and bedrooms were sumptuous

58449,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Tablet to run lights crashed guy who fixed it said this happens often Imagine all the utilities are on software Cant switch off lights or anything when it crashes Serious construction few feet away Building site at inception putting in pylons Breakfast average Beds are lumpy They tried to copy the Marriot feel but its lumpy instead of comfortable ,No Positive
58450,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Took long to get the service i e get additional bottle of water to reset the tv system etc, Clean comfort modern and the coffee maker Starbucks convinience store and tube station is within walking distance 
58451,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The bar on the 17th floor shut early and wasnt open in the morning which was a shame as a coffee with that view wouldve been amazing There are too many things dependent on the tablet technology It was a pain as it kept crashing when trying to turn on the bathroom light , Very comfy bed and staff were very helpful
58452,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I had to wait around for 90 minutes to check in arrived at 3 30pm way after the stated check in time constantly being told by the member of staff my room would be ready in another 5 minutes when I finally got my room key headed to my room on the 11th floor and the key didn t work When I got in later on the TV remote wouldn t work called reception who said they d send someone up and they never arrived Not what you d expect from a hotel of this calibre won t be staying here again, Very sleek modern decor great lighting features in the room comfortable bedding underfloor heating in the bathroom 
58453,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, TV did not work and kept freezing shower flooded I had to email the hotel proof breakfast was included in my reservation Female receptionist was a little curt in her manner shame there was no offer of a room change or apology , Beautiful hotel great location lovely furnished rooms 
58454,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, TV tech not very intuitive and no iPod iPhone doc for playing your own music Minor annoyances rather than a big issue , In house cocktail bar is amazing 
58455,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Drink prices were too expensive , Well presented all the electronic gadgets were fun to use Staff were very polite and helpfully will be coming again in new year 
58456,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Their Full English Breakfast doesn t serve a veggie or non pork option which most hotels now do as standard and they won t let you chose anything else that isn t meat based or not pork as a replacement breakfast even where said option is cheaper than a full English breakfast so you end up paying for full English breakfast that you can t eat if you don t eat pork or meat in general I think their age limit for young children in the pool accompanied by an adult is outdated and needs to be looked at My son is a proficient swimmer at 4 years and he was upset when he was refused entry into the pool even though I was with him , The location is amazing for getting around London The hotel is swanky and clean The staff are friendly and very helpful Loved it 
58457,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Breakfast was really busy had to ask for our drinks twice to arrive and then tea was very weak Rooms could hear other guests TV next door , It was in a great location and had friendly staff 
58458,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The windows were a little dirty on the outside but I did see some window cleaners on the building when we arrived so maybe they hadn t got around to our room yet But it was very minor can t complain , All employees were superb guest experience couldn t do enough we even got a lovely birthday treat for my partners birthday The whole stay was incredible room and hotel was beautiful 
58459,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Coming back to our room in the afternoon the door was ajar due to housekeeping working nearby they had not quite got to our room Was troubling because it was directly opposite the lifts so anyone could have walked in bearing in mind there was highly sensitive material on my husbands work laptop in the room We used the safe after that We spoke to the manager on duty who was extremely apologetic and we were sent a bottle of wine It would probably be better to have a policy of only opening doors when actually in the rooms replacing towels etc , Clean great location brilliant staff especially the bar and reception 
58460,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The use of a carbon copy of my card is very old fashioned and having to give a deposit for the use of the mini bar is very strange, Good location and nice room 
58461,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, The beds are extremely comfortable the staff especially Theodora is nothing short of exceptional and of course the spa is just so wonderful A completely recommendation Not to mention the hotel is very high tech so if that s up your alley you wouldn t be disappointed 
58462,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, We we re sitting at the bar when glass fell from the upper level restaurant down between us and glass shattered all over my girlfriend and I now staff were apologetic for this but all was offered was a drink on them and nothing else They could have done more for the seriousness of the situation ,No Positive

58467,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The mini bar and room service are overpriced , The bath robes were a lovely touch The pool and spa area was very relaxing and well kept and the house made spiced rum was exquisite 
58468,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Check in was a nightmare took ages as they needed to take photocopies of photo id for british nationals insisted you fill out all contact details even though they are on the id and took manual credit card slip imprints for extras There was an issue with my booking breakfast was not charged took 10 minutes to resolve with phone calls bing made and no updates to me , Room was amazing
58469,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The room cleaners disturbed us twice on the day we checked in We did not have any lights on the door to request room cleaning so it was disturbing our stay to have our door knocked on twice , The style The decor The food 
58470,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I had to move rooms 3 times because of noise Very poor sound insulation I could hear people talking in the room next door and the disco from the in house wedding made going to sleep impossible , The hotel is nice and not too expensive In general the staff are very pleasant and want to help
58471,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Room d cor a touch sterile and not particularly original I booked the room when it was reduced in price so it was acceptable but full price is too high for what the hotel offers , Excellent location right next to Old St station and close to East London nightlife Helpful and cordial staff Corner room with excellent views of city panorama Lobby d cor 
58472,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The grubby windows let the standards down and mannequins in lobby areas rather bizarre, We loved the clean modern chic environment elegant flower arrangements and the gadgets bed was gorgeous and smells delightful Well executed ideas for maximum pleasure Our children were ecstatic and we were quite pleased too 
58473,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Windows in room do not open no place to smoke even outside public areas not ideal for conversation or meetings, Nice boutique style hotel friendly staff
58474,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Nothing Great value for a London hotel with such nice rooms facilities Perhaps one degree increase in the pool temperature if I was being incredibly picky , Loved the tech in the room Touch screens on the wall by the bed to control everything in the room Great design great layout the staff were incredibly help friendly polite Definitely be coming back 
58475,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Had to wait 15 minutes to check in due to que not good after a long journey No restaurant for breakfast only room service , Room facilities were amazing Massive TV very comfortable bed everything very modern looked brand new and all exceptionally clean

58480,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, My experience in the bar was disappointing the breakfast was poor but my main gripe is the noise of doors shutting in other nearby rooms which was very loud and annoying Also the water pressure in our bathroom was very poor for a 5 hotel there are definitely some improvements to be made but the price paid it s exceptional value , Outstanding value for money very friendly and helpful staff The spa swimming pool is great 
58481,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, The hotel was amazing from the minute me and my partner turned up The staff couldn t have been more helpful and really went out of their way to make our stay and my partners birthday as special as possible I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be returning 
58482,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Only minor probs we had were with the Internet and the TV not working quite as it should But nothing to spoil the visit wish we d had longer to stay and try the facilities , This was a treat for my birthday which I mentioned when booking And the guys upgraded us to a suite We had balloons in the room cupcakes I was blown away You always think maybe I ll ask was surprised and overwhelmed that they did something Thank you

58484,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Cannot fault this hotel excellent only one thing we had room service breakfast that was built into the price of the room my partner and I both found the bacon quite salty and left pretty much all of it but that is just personal preference, The service was excellence the bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on even though the tablets by the bed were a bit temperamental and would switch off randomly a guy from maintenance instantly came to sort it out The view of London from your location was amazing 
58485,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Staff dies from instruction book instead of listening to guest needs and put service first , Nice hotel newly built still suffering some from the inexperiance of staff When they have trimmed staff and cleaning it will be great

58492,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The expense of the breakfast 29 what on earth and the pre authorisation of funds for anything additional and the length of time it took for the cost of the room to be debited from my account, Everything a fabulously detailed finish

58496,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, As this is a fairly new hotel I think staff were quite disorganised My husband booked the room for me on his card and when I arrived I was told that they would need to take payment from my card for security reasons Staff members then knocked on my door three times the next morning to clean the room even though I had the do not disturb sign on my door and had explained to them that I was staying two nights Nice hotel and friendly staff but overall very disorganised , Stylish new rooms very modern and luxurious Excellent location very close to the tube and good price 
58497,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Cost of drinks in the hotel bar pretty steep 19 for two singles but part of the experience I guess , Personalised touches in the room were much appreciated taken to the room by very nice lady from guest experience We d stated on the booking form that we were celebrating our first wedding anniversary Room was lovely 
58498,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Didn t like the fact you couldn t take drinks up to your room basically no room service And you weren t allowed breakfast in bed You had to go to the restaurant to eat , The decor and the staff

58501,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Some of the hotel is not finished I found my self lost in a stairwell which was part way through being carpeted The room controller is fixed at the bedside which meant changing TV channel requires getting up from armchair walking to bedside and back again I suppose it s ok if you like watch TV in bed , Comfortable bed quality furniture high end toiletries Control of heating and lighting in room Views of Barbican Very friendly and helpful staff 
58502,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Refreshments in room were very expensive Got charged a deposit on arrival which I was not told about neither was I told to bring certain types of I D but luckily managed to sort it Alcohol was rather expensive to purchase from the hotel bar cost 20 for two drinks which was quite dissapointing , Friendly helpful staff 
58503,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The tech in the rooms had a few glitches and breakfast service on one of the mornings was very busy which seemed to put the staff under pressure and their level of service dropped , Room service food was excellent The suite was great and mostly service was excellent

58513,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Everything would have been perfect if not for the concierge who on my first night there saw me coming in from an evening out at about 10pm and chased me down to demand my room number On me showing him my room key he then made up something about a package which he thought might be for me but this was clearly not the case and it made me feel very judged A shame as I really did love this hotel , Great location very modern extremely comfortable bed 
58514,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, style over substances extremely high tech but couldn t sleep because so much light from technology Frankly switching on a light is so much easier than trying to get the tablet to work because the room card hasn t been activated , Excellent bar with fabulous cocktails Lovely bathroom comfy bed
58515,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Despite trying to change my booking 10 minutes after the wrong booking date was chosen not sure how as it was a random date they would not move the date or refund the money awful customers service, Nothing as I didn t get to go for some reason the booking went on the wrong date and despite contacting them within 10 minutes they refused to change the reservation to the correct date so I lost my money Awful
58516,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Just a suggestion really Used the spa on Sunday morning after a post theatre lie in Missed breakfast as it finished at 11 Would have loved to have had brunch post checkout but only lunch was available There is such a brunch culture in the area I wonder if this would be attractive to both guests and non residents Ended up at the Shoreditch Grind which was lovely but would have preferred to have brunched with you to round off a wonderful stay , Loved it all 
58517,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, A cleaner didn t come to our room despite putting the light signal on for our room to be cleaned There was also an issue with the phone in our room We wanted to contact Room Service however the phone wasn t ringing or contacting anyone tried calling the Reception desk and the Concierge desk as a test According to a technician that checked our phone by our request they had stated that the phone was disconnected for some odd reason , The room and facilities were lovely 
58518,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, It was so new that the room smelled a little like paint , Beautiful hotel Staff great Spa was really nice small but nice Hotel was clean Got a free upgrade due to anniversary 
58519,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, The Staff where really accommodating and welcoming I loved the technical system in the room and the guest experience host was friendly and generous with gifts 
58520,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Overly techy too much technology going on Lights curtains tv all tied into one tablet on the bed side table which you cant remove from the stand meaning you have to get out of bed to change the channel or do anything the bedside lamp needs to be switched off at the mains Always a lag on the touch pads to do anything Came away with a sore back due to the bed being mega soft and spongy Spent the last night sleeping on the floor Also 29 for a breakfast Really Is the bacon from unicorns Are the beans magic , Lovely looking hotel couldnt fault the staff at all they really couldnt have been more helpful The views we had from 13th floor were amazing so can only imagine what they would be like from higher The rooms were well kitted out and very clean Excellent location as bus stops within metres and tube is a short 5 min walk away 
58521,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Electronic devices in room mean lots of ambient light not good Should be at least possible to dim them or switch them off TV did not work froze and then could not be watched any further Guests in room next door seemed to exit and enter their room about 50 times between 00 00 and 03 00 The doors slammed very loudly each time Given that the hotel cannot control guests shouldn t be expected to then perhaps some mechanism on doors to prevent slamming is helpful, Staff very friendly Room spacious and comfortable Good location
58522,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Bad view area not so good at night Spa was ok but kids in pool and jacuzzi so not very tranquil for a relaxing spa Stayed at many montcalms before felt this was not to gheir standard, Bed was very comfortable
58523,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, I will not say the location is very bad but honestly it is a little bit far away from everything , Stuff Specially Angelica from Reception Hotel is really wonderful in almost everything
58524,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, It s a 15 minute walk to Moorgate tube station Ok if it s not raining Just nitpicking , Great swimming pool and spa free for guests with abundance of towels Very comfortable beds helpful staff This hotel lives up to it s 5 stars 
58525,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, A lady from housekeeping knocked on my door twice loudly even with the don t disturb sign on When requested a one hour late check out reception were very reluctant Was told 40 mins max , The decor
58526,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Check in took 25 minutes Receptionist was very slow and not very friendly I booked a twin for me and my daughter and she tried to put us in a double and then said we had an upgrade which didn t happen once we eventually got to the twin room I booked there was only one set of towels Not good enough , The room was excellent and very comfortable
58527,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, We had problems with the tablets for the lights etc at first but we managed to get the electrician from the hotel to fix them The tablets can be quite temperamental , The rooms were very nice had all of the facilities that we needed great location Staff were very welcoming 
58528,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The lift down to the pool You can only use certain lifts to get down there but the wrong one keeps coming and you have to send it away Was quite amusing for a while but I am sure this is easily fixed , They upgraded us the swimming pool spa area was lovely and quiet staff were great
58529,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Even though the room was completely pre booked and the amount had left our company card they would not allow me to check in without this card so they had to refund the card and make me pay personally quite annoying, Really techy rooms ability to control everything underfloor heating mood lighting and music library through a tablet oh and electronic curtains
58530,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, We stayed for our one year wedding anniversary and the hotel were had kindly made us anniversary cupcakes they upgraded us and they even gave us a late check out We felt very lucky and cannot wait to stay here again 
58531,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Everything was great from service to rooms to facilities to location Also we got upgraded to a junior suite and the guest services left us an extra special treat of two delicious chocolate cupcakes as it was my Husband s birthday 
58532,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Only minor but touch screen pads kept having to be re booted and tv remote a bit unresponsive , Free wifi no hotel should be charging and I choose not to stay if they do V modern V friendly staff V Clean room etc 
58533,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Nothing really bad but the high tech controls in the bedrooms were in some ways a bit silly To locate an icon on a touch screen to turn on the bathroom light seems IT for the sake of it A simple switch would be a bit more intuitive Also the tv needed re booting and two of the touch screens died It didn t matter but it seems a bit OTT , Lovely modern clean hotel Quiet and comfortable Nice friendly staff 
58534,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Construction just outside very dirty windows noise insulation not very good , Very friendly and helpful staff and management design of the hotel is very nice 
58535,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Nothing this hotel is excellent would recommend , The hotel looked wonderful beautiful inside and out staff were wonderfully amazing and nice from the time we checked in till the time we checked out Very nice and extremely clean rooms and the technology was nice to play around with wish we stayed longer Would recommend 
58536,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, There was a problem with the water in my room no pressure no hot water but in fairness they fixed it pretty swiftly on my second night , Fantastic quality of hotel Fantastic facilities Reasonable prices
58537,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Amazing hotel Best hotel I have stayed in London From the high tech facilities to the comfort of the room and its furniture Also loved the lighting ambience which adds character your room Bathroom was decorated with rose petals as part of the guest experience A beautiful hotel which represents 5 star at its best in a nice local location for those who love the area Found parking on the roads nearby which was even better 
58538,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Spacious rooms the beds are comfy the staffs are so kind I didn t get to visit the spa or pool area but I m planning my next trip to London and I ll sure be staying there The cooking was 100 excellent Also a Stocked mini bar n fresh fruits in the rooms 
58539,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Although a great system in theory we found that our rooms tv continually kept freezing due to it being Wi Fi connected so watching tv was impossible Fabulous food in the evening although I d imagine it would become less exciting if one were staying for many nights as the menu was small , Overall experience was fantastic The 3d effect design of the building was amazing 
58540,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The location as we were in london on vacation we had to change lines to get to central london which was not convenient although it was close to the Crntre, The staff were excellent The hotel technology although u Have to reset from time to time
58541,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Coffee machine was hard to use pool an gym were no where to be found which was a dissappointment Staff took out 100 deposit from my bank account for mini bar but after took it out said it would be about 2 weeks before it went back in , Comfiest bed I ve ever slept in room service was brilliant Lovely touches in the room such as fruit an mood lighting Shower was excellent 
58542,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Couldn t get in the spa because of overcrowding on a Saturday early evening , Clean modern technology that works Plenty of places left calmly for breakfast and evening meals
58543,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The staff although extremely polite and attentive could offer a more personal service with a bit more fluidity to the check in process That said I m aware it s a very new hotel and this will undoubtedly come with time and experience Could you condense maid service with the checking of the mini bar to cause less disturbance Maybe asking a little too much from a hotel gym but could be better equipped in terms of free weights , The tech in the rooms although a bit of an overkill adds a special touch and makes for an exciting stay Room tastefully decorated mood lighting is a great addition Spotlessly clean simply cannot fault the facilities except radio which only had one channel and speaker quality Check out a breeze somewhere for us to store our luggage all day Staff always polite and attentive 
58544,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Couldn t really fault anything apart from it would have been fantastic to have the shampoos restocked and coffee capsules restocked up during our stay As went without coffee on our second morning as we had drank on our first day , Fantastic pool spa facilities super soft bathrobe comfy bed super clean very modern Oh and the home made spiced rum we tried at the hotel bar was to die for Kudos to the creator it is the best spiced rum I ve ever tried where can I get a bottle 
58545,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City,No Negative, Love the look and hi tech features of the whole place it felt a very comfortable stay but more than that it felt special We will definitely go back The staff were wonderful too Thank you 
58546,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, its ultra modern and thus depends highly on technology No switches all touch interfaces Which is great when it works all the time not most of the time Our tablet interface sometimes had a bathroom not responding message , Very friendly and helpful staff in this modern hotel Perfect for a London visit business or leisure

58549,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Brand new and don t think they ve accommodated infants before Staff kindly provided a Tommee Tippee bottle warmer and a new cot but no kettle to actually make the formula or sterilise the bottles Requesting a kettle was met with confusion room service ended up delivering bottles of mineral water then a jug of boiled water then took the boiled water away and gave us a kettle brand new complete with plastic plug cover Farcical but could be teething problems for the hotel not our baby Very apologetic about it all The tablet controlled room was very cool and novelty but awkward in practice , Great location friendly and helpful staff room was very well designed and furnished 
58550,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, The price didn t include breakfast apart from that it s all good, NICE LOCATION EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE MY ROOM WAS AMAZING LOVE THE SPA COULD SPEND ALL DAY THERE IT WAS NICE AND RELAXING WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANY ONE WISHING TO HAVE A NICE RELAXING YET EXCITING NIGHT AWAY prefect spot for night life to 
58551,M by Montcalm Shoreditch London Tech City, Almost too much reliance on computer driven mechanisms in teh room The light and TV switches did not always respond or were erratic or there was a time delay The do not disturb and clean room icons outside were tricky to get right and were displayed simultaneously and we could not change them so housekeeping came knocking while we were still there not their fault of course Locartion is tricky coming from the Islington direction as taxi drivers do not yet know where the hotel is and there is a need to turn sharp right on City Road which can easily be missed It would have been nice to be ab le to open a window , The staff couold not have been more helpful and charming Christine welcomed us and took us to our room They found a kettle for me one had been promised on the internet booking form but they are not supplied as standard and this was one reason we booked with you in the first place Fresh fruit was put in our room on day one and the complimentary water was also apprecaited The room was quiet and had good air conditioning
