186555,Villa Panth on, room too noisy windows offer almost no sound proofing we were unfortunate to try to sleep during the time a party was happening across the street till 03 in the morning people were happy quite very happy but the music was bad ,No Positive
186556,Villa Panth on, If anything didn t like the atmosphere of the breakfast room altgough the breakfast itself was good even had freshly pressed orange juice, Nice little hotel perfectly located close to the quartier latin refurbished rooms with beautiful wooden floor great value for money
186557,Villa Panth on, The hotel bar was closed because the bar staff were absent but on the whole no problems , The young gentleman at reception was friendly very efficient and very helpful much appreciated in Paris where so many hotel staff couldn t care less The room was very small you couldn t open the wardrobe while standing at the foot of the bed but nicely furnished and practical Good range and choice at breakfast 
186558,Villa Panth on, No iron We were going out to dinner wanted to iron our clothes after travelling for 3 days Have never stayed in a hotel anywhere without an iron Staff on duty not terribly helpful concerning this , Great bar breakfast 
186559,Villa Panth on, Nothing I like every part of my stay in the hotel Slept like a baby , The location is extremely good since numerous Paris attractions are within walking distance Commute from the airport using RER is very convenient Take this express train and on the 3rd stop St Michel Notre Dame you get off from the train The hotel is 15 20 minutes walk from the train station Once you come out of the station turn left to Blvd St Germaine turn right to Rue St Jacques and turn left to Rue de Ecoles The hotel is on the right side Nearest metro station is Mutualite about 150m from the hotel There is market day on Tue Thu and Sat opposite this metro station where you get good bargains i e leather bags fresh produce preserves etc There are also countless reasonably priced restaurants around the area along with grocery shop beauty salons nail salons bookshops etc La Petite Perigourdine with very pleasant staff who serve delicious meals is just 3 steps away from the hotel The hotel is manned by very helpful and pleasant staff Ahmed is a gem The hotel is very clean The bedsheets were really clean and smells good I slept like a baby Last but most important the hotel provides a mobile phone Handy free of charge loaded with Paris attractions hidden paris gems suggested restaurants tours etc This tool was really very helpful Local calls are also free of charge What more can you ask 
186560,Villa Panth on, Very cheap and expensive breakfast I am genius member and they didn t give me welcome drink very small room very bad and noisy elevator if you want to use metro to Madelin blvd you must to stay in 11 station and 1 change just metro No 10 close to hotel and it is not comfortable , Very nice and polite staff good location by feet clean room 
186561,Villa Panth on, Our only negative was that there were no tea making facilities in the room , Location was excellent in the Latin Quarter easy walking distance to metro station restaurants the Seine and quite near to Notre Dame Staff were all excellent especially Ahmed on the front desk who was always smiling and could not do enough for us Room had a fridge and was very comfortable 
186562,Villa Panth on, Rooms are small but that is expected in most European hotels There was some minor construction going on in the courtyard but that should be done in a couple of weeks , Great staff and location right by the Pantheon It is a 5 to 10 minute walk to two hip restaurant bar streets Muffetard and St Michel Streets and 3 different metro stations Within a 20 minute walk to Notre Dame and the Louvre The central air worked great in the 90 degree heat and was a very quiet system The free Handy smart phone for use was an unexpected bonus 
186563,Villa Panth on, Limited opening hours of bar , Great location Easy to access take direct RER train from CDG airport for 10 then walk 10mins 8 minutes to Notre Dame Ile de La Cit Boulangerie diagonally across the street serves good quality coffe sandwiches and pastries Road not too busy so not too noisy main traffic one road down the hill Rooms OK in size for Paris British royal style elements Good beds 
186564,Villa Panth on, AC initially not working and was told no fans available Requested same the next day and fan was provided and AC repaired Would have liked easier access to coffee and tea Perfectly, Bed was comfy Room a little small but adequate 
186565,Villa Panth on, The aircon didn t work the first night and the small room was unbearably hot and we weren t offered any compensation when we complained We might not expect a refund but a complimentary drink or breakfast would have been nice given we couldn t sleep that night ,No Positive
186566,Villa Panth on,No Negative, The staff was great especially the bartender who gave great advice about how to get around and which restaurants to try The location was convenient and the rooms were small but clean 
186567,Villa Panth on, The room was a bit squeezy but we were expecting that There are not enough plugs for charging phones and iPads etc We had to unplug the TV and the lamp to charge our phones every night , Excellent location safe area so close to the m tro lots of food options nearby extremely clean good bed all wonderful The staff were so helpful We could leave our bags after check out until it was time for our train 
186568,Villa Panth on, Wait until hotel finishes its renovation and the staff becomes more professional Too many rookie mistakes and carelessnesses to list We left not feeling particularly good about it which is a shame because we are positive people Hopefully our experience was an aberration , Comfortable beds excellent location complimentary coffee in the morning 
186569,Villa Panth on, Tiny rooms the hotel was under renovation and there were tools laying around in the hallway and also some cleaninh equipment that was left in our room after the cleaning services left , Amazing location very nice staff
186570,Villa Panth on, The room was very small but not bad by European standards The only real issue was an unisual heat spell while we were there in May of high 80 s and 90 and the air conditioning really did not function well When the weather cooled the room was very pleasant and we could open the French windows which was lovely We would stay there again, The location was great There many nice cafes and stores close by The hotel is very affordable The staff were wonderful very friendly and helpful They arranged a ride to and from the airport for us and made suggestions on sites to see It was very clean The bartender was also friendly and charming We were impressed with all of the service 
186571,Villa Panth on, No ac Travel with a 6 month old baby and was suffering our entire stay It was 37 degrees and no ac in the room No fan no help from stuff when we complain Horrible, Location was good
186572,Villa Panth on, It was very hot and very noisy in the rooms The airconditioning did not work for 3 days We changed two rooms both was disappointing You ask extra towels it takes a day to get them The rooms are smaller that you expect at a 4 start hotel too At a 4 start hotel at that rate you expect more The staff was not very problem solving or helpful either , the location
186573,Villa Panth on, Bad wifi connection Air conditioning didn t work Dust because of renovation and construction everywhere and noisy The should have reimburse the costs and or warning because of the situation,No Positive
186574,Villa Panth on, See above, Construction scaffolding right outside our room window Re stucco of bldg exterior Dirt noise dust water spray all day from 8 00 am until 6 00 pm Impossible to open windows for fresh air At one point a worker with a room access card entered our room without knocking presumed we were out to do some work on the window interiors We had not been informed by management that this would happen Nice hotel great location but certain rooms should not be rented while construction continues Disappointing and annoying 
186575,Villa Panth on, not like the booking ad promised, the choice was about location The hotel was a bit disappointing Very small room work in progres inside and invisible staff
186576,Villa Panth on, Our room was very small and as we were travelling with 2 cases it left very little room to move As we had booked two rooms we were given one was small and the other larger we were told we could request an upgrade the next day but instead the next day we were told due to renovations their were none available , Great Location to many attractions and good restaurants 
186577,Villa Panth on,No Negative, Staff were very nice Camille at the reception was very helpful The barman can prepare lots of cocktails variety in the meantime the barman offer any kind of light sound worldwide music for guests seating at the bar Brazilian music for Brazilian guests oriental for Lebanese guests Italian Spanish and others this was very cozy I was in lots of hotels in Paris and the villa pantheon was my preferred one 
186578,Villa Panth on, Would have liked a tea coffeemaker in room, Staff were so pleasant from start to finish made us so welcome Hotel is in a most perfect location couldn t fault our stay from start to finish
186579,Villa Panth on, Our room was quiet except for the lift which ran beside our bathroom But I am a very light sleeper , Good location By Paris standards a good size room 
186580,Villa Panth on, The hotel was perfect there wasn t anything that we didn t like The area and location were spot on I couldn t really say anything I didn t like , The staff and atmosphere at Villa Pantheon were exceptional Never have I met such friendly welcoming and helpful staff We were given a new room at no extra charge that included a better view of the city and a small balcony The room was perfect size clean and had a comfortable bed Location was perfect with Notre Dame just a few minutes walk away and even a metro station which could easily connect you to all the top locations in the city With regards to dining the choice of restaurants cafes and bars are endless You can dine in posh restaurants or even grab a quick coffee at nearby Starbucks or a burger or sandwich from Mcdonalds KFC and Subway 
186581,Villa Panth on, Receptionist was not very polite In the reservation was specified that we ll have a welcome drink as genius members on Booking com None was offered Room is very small almost no place to deposit a travel luggage There were some pictures with a garden on Booking com I have seen some kind of green space there but no chairs , The property is few minutes walking from metro station and also from Pantheon building There are many restaurants in the area The view from the room was very nice to main boulevard Price for genius client was a very good one for Paris Hotel is vintage style 
186582,Villa Panth on, Bar was not open in the hotel due to staff not being in the country but wasn t the end of the world , The staff were extra helpful and very informative of tourist attractions and where to go Hotel is only a stones throw from a number of restraunts and shops 
186583,Villa Panth on, Bit tired looking and could have been friendlier Cupboards in the bedroom for the TV were dangerous Small room and you have to remember to close the cupboard just to get to the bathroom , Location was excellent and handy for metro Excellent value for money and it was clean 
186584,Villa Panth on, So so so bad experience and memories when I was in the hotel The first night when I arrive in the hotel after a long long journey so so tired but when I want to take a shower before sleep the water was totally cold cold totally cold no hot water Then I call the reception knowing that the system of the whole hotel was wrong Ok I can understand the system broken but why do not inform the clients early The hotel know it before but did not tell the client I have no choose and then very sad and tired without a shower and then I pay cash to the opposite another hotel to rent a room for shower in the first night I arrive in paris alone and midnight And what is more terrible is the second day morning when I told the new reception what happened last night the reception named Jimmy with very bad attitude told me ok we have problem with the system but we have already make it well now you have already the hot water And I said so how about last night You even did not say sorry and I even pay cash to another hotel for a shower in the midnight and Jimmy said so ok what do you want last night is past and past is past You need to pay So show me the prove Oh my god I even do not believe my ear i stand there do not believe what he said I never let the hotel to pay the fees for shower but my god they even did not say sorry in the second day So rude And make me really angry I travelled all over the world and it was my sixth time in paris but the first time to meet so ugly hart and bad rude guy Even the reception of the first night boy was so sorry and said so shamed for no hot water with many polite but the old reception Jimmy are so so so bad polite , Location is ok just this
186585,Villa Panth on, There wasn t any windows in our room to ventilate the room so I had to open the door for a few times which was not very comfortable The color of the room and the furniture was so dark that the room was dark and dreary in general In our bathroom there was a window on the ceiling that we could not open from where we could see the upper floors so was wondering if the other visitors were seeing us in the bathroom Well the room in general was OK but there were these problems so I was not feeling very comfortable ,No Positive
186586,Villa Panth on, No decaf coffee available at the decaf option of the coffee machine But the double espresso was lovely as were the bread and croissants , Very friendly personnel Very powerful shower Hot water always available Very good breakfast buffet Comfortable cosy furniture and decor from the revolving entrance door through general areas to the bedroom Excellent bedding Very quiet room with the sound of pigeon s in the mornings So nice 
186587,Villa Panth on, Rooms were a bit tired The bar was closed for a month apparently so we couldn t sit with a drink and coffee after a day out Plus I couldn t take a hot drink up to my room as there is no tea coffee facilities in room , The male receptionist at check in was extremely helpful Good location
186588,Villa Panth on, Some staff could have been a bit more welcoming and informative Breakfast a bit too pricey so was eating out The lifts were a bit slow , The location in the Latin Quarter was ideal Walking distance to Notre Dame and most other central monuments Very clean hotel with nice character that fits the vibe of the Left Bank 
186589,Villa Panth on,No Negative, Plenty of choice for breakfast Staff was very helpful and gave us information regarding sightseeing Room was small but it was comfortable and romantic 
186590,Villa Panth on, The wifi signal strength was very poor except for first thing in the morning , The staff were very friendly and helpful The location was great very close to the Metro and RER trains which made it ideal for travelling around the city 
186591,Villa Panth on, Broken hairdryer advertised as having free coffee available not the case, Great location great value thru booking com Clean and friendly Good breakfast 
186592,Villa Panth on, It was my wife s 60th Birthday celebration and on arrival the the manager promised us a drink in the bar They had plenty of opportunities to do this but it never happened but it made us laugh , Mostly the location the hotel was clean and comfortable
186593,Villa Panth on, The decor in the halls was really dated and out of place with tartan carpets and paintings of fox hunting everywhere The building itself is beautiful so it s a pity that the interior lets the place down It s definitely not worthy of four star status however the friendly staff location and overall value for money compensate for this and I wouldn t hesitate to recommend this hotel to a friend , Great location and facilities at a reasonable price Really loved the balcony in the room All the staff were amazing super friendly and couldn t be more helpful 
186594,Villa Panth on, The carpets on the corridor and stairs, The staff were friendly helpful and welcoming Bed very comfortable power shower brilliant and cleaners does a good job Heating was perfect too
186595,Villa Panth on, Stayed in 114 where there is a separate room for shower and basin and another one with the WC It was very weird that the WC is in one room and the wash basin in the other Also expected basic facility like an iron in the room , very friendly people specially the guy at the bar from Brazil and the thin guitarist guy at the reception should have known their names my bad they were extremely helpful and amazing people Decent location quick easy walk to Notre Damme and a direct bus to Eiffel tower from right in front of the hotel 
186596,Villa Panth on, I booked two single beds but somehow they didn t get this information from booking com and we got one bed Because of this our room was upgraded to superior so it s OK We were promised another room with 2 beds but finally they forgot about it The bar was supposed to be open 24 7 but of course it was closed in the morning The WiFi was extremely slow especially in the evening it was impossible to work There were only two power sockets in the whole room couldn t charge my phone next to the bed There was no power socket in the bathroom to use hair curler or charge toothbrush , The room was clean and quite spacious for Parisian standards The hotel is super cute very Parisian style really adorable The location is amazing 5 minutes walking from Notre Dame and there are many nice caf s and restaurants in the neighbourhood We almost never took subway walking distance to most of the tourist attractions Very convenient 
186597,Villa Panth on, Going back to the hotel means getting off at the bus stop 3 blocks down Not a problem but after a long day and the temp has dropped it would have been best if the street was not one way and the bus stop is just across the hotel , The location In front of the hotel is a bus stop with buses that could take you to the major tourist spots in Paris Within walking distance are caf s and boulangeries too
186598,Villa Panth on,No Negative, The hotel was exactly as photographed There were 2 large lifts to take us to our room The room itself had 3 balconies including 1 in the bathroom which was wonderful We were allocated the largest room in the hotel room 606 on our discounted rate which was unexpected We loved everything about the hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone 
186599,Villa Panth on, Could be a nice touch having a coffe machine in the room , Staff was helpful kind and friendly Room was cozy clean and warm The position a few minutes walk from N tre Dame is absolutely exceptional 
186600,Villa Panth on,No Negative, Breakfast was great delicious fresh pastries Room was tidy and spacious Bed was comfortable Location was within 5 minutes walking distance to the Pantheon Staff were friendly and welcoming 
186601,Villa Panth on, Room was a little small , Reception staff gave us a super friendly welcome which after a rude and surly taxi driver we needed Excellent wifi local transport advice Our every request was met in full without drama
186602,Villa Panth on, No kettle in the room and we had to go and get pots of hot water if we wanted to have a cup of tea or coffee A bit frustrating , Clean room Excellent location Friendly staff Definitely will return if I go to Paris again 
186603,Villa Panth on,No Negative, The place is excellent and close to metro stations It was at walking distance from many places in Paris Besides they gave us a map of the city It was a great experiencie 
186604,Villa Panth on, Rooms could have been a bit more spacious so that one could move around , The hotel was on the prime location The proximity of Maubert metro station pantheon a grocery store which is open until midnight Latin quarter good restaurants adjacent to the building made the stay convenient and memorable I was a solo female traveler first time in Paris the staffs were friendly they had staff 24 7 at the reception the room was clean The only disadvantage was the size of the room It was too small to move around But considering all the other factors I would ignore that since I was away the whole day 
186605,Villa Panth on, Room falling to pieces wallpaper flaking everything shabby Wifi poor quality and the bad staff are unfortunately absolutely awful which really outshines the good staff , Bed super comfy Great view and the good staff are GREAT Shower fantastic too Location great 
186606,Villa Panth on,No Negative, The bartender was the best We had an amazing time The room service was done to a perfection I really appreciate it The buffet at breakfast was also good Location Excellent
186607,Villa Panth on, Very dark room and small bathroom Television with only one English channel , area of the hotel and the staff very cheerful and helpful Plenty of hot water and clean towels 
186608,Villa Panth on,No Negative, Staff of the hotel is very friendly and helpful Hotel is in great location near to the most of attractions Lots of small restaurants bars and cafes in the neighborhood made our trip even more pleasant 
186609,Villa Panth on, The room is so tiny that I felt like in rented apartment in Manhattan It was the pain in the ass even to move in the bedroom The worst thing is sound isolation There is none We lived on the 4th floor and heard all sounds from the busy street thrue the window I have checked 2 times if it is closed It was We had literally to buy ear plugs to sleep We have asked room cleaning personnel for another blanket they simply don t speak English Not at a word This is disappointing in such hotel , Reception personnel was very helpful and nice That s almost the only thing we liked besides good bed and bathroom 
186610,Villa Panth on, The room was very small but nice , Well run and welcoming hotel in a good location off the Boulevard St Germain Plenty of good places to eat close to the hotel and the nearest metro station was a short walk Cleanliness of the room and service were both very good WiFi good 
186611,Villa Panth on, Some old stuff in the bathroom will need proper repair soon the elevator sounds old too though it was working fine Otherwise nothing really bad to complain on , Very convenient location old fashionable British like style giving a nice atmosphere if you like it 
186612,Villa Panth on, Out of the three days we stayed both elevators did not work for a day and a half The rooms were not cleaned before 3 4 in the afternoon One day our room was not cleaned at all We complained at reception and someone put a request on our door to clean the room But that was all I forgot a couple of items in the room I wrote an email asking if they could mail them to me but no one answered , The location is great and the stuff is friendly 
186613,Villa Panth on, Facilities at the hotel were not as expected no good food was available even to drink a cup of coffee I had to go outside My room was at 4th floor and on my first day the elevator was not working , I liked only the location as it was near metro
186614,Villa Panth on,No Negative, Everything Easy to walk to from Notre dame RER station 10mins max Staff so helpful and they helped us celebrate our friends birthday Rooms bigger than expected Breakfast as expected good start to the day 
186615,Villa Panth on, We had a communication problem with the staff Even if we wanted a double bed they gave a twin bed Even if we paid the bill in advance they acted as if we were swindlers Maybe because of the darkness of the decoration they were kind of skeptics Apart from this the furniture is old and the elevator makes too much noise I felt like I was in the hotel in Barton Fink , Location is excellent Decoration is a bit dark but you d like it if you are into vintage Breakfast was large 
186616,Villa Panth on,No Negative, location location location clean but old my room was nice but I was on my own might have been small with two vert quiet I was off the courtyard lots of places to eat near by I feel like I lucked out in choosing this place 
186617,Villa Panth on, Did not read the fine print our mistake and paid 15 per person for breakfast which was not worth the price Also it was very warm in the room guess they do not have the AC on in the fall Bad ending as my friend had her carryon bag stolen right from under her nose while waiting for me outside , The location and the friendly staff who were very cheery and most helpful Beautiful bar lobby area 
186618,Villa Panth on, My son was stuck in the lift for 45 minutes The staff offered a discount It wasn t clear what would have happened if there had been a fire or other emergency The staff said they didn t have a key and had to wait for the technicien , Location and staff were very nice 
186619,Villa Panth on, Maybe not deluxe dated furniture but perfect for our needs We didn t spend much time in our room , Staff was wonderful good breakfast quiet close to everything we wanted to do 
186620,Villa Panth on,No Negative, Wonderful big and comfy bed We had three big windows overlooking the main street The bathroom as well was very big for Paris standards Really lovely stay 
186621,Villa Panth on,No Negative, Great location in the Latin Quarter Walking distance to many fine restaurants to Notre Dame to the Pantheon to Jardin des Plantes and other sites I highly recommend 
186622,Villa Panth on, The cost of the drinks in the bar is too expensive , The staff were helpful kind welcoming and even upgraded us to the best room The hotel was quiet no traffic noise yet in the middle of Paris Good breakfast by French standards 
186623,Villa Panth on, The air conditioning Lack of tea and coffee making facility in the room , Excellent location Staff very good friendly and go out of the way to help especially Mr Ahmed and Kim at the reception 
186624,Villa Panth on, Unfortunately this was a very bad experience The hotel was booked at 10 00 at night on bookings com I arrived at 10 30 and the receptionist said he couldn t see the booking on the computer even though I showed him the reservation and reservation number on my phone He said I can t check in for around an hour but to leave my luggage and my number and come back I did not receive a call until 1 00 by which time I had made other plans The receptionist said if I don t come back now and pay he will throw my luggage on the street This in rude inconviniencing and unacceptable behaviour from any hotel Acceptable behaviour would have been to simply take a deposit or the full amount and give me the room until the computer came through with the booking ,No Positive
186625,Villa Panth on, The rooms were very small and a bit shabby in some areas I guess all rooms are small in Paris , The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful The front office staff were charming and the bar staff very helpful and friendly Location was excellent we were able to walk to everything 
186626,Villa Panth on, maybe coffee making facilities in the room but that is not the usual thing in Paris and it ia not that important to me , the staff at the front desk the housekeeping staff the people who served breakfast and Haroldo in the bar were all wonderful 
186627,Villa Panth on, As other reviewers have said the decor is old fashioned dark and quite worn some cracked tiles and scuffed furniture We got the room at a discount price through this site so it was fine but I would have been very disappointed if I had paid full price since this really does not look or feel like a four star hotel , The location is fantastic and the staff very friendly 
186628,Villa Panth on, Very low quality for a 4 star hotel and the price Inadequate response of the staff to the problem with running water in the toilet that has been very disturbing Without my knowledge they charged my credit card that I gave for the reservation before I checked out probably to avoid paying compensation for the toilet problem ,No Positive
186629,Villa Panth on, Rooms were compact No coffee and tea facilities , Location was excellent just a stones throw from Notre Dame Staff were especially friendly Rooms were neat and comfortable 
186630,Villa Panth on, Not enough power sockets Wooden Furniture is tired Not in very good condition There is no IRON in the hotel How is it possible in 4 stars hotel Please buy it We had to visit very good restaurant with our Parisien friends in crumpled clothes There was no welcome drink like it was written on booking but it s not a problem of course , Perfect location Quite And the most important you can take your dog for free For us it s the best point to choose this hotel
186631,Villa Panth on, We only had a single night in Paris The staff were not very friendly or welcoming upon check in When I asked for suggestions for places to take a stroll have a bite to eat they weren t helpful at all Checkout was a 25 minute affair The weather was rather warm and humid and the room A C just couldn t cope , Great location in city center 
186632,Villa Panth on, Just breakfast it was expensive, Staff was very friendly and polite location it was very good and garden in hotel make the hotel very fantastical Bath very clean and A C working good
186633,Villa Panth on, No big complaints staff were friendly excellent location Not sure why this is 4 star who hands out stars it doesn t have 4 star facilities Looked like the upper rooms had had a refit but the ground floor room we were given to share with our son was tired all the furniture was inexplicably in the middle of the room when we arrived one of the showers was out of order and it had a toilet in one room and wash basin in another which was odd ,No Positive
186634,Villa Panth on, The room was very small The decor was dark which I found very oppressive in such a confined space The air conditioning did not work properly The bar was never in use from what I saw probably due to the extortionate prices , Good location 
186635,Villa Panth on, It s outdated regarding the furniture and overall look of the place , The location is fantastic its very central but also quiet Even if you have a room on the street side The receptionist in the morning was very nice to us The rooms are big for Paris standards
186636,Villa Panth on, In need of decoration Some traffic noise as we were in a room at the front of the hotel , Good location particularly for bars and restaurants Bed comfortable and shower great 
186637,Villa Panth on, Decor is a bit tired and need of some matintenance Famiily room would work good for small children not so good for adult children of different genders , Location to Metro was great 
186638,Villa Panth on, There is no free parking anywhere near the hotel Parking costs average of 4 euros per hour The elevator works but it s noisy It needs some maintenance, Location is great if you want to be in a lively area Beds are comfortable Bathroom is very clean and water pressure is great Overall it s a clean hotel
186639,Villa Panth on, rooms are small but this is mostly a Paris characteristic in hotels If one compares to the average room size in the city this one is ok Wi fi hasn t worked perfectly , good value for money calm and well located neighbourhood great location Friendly and helpful staff 
186640,Villa Panth on, A C did not work properly The hotel needs maintenance bathroom tiles paint wallpaper , Helpful staff Great location Very comfortable beds and pillows the decor the breakfast the big room great water pressure in the shower 
186641,Villa Panth on, Wifi didn t work and seems a regular problem Was told that other guests had also complained and that they have an arrangement at the hotel next door to use a computer in reception there so obviously happens a lot , Good sized room surprisingly quiet
186642,Villa Panth on,No Negative, Good location for walking to various sights for us Helpful and friendly front desk staff While the location was a highlight the lowlight is the tired state of the interior worn carpets and very banged up wood furniture in rooms
186643,Villa Panth on, Our room was clean but a bit shabby It was in a quiet part of the hotel which was good but it was very gloomy as the decor is dark and there was not much natural light There was a water leak from the room above us in the bathroom but that was fixed after reporting it It was a bit of a concern as it was dripping through a light fitting Generally we thought the hotel needed a bit of TLC to be worthy of a 4star hotel rating , The staff were friendly and welcoming especially the barman from Brazil Hotel ideally situated if you want to explore the Latin Quarter which is why we chose to stay there 
186644,Villa Panth on, Unfortunately in room 604 I woke up with over 7 bite marks We had arrived directly from our home in Canada Therefore the bugs were present in the hotel room We showed the marks to the staff and they said they would quarantine the room for 1 month and proceed to its cleaning , The hotel staff were courteous and the hotel is well situated 
186645,Villa Panth on,No Negative, The location was terrific in the Latin Quarter on a main street but very quiet I had a king sized bed in my single room The Belle Epoque decor was lovely The breakfast buffet was an excellent value at 15 euros extra 
186646,Villa Panth on, the room had a skylight so when it rained the noise from the rain could wake you up at night , staff were very friendly we got a free room upgrade we slept in late and were not charged with late check out charge location was superb in a nice neighbourhood 
186647,Villa Panth on, A computer for guests to use might be useful We were not offered a welcome drink although it was stated on the reservation GeniusAlert but also we didn t ask for it Device number limit for wi fi can be more than the number of people staying in the room as some people might have a computer or a tablet in addition to their phone , Reception staff was great Rooms are nice a lot of storage space and they were cleaned everyday Bathroom and shower was really nice First we were put in a room facing the courtyard it was pretty big but also dark thankfully they were able to change it So my suggestion is asking for a room facing the street noise didn t bother us windows cut it pretty well Wi fi was good we were in a corner room so it was not the best one to receive signals but we were able to use it without much problems I was with my mother and we both loved the location and the hotel It was overall a good experience 
186648,Villa Panth on, The hotel is very clean however could use some updating , The staff was so very friendly and accomodating They obviously care about the customer The bartender Haraldo was so warm and enjoyable we looked forward to our late afternoon drink in the bar The location was perfect for us We walked to most of the sights we wanted to see 
186649,Villa Panth on, Racism Smoking room when non smoking booked Having to fight to check in Watching others with reservations get sent away Then fighting for wifi Shocking stay never again When will booking com take criteria such as racism into account listings , Nothing 
186650,Villa Panth on,No Negative, Great staff very friendly and very courteous No problem checking in early booked a great inexpensive taxi shuttle to airport Great location Very clean nice rooms Made our last few days in Paris exceptional 
186651,Villa Panth on, Had a problem with lift trapping me inside Another guest had same problem It should have been closed off immediately Bar not open Sunday when I wanted to invite guests , Friendly staff
186652,Villa Panth on, Breakfast price was 15 Euros but at the cafe next door the breakfast is 7 Euros , This hotel is a gem with an excellent location We had connecting rooms for a family stay The entire property is beautifully decorated There is an outside courtyard elevator and lobby bar It s an easy walk to Notre Dame and Blvd Saint Martin with all the side streets filled with bars and restaurants 
186653,Villa Panth on, When you have two staff members in the room you should not have to ask for forks spoons cups etc And the plates dishes should be filled upas there was alway a lack of tomatoes cheese etc It would also be a good idea to have salt and pepper on each table instead of one set to be shared If you have a bar it should be open more than twice a week, The staff in the reception were so friendly and helpfull The bathroom had everything warm water all the time
186654,Villa Panth on,No Negative, All the staff were extremely welcoming and helpful They assisted us with directions to locations and made helpful suggestions Our room was upgraded and was roomy and comfortable This was my second visit to Paris as a tourist and it turned out to be a fantastic experience because of the location and the staff I would stay again when I return to Paris Thank you from John and Xia
186655,Villa Panth on, Nothing I did not like , The reception team mainly Muhammed and Alikhan genuinely care about their customers and they actually do go out of their way to satisfy their guests I can not thank them enough for looking after my mother my wife and my two year old son Thank you I will be back
