88755,H tel Regina,No Negative, Building is very old but nicely maintained Bed quality was excellent and quality of toilettes are very good We booked family suite and there are three single beds in children room but we have a teenage daughter so they gave us two connecting rooms later which were much better The rooms are facing back of building which is better than facing road because it is more quiet and you can keep window open 
88756,H tel Regina, The only let down was the service On check in our luggage was lost and we had to go identity it Then we were then short a bathrobe that never came Same thing happened with our request for an iron We enjoyed our stay but for the price service should be on point , Beautiful hotel in a great location We booked the Eiffel tower junior suite which was lovely with a great view The bed nice and big but very hard I know some prefer hard to soft Good and friendly staff on reception 
88757,H tel Regina, they should not lie about their prices and accommodation to lure people in it although they said was booking com that misrepresented the value I could have been in a better place And wouldn t feel annoyed and fooled by people I gave my business to, THE CITY
88758,H tel Regina,No Negative, This is my favorite hotel I have stayed here three times and never been disappointed It is located right next to the Louvre and the Tuileries Gardens near a stop on metro line 1 and within easy walking distance of the Paris Opera and the Musee d Orsay The hotel is in an original Haussmann building with decorations in Art Nouveau style An old world Parisian style pervades the building and the excellent service but a recent remodeling has made the rooms and the bathrooms state of the art Many of the rooms have Eiffel Tower views we were lucky enough to be upgraded to the Eiffel Tower suite with a table on a small balcony where we could have breakfast overlooking the Eiffel Tower the Louvre and many of the top Paris monuments Hotels in Paris can be expensive and this one is but we left with a feeling of money well spent 
88759,H tel Regina, I expected a little bit more for the money The room was quite small , The bed was extremely comfortable and the view was unparalleled Staff very attentive Classy hotel 
88760,H tel Regina,No Negative, It s a great hotel Beautiful and the staff is awesome I lost my earrings and they did find them and kept them safe until I came back for them after one week
88761,H tel Regina, The room was wonderful but the curtained in shower area was cramped , Perfect for those looking for the ultimate Paris experience The location decor and architectural design cannot be beat If you are looking for the hotel gym and buffet breakfast this is not it Wonderful staff Ask for a view of the park 
88762,H tel Regina, The shower wasn t my favorite It didn t have any glass doors it was just a tiled space in the corner of the bathroom with a wrap around shower curtain No matter how careful we always managed to get water everywhere making the floor a mess and slippery Our room also had an unpleasant odor to it not sure if its just because the hotel is a very old building or it there had been previous guests that smoked , We were lucky to have one of the few rooms with a view of the Eiffel Tower which was wonderful I liked that the windows were double paned and we could open them up for some fresh air and an even better view of the Eiffel Tower The location of this hotel centrally located for any traveler who is wanting to see the main and best highlights of Paris It s right next to the Louvre Museum and the Jardin des Tuileries and other prominent museums The bus and metro lines are very close with quick access to the other sites to see The concierge was helpful the night before we left to get us an early taxi to the airport The bar and terrace looked beautiful but we did not visit them 
88763,H tel Regina, The air conditioning is not like what we have in the States and most nights we had trouble sleeping due to bing too hot in our expensive room That was disappointing Our view was unbelievable It was more than I had hoped for with three different balconies facing the Eiffel Tower , The staff was fantastic friendly and very helpful The property is absolutely beautiful 
88764,H tel Regina, Toilet requires a deep clean Black stain in bottom of the bowl and red mould around rim under toilet seat Unacceptable visual impact for a guest Tariff would suggest that this should have been addressed via regular periods of maintenance Room service wine glasses were clouded from frequent washing However glasses in room mini bar were clean and not cloudy , View
88765,H tel Regina, The view from my room looked into other rooms So we closed our curtains all times By cutting off nature lights and view of distance objects we felt boxed in For a honeymoon room they could have tried better for a better facing room , Closest hotel to lourve museum and gardens 
88766,H tel Regina,No Negative, I was a bit nervous traveling by myself not knowing much French From the few days before when I needed to arrange taxi service from the airport to when I arrived hours before checkin and the accommodations they made for me to the delicious room service albeit a bit expensive EXCELLENT The room itself was beautiful the bed extremely comfortable the bathroom well lit and very clean Every staff member I interacted with was SO KIND SO POLITE The location of the hotel is right in the heart of Paris across the street from the Louvre and walking distance to all the major Paris attractions I will definitely be back 
88767,H tel Regina, On our first evening which was a Sunday and coincided with the election of the new French President who was about to party at the Louvre right in front of our hotel we decided to have a quiet dinner in our lovely suite as most local restaurants appeared to be closed Despite specifying clearly to Room Service on the phone that we wanted parmesan cheese with our pesto pasta and some bread to accompany the other fish dish which should in any case be normal practice it arrived without both The waiter had to go back and get them which meant that in the meantime our meal became rather cold which spoiled it somewhat The quality of the food was good however Some of the restaurant bar staff need to be better trained We had lunch one hot day in the nearly empty bar and it took them around 15 minutes just to bring us an iced tea while the bar girls appeared to be just chatting amongst themselves in the meantime , Wonderful location near all the interesting sites especially the Louvre Lovely view from Eifel Tower junior suite Room and bathroom beautiful newly furnished and with all mod cons but in the old style Bed very comfortable Hotel kindly gave us a bottle of champagne to enjoy and delicious chocolates on the pillow at night a good old fashioned 5 star hotel as it should be Breakfast very good only had it once in the hotel but they forgot to charge us for it and when we pointed it out to Reception they waived it which I thought was very professional and much appreciated Great hotel on the whole 
88768,H tel Regina, The upholstered lobby furniture chairs and sofas should be replaced , The Hotel Regina was in the perfect location to get to all the important sites in Paris The hotel staff was friendly and helpful The old world charm of this historic hotel was just what we wanted Our family room was perfect for us with our 2 children It had lots of room especially for a hotel in Paris and having the 2 fully fitted bathrooms was great Our room faced the Louvre but we had a view of the Eiffel Tower from our small balcony There was no noise from the street below thanks to the double windows The cleaning staff was excellent and our girls loved the turn down service at night The food at the restaurant was good and the bar stayed open late one evening so I could work 
88769,H tel Regina, We booked a Junior suite and the size of the bedroom was very small It wasn t the same suite as shown on booking com at all We also requested a king size bed and we had two twin beds pushed together which then separated when we slept on it so my partner and I had to sleep on the twin beds with a gap between us Due to falling down the gap it hurt my lower back We made a complaint on checking out and we are still waiting for the manager to come back to us, The view of the Eiffel Tower was amazing from the 6th floor The room had 3 small balconies
88770,H tel Regina, Price of breakfast was outrageously high particularly if you are not a big eater , Lovely suite in a fabulous location Very comfortable Concierge service was wonderful 
88771,H tel Regina, I couldn t find fault with anything Perhaps if I m being really pedantic the power from the shower could be a bit better , Everything start to finish was a 5 experience Allowing for my poor French the staff were delighted at my attempt to converse Completely unlike any other experience I ve had in Paris previously 
88772,H tel Regina, Absolutely nothing , It was simply amazing The room was breathtaking the quality of service superior the view dazzling the location perfect Across the street in one direction the Louvre in the other was the best pastry shop in Paris 
88773,H tel Regina, Can t think of anything, Everything was great But the best part of my stay was the staff they treated you as part of the family Which has made my time at the Regina very memorable 
88774,H tel Regina, The breakfast prices were pretty steep we walked outside for breakfast , Fabulous location and accommodations very luxurious The staff was very attentive The dining room was fantastic for dinner Next time we will upgrade for an outside view of Paris 
88775,H tel Regina, Our stay wasn t long enough , An exceptional boutique hotel with beautiful period features transporting one back in time Centrally located to major tourist attractions metro boutique shopping this hotel offers the discerning traveler the complete package The rooms are large which is unusual for Paris the beds and pillows are luxurious ensuring a complete rest and the staff from the doorman to the management are friendly informative and helpful No request was too big or small from booking tickets to a local football match to booking a cooking class with a traditional French chef they can handle any request with ease Staffs local knowledge was extremely helpful assisting us to have the best experience possible This is one hotel you should not pass up if you are looking to book a total Parisian experience 
88776,H tel Regina, Nothing negative I can offer except for a rather cold Spring week on our visit , The friendly service particularly at the Concierge Reception No matter too big or small to deal with Luxury at a different level Cleanliness comfort of the bedroom Best laundry service ever encountered Location no need for a taxi within a 15 minute walk or 5 km radius it s that central The Louvre and Musee l Orangerie are your neighbours My new home away from home in Paris 
88777,H tel Regina, The lobby of the hotel is very small and the hotel corridors is little old fashion You might feel that you are in 1960s , The hotel location The room is clean and the the staff are friendly
88778,H tel Regina, The veiw was of other rooms we were on the inside courtyard But right outside was the beautiful Jardin deTuiliers and a veiw of the Eiffel Tower and the Louve We didn t spend enough time in our room to really care that there wasn t a great view , The room was beautiful The staff very friendly Very quiet and fantastic location 
88779,H tel Regina,No Negative, Staff was extremely pleasant and very helpful Accommodated all of our needs Our room had a view of the Eiffel Tower and the gardens across the avenue 
88780,H tel Regina, Shower could be a little bigger, Breakfast in the room Excellent and very friendly front of house overall a memorable experience From the Doorman Gildas who is fantastic to the housekeeping and room service staff Nothing like a happy staff complement This shows great leadership and that contributes to the ambience 
88781,H tel Regina, The fact we had to leave our hotel and Paris , Our room was magnificent a perfect view of the Eiffel Tower Paris Eye and of course all the beauty of Paris The staff were far exceeding even our expectations of a first class hotel They went out of their way to make us feel at home advising us to be sure to try the bar across from the hotel entrance on the corner And their restaurant is filled with staff that is at once unobtrusive yet attentive The service and food must be experienced to understand that without a doubt not a dinner but an epicurean delight of ambience and great food Across the street on the corner is a wonderful Bar Bistro that has scrumptious salads and main dishes that were less expensive than I would have expected for the quantity and quality of the food A must do when staying at the hotel Another tip grab the two day hop on hop off bus pass for around 40 euros and explore all of Paris The pass is far cheaper than trying to get a taxi in some areas My wife loved the shopping so guys wear comfy walking shoes and enjoy the people of Paris 
88782,H tel Regina, Thier old dirty furniture and worst of all their MATTRESSES My spouse and agree it was the worst mattress we have ever slept on we couldn t get a good goodnight sleep the whole time we were there we constantly kept waking up during the night and barely slept when we first hoped into bed , Location and their friendly staff 
88783,H tel Regina,No Negative, Service excellent and impeccable Staff ALL attentive and extremely polite and helpful Hotel perfectly clean and comfortable Temperature easily regulated bed super comfortable with variety of pillows to choose from Always clean and crisp bed linen and towels Marvellous view of Tuileries and Eiffel Tower a dream to treasure All receptionists concierges and doormen extremely nice and helpful We were welcomed by manager and recognised from having been at the hotel before Addressed by name so very personalised treatment Ideal location central to all attractions and neighbourhoods Didn t use metro at all but had lovely walks all over Paris Then back to a super comfortable super clean room Can t wait to be back at the Regina Pyramides 
88784,H tel Regina, This hotel is perfect nothing that can be done better , The entire hotel is heaven The bed is a dream come true The rooms are amazing the staff is incredibly kind 
88785,H tel Regina,No Negative, A very beautiful and charming Hotel Staff are excellent always attentive to client needs and a pleasure to speak with Location is superb a short and enjoyable walk from major attractions otherwise metro taxi and bus service are easily accessible Restaurant and Bar offer both a wonderful service and delicious menu Already planning a return trip thank you for the perfect stay 
88786,H tel Regina, Room a little cold due to larger than average size Paris room Highest air con is 25 degree The hand hold Shower head pointing at a direction that s slightly awakard when you switch on it spray water on the floor , Concierge staff were very friendly and helpful 
88787,H tel Regina, Nothing, Great location with views to die for stayed here before a few years ago and compared to that trip they ve really spruced up the place Amazingly comfortable bed hotel also threw in a free bottle of champagne 
88788,H tel Regina,No Negative, Location is prefect very nice and professional staff no noise at all But only you have to ask the room service every day for the water and towels other than this was an excellent hotel for me Room 640 
88789,H tel Regina, Instant coffee in the room really Yuck Mini bar inferior brands at silly prices Room service menu crazy prices So what does a guest do in response We never ate in the hotel The lovely English bar was a dead zone No bar food In need of new innovative ideas to breath life into the hotel again , Best location right opposite the Tuileries garden Louvre and directly next to the Outlet Mall bus stop A grand hotel from the old glory days Corner rooms have stunning views of the Eiffel Tower across the gardens 
88790,H tel Regina, We didn t have bouth of rooms with view which I was asked for it, Everything was perfect bed was really comfortable Breakfast was good and all the staffs were friendly and helpful 
88791,H tel Regina, The hotel restaurant is okay but not up to the quality of the rest of the hotel , This is a gorgeous hotel directly across the street from the Louvre and within walking distance of most attractions The building is classic elegance with high ceilings ornate woodwork yet it has been updated with all the conveniences you d want It is very quiet even rooms looking out over a busy street are very quiet This is definitely where I ll stay when I return to Paris 
88792,H tel Regina, Nothing it was literally perfect , I was taking my girlfriend on a surprise trip to Paris prior to deploying with the Army for 6 months I booked a normal room that stated it had a view of the Louvre I explained it was a special occasion during the booking and asked that if possible we could get a good view of the Louvre When we arrived we were greeted by the hotel staff and I was waiting for what I assumed would be the room I booked however we were informed that after seeing my request they had upgraded us which I thought was really lovely Little did I know that they had actually upgraded us to the Eiffel Tower Suite It was incredible and the room was laid out with petals etc on the bed and in the bathroom It had the most amazing view of the Eiffel Tower I could not praise this hotel and the staff enough It was absolutely fantastic in every way and I absolutely recommend anybody staying here My best hotel experience hands down 
88793,H tel Regina, We had emailed the hotel of our late arrival so they knew we were travelling from the USA on a flight that was delayed for almost 7 hours We were so were parched and when we got to our room we saw there was no water left out for us so we took one from the mini bar When we checked out I saw that they charged me 9 Euros for the water So excessive ridiculous really for a small bottle of water The next two nights they left bottled water for us on the nightstand , My daughter and I stayed for 3 nights and had a lovely stay in Paris The location was excellent directly across from the Louvre The front desk staff were helpful The beds were comfy and the room was well appointed Very nice bathroom with large walk in shower 
88794,H tel Regina, Breakfast really needs improvement It was not a 5 start hotel breakfast at all Room carpets need to change , Location is perfect Beds are really comfortable Staff were amazing 
88795,H tel Regina, A very noisy flag pole above our room kept us awake No mirror in the room Terrible bar staff and wine selection They ran out of tonic as it was Paris Fashion week And we couldn t order wine as the sommelier was off and he had the key , Lovely room Eiffel Suite Nice reception staff
88796,H tel Regina, This is minor but I wish the bedding and curtains in the room weren t boring beige and dark brown other colors would have reflect the grandness of the hotel better , Amazing location Walked everywhere from the Louvre to Pont des Invalides to the stores on Saint Honore Great and friendly staff especially the lovely Helen and Beligh 
88797,H tel Regina, Nothing, Our stay at the Hotel regina was excellent in every way The hotel is beautifully renovated modern amenities but with traditional charm My bedroom was a good size not particularly big but roomy by Parisian standards with a magnificent view There was complimentary instant coffee and a coffee pot so I could fix myself a cup of coffee before starting the day The bed was very comfortable and the room extremely clean The bathroom was a very good size with soft big towels not commonly to find in french hotels and a good sized shower The staff was extremely courteous and accommodating The hotel s location is perfect within walking distance of many famous sites and great neighborhoods and very close to metro stops And all this came with the most reasonably priced rate I have ever seen I would have expected this experience to cost deservedly so at least three times what my room cost I can t rate this hotel highly enough I would go back there in a heartbeat A beautiful hotel in a fantastic location with superior staff 
88798,H tel Regina,No Negative, I went to Paris on a special occasion and let the staff know so they could help me prepare a surprise for my fianc e I must say the staff was 5 stars very friendly and always ready to help They made the whole experience better than I could have imagined it We travel a lot and always stay at 4 or 5 stars Hotels and I can say this was one of the best Hotels we stayed on Will definitely stay there again on my next trip to Paris 
88799,H tel Regina,No Negative, Friendly and professional staff Good sized room and well equipped bathroom Bar and restaurant service was very good also and at breakfast an excellent selection 
88800,H tel Regina,No Negative, The hotel is stunning The staff were exceptional and couldn t do enough A truly memorable stay So much so that I m going back very soon
88801,H tel Regina,No Negative, Great hotel and very courteous and helpful staff always willing to go the extra mile to anticipate on your needs Beds were gorgeous rooms very large and the location near the Louvre s entrance and within walking distance of a number of the city s landmarks is top 
88802,H tel Regina, I had no complaints about anything oh I know there was no HBO type channel so TV was a challenge only 4 British channels and 30 other language channels , The staff went out of their way to provide us with everything we requested They were always pleasant and happy Everything was clean and presentation was a 10 
88803,H tel Regina,No Negative, Luxurious hotel Quiet clean spacious room Prime location Excellent breakfast first rate lounge What really makes the hotel is its superior staff who are gracious accommodating thoughtful and attentive to detail 
88804,H tel Regina, That there was no espresso machine, We stayed in Junior suite We loved spaciousness abundant cupboard space cleanliness and organization of the room and the facilities 
88805,H tel Regina,No Negative, This is a magnificent grande dame hotel situated right in the heart of the opera district directly across from the Louvre I am a Canadian and stayed in this hotel for eight nights during the Christmas season I don t speak fluent french but the staff were extremely accommodating with the English speaking guests everyone from front desk housekeeping to the concierge as well as the lounge and restaurant They are also all very accommodating and friendly The rooms are spacious and well kept very elegant and clean Every few days I would have a full bowl of fruit and chocolates left in my room clean fluffy robes and slippers a towel warmer in the bathroom and windows that open for fresh air and a beautiful view The concierge was extremely helpful in helping with tours directions Prices are surprisingly comparable to many other hotels that are more run down I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in the heart of Paris in the lap of luxury I will definitely be booking this hotel again as I love the city of light 
88806,H tel Regina, bath was too narrow I am not fat just ordinary size but my husband and I both had difficulty in getting out of the bath because we could not turn this would be almost impossible for a larger person ,No Positive
88807,H tel Regina, not many choices in breakfast Coffe is only served once and the waitress doesn t check whether I need another one , Reception is very nice and we feel very welcomed Room service is very considerate and in second day an extra bath salt is prepared Bed is comfortable with different size of pillows 
88808,H tel Regina, De rien Tout superbe , Marvelous helpful staff Wonderful room with a lovely view Convenient to the Louvre block away at best Good hotel food Knew gluten free and accommodated it very nicely 
88809,H tel Regina, I would change nothing about my stay , The staff was courteous professional and friendly The hotel itself is a beautiful Art Nouveau building in a prime location across from the Louvre Good value for the money worth every penny 
88810,H tel Regina,No Negative, The room we stayed in looked over to the Eiffel Tower which was all lit up We had fresh fruit in our room and the room was amazing along with the hotel 
88811,H tel Regina, Would have liked the towels folded in the bathroom when they turned down the bed in the evening One occasion they took our key and we only had 1 tea bag for 2 people each day , Comfortable bed Excellent staff Will certainly return and would certainly recommend to others
88812,H tel Regina, front door is not convinient for baby strollers Staff asistence is needed everytime , One of the best place that can be picked in Paris as a 5 star hotel with these price levels Location staff approach cleanness amenities quality and atmosphere are good 
88813,H tel Regina, Nothing, The staff were exceptional and no request was too much trouble I really can t fault the hotel in any way from our bags being taken as we exited the taxi on arrival through to departure we were made to feel special The hotel is ideally located for the sights or fashion houses Well done Regina 
88814,H tel Regina, Decoration made by cheap and imitated furnitures Food and beverage management not working well , Location and the structure of the hotel are precious 
88815,H tel Regina, There could have been a separate shower cubicle rather than shower over the bath , Great sound proofing even though room faced the road I could see the Eiffel tower from my room Staff were friendly and helpful The bed was also extremely comfortable one of the best I have slept in in a hotel Good restaurant recommendation 
88816,H tel Regina, The selection of TV channels to watch is rather poor and limited Should be more international and more variety since most channels are only news , The in room dining experience and the comfortable rooms
88817,H tel Regina, The concierge needs to be a little more intuitive about their customers and more engaging, Helena at the reception desk is very kind and very helpful She has an excellent personality and friendliness about her
88818,H tel Regina,No Negative, Regina is a beautiful hotel in a perfect location Walking distance to The Louvre and with a view of the Eiffel Tower The staff was amazing Friendly helpful and very efficient They made our stay in Paris even more memorable 
88819,H tel Regina, Housekeeping work is not that good when we are speaking of 5 star Hotel , Great location to go everywhere by any transportation bus Metro PER Bike etc Staff are very nice Hotel looks awesome 
88820,H tel Regina, we had dinner the night before we left waited approx 1to 2 hrs for our meal we were the only customers there Also the next morning for check out was a shambles We gave them plenty of notice that we were checking out early so we could have luggage brought down early morning call express breakfast which was paid for in our booking we had no early morning call had to call down twice for baggage still nobody came driver was waiting for us still no baggage breakfast was pathetic 1 apple 1 bottle of juice for 2 people what a let down this was at the end we said we will never go back again it was good at the begining then failed we loved Paris and said we would return again next year but not to this Hotel,No Positive
88821,H tel Regina,No Negative, Excellent location Our room had a view of the Eiffel Tower The entire staff was friendly and very efficient The concierge team was extremely helpful in arranging our activities 
88822,H tel Regina, Restaurant was great service but food not too impressive But there is so much choice around that is not a worry It wasn t bad just not amazing , Beautiful hotel 5 star quality all the way through Everyone is very friendly and the attention to detail is spot on We had a view of the Eiffel Tower and was a great room In fact the family room was two connecting rooms which is great as the kids think they have a room of their own and bathroom but they are under easy watch still Concierge and doorman are so ready to help you on anything Location is 150m from the tuileries metro station That is good because you are sort of in the middle of all the main places to see Louvre is literally round the corner You cannot be better placed Rooms are spotless and wifi works impeccably Just have to do a relog in every 24 hours Expensive but it is 5 star and you get what you pay for Well recommended to anyone who wants to enjoy Paris in style 
88823,H tel Regina, Because we had 4 childten all very young we were made to book an adjoining room to the suite which we did not use and was not needed and added unnecessary expense , Location is directly across from the Louvre and a nice walk to so much more Booked the suite with view for special occasion and it was unforgettable 
88824,H tel Regina, Probably would have liked a few more tea bags on the tray in my room to make a cuppa when I needed more than just 2 per day Breakfast was lovely and varied but I would have loved some poached eggs not just scrambled , I loved my greetings from staff at Reception from the minute I arrived to the minute I got into my cab to leave The staff were wonderfully competent in both French and English and I can only thank them enormously for respecting my attempts at conversing with them in French They consistently praised my French pronunciation and encouraged me all the way to use my 2nd language I felt totally at home and very very welcomed My room was to die for with a magnificent little French balcony overlooking the beautiful Tuilleries Gardens as well as the Eiffel Tower even though the hotel is located in Arrondisement 1 Special thanks need to be given to Franck and to Delphine on Reception with whom I shared some delightful if somewhat broken on my part conversations in French A wonderful experience I highly recommend the hotel 
88825,H tel Regina, At arrival due to their overbooking we were kindly offered to change our booking so that we would spend 2 nights in a different rooms though with discount But they should realize that for romantic weekend in Paris planned much earlier it was not an option from the beginning ,No Positive
88826,H tel Regina, i think they need more staff at the reception i have to wait a long time to check in and check out the door is too old to open , nice room and nice people 
88827,H tel Regina, Sadly we encountered pick pockets upon our arrival warning to all future travellers please be vigilant The hotel had the incident on cctv but of course we didn t get the purse back The hotel staff were fabulous and very very helpful , The hotel was beautiful and the staff couldn t have been more helpful friendly or accommodating for the entirety of our stay Our room was upgraded to a prestige suite Absolutely wonderful 
88828,H tel Regina, none, 1 Location Just face to Louvre many of touring spots are within walking distance 2 Room High ceiling classical elegant with comfortable bed 3 Staffs All staffs are kind polite always smiling Finally 5 star hotel but not so expensive 
88829,H tel Regina, Safe is not secured to the building It can be picked up and placed in suit case, Location and helpfulness of staff Also asked for a balcony with view and it was given to us Thanks you
88830,H tel Regina, It would have been nice to have breakfast included in the price but this didn t spoil things , The suite was amazing like an apartment and was beautifully decorated The bed was huge and super comfy Even the slippers were super soft It was the most beautiful rooms we have ever stayed in The staff were excellent and nothing was too much trouble 
88831,H tel Regina, Missing a gym The breakfast was underwhelming , The staff was incredibly nice The service was impeccable The location was perfect Had connecting rooms family room with a king 2 twins attached in one room and a queen in the other VERY hard to come by in Europe Also having 2 full bathrooms was great Highly recommend this beautiful boutique hotel and would absolutely stay there again 
88832,H tel Regina, When staying in a hotel like the Regina I don t expect to be questioned as to if I m staying In the hotel when asking directions to the bathroom and then after staying yes having my room number requested Assume you guests are not lying to you, Location was very central right on the river breakfast was not worth having in the hotel
88833,H tel Regina, Hall way doors banging in the night , Comfy bed and helpful Staff Expensive but a drink in the bar was set apart from the bustle outside and very conducive to relaxation 
88834,H tel Regina, The breakfast buffet could possibly have had more options to tempt us , From reception to housekeeping the staff was amazing Very friendly and efficient and went the extra mile to make your stay perfect The hotel itself is gorgeous and the rooms large and luxe especially for Paris The location was unbelievable I was traveling with a 3 year odl the most difficult of guests and it was very easy including special toiletries for her and a little robe WE stayed on the third floor and booked the delux and premium delux room One was slightly larger than the other but maybe not enough for a price difference They provided an iron on request and my mini bar stopped working and it was quickly replaced The hotel and rooms are like their official pictures so no worries there There are lots of cafes nearby so never opted for the breakfast there but ordered room service once fried eggs etc the eggs were oversalted the first time so just make sure you specify We will definitely stay here again 
88835,H tel Regina, We were upgraded to a room with Eiffel tower view I already thought hotel was expensive so don t know how much more this room would cost, Position breakfast room staff Would stay here again Staff really looked after us and nothing was too much trouble 
88836,H tel Regina, Neighborhood is a little touristy, It was my 40th birthday and they upgraded us for free to this amazing suite overlooking the Tuilleries and the Effile Tower 
88837,H tel Regina, Check in was complicated took too long and gave inaccurate information to start, Staff was pleasant Concierge was very pleasant Porters was splendid 
88838,H tel Regina, Breakfast choice and quality below expectation for this hotel standard Quiet peaceful breakfast would be appreciated early in the morning , Location could not be better room on Rivoli street facing Le Louvre well insulated from street noise
88839,H tel Regina, Sadly the restaurant for breakfast and the bar was empty most of the time so there wasn t much atmosphere therefore we went out but if you encouraged people to have breakfast as part of the room rate it would encourage others to use the facilities more , Lovely hotel in a great location close to everything and brilliant for sightseeing and of course shopping in the lovely boutiques Very close to some gorgeous restaurants so you can walk to everything 
88840,H tel Regina,No Negative, Perfect location comfortable bed good airconditioning everything you would expect from a highend hotel Staff very kind Most of all perfect view of Paris and the Eiffel tower 
88841,H tel Regina, We selected to stay at the Regina for our last four nights after a month stay in France We had high expectations since this is a 5 star hotel but sadly we were extremely disappointed It was a really sad end to an otherwise amazing time in Paris and France When we arrived the room was nice but in a very poor location There was no view and the noise level from the hotel staff was outrageous On one day we counted ten times hotel staff slammed doors outside our room There was constant noise from the hallway from staff and from outside our room with things clanging crashing We might have been near the hotel bar or restaurant It was not acceptable There was no hot water in the shower in our room when we arrived We called the front desk twice to get someone to look at it The night manager checked it and confirmed it was broken We were offered a smaller room on a lower floor in a less desirable location for the same price no less or wait until morning to have it fixed We thought the offer was pretty ridiculous so we opted to have it repaired in the morning We were told someone would arrive between 8am 9am to fix it No one showed up so at 9 30 we called and someone finally showed up at about 10 15 He got it to work but only minimally so We were not offered another room or any discount on our room The water was lukewarm at best with NO water pressure whatsoever The staff were polite but very slow to respond We had to call four times to get towels and when they arrived at our room they did STILL did not have what we requested They constantly entered our room even when the light outside our room was red indicating we wanted privacy and did not want our room serviced When the green light indicating service was wanted no one showed up We had to call to request service We called to complain about the noise and the fact that the shower was still not functioning properly , Location of the hotel Strong WiFi Beautiful hotel
88842,H tel Regina, Room service was subpar Breakfast was weak Service was marginal No resort amenities , Great location with amazing views We got to see the Bastille Day fireworks over the tower 
88843,H tel Regina, Breakfast wasn t the best continental really Decor a little tired in places , The best Concierge we ve ever had Location next to the Louvre and so many other attractions was fabulous 
88844,H tel Regina, breakfast is simple and same every day which didn t really value the price of 32 euros Though no proof I highly suspect that the 1500 euros in cash that my husband and I lost were stolen at night in room during our stay Hotel staff took notes of our reporting of money lost but we didn t receive follow up messages as promised , the location is superb you can take a walk to Louvre or Tuileries and sit to enjoy a quiet sunset Room is spacious compared to normal Paris hotels We had two rooms and one of them facing the Eiffel Tower very nice

88894,H tel Regina, That booking com writes that they have an airport shuttle which is not true I had to hire my own shuttle service called Start Shuttle The hotel should work in concert with them so they can offer what they say they really offer For 26 Euros ibtook this shuttle whereas a cab or limo would have been 60 100 Euros , The staff was amazing I became very ill just as I had arrived there and they called in a Concierge Doctor for me whom was there w in one hour then they rushed out and picked my meds up for me They made it so I could fly out the next A M and not have to spend another day in bed there They were all lifesavers The bed was so comfy too Room was small and there was some noisy construction going on below me but the way they helped me during my awful illness was remarkable

88904,H tel Regina, Nothing but if the breakfest is included into the room price would be better, The location of the otel is perfect the most important streets and avenues are just 10 min by walking but also very silent and peaceful
88905,H tel Regina, Rude staff after have checked out I left my bags there When I got back I needed to use the toilet and was stopped by rude receptionist asking what I wanted Asked for the toilet and she says it s in your room I told her I ve already checked out and showed her the tag for my bags in which she extremely apologized and showed me where the toilet was Paid 650 euros to stay there for 2 nights to have this last experience There are better hotels to stay in , Comfortable bed

88908,H tel Regina, We both drink English Breakfast tea and the one teabag we received was never replaced over four days We found it a bit much that we were meant to pay for any extra teabags Really petty and disappointing for a lovely hotel We also found the duvet far too hot and honestly never had a very good nights sleep I would suggest a sheet and easily washable light blanket much healthier and pleasant especially in summer , Loved the ambience and the location Staff were most helpful and friendly 
88909,H tel Regina, But after we left I receive a mail for later charge for mini bar I wrote back to the reception and asked them to clarify what I have taken from the mini bar but three days pasted there was no answer It is just 9 euro and I can pay for the five star hotel suite also in term of honest I shall never deny my expense how could I deny this 9 euro upon check out Thus I think that is very impolite and rude for the hotel to charge me later and can not provide the facts which leads to a very bad experience , the location is good and the effiel suite we is super 
88910,H tel Regina, I bought 3 pairs of shoes 2 empty boxes and one shoe remained in the bag The cleaner threw away the entire bag thinking it was rubbish but it included one new shoe The cleaner should have verified if this was rubbish Management was very nice to reimburse me for the shoes and were sorry for the inconvenience, The bed linen was lovely and the reception and manager were good
88911,H tel Regina, If I had to critic one thing it would maybe be wifi Was somewhat slow at times , The hotel location is really convenient close to the Louvre and has great metro connection links The room was amazing The bed was extremely comfortable I would describe rooms as old french luxury I had a great view of the Eiffel tower also The staff and concierge were also extremely polite helpful and friendly Will definitely stay here again 
88912,H tel Regina, Minor quirks not worth mentioning , Helene checked us in and was so warm and welcoming in a genuine way All the rest of the staff were also very professional and accommodating This hotel offers you a glimpse into the past a time were customer service really meant something The inherent sense of luxury that you get is very real The marble the art work decor If you want to experience the romance of Paris this is the only hotel for you
