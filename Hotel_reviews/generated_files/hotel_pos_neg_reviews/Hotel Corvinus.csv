377696,Hotel Corvinus, There was a strange smell in the room probably due to the fact that the hotel is located in an old building no parking of the hotel but there s one really close to the hotel , Excellent location on Mariahilf street close to the center shopping area and restaurants Large room for 3 people 
377697,Hotel Corvinus, Slightly dated Shower bathroom very small with sliding door Very small lifts up to the hotel which calls itself pension Not for a romantic stay , Good location clean and comfortable and good value Spacious room Nice staff 
377698,Hotel Corvinus, Nothing, The hotel was located right on Mariahilferstrasse a top location in Vienna with an underground train stop next door going straight to the center AC is available upon request of the remote not a given in Vienna I was upgraded to a nice double room even though I only booked a single room The people were very nice 
377699,Hotel Corvinus,No Negative, The hotel is very comfortable with home and friendly atmosphere It is located in very good place on the central street of Vienna with many shops and cafes For travellers is ideal variant 
377700,Hotel Corvinus, The bathroom was a small plastic box like from a ship in the 80th Just for one person and you couldn t really move The bed was so soft that we couldn t sleep and the curtains are not really helpful it was like in the daytime , The hotel is in the beginning of a shopping street A lot of restaurants coffee places or bars are in this area The staff is helpful and friendly For a short stay is the hotel ok 
377701,Hotel Corvinus, Although we did get a double bed that we specified mattress was not one Much less comfortable Actually the 2 mattresses were sunk at middle of the joint line Sliding bathroom door is substandard for important and obvious reasons , Room size friendly staff location Church with church square next door and all that in one of best parts of town 
377702,Hotel Corvinus, the shower was inconveniently built , The family running this hotel were very nice helped you out with a smile anytime The room was very comfortable with big windows Not to forget the location some good breakfast places around 
377703,Hotel Corvinus,No Negative, The staff at Hotel Cornivus were amazing So friendly and welcoming made the stay very homely and comfortable Location was also incredible Short walk to the museum quarter and a nice stroll to the State Opera and the rest of town Overall a really great and warm atmosphere 
377704,Hotel Corvinus, Some members of the staff were smoking in the lobby in front of the elevators Breakfast was expensive No refrigerator in the room , Excellent location clean room Shops and supermarket very close to the hotel Would return there 
377705,Hotel Corvinus, The room was very cold and only they day after we arrived they turned on the heating After cleaning the room when we arrived late ate the hotel we found 2 times the windows wide open at 0 degrees Poor breakfast , Good location 
377706,Hotel Corvinus, NOTHING, I liked almost everything from check in to check out I am sorry I cannot say the name of the owner because it is difficult for me but he was an amazing and professional person The hotel is very clean and quiet and the room was big clean and comfortable with mini bar and coffee machine The location was a hit in the heart of Mariahilfarstrasse A Kino cinema is next to the hotel Everything is handy in the area shops pharmacies cafe restaurants etc Places of interest like cathedrals and museums were within a walking distance The staff catered for my questions and requests very well I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there again 
377707,Hotel Corvinus, 0 this is a Pension and NOT a 4 star hotel 1 WiFi was there but no real access to the internet 2 I stood for 3 days My room was not cleaned on the 2nd day When I approached the owner he seems not to be aware of it although this is a small hotel of about 15 rooms 3 Although their driver was workless waiting in the lobby they charged me 39 euro instead of 35 euro for the hotel to airport transfer as they promised saying that I should have ordered it in advance , Excellent Location Good Price Performance Cleanliness Breakfast very good and to the point
377708,Hotel Corvinus, The location was a bit far from Old Town Vienna We had to walk about 15 minutes so not terrible but a bit of a walk after being on our feet all day However the street Maria Hilfer was nice with lots of shops and restaurants , The owner was very helpful Every morning he got us hot water for tea The room was large and very comfortable We had a problem with the satellite TV and the owner worked on it very diligently We felt the price was very good for the value 
377709,Hotel Corvinus, All good but I guess people who like to drink tea would have missed not having a kettle very minor point for me , Lovely spacious room excellet facilities including kitchenette and jacuzzi 
377710,Hotel Corvinus, There was a very bad smell coming from bathroom and hotel should give an attention to the cleaning services Except that everything was OK , The staff is super friendly and willing for help Location is excellent We enjoyed our 6 days trip in Vienna 
377711,Hotel Corvinus,No Negative, The staff went out of their way to help us in every way Myklos the man who runs the desk is such a sweetheart and went above and beyond for my friends and I Comfortable bed and room 
377712,Hotel Corvinus, 1 They take money for any guest in u room even he will not stay for a night 2 Air condition is really bad 3 It s deserve only 3 stars not 4 Too expensive for the value , At the heart of vienna

377716,Hotel Corvinus, Nothing Everything was great , Very respectful and helpful staff The location is perfect in Vienna Always feel at home and welcomed there I ve stayed several times 
377717,Hotel Corvinus, Location was at least a 20 30 minute walk from anything up to a 1 1 30hr walk The mattresses were awful and gave us back problems The staff didn t bring new toiletries every day despite having cleaned it I even found a banana peel left on the floor by the bed after their cleaning We were accused of smoking in the room when we had never smoked a day in our lives We had to ASK for them to let us turn on the air conditioning and were told we didn t need it and the A C didn t work on top of that The staff was very rude and overcharged us for a shuttle which was supposed to be 34 euros but they charged us 50 instead Every time you left you had to give them your hotel room key and they have a system of buzzing you in to the main room and your hotel room hall that is significantly annoying There was construction in the room next to us that led to pounding on the walls all day Overall not recommended for stay find a real hotel , nothing 
377718,Hotel Corvinus, Nothing All was perfect , Location is in the middle of EVERYTHING And in the same time in a shopping street medium end Zara style full of restaurants and close to museums The hotel and the owners are amazing always available Rooms and beds comfortable Amazing experience in this hotel Thank you host

377726,Hotel Corvinus, One needs to ask the reception to enter the tract with the appartment Not very convenient and not appropriate given the price for the apartment , The room or better the apartment room is spacious overlooking the street Very clean and perfect

377728,Hotel Corvinus, From the photos I thought there was a Nespresso machine in our room but the owners have one and gave us a coffee when we arrived My sons room had no window Just a false one onto a corridor, Hotel was in quite a good location but pictures deceptive Hotel on 3rd floor of much larger building Family run and nice staff Room was small and bathroom tiny
377729,Hotel Corvinus, poor breakfast bad soundproofing not a 4 hotel just family run hotel situated on a third floor of a building , excellent location on one of the main shopping streets next to metro good wi fi
377730,Hotel Corvinus, Every time when you come in you have to inform the receptionist since the hotel is only a part of a bigger building and you don t have keys for all the doors Limited breakfast selection , Fantastic location and excellent helpful staff The rooms were of a good size and well equipped Did not hear any noise from the large pedestrian MH Strasse

377734,Hotel Corvinus, it is not 4 not even close it is family run type of the hotel and there are two separate beds pulled together in a double room we just hate it there were some problems with wifi at some moments the connection could just dissappear though you could still see the sign of the wifi, You actually should not expect 4 hotel it is more like family hotel which is situated on a third floor of a living building where also other hotel on another floor and some appartments on the other side It s not bad it s just not what we expected for those who what to be close to the shopping district and Nashmarkt it s a right place and U bahn is just 200m away
