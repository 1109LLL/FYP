87125,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, The only drawback was that the train ran right in front of our window which was noisy and times I still would have chosen the room for the view , The room was small yet expected in Paris Very clean and comfortable We described the decour as crisp Staff were all very nice and helpful Breakfast was great to start the day quickly Hotel itself was very quiet We had an amazing view of the Eiffel Tower which is the main reason I chose the hotel Walk to the tower was about 15 minutes Shopping nearby 
87126,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Good location near the Eiffel Tower can see it from on the bed across the road from the Metro not noisy and near a few restaurants for easy dinner options 
87127,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, We had a wonderful stay The staff was very friendly and helpful the location was great with easy access to transportation and restaurants The room was very clean and the bed very comfortable 
87128,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, Poor communication with staff inadequate plumbing often no water at busy times paid for view of the Eiffel Tower required leaning out of the window no bar and no enough staff at the desk for checking in or out , Very close to Metro
87129,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Very friendly people and great shopping easy city to get around both by walking and Metro the station was only across the street but the rooms are sound proof you can t hear anything 
87130,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, The small croissants and chocolate croissants for breakfast were unfortunately quite dry not what I expected from pastry in Paris , Fresh orange juice for breakfast The staff was very friendly and changed our initial room from the 1st to 4th floor as we were afraid of the noise of the metro just in front of the hotel From the 4th floor we even had a beautiful view of the top of the Eiffel Tower The location of the hotel is great there are a lot of shops and restaurants around the metro stop is just in front On Sunday s there is a market 5 minutes away 
87131,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, The room size is typically Parisean ie small and being here for the marathon made this a challenge to prepare The storage could be improved to reduce this issue, Staff were extremely pleasant and went out of their way to help with our requests They made us feel welcome and personalised our stay 
87132,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, Very bad service Staff very rude No free wifi as you said Over priced Room very small, Very bad service Staff very rude No free wifi as you said Over priced Room very small
87133,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, Poor wifi in room very cramped space bed too large little place to put things not enough hooks and bars to hang things , Location good service from staff
87134,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, We stayed in room 606 No View at all in that room in fact the windows are small but there s nothing to look at anyway Any room on the left side of the hallway will not have a view at all The room was VERY small The bed was not comfortable Our room wasn t cleaned everyday Actually it was only cleaned twice in 7 days Also just about ALL of the tv channels were in French We brought our Apple TV with us just in case that happened but the wifi was horrible so it kept cutting out last but certainly not least there was a fee of 60 euros for a late checkout plus a prorated fee for the time we were late Checkout is at 11 we Thought checkout was at 1pm at 1pm we received a call from the lady at the front desk I informed her I didn t know what time checkout was we d be right down We got downstairs at 1 30 and we were charged a late fee plus a prorated fee for every late hour so it s a charge on top of a charge I have never been charged for a late checkout I was very upset , The location of the hotel is perfect it s directly across the street from Cambronne metro station The gentleman who checked us in was very pleasant 
87135,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, There was no kettle tea coffee in the rooms The train going past was mildly noisy and we had a couple of slightly awkward interactions with a pushy taxi driver hanging round in reception All minor issues though , Clean small stylish hotel Comfortable bed polite staff Good location with nice patisserie and restaurants nearby as well as all public transport links 
87136,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, No English channels on the tv, Great view of the Eiffel Tower from 6th floor bedroom very friendly staff always greeted with good morning when coming out of the lift 
87137,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, The check in time is not flexible you have to check in at 3 pm or after 3 pm If you want to check in before 3 pm expect to pay a fee i think 40 Hotels I stayed in the past have been flexible about this, Amazing place to stay nice and clean and it is close to everything Many good restaurants nearby you can walk to the Eiffel Tower hop on and off bus etc highly recommended 
87138,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, The rooms are quite dark , The hotel is right next to a Metro Station so you can get quickly around Next door is a terrific bakery and a couple of good shops are in walking distance 
87139,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, They don t say anything about tax until you get there so you gotta pay a 10 tax which I thought it was muggy but other then that it was good , It was very clean but the breakfast wasn t that good to be honest 
87140,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, My colleague was billed for my room My room was exactly at the level of the aerial metro line that runs just in front of the hotel , Great location Breakfast was quite good Comfortable bed
87141,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, As our room was right opposite the Metro station the road was quite noisy during the day and most the night This wasn t a big issue for us but in the summer when you want the windows open it could be irritating to some However not a lot can be done about this so would not put us off staying again , Staff at First Hotel were friendly welcoming and very helpful Very helpful that they all spoke English The room was lovely clean and a good size with a comfortable bed Definitely a perfect stay for a young couple The hotel itself was very well presented and clean throughout We did not hear a noise from any other guests at the hotel so was very peaceful We could just see the top of the Eiffel Tower from our room which was lovely Great location with restaurants small shops etc around and right opposite the train station 
87142,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, There wasn t much not to like , When you walk into your room and the first thing you see is the Eiffel Tower through the window you know things are going to be pretty good from there on in Ecxellent location in walking distance of so much and transport links right outside Even the guys in the bar next door were great 
87143,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, There was no kettle complimentary coffee and there was no usb port for charging except the back of tv which takes along time to charge , Cleanliness friendly and helpful staffs Delicious and fresh breakfast buffet 
87144,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, the speed of the elevator very slowly the doorcards are very sensible to your smartphone, Very good breakfast the silence although the hotel is located near a round a bout very nice room
87145,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, Room was a little dusty patting the black blanket sent up a cloud of dust , View of Eiffel Tower from room 505 was outstanding Breakfast was lovely Benedicte the front desk staff was so helpful 
87146,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, Being across the street from the Metro station means that if you have a room with a view it will be noisy at night Although we enjoyed the whimsical black and white theme of the hotel the dimly lit hallway and all black walls and doors we did not like , The location can t be beat Walking distance to the Eiffel Tower The Metro Station is literally across the street Staff is very friendly helpful and efficient 
87147,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, The bathroom was tiny me with 4 travelers it was quite cramped I think it was a bit overpriced for the room but it was an overall enjoyable experience , Location was great right next to the cambronne metro station with the Eiffel Tower within walking distance We stayed in the suite and the view was spectacular The staff were friendly and the room was nice 
87148,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, The bathroom door was not working and they almost didn t secure our reservation cause the rooms were not reserved for us even though we have book few mths earlier Plus the credit card machine wasn t working and I had to draw cash for payment , The location is awesome Near metro Staff was friendly and it was a comfortable room for our stay 
87149,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, Our room was on the street side where traffic people returning from parties etc caused unslept nights due to huge noise Our room was a suite with two rooms but with only one real and small window Therefore the room is not very light Bathroom would require a lot more attention there is only one hook for towels but the room can hold 4 people The room would need more small tables or something that you can place you small items onto We also felt disappointed as the pictures from web site showed nicer view than you finally got from that one window You couldn t really see the Eiffel tower at all , Location of the hotel is great it is opposite of Cambronne metro station so it is easy to reach from the airport with 1 change only Hotel is close to Eiffel Tower and few other sight seeings Few nice restaurants around makes eating and drinking very easy Breakfast of the hotel was good fresh juice croissants and other delicacies 
87150,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, Breakfast was poor Paid an extra 45 euros for a view of the Eiffel Tower but when we got there the view was just the tip , Location was amazing and room was substantial and hotel is modern and clean 
87151,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, We tried a breakfast in the hotel and it was poor not the ingredients but the staff didn t keep an eye on various items being used in other words it was almost impossible to get a portion of scrambled eggs and a sausage or two at the same time, Very comfortable bed and room
87152,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, The exterior of the hotel didn t look like the picture it was in fact an old run down looking building but that s perhaps Paris for you We wanted to keep the room for 2 more hours on the day we was leaving but the hotel wanted half a days rate which was 90 this was extortionate I requested an Eiffel Tower view which I was supposed to pay extra for but the view was of the tip of the Eiffel Tower and not the full view of the tower as advertised we in fact got a view of the railway line I was not charged for this view though But I would have refused to pay for it if I was in fact charged Whilst inside this hotel was lovely I don t think the hotel reflected the price at all I could have got a bigger and slightly more luxurious 4 hotel for the same price or perhaps a little bit more , The location the quirkiness of the rooms and the hotel inside the staff was nice the rooms were clean and warm once they turned the heating on for us 
87153,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, Car parking a couple of blocks away is expensive and run down , excellent modern small hotel Easy access to central Paris good breakfast Staff extremely Helpful 
87154,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, It s a small hotel very cozy and clean The staff was very helpful and we thank once again the possibility of early check in and breakfast The location in front of the Metro is ideal to go anywhere We will never forget the fantastic night view from our bedroom window to the Eiffel Tower Magnificent

87160,First Hotel Paris Tour Eiffel, They did not have our booking No suite was reserved for us They didn t even know we were coming All suites were taken and we couldn t have the room we booked The male receptionist on arrival didn t believe me when I said I had booked even upon showing him the confirmation booking com sent me When I looked into the system for him we managed to find the booking Luckily there were other rooms available other wise we would of had to find another hotel But it was not what we wanted and it was our 1 year anniversary also , It was right by a metro also a nice bakery and a few bars and restaurants
