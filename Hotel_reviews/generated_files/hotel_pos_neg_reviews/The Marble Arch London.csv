146634,The Marble Arch London,No Negative, Excellent customer service was a little slow on checking me in but without any questions offered me a complimentary breakfast Extremely welcoming staff professional personable Great facilities 
146635,The Marble Arch London, Hot dishes at breakfast could have been warmer maybe difftrent hot terrains for service, It was ur 20th wedding anniversary and the staff were great we were upgraded could not fault them 
146636,The Marble Arch London, Terrible checking in process Arrived at 3am to the property and mentioned to that fact to the hotel prior to hand They decide to log me into a room that is in a different block had to walk with my luggage in the rain with an incompetent bellboy who was literally taking way too much time closing the umbrella before going in while I waited in the rain The other rooms are ridiculously far from the main property Room was terrible ground floor and not clean hair in sink lobby light into the room too much noise and just a terrible experience Asked to be moved and had to walk all the way back into the main hotel in the rain to be given a room grade which I initially booked It just seemed that at the middle of the night that was the only room available Asked to speak to the manager which was not communicated until he saw me checking out and asked about my stay Overall would definitely not recommend the hotel for future stay as there are tons of other hotels in London that offer proper services at equivalent prices including other 4 star hotels , Location is ideal but the service is subpar for 5 star hotels 
146637,The Marble Arch London, Room temperature room service, I have 2 change the room for tow times because of the AC it was very hot and they did not try to fix it even the third room was not that ok and the last day i had been stolen i could not find my perfumes Soo becarful with the room service staff

146640,The Marble Arch London, The bath plug didn t work so no water drained away though this will be an easy fix for them Disappointed to not get a bottle of water included in the room for the price I ve stayed in several less luxury hotels and have always had a free bottle of water or two 4 is a bit of a rip off for 500ml , Lovely hotel in a great location just up from the Marble Arch Comfy bed and good toiletries Nice chairs next to the sash window and a decent bowl of fruit Very modern and boutique with friendly staff

146643,The Marble Arch London, Room was extra small and the bad was also extra small After first night they changed my room but that one was also very small I think far a way not as confortable as a five star hotel Staff wasn t very kind always was a lot of guys at the reception but nobady said hello I think is a big trap no money return , very good location
146644,The Marble Arch London, Overpriced breakfast it is better to eat nearby Small wardrobe Very few European power outlets Very soft bed with extra hard pillows weird combination Didn t refill minibar though I didn t ask , Location is just great 5 minutes to walk to the Marble Arch Oxford Street or Hyde Park Nice room with glass wall between bedroom and bathroom press a button and it is not transparent anymore Nice set of toiletries Free water and apples at the reception just great

146647,The Marble Arch London, There was kind of a musty smell in or rooms when we first arrived not a big deal we opened the windows and it was fine after awhile , Another fab welcome from the Montcalm group This is the second time I ve stayed at one of the Montcalm hotels in Marble Arch and I ve been so impressed with the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff They go above and beyond Christian was particularly great he learned it was my friend s birthday and so rushed around to organise a surprise of gorgeous cakes and a bottle of wine So unnecessary but very kind 
146648,The Marble Arch London, The room was extremely small the smallest I have ever experienced , Has all of the mod con s fruit bowl neat and tidy although all squeezed into a compact space 
146649,The Marble Arch London, Only one person on reception long wait as the receptionist struggled with ensuring guest ha paid in advance as they claimed Despite paying by Debit Card in advance the reception still wanted to see photo id They then asked me to sign an impression of my Card on an old fashioned roller machine for the amount of the booking in case it wasn t my Card I simply said no I m not paying you twice The receptionist gave up arguing and all was well They need to review their customer service policies I don t expect to be greeted with mistrust, Beautifully appointed bedroom and bathroom but the bedroom was tiny The smallest I have ever stayed in Certainly not 5 Star However for what I paid certainly good value

146682,The Marble Arch London, The first mornings breakfast service can only be descried as shambolic every order of a party of four either had elements missing or unwanted additions added A word with reception sorted it out the next day however it really shouldn t need a word , The hotel is part of a much larger hotel situated across the road I actually thought that is the hotel I had booked It turns out we had booked into an annex of the main hotel and as such was a bit lacking in facility but still very comfortable

146696,The Marble Arch London, This was our second visit and we experienced problems again All electronic equipment was unplugged including phones The hot water wasn t working and we had to call front desk to get it fixed A handy man arrived quickly which was good The water then worked It ran and was hot but not very quickly or hot Fixtures and fittings were a bit wonky Quality control needs reviewing , A good quality hotel Quiet ang good location 
146697,The Marble Arch London, Lack of space to get past the bed and chair to get to the bathroom No heating in bathroom Definitely not 5 star and misleading promotion, Position and discount

146699,The Marble Arch London, The bed mattress was lumpy Towels were old and we had to call to change them Bathroom basin is so small and no place to place anything else Dustbin old and noisy The hotel enterance was nearly blocked by rubbish on street There is no way this is a five star hotel prepare to be disappointed , Staff were excellent
146700,The Marble Arch London, Our shower was very weak which wasn t ideal although we could have been unlucky with the room for a one night stay it was fine There could have been a more varied night menu with more vegetarian options , The staff were very friendly and welcoming the door men were brilliant The location was incredible particularly for the price and the street surroundings are very Londonesque beautiful at Christmas The hotel itself was cosy clean and tasteful 
146701,The Marble Arch London, May be the breakfast is the same for all days Suggest to do some changes in daily menu, Excellent hotel and hospitality Only price is high but it is norm in london

146703,The Marble Arch London, The I guess understandably for central London Compact and Bijou room was very badly impacted by noise from rooms on both sides Trust me I m not a moaner and most of my feedback on this site is positive we had television sound booming through our headboard wall and an adjoining door on the other wall until 1 30 am 1 00 am respectively on both nights It wasn t the other guests being bad you could barely hear their TV in the silent corridor but the wall was like a low frequency sound box and the door might just as well have been a Japanese screen noise insulation wise The rooms are thus expensive and yet badly insulated to say the least 5 star at 5 start rates in many ways but 3rd class in others I got a deal through Booking Com that meant I only paid 214 per night but that s a lot for poor sleep on each night IMHO If we got a basket case room because it could have been nearly 350 per night according to the website I question the Booking Com proposition , Friendly respectful helpful staff Nicely appointed if tiny and thus slightly stuffy room 
146704,The Marble Arch London, This hotel is 3 stars maximum and expected much more form a 5 starts hotel Rooms are very very small unless you want a basement room with a small window and extra humidity Very poor lighting in the bathrooms and good luck if one wants to shave or put makeups Most photos you see on the web such as google are from the Montcalm hotel across the street Watch for the mice , Location is excellent and beds pillows are very comfortable Good Free Wifi and a handy small pad for internet and free calls Complimentary fruits and water and tea coffee facilities Staff very nice and helpful

146707,The Marble Arch London, At the beginning the room located was not the room which i booked on booking com Some of the pictures in booking com do not reflect the reality, Receptionists were very friendly and hospitable 
146708,The Marble Arch London, Some of my girlfriends make up kit got stolen by the cleaning staff we told the receptionist but they really could not do anything First time that has happened , Location
146709,The Marble Arch London, The staff at the registered address of 31 Great Cumberland Place were lacking in knowledge on how to book people in We then got taken across the road to the Sister Hotel part and because of an error at 31 it took us an hour to book into 2 rooms They also said we had got an upgrade which was untrue we had paid for a Deluxe Room each The bar staff we rude not the Manager who was very polite and pleasant Wouldn t go back , Very clean good location
146710,The Marble Arch London, This hotel is like a trap the reception are well trained to give u the worst room so you show your discomfort with it so they can advise you they can shift u to Montcalm hotel across the street but of course for higher price Zero customer service , Location is great
146711,The Marble Arch London, The rooms were very small Washing towels were not supplied for two of the six days we stayed there , Staff were knowledgeable about where to dine or drink in the area 
146712,The Marble Arch London, The mattress in the sofabed can go thicker as it was too thin and the pillow to fluffy , The staff were very nice and extremely helpful Another thing is also because the upgrade my stay into a junior suite which was beautiful and lovely LOVE the location only 2 min walk to oxford st and around 10 15 min walk to regent

146715,The Marble Arch London, Would have loved a normal bigger swimming pool as the plunge pool system to swim against the current didn t work, Lovely room Great Location Staff were great Club Lounge was fantastic 
146716,The Marble Arch London, Several points 1 TV facility in the room stopped working after only 30 minutes and having contacted staff I was told there was a fault with the system They didn t know when it would be fixed This meant that my staff for one night wasn t off to a great start as I couldn t even watch the TV to unwind from a long day 2 The light surrounds for the ceiling spotlights seemed to be loose as if ready to fall away 3 The lock barrel spindle on my side of the door appeared to be exposed missing a back plate As if it may have been faulty this didn t do much to reassure me of the lock working room security privacy 4 The mirror on the wall appeared to be cracked I brought all of this to the attention of a staff member who came to the room to check the TV when I first reported this fault I believe this may have been the hotel s general manager I was told all of these points were fine The next morning when I checked out I received a verbal apology from the desk staff only when I specifically reiterated the above points no refund on the bill It s very disappointing to pay around 150 for a night at a apparently upmarket hotel townhouse and not receive the service stay you paid for I did write to the company at their registered address three weeks ago and no reply disgraceful anytime I am in London again I will definitely not stay at any of their hotels , Good location 
146717,The Marble Arch London, Nothing, The hotel it self is a 5 stars but the staff make to me 10 stars They are so nice and friendly and working very hard to solve your problems and make there best to make you be satisfied in your stay And really I want to thank all the staff and the receptionist and special thanks to miss Reta I hope I spelled it right She was so nice to my son Bader Thanks again all of you
146718,The Marble Arch London, Deluxe single room was incredibly cramped and on the basement floor with the only window into the hallway Furnishings were new but not thoughtfully designed Sloppy service someone was still in the room when I entered after checking in the shower contained two bottles of body wash but no shampoo the safe didn t work , Great location 
146719,The Marble Arch London, I noticed that my dress was stolen from my suitcase when I came home Therefore I do not suggest visiting the Marble Arch This should not happen especially not in a hotel which has a good reputation Unfortunately the Marble Arch did not take its responsibilty in this matter therefore I feel obliged to mention it here in order to prevent recurrence to other guests ,No Positive
146720,The Marble Arch London, Terrible room tiny not big enough for two bed very small and so soft you roll to middle Very noisey outside and no soundproofing between room , Sorry Nothing other than its close to Oxford Street 
146721,The Marble Arch London, The Double room we booked was so small that you could not easily get around the double bed We paid over 300 pounds for this room in a 5 hotel and I have seen bigger cupboards This room was not fit for purpose in my view , Location was great
146722,The Marble Arch London, breakfast experience not enjoyable tables not cleaned and ready and poor service Shower disappointing the rainfall option barely had any pressure had to use the hand held attachment , Great location as visited Hyde Park literally opposite and very stylish entrance and warm welcome and easy check in Rooms pleasant 
146723,The Marble Arch London, When extending my stay I was quoted a higher rate than I could of booked myself online I told the receptionist and showed the rate on my phone to her She was rude and told me I d have to book it myself through booking com Further more she tried to charge me a cancellation fee for the additional night I hadn t even confirmed Spoke to the hotel manager and it was resolved but I d be reluctant to stay here again with service like that , Good location and clean rooms
146724,The Marble Arch London, Check in as it was brought as a birthday present and the staff were very unhelpful as they wouldn t let you check in with out the original card of payment , Amazing trip to London
146725,The Marble Arch London, Very warm in the room with little benefit from the air con however staff supplied a fan and complimentary cold soft drinks, Staff team very helpful and friendly Breakfast of a high standard with plenty of variety Awesome location
146726,The Marble Arch London, Nothing at all , The kindness of the reception attention of the staff and comfort of the Bed The Concierge always at the door greeting you is making you feel at home Extra thank you to the Concierge that can speak in Japanese 
146727,The Marble Arch London, This is a comfortable hotel but as a solo traveller I was too crammed in the single bed room I kept bumping into the walls The double rooms seemed to be spacious and it does not make sense to cut floor space down just because you are one person , Excellent and friendly staff 
146728,The Marble Arch London, I think if your hotel prices goes down slightly then it will be much better , Overall everything was great 1 Room was very comfortable 2 The hotel staff was very friendly
146729,The Marble Arch London, When we asked for the room to be cleaned it wasnt properly cleaned For example the bathroom bin wasnt emptyed and there was no tissue toilet, The location was good Having the toilet water sprinkler was great Ghe service and cleanliness of the room was also very good
146730,The Marble Arch London, Upgrade we arrived at the Marble Arch hotel to be told we had been upgraded to a room in the parent hotel the Montcalm located across the road Sounds great but the room was really small with a terrible view so i m not sure what we were upgraded from Oh yes breakfast in the original hotel was 12 breakfast in this upgraded hotel same menu same food 22 Rooms were well appointed very clean and Ok for a night , location is great near to Hyde Park Oxford street and West End
146731,The Marble Arch London, On my last day they closed the breakfast 10 minutes earlier than they are supposed to , The bed was extremelly comfortable Room has all the amenities one would need including a mobile phone guests are free to use in the hotel and around the city to browse the Internet and make calls to the UK the US and certain other countries for FREE 
146732,The Marble Arch London, They charge to provide knives and plates Charge exhorbitantly for an extra bed Poor breakfast , The location is awesome The hotel was comfortable and classy The room size is good compared to other nearby hotels in central London 
146733,The Marble Arch London, Room wasn t completely clean sockets and TV didn t work got a very good compensation though , Awesome but very expensive breakfast absolutely fantastic staff
146734,The Marble Arch London, They did not restock my refrigerator or clean my room when asked I was also waiting for assistance for the TV after waiting a while I went to the lobby and the guy had just been down there hanging out talking No rush to come help me ,No Positive
146735,The Marble Arch London, Should not really qualify as a 5 hotel more like 4 The room was extremely small while service at breakfast was certainly not 5 , Very pleasant boutique hotel in a great location just next to Marble Arch 
146736,The Marble Arch London, Small thing the carpet in the corridor is a bit of a trial when you are trying to wheel a heavy case , This is our second stay at this hotel in a matter of weeks upgrades from their little sister across the road A very good room on both occasions with a terrific bed full facilities and great bathrooms particularly on our second trip The staff on every level from the doorman to the cleaning staff couldn t have been better 
146737,The Marble Arch London,No Negative, Very good hotel and location The staff is very friendly and helpful The breakfast is a bit expensive but very good Fresh juices fruits vegetarian sausages croissants and many others And what we like the best is the Handy phone with free Internet local and some internationals calls navigator It was very helpful 
146738,The Marble Arch London, they hold the amount for the whole booking nights since i arrive they been losing my last night i should stay there eventually they fixed it but i guess there is no perfect system , I liked how they used the available technologies and provided for free for their customer free smart phone with sim card free to call every where there i pad room notifications of course it build up in the room price but come on such price in the heart of downtown very close facilities around you made our life easy I think its very convince price since its 5 stars hotel with such service and the additional provided stuff comparing to other 5 stars hotels highly recommend it 
146739,The Marble Arch London, When you opened the door of the room it hit a chair This was due to the size of the room It was more like a broom closet than an actual room When the guy took me to the room he actually only apologised rather than tell me anything about the room property , Clean 
146740,The Marble Arch London, The bar is very quiet But friendly staff And it s a smaller hotel so everyone is out anyways , We went to this hotel as a group of friends for the London marathon The hotel is lovely Not too big It s 2 mins from marble arch and oxford street so really central Rooms were new and spotless Staff were excellent Breakfast was great There is tech in the room to play with and they let us trial a new phone which was fun They called maintenance when my sunglasses broke Wow Will definitely be back X
146741,The Marble Arch London, The room was terrible in the basement The room was extremely small with very small window 30cm in front of that window was installed the AC exterior unit of other room meaning a lot o noise and almost no light was able to enter the small window Additionally the room was located in the basement below the breakfast room Employers decide to start dragging tables around at 4 a m all the noise could be heard inside of the room No more sleep after that since all the steps of the employers were making the old glass in the window to vibrate and make strange noises Really a nightmare Staff is also not nice and unable to follow your requests For 3 times I have requested the invoice under the company name for 3 times they were not able to do it They tried all the escuses including sealing the envelop with the invoice inside hoping that I would not open it and check that the invoice was still without the company name Then they have said the system do not allow to change the name only after I got really angry and start talking loud the system finally allow for the invoice to be made as I have requested inclusive when checking in It was my first and for sure last night at this terrible hotel , The bed was comfortable The water pressure in the shower was also OK 
146742,The Marble Arch London, The rooms are very well decorated but very much on the small side and quite dark Had to have the lights on during the day The bathroom as well was small You definitely can t be two in there getting ready Plus you feel your bathroom is part of the whole room , It s like a small boutique in a great location The bed was very comfortable and the shower had good pressure It s very a convenient location as you can literally get everywhere from here Tube station five minute walk Taxis easy to find and great shopping and restaurants near by The staff were all very friendly and helpful They actually put balloons and little cakes for my sons birthday 
146743,The Marble Arch London,No Negative, Fantastic service excellent friendly staff we travelled with a 18month old child so as you may understand things can be hard however staff at the Marble Arch made things so easy absolutely loved the hotel and would 110 return our new home in London 
146744,The Marble Arch London,No Negative, I have nothing to say except my stay was extraordinary and the staff there were friendly especially Madalina who made my stay pleasant and smooth The Montcalm hotel offered me a smart phone with internet and free international calls What a service 
146745,The Marble Arch London, nothing, everything the staff were so helpful so sweet so friendly the room 902 in the basement was huge seem like a suite comfortable bed the location was excellent to shopping close to the station special thanks to Rinha in the front desk she was so so cute with a friendly and smiley face they make our trip joyful
146746,The Marble Arch London,No Negative, I have been impressed by the quality of the service from the reservation to the ending They really know how to make your stay enjoyable and to make sure that every problem you may encounter is to get solved The room was well furnished a mix of high tech and more classical furnitures we were provided a phone with 4G which made our stay even simpler Every detail is well thought This was a perfect stay 
146747,The Marble Arch London, It would have been nice to be able to sit and have a drink beyond midnight Although the rooms have a mini bar they are just to small to enjoy it , Fantastic location clean nice staff 
146748,The Marble Arch London, room was 5 square meters literally about 20 cm from the end of the bed to the wall about 40cm from each side of the bed to the wall bed was 130 cm X 200 cm ceiling was less than 220 cm high matress was at least 15 years old and had a deep hole in the middle you have to sleep on a slope from the side of the matress to the center Old reception with tired forniture have to carry your own luggage to room despite stairs on the way overall hotell is a decent three star claiming five star status is completely ridicolous , location ok
146749,The Marble Arch London, Far too expensive for the tiny size of the room Mini bar items ridiculously priced Internet not secured and service not consistent , Clean and elegant Good location and distance from tube station Staff quiet helpful and professional 
146750,The Marble Arch London, the mattress rolled to the middle which would be bearable for single occupancy but annoying for two Hardly any room to walk around the bed to reach the bathroom and rather a lot of noise outside from the side aspect beneath the window , everything available within the room
146751,The Marble Arch London, Nothing, Fantastic position At the top of Oxford street The staff were fabulous They went out if their way to help Even trying to organise transport for me when there was a mix up with my pre booked ride 
146752,The Marble Arch London, The only thing I dislike it and I d like to mention it is the insects in the room , I d like to thank all the staff Ofcourse I am gonna stay again at the hotel in future 
146753,The Marble Arch London, We certainly could not fault a single thing , We were celebrating a special anniversary and the staff were absolutely outstanding and could not do enough for us We were upgraded to The Montcalm which made it all the more special We were greeted at checkin by the lovely Izabela who was incredibly friendly and helpful She showed us to our superb room which had been romantically decorated Chocolate covered strawberries and chilled champagne awaited us in our luxurious room It was such a lovely surprise and made us both feel very special Our whole experience was one that we will always remember and will certainly recommend The Montcalm to business colleagues family and friends Next time we are in London we will certainly be back Thank you from the bottom of our hearts Janene and Brett Brisbane Australia
146754,The Marble Arch London, No bar unless you went over the road to sister hotel , Great location for Oxford street staff very friendly rooms are comfortable and well equipped We really enjoyed our stay here 
146755,The Marble Arch London, When we arrived our booking wasn t showing so we were sent to two of the three hotels staff seemed confused as to which place and room we would finally settle into , Overall experience excellent everything was really good room food staff
146756,The Marble Arch London, Nothing , Everything The staff especially the receptionist Barbara is extremely helpful and the manager on duty last week was excellent and very attentive 
146757,The Marble Arch London, basement room had an adjoining room and the door needs sound proofing could hear the occupants next door clearly, The attention to service detail by the staff Always attentive and asking if they could do something bring a coffee etc
146758,The Marble Arch London,No Negative, The location of this hotel is perfect for working in and around London with an NCP car park next door for secure parking staff and hotel very nice and friendly will visit again and for nights out just off main drag into London shops fantastic
146759,The Marble Arch London, Room service and mini bar prices were very steep and we had nearly 30 vat added onto our booking which was not a nice surprise to have at the end of our stay , Loved everything inside the hotel decor was immaculate 
146760,The Marble Arch London,No Negative, Marble Arch by Montcalm boutique hotel is a gem of a hotel situated about 100 meters or so from the Marble Arch entrance to Hyde Park and equally close to the Marble Arch tube station It is within easy walking distance to the famous Oxford and Baker Street and a short uber hop to all of the more famous landmarks of London We stayed at the Marble Arch London for just over a week and were extremely happy with the hotel from the check in we were upgraded at no extra cost to the breakfasts to the overall friendliness of the staff The rooms were more than adequate considering this is London and space is a premium we were not cramped at all 
146761,The Marble Arch London, Improvements could be made to the champagne bar Club room was a little uninspiring , The atmosphere is very unprotenscious Very friendly staff who were very attentive Showed us to our room and explained everything Got a free upgrade from the hotel over the road 
146762,The Marble Arch London, 1 Even though the shampoo and conditioner were Elemis they made hair dull and hard to comb 2 At the check out any of reception staff didn t help with luggage and taxi even though they saw we had heavy bags The door man just disappeared and never showed off 3 Cleaning staff didn t provided toilet paper for several days and we were used to call reception 4 Safety box didn t work properly and everytime we used it it was a feeling that we might not open it again 5 My mom had a birthday during our stay but hotel didn t mentioned it Maybe it s not crutial but those little details make huge difference and emotions overall stay I was staying that hotel for the second time but not sure if i would stay with them again For that price I would find some better options , Good location nice room clean bed
146763,The Marble Arch London, Definitely not a 5 stars hotel Small rooms when travelling with a baby but ok for 2 persons , Very good location for visiting London Friendly and helpful staff 
146764,The Marble Arch London, Please see above any faults for this type of operation I would attribute to years of service and this has been addressed via pricing , The hotel is in a great spot and I received a really fair price Everything was passable or better in terms of comparison to price point The place obviously looks quite tired at the moment but will command a higher price point when it is refurbished so I have no complaints about the calculations at all 
146765,The Marble Arch London, The saga starts at check in although they had charged my credit card for the entire stay prior my arrival which is ok as I chose non refundable booking option they tried to force me to sign an old traditional payment slip on top When I refused they said they would not let me in to my room although they took my money for it After half an hour of nerve recking quarrel I managed to get into my room Then comes the part where it becomes an issue for the Trading Standards office The hotel is listed as a 5 star hotel but it is no more than a B B The pictures of the rooms I booked deluxe double have nothing to do with the actual one I had to stay in When challenged the front desk I was told the pictures on the site were of executive doubles and they get complaints often with no regret , Stay away i have travelled to 46 countries and many more number of cities Stayed in hundreds of hotels but I have not seen one nearly as bad as this hotel Apart from the central location of this facility which obviously is a defacto advantage which cannot be attributed to the people who run the place I honestly can say that there isn t one thing I can count as positive 
146766,The Marble Arch London, Some times the sound of the cars annoys especially at night the rooms are a bit small, Cleanliness of the property and friendliness of the staff bathrooms are very good more of arabic style
146767,The Marble Arch London,No Negative, The staff made us feel very welcome travelled for girlfriends 21st when asked by staff what we travelled for told them 21st we had bottle of wine and chocolates on bed when we come from exploring the city off London I would deffinatly stay in this hotel again also had breakfast free of charge in the morning off departure this was put on by hotel for girlfriend
146768,The Marble Arch London, While booking I picked the breakfast box unintentionally for two instead of one because default was 2 Then I sent an email explaining via booking immediately When I reached there I asked them to correct but they did nothing and charged two breakfast for one and I paid for a breakfast I did not get , Reception Barbara was very helpful
146769,The Marble Arch London, Nothing Great place , The staff is truly outstanding I was able to schedule a special reception for my wife s birthday and the hotel staff thank you Janine went the extra mile to make her staff exceptional Many little details that added up to a great experience 
146770,The Marble Arch London, Outside the Hotel the litter was awful and I would have thought they would have cleared it up maybe they do but not often enough We still had a great time , Very nice hotel in a great spot Nice staff good breakfast Well done the Marble Arch 
146771,The Marble Arch London, poor untrained reception staff room not ready on arrival poor room service no service then excuses made that meal was not ordered 1 5 hour wait room was not cleaned after 1st day etc summary rip off London style not worth 5 stars, good location
146772,The Marble Arch London, Breakfast very average no public stairs without going through the private areas, Location is great right at the junction of Mayfair the West End and Soho opposite Carnaby Street Staff friendly and efficient Real sense of history Rooms large and well specced 
146773,The Marble Arch London, The room type was different than the pictures on booking website I really appreciate that a member of staff has moved me to another bigger club room No window view as the room was on the basement floor No lobby The fruit basket was not provided in both rooms until I asked for it , Location staff
146774,The Marble Arch London, After we had settled into our room and did not really want to move people moved into the club room next door and we could hear every word they spoke when they were in the vicinity of the adjoining door , Friendly and very helpful staff Good food Great location 
146775,The Marble Arch London, Not possible to open the window at least in my room But believe this is due to teh structure of the building old on the outside new structure underneath Everything else was great , High quality boutique hotel Nice rooms with fresh renovation Good breakfast with a wide selection Attentive staff goes the extra mile This makes a big difference Good value for the money 
146776,The Marble Arch London,No Negative, Excellent location Very convenient to all the major stores and the nearby Marble Arch underground Quiet pleasant Great staff Very helpful Would definitely visit again 
146777,The Marble Arch London, I feel that just because we booked on a discount site the put us across the street in a room that was facing the street No only was it loud but we couldn t open the drapes as people were looking into the room Just disappointed after such a lovely room in the past This hotel didn t even have a bar had to go across the street , I have stayed at the sister hotel across the street and it was lovely 
146778,The Marble Arch London, The spa facilities were not working most of the day Very disappointed especially when we booked for Valentine s to relax , Rooms were clean and big Staff were friendly
146779,The Marble Arch London, Nill, I did like the service i had alot every one was treating me like a family they never ignored my request and when ever i ask for any thing i find it right away at my door step so thanks for that
146780,The Marble Arch London, The booking com listing and hotel s web site descriptions make the property more upscale than it is It s a nice property but not a 5 star property The walls around my room were paper thin could clearly hear conversations in neighboring rooms snoring nose blowing etc and there was very little space to move around in even by European hotel standards That said the bathroom was spacious odd lighting but great shower heads , Every single member of the staff was very friendly and helpful To me they were the hotel s best feature The hotel s location made it fantastic for easily picking up the Tube or a bus to wherever I needed to go 
146781,The Marble Arch London, Nothing , It is a small hotel feels homely beautiful rooms small but spacious enough You dno t need much room when you are travelling for business They have always provided me with a bigger room when requested They also go out of their way to clean a room for me as quick as possible as i arrive at 9am They have super efficient staff especially a lady called Barbara VIncenti at the front desk I left my credit cards at the hotel inside a parcel I left with concierge I phoned from Paris and she organised that they were delivered to me by courier the next morning Best service ever 
146782,The Marble Arch London, We were given a double bed for me and my daughter which led to a very uncomfortable night despite them being aware of this when we booked We asked to change rooms and was told there wasnt any Very disappointing , Location was excellent and easy to reach for all amenities This is a boutique hotel and you can used the facilities of The Montcalm across the road which we learnt from literature in the room on our departure 
146783,The Marble Arch London, The reception staff seemed to lack basic knowledge and skills On arrival i was told our original room had been changed due to the previous occupants having smoked in it However the room we were give was very small and despite running the air con at 26 degrees for ninety minutes it still remained freezing cold The bathroom also only had half a toilet roll in it no spare and when we asked for non feathered pillows we were told the hote had run out of them and would need to borrow some from the other hotel nearby We were offered another room but when we were taken to see it the staff quickly informed is that we couldn t have it as it was subject to maintenance and smelt of damp We were finally given room 303 which whilst warm obviously hadn t been cleaned that day as there was a layer of dust all over the surfaces Breakfast the next morning was also slightly shambolic as we needed to keep asking for basic items coffee butter etc On checkout it then took three members of staff to work out how to take part payment given that they had already pre charged my card This was a real shame as I have stayed in this hotel previously and also in its sister hotel across the road late last year both times having no issues Perhaps this was just an unlucky stay but it makes me question using this hotel again despite it being so convenient for work and leisure , The location was handy for both where we were going but also to get to from our respective offices 
146784,The Marble Arch London, the whole experience also I won t use booking com again staff very unhelpful regarding card mix up, Hotel took money from my account without permission before I got there when I told them prior that my daughter was paying on arrival Then someone knocked on the door with wine I said they had wrong room next day tried to charge it to me Tv broken took 2 engineers 2 attempts to fix also
146785,The Marble Arch London, The hotel is trading off the Montcalm over the road but I have stayed at both and the Montcalm has full facilities This location has very limited facilities and appears to be a poorly serviced overspill location which simply negates the association with the Montcalm ,No Positive
146786,The Marble Arch London, Some facilities only available in the main hotel across the road , Staff were fantastic and made our one night stay perfect With two young children they did everything they could to accommodate and offered us a room with more space They were all fantastic 
146787,The Marble Arch London, The rooms are super small, The staff was helpful and kind in dealing with customers and I would like to recognise two members of the staff whom where excellent in treatment they are Silvy and Barbara The hotel had good location 
146788,The Marble Arch London, The staff were not helpful The room was small and in the basement which is odd No privacy no soundproof I don t think that hotel is worth five star even four star is more than they deserve Think for alternatives , The Wi Fi was very good The location is close to main streets and shops 
146789,The Marble Arch London,No Negative, Perfect location Staff is very freindly and providing all necessary assistance without any delay Internec connection is stable and of good quality Single room is small but very clean confortable and providing all necessary facilities for short term staying 
146790,The Marble Arch London, Moved to an overspill suites room which was old Poorly refurbished and noisy Made up for apologetic free wine and room service Excellent staff,No Positive
146791,The Marble Arch London, Actually when I booked online the rooms were showing on the picture large and nice but when I arrived they gave me a smallest room even I couldn t move inside the room and I didn t have an enough space to put my bag and my personal stuff I was suffering at night from the other people because I can hear everything from the rooms , I like the location of the hotel because everything was near me 
146792,The Marble Arch London,No Negative, From the moment we stepped over the threshold of the hotel until we departed for home nothing was too much trouble for the staff who were all extremely friendly and helpful The bottle of wine sent to our room for our anniversary was also very much appreciated A very nice gesture Thank you 
146793,The Marble Arch London, Shower leaked they upgraded us across the street at a partner hotel but I m not sure we got a better room Room was only OK King was two doubles pushed together , Good location near Marble Arch Bond St etc Pretty good breakfast 
146794,The Marble Arch London, The hotel bar closed early, Lovely hotel with unbelievably helpful staff that literally could not do enough for you Excellent service Very impressed Lovely hotel in a great location
146795,The Marble Arch London, the main thing we didnt like was the smallness of the room and the noise and talking form the hall and other rooms were disturbing there werent any view the room was dark and the smell in the room was too intensive the bed was uncomfortable for conclution the location and friendly staff was the only thing we liked about the hotel for that price we expected more , location was very good and staff were friendly 
146796,The Marble Arch London,No Negative, Staff very friendly helpful Always there with a smile a greeting Also I needed a quiet meeting spot at extreme short notice they were able to accommodate me Thank you Janine Adilla
146797,The Marble Arch London, Partly my mistake too few quids 150 but never before ended up in tiny Ground levell Room with a wall view outside Even in NYC Could not change even when I offered to cover price difference So If You look for a nice view be carefoull and Check location as well size of a room , Location and friendly Receptionists 
146798,The Marble Arch London, The room views were horrible the room wasn t what i call high standard Also very small, The staff were very nice helpful Friendly made you feel welcome 
146799,The Marble Arch London, The room was small but comfortable Price is high Lobby is small , Small hotel great location just few steps to Oxford Street Edward road and marble arch tube station I requested my room in high floor to avoid getting room in basement Staff was very friendly and helpful 
146800,The Marble Arch London, Reception staff were too busy giggling about an in joke to realise they had someone waiting to check in and didn t appear to understand the concept of prepayment , Great location good food and well kitted out rooms although an ironing board wouldn t go a miss 
146801,The Marble Arch London, Lobby Breakfast Food variaty was not 5 The room was tight just the bed and walking space around it The desk chair has a problem metal supports bulging and pressing on your thighs, Location Free Wifi Clean Staff 
146802,The Marble Arch London, Photos in booking com not reflect the fact it s really discusting the room givin in the basement floor first time happen to me Breakfast is poor, Location
146803,The Marble Arch London, Our room was downstairs and once you went through the fire door there was an unpleasant musty smell The floor has subsided in places both in the hall and room so when you step on it your foot sinks The room itself was stuffy and the air conditioner didn t work so we opened the windows This was great but there was no security on the windows and they were at ground level , Great location at a reasonable price Close to Oxford Street and Hyde Park Tube station a short walk away Small but comfortable room with a modern bathroom Complimentary fresh fruit Helpful staff 
146804,The Marble Arch London,No Negative, Excellent service the staff at reception were very friendly and helpful They organised a very nice surprise when they found out it was my birthday The sofa bed in the room was broken but they kindly brought up an extra bed free of charge at 12am at night and set it up Very good value for money considering the spacious room and location Would definately stay there again
146805,The Marble Arch London, The size of the room but most of the hotels in london has small rooms, The location of the hotel the free wifi the area is quite the toilet has a water hose which is good
146806,The Marble Arch London, See above, We have booked several London breaks last minute and this one was the poorest value for money to date The room was very small and not very comfortable for three adults as advertised I consider the room was adequate for 2 persons only The room was not prepared adequately and it took hours for staff to respond to reqests to make up additional beds and to provide additional towels I would not recomend this hotel as value for money for a short break 
146807,The Marble Arch London, The room originally provided had no windows to open for fresh air I was struggling to breath upon complaining about this matter I was advised nearly all of the rooms have no windows So changing rooms was not an option upon asking for the name of the reception staff whom am I speaking to as I will be processing an official complaint in this matter The reception staff refused to provide his name and advised me he will speak to the manager and call me back With out any further conversation the phone was cut off Five minutes later a room with a window is available ,No Positive
146808,The Marble Arch London, I can only speak to the room I stayed in but the shower was extremely difficult to use The multiple water outlets and controls were not intuitive at all at least to me I am also not a big fan of turndown service and think it should be standard to opt in rather than opt out , Professional friendly staff Great location close to Hyde Park the Marble Arch tube stop and not a long walk from a section of Edgeware Rd with several late night food options 
146809,The Marble Arch London, Very small rooms Be careful pictures on booking don t reflect the reality in my room the flush in the bathroom was so noisy and wouldn t stop all night It is actually not a hotel just a accommodation so don t expect Hotel services it is not comparable no services given Single rooms are so small never book them no windows in the rooms or natural lighting old building , Location
146810,The Marble Arch London, We booked a Deluxe room but were initially given a Standard room which was very very small After we highlighted this to hotel management they changed our room to a Deluxe room which was a larger , The hotel is in a great location with some wonderful restaurants and pubs close by 
146811,The Marble Arch London, The size of the room 10Sq meters The condition of the room cracked floor tiles handles that came off in your hand The unprofessional attitude of some of the staff I am their customer not their college friend, The location 
146812,The Marble Arch London, The first night was horrible We were given a room in the basement I complained so much until the room was changed , The location is convenient The staff are friendly and helpful 
146813,The Marble Arch London, The hotlel is 5 minutes walking from the Mable Arch station however it is very confusing since all hotels near the Mable Arch station is called Mable Arch hotle but under different group takes me almost 30 minutes to find the right one i am very bad at direction The room is very small but it is London and located in the center it should be small , The service is very good and friendly room service is 24 hours basis fantastic 
146814,The Marble Arch London, The bed needs replacing as it sinks inward breakfast was sufficient but none of the teapot lids fit the teapots and always became displaced when pouring Also need block out blinds in the bedroom , Location was great
146815,The Marble Arch London, Even though it was a non smoking room it smelled badly from smoke We complained and was told it was because the person in the room next to us was smoking illegally However that did not help us much which was disappointing , Location was perfect only 2 min walk from the Marble Arch underground and in walking distance to Oxford Street 
146816,The Marble Arch London, The bed was very small and dented in the middle so that you rolled in to it Room was very tired dark and very small , Staff very friendly and helpful Location great for our trip
146817,The Marble Arch London, Just wish the cooked breakfast could be hot not warm , We were upgraded to the sister hotel Montcalm Well positioned hotel for our needs Very comfortable and very clean super hotel
146818,The Marble Arch London, The rooms are underground or ground level as far as I could tell There are too many stairs and manual doors to negotiate when you are carrying luggage There was a pervasisve smell of food dampness in the corridors , The staff were curteous and the room was clean and in good working order 
146819,The Marble Arch London, Room was in a separate building across the street from the main hotel So not really any facilities unless you go to main hotel First single room in the basement smelled terrible due to sewer issues next door Staff upgraded me to a double room ground floor which is nice of course but also pretty normal in these circumstances Bed linens where dirty brown stain and bloodstains and have to be changed Even for a double room pretty small though but as I was alone I don t care about it Staff was really nice and helpful but won t book it again , Helpful staff
146820,The Marble Arch London, The rooms are extremely crammed and much smaller in real life than you would imagine There was barely any space to move around and I was a solo traveller in a double deluxe , I liked the friendliness of the staff 
146821,The Marble Arch London, Nothing well was slightly hard to find at first but i mean had to spend 5 min to look at the map again, Place is amazing superb location with very kind staff Its a nice boutique like hotel with very few rooms and personal service feeling I spent months in a year staying at hotels and especially in London value for money this is one of my top choices I will surely stay there again 
146822,The Marble Arch London, Free wi fi does not always function , Central location but still quite enough for a quality sleep The 20 m2 room was satisfactory It is difficult to find spacious rooms at reasonable prices at the city center 
146823,The Marble Arch London, 1 Windows were not double glassed so sound street was a bet noisy 2 Size of the room small also the bathroom, Room was clean Good facilities Location wise it was good
146824,The Marble Arch London, The staff didn t do any thing I ve requested for example when the first time I arrived I found no facilities on the TV movies then I told them that no movies on the TV and since that time and I m every day request the same from the staff and I found no response till the checkout also their was a leeks in side the bathroom after all this hotel doesn t worth 5 star 3 is fair, Wifi
