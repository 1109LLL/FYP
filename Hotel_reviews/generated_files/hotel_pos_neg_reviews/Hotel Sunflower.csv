410463,Hotel Sunflower,No Negative, During a booking process I made mistake and booked wrong dates for nonrefundable package wrong month July instead for June This booking was cancelled by hotel with no charges Big thanks to the hotel staff again 
410464,Hotel Sunflower, We had ants in the room Staff offered us cleaning or another room this is okay But anyway ants in the room are not acceptable This is in a 4 stars hotel , In general everything was okay except 
410465,Hotel Sunflower, Very very dirty hotel there are special kind of mosquitos in the room after week our whole family not recoverd with red spots very poor breakfast old hotel shower water very slow dirty washroom broken washrooms big disappointement because was fully paid for three days having no chance to change hotel agter my first night night mare , Nothing like in this hotel its my worst experience of the year
410466,Hotel Sunflower, I killed two cockroaches in the room in two different days The towels had a heavy smell I suppose because of some kind of dissinfectant they use in the laundry The breakfast was very poor and they did not refiiled the empty trays although it was still 09 00 and the breakfast period was till 10 00 ,No Positive
410467,Hotel Sunflower, Room was quite old fashioned would have been great to have a coffee tea maker A shame is the TV with something like 200 channels or more but would say 5 maximum are not in Italian language More international channels would be a must Staff upon arrival was not really welcoming and I needed to find myself some information Not acceptable for a so called 4 stars hotel , Breakfast is great and full of salt sweet stuff I would only criticize the orange juice which is not pure juice but kind of water with flavour Despite situation in a noisy area sleeping was ok Shower worked well with nice smelling toiletries 
410468,Hotel Sunflower, I asked for a room with a bath meaning bath tub I was told that it is a 4star hotel and all the rooms are with a bath It turned out that they meant bath room and not a bath tub They apologised for misunderstanding though It is an OK hotel but since it said 4 stars I had certain expections for the room breakfast and so on If it said 2 or 3 stars from the beginning I would have been less dissapointed ,No Positive
410469,Hotel Sunflower, They refused to put on air conditioning when the room was boiling hot so we had to have the window open with all the traffic noises from outside which disturbed our sleep Their scrambled eggs seemed to be made from powdered eggs they were more like angel delight in texture than your fresh scrambled eggs The rest of the breakfast was poor The staff were quite unhelpful with any questions we had , It was clean and there was a lovely ice cream shop nearby They have good coffee machine at breakfast which you can help yourself too The bar man seemed friendly too 
410470,Hotel Sunflower, The breakfast wasn t the best and although the hotel is next to the tram it is the only quick cheap close way into the city and it takes a while You also can t buy tickets for the tram at the tram itself a bit of a pain, The hotel had a nice old luxury feel to it The rooms were a good size and it had a little balcony The floors were all tiled which was nice The Restaurant next door is also very good 
410471,Hotel Sunflower, The quality of the shower a bit old style , Great position for visting the Politecnico Easy to mov around Milano from Bovisa station Good breakfast Friendly staff 
410472,Hotel Sunflower, I found the position of the hotel uncomfortable to reach the center of Milan and the zone does not seem to be very secure , The room was big and comfly

410474,Hotel Sunflower, Nothing yet, Very nice hotel and comfortable frienldy staff despite a little far from the city centre Ten mins walk to Bovisa nord POLITECHNICO di Milano train station in which you can take the train to get to the Malpensa airport directly Suitable for business traveller 
410475,Hotel Sunflower, The room was basic The area where breakfast was served looked depressing the plates did not look very clean the overall quality and variety of food was limited mainly to sweet cakes The service was typical to rude ,No Positive

410477,Hotel Sunflower, Myself and my wife stayed at this hotel early Nov 16 I booked it on the basis that is was 4 star and its location seemed ok We stayed for two nights and our sleep was disrupted on both nights firstly because we were awoke at 3am but loud voices and laughing from a room a few doors away I appreciate this was not the hotels fault I banged on there door and asked them to be quiet Second nights disruption was due to noise both from above our room and to the sides as the walls seem to be paper thin and any noise from above seems to carry through the floors There was also no tea coffee facilities in the room which i personally would expect in a 4 star hotel The shower area was not in the best hygiene either I am fortunate enough to have travelled all over the world and would go as far to say that a shower cubical in India in a 2 star hotel would have been as clean Breakfast supplied is ok but not great Would I stay here again NO, NOTHING
