209824,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, We were initially put in a lower ground room with no window and found it claustrophobic asked to be moved but the hotel was full that evening but promised a new room the next day and this promised was kept with reception making sure we liked our new room , The staff were very efficient and friendly and solved our queries quickly Great location for the tube station 
209825,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Directions in the hallway could have been a little better The hotel is on a high street with plenty of variety name brand shops M S Boots Sainsbury s Tesco Express Primark however the caliber of the shops is low Higher quality is nearby though around St John s Wood , Staff were extremely helpful I like a firm bed so I slept very well The air conditioning cooled quickly and easy to adjust Shower was reasonable size not the tiny booths that you find in some places Breakfast assortment was pretty good and they would accommodate special requests 
209826,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The rooms are a LOT smaller than I expected We even had one of the superior rooms with a window which is a luxury in this hotel Do not expect to be able to walk around the bed The reception staff were not particularly helpful with leaving luggage In fact they ended up leaving our luggage in the lobby even after asking them specifically to move it to the room Really not happy especially after I walked in to the reception and waited at least 10mins for a member of staff to appear Poor , The decor was great and the location was fantastic For the price point this hotel was ok It s not up to the usual Best Western standards 
209827,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, We were put in a basement room with no windows It was probably one of the worst nights sleep I have ever had If you stay at this hotel do not get a basement room It is horrible , Not that much to be fair
209828,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, My son said that he wished he had spent more time at the hotel which is a good recommendation, Did not have breakfast I booked the hotel for my son who was on a business trip
209829,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Basement room No natural light my wife had to exit the building to check the mornings weather each day noisy due to staff in and out of adjoining door all night Bathroom was functional but very small unable to sit properly on the toilet as it was almost up to the wall the shower was in the bath and you need a step ladder to get in and out The wardrobe rail was about 6 3 high I am 5 5 and my wife is smaller There are steps down into the room when you get through the door the safety deposit box repair man fell down them The staff don t appear to talk to each other as messages about us wanting to change room weren t relayed to the morning staff The receptionist did offer another room if we left out bags in the reception area the next morning before 12noon where she would watch them for us but on questioning this she stated that she would NOT be responsible for them and we did not want to waste the small amount of time we had in London trying to change room Last time we stayed here it was reasonable but not this time The room was very hot despite having air conditioning it only worked on low fan speed and no matter what setting were made it didn t cool very much The corridor to the basement is enclosed by glass and smells awful When we were checking out the receptionist asked what complimentary offers where we given answer none were offered Breakfast was not included and what we paid for the first morning was laughable the coffee was strong and almost cold the selection on offer was very poor We ate elsewhere the next morning , The area was reasonably nice and local to where we needed to be 
209830,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, No hot water in the evening and then electricity outage in our room the following morning No offer of compensation in any shape or form , Large shower and mirrors that did not mist 
209831,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Upon check in I found the staff member to be quite rude very unhelpful and I received a number of blank stares from this particular worker who was slow The other worker checked 3 people in during the time it took for us to be checked in and she was friendly and very informative unlike the girl we had The room was tiny not much room to move around at all but it was very clean and modern and was fine for what we wanted We had paid extra for the breakfast and were at no point told that this was only a cold buffet if you wanted a hot breakfast there was another additional charge for this The wait staff I found to be rude the milk smelt off on the table and I had to ask 3 times to have different milk and I was met with the same blank rude stares I had been given at the check in desk the day before At 145 for one night this was not value for money and was not somewhere I would recommend or return to again I am not picky and I am a firm believer in you get what you pay for but at the cost of this I would of expected much much better , The hotel was very clean and the location was excellent for getting around London 
209832,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Staff were a bit odd when requested breakfast that I had not included in the booking Sink in room was defective, Good in room facilities tea coffee etc Generally friendly atmosphere and very centrally located easy to get around from the hotel 
209833,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Not much I could say really everything was satisfactory, The room was a good size The restaurant downstairs was incredible Very friendly and food was beautiful 
209834,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, nothing if i had to nitpick i would nt want to be hanging about the area after 11 30pm as a lone female traveller but that is not the hotel s fault , The bed was so comfortable and the staff were really friendly and helpful Location is only 3 minutes from Kilburn Park tube and their are 2 pubs and a tesco nearby which is convienient 
209835,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Poorly maintained bathroom plumping Inconvenient placement of TV Non detachable hangers in closet in tight space , Location convenient with transportation Decoration cleanliness 
209836,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Noisy room Some kind of tumble dryer going until 11pm Anytime anyone in the hotel ran a tap you could hear it Informed staff all they did was laugh I wouldn t stay here was his response Avoid this place at all costs,No Positive
209837,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The room was difficult to find and I got lost several times with my heavy case The receptionist should have given better directions The very comprehensive folder in my bedroom stated there were complimentary biscuits but I failed to find any , Staff were very very helpful helped me with my case without my needing to ask for assistance Room was great bed was very comfy 
209838,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Apparently the room next door was very noisy and keep knocking the wall or scratching the wooden pieces on the wall making it very annoying and hard to have a peace of mind in the night and morning Might need to increase sound proof system , The bed was very comfortable and everything in the room was pretty good 
209839,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The air condition unit was broken It was blowing out very cold air The off switch button did not work The room was very small hence there was nowhere to hide from the constant cold blast , Clean 
209840,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Nothing, Absolutely brilliant I was greeted at check in by assistant manager Raveca and Amy whom were both very professional and polite Raveca went the extra mile to make my stay as comfortable as possible Location was excellent I had to attend an event in Knightsbridge and found it was quick and easy to get there Great facilities room was very clean and quiet what more could you ask for Will definitely be going back
209841,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, A room without a window Honestly I felt trapped and I don t think I saw that on the description of the Executive King Room when I booked it I think it should be in there so people can choose The room was freezing cold when we entered and after a while we managed to turn it off but it took a bit until it was back in the normal temperature The bed wasn t king size either I think it was two separate beds joined together , The room was clean and so was the bathroom Fairly spacious The shower was spacious too The location of the hotel is a huge plus Very close to the underground and Paddington train station isn t far either 
209842,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, My bed was under a skylight At 5am something dropped from that skylight and hit me on the face I turned on the light to see what it was and was surprised to see a live maggot on my bed I spent the rest of the night on the sofa I put the maggot in a glass and presented it to reception on leaving and asked whether I might be able to get a refund I was offered an upgrade of my breakfast from Normal to Continental I replied that there was no way in the world I would be eating in the hotel No manager was available to speak to me , Nothing
209843,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Bad value for money thinking of the location size of the rooms the are tiny as cupboard no luggage room all bags are lying in the hallway unattended Very small and basic breakfast variety And main thing for us we had booked King Executive room which was on basement floor underground and with no window , Shops restaurants bus stops all just around the corner
209844,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, On arrival receptionist wasn t full of the joys of spring the transaction seemed more important than the service , Private basement room spacious comfortable and very clean modern
209845,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Told by reception not to bother booking a table in the restaurant and last food orders were 9 30 I was then refused a table at 9 05 as the restaurant closed at 9 00 The waiter said he would try to get the chef to serve me The chef ignored me completely complaining loudly in Polish over my head and giving me a death stare I said to forget it and ate elsewhere Yes you can t have a meal after 9 00 in a 4 star hotel in the middle of london Will never go back, Hotel is conveniently placed for the tube and comfortable 
209846,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The check inn started at exactly 2 o clock so we had to wait quite a while , Nice fresh fruit with breakfast Close to the metro and a great pub across the street The Old Bell 
209847,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The beds are small Also the area can come across as a bit nasty at night , Value for money Expected a lot worse for this price Also all rooms do indeed have windows I booked 7 rooms for a group booking and all had windows which it says it doesn t on the discription In fact this hotel presents better value than most centrally located value options around Hyde park Paddington and other central discount hotel hotspots Breakfast was good for that price 
209848,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Very small room sometimes smelled damp for no apparent reason Bathroom not properly constructed ie heavy basin not fully supported on bench , Clean and tidy
209849,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, There was not enough staff working at this fully booked hotel Rooms were not ready at check in dinner was a wait as only 1 barman server and breakfast was chaos as only two waitresses , Dinner and breakfast was very nice and all the staff there were excellent and working very hard 
209850,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, WINDOWLESS SMALL CLAUSTROPHOBIC ROOM NOISY ROAD PIGEON NOISES ALL NIGHT MOST TELEVISION CHANNELS NOT WORKING I SPECIFICALLY AVOIDED THE ROOM WITHOUT A WINDOW WHEN MAKING THE RESERVATION OPTING FOR AND PAYING FOR AN EXECUTIVE KING ROOM THAT I ASSUMED WOULD HAVE A WINDOW THIS CLEARLY DID NOT HAPPEN, NOTHING IN PARTICULAR
209851,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The bathroom It was a SSS bathroom no proper separate shower toilet sink and shower all in one room There was a constant strange odor in the bathroom that made it unpleasant The room had too much furniture and it was a tight squeeze The couch was right in the walkway entrance to the room so you had to shuffle around it to get to the bed very strange layout , The breakfast nice selection of food The staff friendly helpful location internet
209852,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Room and area, Booked hotel because of its proximity to Wembley Not a particularly good area restaurants nearby ok No window in room and therefore no view and felt like a cave Also smelt mildly of damp Breakfast good
209853,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Hotel catered for Muslim by not supplying bacon it smelt terrible it was dark and the rooms were small, The hotel is run down it s not luxury the rooms are dark and small and the hotel smells damp and fusty the area around the hotel is run down and quite intimidating especially at night the breakfast at the hotel is poor only continental which you didn t state when saying breakfast was included anything more than continental had to be paid for and also the hotel does not supply bacon Being English in England I find this offensive
209854,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, We didn t like the fact that we were not allowed to open the window at all and air conditioning was not working properly Also bathroom was not cleaned properly There was a lot of dust on a dryer Also during our stay the light didn t work so it was pretty much dark most of the time Another thing is the shower door I couldn t open the door from the inside without my partner open it for me from the outside It was stucked It was also very hard to flush the toilet We had to push so hard The security deposit box was broken Overally it was good but fixing these small problems would really make the stay much better , It was a good value for money Breakfast is good and staff is friendly 
209855,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, First floor room was actually in the basement without a window and very poor air quality not what you expect for a superior room, Staff were very helpful
209856,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale,No Negative, I booked a standard room with no window and was pleasantly surprised on arrival to be allocated a room at the front of the hotel with a window Room was small but had everything in it I needed Would be happy to stay here again
209857,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale,No Negative, Very close to underground ABD overground transport Bright cheery reception and bar Room compact but very clean very comfortable bed and great shower Towels werewolf and toiletries very nice Continent breakfast was good Great price Thoroughly recommend stay 
209858,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Booked the room because the deal for a suite with a lot of extras included like fruit soft drinks magazines bathrobe None of it was included and the staff wasn t at all interested in checking why that information was on both their own and booking coms website , The size if the room was good for London But then it was a suite
209859,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Had to get room card re activated and new Wi Fi code every day, The Old Bell across the way is worth a look Good food friendly staff and value for money 
209860,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Only hotel we have stayed in that didn t let us check in till just after 2pm even though there were a lot of guests waiting , Clean and comfortable and near underground
209861,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Breakfast was continental We would have prefered full English instead Thought this was offered for an extra 7 95 each , Close to station modern inside clean friendly 
209862,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Room was tiny Decorators sealant up half the door frames when should ve been around the floor Staff weren t very helpful in check in , Located right near tube station and near local facilities Wi Fi was included Restaurant attached next door was a great price 
209863,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, We had absolutely no hot water and the staff were aware there is none when we checked in but failed to tell us There was still not hot water the following morning and only received 50 refund after a lot of complaining and arguing the minimum expectations of a hotel , The decor was good
209864,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The room was stinking mainly in the shower area it was foisty The room was a bit on the small side , Getting complimentary drinks when arriving We had to haggle a bit to get them though for being a genius member Staff were friendly and it was in a good location Buses were outside to get too and from the main tube station Would definitely stay again and it was good value for money 
209865,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, the only thing I can pick at is the lack of a plug socket near the bedside unit so I had to get my lazy ass out of bed to put my phone on charge , Nice air conditioned room comfatable bed and really good shower What more do you need 
209866,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, How small the room was, The room was great value but very small The lights was hard to find and there was a fan that I was unable to turn off so was very load throughout the night We had booked 2 rooms and the other room was prefect I had phoned earlier and asked for a window and that was given to me which was fantastic
209867,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, We found that the wet room leaked water onto the bedroom carpet which left an unpleasant lingering smell , Quick and easy check in Nice choice of breakfast and reasonably priced 
209868,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Selection of vegetarian options on food menu However plenty of restaurants and shops nearby to eat out at e g Spicy Basil Pizza express , Beds are comfy
209869,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale,No Negative, Excellent location A train tube station is 8 minute walking distance from the hotel Very good continental breakfast A supermarket is right across from the hotel as well as ATM and bus stops that take you directly to downtown London The bedrooms are very clean and spacious compared to most London hotel standards Definitely recommend this hotel 
209870,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, I booked as a genius member and one of the perks was welcome drinks Staff were rude and said that because they have a lot of genius members they don t do them I d also emailed to give a heads up we were celebrating a 50th birthday and got no reply In the end we got welcome drinks and the manager was great gifting us a bottle of champagne The reception staff however were unhelpful and rude and I had a few run ins with them during my stay , Lovely modern hotel in a nice location 
209871,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The room was small and was supposed to have a city view we were very disappointed our view was of the back yard were the dustbins are kept we could not open the window because of the flys Not a power shower like it stated, 2 welcome beers on arrival comfy large bed and tea coffee in room Good Location for Wembley concert
209872,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The continental breakfast lacked choice but having it included as such a low price for London was a bonus , For the price this an excellent hotel super easy to get to from Paddington and the room was perfect for a one night stay 
209873,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The room space was small and did not present big enough for two people The air con took ages to become cool which was horrible considering we had opted in having a bedroom with no window there was a window but it couldn t open , The hotel staff and kitchen staff were polite and friendly from arrival to departure 
209874,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, King size bed was very close to wall at one side making it very tight difficult to get in out of bed Thankfully I m reasonably slim or this would ve been a problem ,No Positive
209875,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, My modern room was beautifully appointed and super clean I couldn t fault it But as I was in residence for a week it would have been good not to have been in a basement room with no natural daylight The bonus however was that it was quiet , Close to tube and busses and an array of local shops Good relaxing coffee bar area Modernised interior Friendly helpful reception staff 
209876,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, I booked king size room but the room was ridiculously small Not sure it even reached required standards as not enough room to walk around the bed less than 8 10 inches between end of bed and wall Too expensive for what it was Very disappointing If staying here go for cheapest room possible having stayed in standard room before the room I had then was bigger than the king size and much cheaper Unable to check in early, Bed comfortable
209877,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The rooms are placed like a maze You go up then down on stairs and no elevator down so you carry your luggage The toilet seat too close to the towel rail heated rail that you can burn yourself Sink in the bathroom fit in a very narrow way that there is no place to rest the soap Phone was not working on Saturday afternoon reception told me no maintenance to replace your phone Checked out on Monday and still phone not working so you can imagine I had to keep going through the maze back and forth to order food Staff is nice but definitely management is absent ,No Positive
209878,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Breakfast not a patch on how it used to be Waited 20 mins for coissant and when it came was far to hot and still not cooked , Staff friendly great location for my work
209879,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, I was happy with everything, The bed was really comfortable and the shower was amazing and it s close to a lot of buses that go in all directions plus there is a Tesco and Starbucks straight across the road
209880,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Room was very very small Didn t feel like a hotel room felt like a storage room When I heard a very loud and strange noise was told there were no staff to help out Thank God the noise stopped or else I would ve ended up awake all night , Friendly staff decent location
209881,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale,No Negative, Staffs were friendly Breakfast was good quality Rate was reasonable The AC was great Room were a little smaller than we envisioned Easy access to local buses and Killburn Park station to town Take bus no 16 to Victoria Station in 25 mins Next door to laundromat was very convenient Grocery store across the street and local restaurants nearby I strongly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting London 
209882,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Breakfast used very cheap ingredients unimpressed Had a basement room which was quite small and when air conditioner was on as there was no window there was an awful stench Sat in the bar as the room was too hot without putting on the awful aircon but they kicked us out before 11pm , Nice look to the place Friendly staff and good location 
209883,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The room without window and a little bit small and the small of humidity , The hotel is near the subway the room and the bathroom were clean and the breakfast was good 
209884,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, In the bathroom the loo seats would not stay up A minor but irritating detail , The hotel was conveniently place for us and the staff were helpful and efficient at all times
209885,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Unbelievably bad experience We did not receive a complimentary genius drink upon arrival During booking at check in and on the last night of our stay we requested a late checkout and were assured it was possible On the day of checkout at the agreed upon time we returned to the hotel to find the hotel staff had finished packing our bags and removed them from our room claiming the night shift failed to relay the message I have never been more angry at a hotel I could understand if they disregarded a single request but I made the same request on 3 separate occasions and this is inexcusable So while the accommodations may have been acceptable I wouldn t keep any of the front office staff under my employ and I can t recommend this hotel in good conscience ,No Positive
209886,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, the room was small for my luggage but i heard some noise voice its was horrible its comes from toliet and i called the reception she came to my room after 20 minutes after when the voice gone she said to me if happened agin am gonna change your room , The quality of the the room and also the hotel the stuff there were helpful
209887,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The receptionist was rude on arrival The housekeeper walked into my room without knocking When I complained the receptionist put the phone in my face I was offered a complimentary meal The chef obviously didn t understand the meaning of rare steak AND DID NOT CHECK THE SALAD AS THERE WAS BLUE PAPER IN IT The best thing in the hotel was the waitress very professional , The bed was comfy
209888,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, I was not aware that we had booked a room with no window Perhaps I missed this during the booking process I didn t follow up on this with the staff as were staying for only one night Although the room was in the basement with no window there was some noise from the street during the night anyway , The hotel is easy to find and located close to the tube station The room and bathroom were newly renowated and clean Friendly staff at check in 
209889,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, A lot of the rooms have now windows and are smelling really damp This Hotel is a joke how can a 4 hotel be allowed to sell prison cells No mention of that on Booking Stay away from this Hotel , Hotel looks nice from the outside
209890,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Fired eggs were a bit greasy and bacon was more the american rasher type thin oily and not great so a bit of a disappointing cooked breakfast I would have expected better in the UK from an actual cafe I knew room I d chosen was basement with no window so not bothered too much apart from alarm clock was an hour behind and fire alarm went off due to apparently from someone taking a shower So was rudely awakened and a bit of a maze and worry getting out since no window in room but got free breakfast , Adjoined to next door Italian cafe for breakfast so coffee was great 
209891,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale,No Negative, Location close to tube with easy access to central London 45 minutes to LHR via Paddington Express Lots of casual neighbourhood cafes bars and restaurants close by 
209892,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Very small room noisy as right next to a main road with no double glazing shop around and only buy if it s less than 70, Good location clean room
209893,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Slightly noisy as there s a busy street outside but wasn t bad as you expect this because of its great location so it didn t really matter, With breakfast included in the booking deal I sound the Pain au chocolats were amazing and late check out was convenient They were also kind enough to keep hold of our luggage on the day of check out so we could spend the day and pick it up before we set off from home
209894,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Room was small poorly designed and pretty much every fixture and fitting was broken Chipped sink TV hanging off the wall window didn t work window fittings held in by old tape shower made a horrendous noise when turned on Very poor , Location and comfy bed
209895,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, I have stayed in executive suite and it wasn t what I have seen on photos Shower was not separated from the rest of the bathroom so I could sit on the toilet whilst showering Also once you take the shower you cannot enter the bathroom because the floor is covered in water so you either have to mop the floor after you shower or have constantly wet feet I have asked for a different room but apparently they were fully booked and I was offered a smelly room without a window in a basement , Comfortable bed and clean
209896,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The room was slightly cosy but ok for the price , Breakfast was lovely and the staff were so friendly and went out of their way to help They made the visit and would recommend as a result 
209897,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, There were no windows and the A C was not working We complained to the front desk several times and they gave us a little fan which did not work either the first time around Second time it did but it was so tiny that it barley made a difference We were sweating all night and could not rest The front desk staff had an attitude that we were being too picky or doing something wrong We were not happy ,No Positive
209898,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The address on this hotel stated Camden when infact it was no where near Camden and for someone not familiar with London this was very disappointing It should not have Camden in the address when it is not as it gives people a false impression ,No Positive
209899,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Air con was broke so the room was like a sauna Bleach stains on carpet bed was incredibly uncomfortable Staff didn t seem bothered when we aired our concerns about the air con, Location was pretty good for what we wanted Near to tube station and shops
209900,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, It wa a great I could leave my bags before and after check in but I was disappointed they were left in the lobby for anyone to pick up , Staff were very helpful and friendly Nice breakfast and close to tube 
209901,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The fact that we could here all the noises from the next door room the top room as well and especially the wooden floor under the carpet often at times their was a very loud noise from the pipes we were in room 216 and it was very uncomfortable to sleep , The bed and the decoration
209902,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Not at all, Wonderful people in the whole staff A particular mention to the restaurant for its food very well made and for the fantastic balance between quality and price The staff is perfect in the restaurant too 
209903,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The room was boiling hot windows did not open had a view of a chimney the staff were ignorant and I think the floor may have been more comfortable than that solid mattress There was mould all around the sink in the bathroom Should have gone to the travelodge ,No Positive
209904,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The bedroom and entire floor we were on had a distinct and overpowering smell of marijuana the television in the room was broken we were in the basement of the hotel so every time someone else on another floor used the toilet or shower we could here the pipes, Location very good for the underground
209905,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The size of the room was far to small found it hard to move about and was a struggle to get up out the side of the bed room got very hot quickly shame there was no outside view from the window over all a lovely stay staff were most helpful although my only criticism is that they wouldn t give out taxi numbers would ring them for you guessing as this is there way of getting commission,No Positive
209906,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Fire alarm went off 3 times in the morning which ruined any chance off a lie in Called reception and was told someone in the hotel was smoking so caused the alarm to go off No apology from reception Room was tiny but that s expected in London I guess Bed was very uncomfortable lack of pillows Air conditioning didn t work properly , Accessibility good access to all areas in London
209907,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The parking was a nightmare was told that there was local parking which was open all hours however the car park was closed on arrival and was far from the hotel so therefore had to park down a side road which took ages , The hotel was lovely and clean
209908,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Very poor hotel Cramped room unable to see through window as the bed was in the way Dated furniture and dirty marks on the walls Very disappointed as it was a treat for my husband s birthday Not worth the money Been in better hotels for cheaper ,No Positive
209909,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The room was extremely small with the bed having approx one foot of space between it and the window and one and half feet between the foot of the bed and the wall making access extremely difficult The interior window was stuck on with masking tape The pillows were hard The noise from the water pipes was very loud and was intermittent throughout the night as people used their bathrooms nearby , Continental breakfast was good
209910,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale,No Negative, Staff very helpful and friendly Comfy beds Perfect for what we needed If we were staying longer would have booked a room with a window but for 1 night it did not mater Breakfast was good too 
209911,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Was slightly noisy the hotel rooms could hear people quite a lot but only that problem the rest was amazing great room and great staff , I loved the room 
209912,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The window was broken and cellotaped back together and the bed took up pretty much the whole room saw some of the other rooms in the morning and they were loads bigger was not impressed , The bed was huge and comfortable
209913,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The room smelt weird it was pretty small room a random alarm went off in the middle of the night which flashed red and blue no windows so no view and it was really warm even with air con on Was extremely disappointed with my stay , Efficient in delivering an iron
209914,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The space around the bed was a bit tight , Very nice hotel with very friendly and helpful staff Excellent breakfast Easy to get to from Kilburn park metro station 
209915,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The walls were really thin in the room Could hear everything in the next room really early , Staff at reception friendly and helpful Nice large room with big bathroom plenty of space No windows but knew this already when we pre booked as we were in the basement room Good location with a bus stop opposite and Kilburn tube round the corner 
209916,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, When we were using warm water then watersystem made very loud noise It wasnt very comfortable for us because the noise was veryvery loud , Nice clean comfortable place Staff was very nice and helpful

209918,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The bathroom in general was a bit grubby toilet seat loose with red stains on it Shower if you were not careful soaked the whole room Had to use towels to mop up floor Fridge light didn t work The worst thing was being woken at 4 a m after a lovely evening out the purpose of our trip to red flashing lights in our room and the fire alarm It frightened the life out of us I rang reception to ask if their was a fire to be told it was a guest having a very hot shower After this we couldn t sleep , The bed was comfortable 
209919,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, I went with my girlfriend for what was supposed to be a relaxing night for her birthday however we were woken by the fire alarm at 4 am and again ten minutes later This was followed by the smell of weed wafting through our bathroom air vents Not ideal , Comfy bed and lovey shower 
209920,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The room was so cramped that there was no space between the bed end and the wall to be able to close the window blind An executive king room I do not think so The awful red marble in the bathrooms was like an autopsy had been carried out The blinds at the window once I had crawled across the bed to close them were filthy The room smelt musty There was no mirror in the room to dry one s hair by I had to guess what I looked like It was basically rubbish and I didn t want to stay for breakfast The reception staff had no idea of the local area and told me the road I was looking for was 11 minutes away It was across the road visible from the reception desk ,No Positive
209921,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, We have stayed before at the property as the location is good However this time we were met at the reception desk by a very robotic receptionist whose English was not her first language No warmth or greeting just a list of the facilities including the fact that I had already been pre charged for the stay Usually I am asked whether I would like to pay immediately or after the stay I asked whether we could have a complimentary drink as is usual at the said hotel for Genius bookers A heated consultation with the other three receptionists ensued before we were told that this was not an option unless we joined the Best Western Hotel users club then we could have a complimentary drink By this time we were feeling annoyed and irritated by the receptionists attitude and lack of interpersonal skills so we just went to our rooms , We have stayed before at the property as the location is good 
209922,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Pictures didn t match the room we actually were put in fire alarm tests at 6 30am on a Sunday weren t exactly how I planned to wake up you could smell the drainage after using the shower or toilet in the bathroom overall was poor considering I took my girlfriend there as her first trip to london, The staff were really friendly and welcoming

209928,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, When I went to check out there was a fire alarm malfunction which knocked out the computers The sole girl on reception did not have the password for the system No response to her phone calls for help Fortunately another staff member came in to work and helped This was 8 15 so there should have been more than one receptionist available for checking out I had to ask them to call me a taxi on their account as I was now going to be late for my meeting which I had planned to walk to When the taxi came he asked me whether I liked the hotel When I told him of my experience he told me that this happened frequently there and he often picked up unhappy guests who had requested a transfer Plus my shower was lukewarm there was no loo brush in the bathroom and the coffee was lukewarm too A very poor experience very disappointing , Convenient location

209932,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, On opening the door to our room we were greeted with an overpowering smell of damp mouldy stench We opened the window to try and reduce this As the hotel is on a main London street the traffic outside was relentless and after half an hour sitting with the window open and the constant noise we realised that the stench was not going to go We went down to reception to ask if we could be moved to another room and were told that all rooms were fully booked but front of house would try to resolve something for us We went back to the room and sat in our coats with the windows open for another hour waiting to hear from reception but heard noting We thought we would have a hot drink whilst waiting this is when we discovered that one cup was clean and one cup has sugary residue in the bottom obviously it had been used and put back then had not been washed by house keeping staff when preparing the room Time to turn the kettle on this is when I turned on the socket to the kettle and my arm very slightly brushed the bedside wall light this was extremely loose and swung upside down obviously the cleaning staff must have known about this why wasn t if fixed before a customer had been put into that room I phoned reception to ask what they were actually doing and did not receive any productive input in fact they gave the feeling they had forgotten about us I had to suggest that if we could not be moved could someone at least come to the room with air fresheners and try to ascertain where the smell was coming from as up to then we had made one visit to reception two phone calls and yet not one member of staff had bothered to even view the problems with the room Eventually a member of staff turned up with one timed battery air freshener and a can of spray air freshener They agreed the room smell was putrid and overpowering and she was also shown the very loose bedside lamp , Bar and restaurant staff were friendly welcoming and professional Food in the restaurant was very well prepared and cooked beautifully

209938,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Will be making a complaint water came through the bathroom light the solution was to wipe it up with tissue and because it stopped dripping that was the leak fixed As a gas engineer i was shocked at the lack of investigation to find the source the panel above the bathroom didnt get moved to see where it was coming from Both staffs english very poor and didnt understand what i was saying I over heard ot happened the previous day and also the room next door had the same problem so obviously lack of experience in this field to fix basic plumbing Also had a funny smell in the hall and bedroom , Nothing to like

209950,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Breakfast included in the rates but poor in variety Pillows and bed not properly comfortable , The best reason you should choose this hotel is the great position bus available in front of the hotel and metro stop at less than 2 mins by walk to reach the center in less than 20 mins Room dimensions could be sufficient Staff is really kind and available to provide any help Good quality price ratio

209965,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, My son had brought his Ps4 thinking we could play it through room Tv but no as they have the Tv s restricted in settings maybe silly to most people but trying to keep a 9 year old amused in a small room would of been a lot easier if the Tv settings where like any other hotel, Staff and hotel itself was great would recommend

209977,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The air con was tricky to get right but managed it eventually Our room 127 had no windows and was internal to the hotel which might seem to be a bit claustrophobic to some people hence the need to get the A c right , Stayed here for one night as we had to attend a birthday party nearby Very comfortable rooms and beds All modernised and well laid out Very helpful staff with things like booking taxis and extra amenities for the rooms Great value coffee house next door with cake and coffee for two for 8 
209978,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Unfortunetly the aircon combined with the noise from outside kept us awake most of the night providing a bad night sleep Maybe a good solution would be to double glase the windows Thank you, The staff was lovely specially the breakfast ladies that unfortunetly we didn t get their name But thanks to every one 
209979,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Rooms a bit small Not sure why the mirror in bathroom is tinted as it makes it difficult to use, The bed was very big and comfy good size TV and nice clean room
209980,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The bed that was supposed to be kingside was infact two single beds pushed together Also the room was very small so you couldn t move around much without tripping over things We picked the excecuative room so thought we d have more space but didn t Also the shower was leaking in the bathroom so water kept going everywhere Breakfast was also misleading although it states continental breakfast in with the price for 10 it s actually cheaper not to pre buy breakfast and have a full English for around 5 7 pounds which they don t tell you The cleaning staff seemed a little abrupt with people which was disappointing and the waitresses at breakfast time , The reception staff were lovely and friendly 
209981,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Firstly hotel is trying to manipulate the room spec They offer standard room w o window as a cheapest option but even if you choose Executive room with king size bed you will learn that it can be blind room so small that you cannot fully open doors to bathroom cause they are blocked by the bed room 124 for example Extra 50 night is fee for king size bed as I learned from receptionist ROTFL As it occurred there are executive and executive rooms The true executive rooms are with window fridge and decent in size The other executive rooms have no window no fridge and are so small you cannot even enter bathroom No clue in what way they are assigned to guests Secondly heating in the rooms is not working and requires strong argue to make it operating After several trials central A C started to operate however due to broken temperature sensors it was switching on and off constantly with no possibility to heat the room decently Thirdly there was no possibility to take shower without flooding all bathroom as doors to the shower didn t close Fourthly rooms were generally dirty Windows in rooms could be opened as they are nailed to the wall room 115 and I suppose they were cleaned last time when Queen Victoria was ruling the UK In bathrooms you can find variety of life forms between tiles on walls and floor inside the sink in the shower Hotel offers black cups for do it yourself tea would be nice if they are washed when doing rooms In each of rooms we were the cups were dirty after the night before guests We washed them but let s not play the game it was an ugh experience Finally the card I used for booking com reservation has been charged for the stay without my acceptance On checkout it occurred payment was already done by night watch to speed up checkout , Localisation 5 minutes walk from subway station Decent breakfast 
209982,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The area around the hotel is weird but it seems to be safe anyway as we have nor had any problems, Breakfast really good near the tube station comfortable bed

209984,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Size and cleanliness of Room General state of Repair Cooked breakfast awful , Room Executive King Room 129 was cramped Walls dirty Toilet Roll Holder coming away from wall and what we thought was a bit of cake left behind by previous occupants because it was dry and exposed to elements was actually a complimentary cake The bed was comfortable enough I paid 5 extra for a full English Breakfast which turned out to be Turkey Rashers with a chicken sausage and beans which were sour because they had gone off Serving staff were nice and very apologetic though All in all a poor experience We won t be returning to that Hotel and since it was our first experience at a Best Western Hotel we are a bit dubious about trying another one 
209985,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The cold room with cold air conditioning and when we called a member of staff to help the instructions were not clear regarding how to work it The staff member should have physically helped us with the air conditioning instead of giving my partner unclear instructions , The location was close to the station The pastries were nice
209986,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Road noise unbearable Room was so small you could manoeuvre around the bed The reception staff asked me for photo ID and wanted a copy of it I refused They also wanted me to give them my credit card and take a 50 pound deposit from which if I did not use would be returned to me in a few days I refused No hot water in shower The lift was out of order Very disappointed with this booking , Close to tube
209987,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Some top sheets on the bed were still stained The bathroom had a lot of dust around the skirting boards We tried to check in at 1pm but had to wait until 2pm I know that 2pm is a standard check in time but I have never had to wait at another hotel they usually accommodate I left bags with the reception and they were left in the main walkway that anyone would have access to The bar did not have coke or lemonade as the pump was broke there were no provisions in place for this like just buying some bottles , Location was convienent for where we were visiting
209988,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale,No Negative, The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable The hotel was overall very good all round No problems at all would definitely stay here again 
209989,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The room was teeny tiny though I appreciate the price but for two we couldn t even open the door to the room without a struggle and both the tap and shower made a horric screeching sound when in use , The bed was super comfy and most of the staff were helpful polite and friendly Breakfast was also better than expected Clean rooms and modern twist with electronic notification board for room service etc that displasy outside the room 
209990,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, My room had a nasty odour especially the bathroom I did report it but my room was not deep cleaned as the odour was still there on my second night, Location Quiet facilities
209991,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Staff tried to force us to move to Ealing Booked a Double Room received a Twin Blood over the curtains Couldn t even get by to other bed without climbing over one as beds were full breadth of room Rooms dirty, Location was ok although was in Kilburn Road rather than Maida Vale
209992,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, After paying extra for an executive king room the lady in reception tried to give us a room in the basement with no window After returning to reception and arguing and told that there are no more rooms available we eventually were given the room we had booked With a window The shower was freezing in the morning and night at midday tho you could get a hot shower tho The staff in the restaurant were unhelpful and the continental breakfast was poor , Very clean facilities good location close to train and tube

209996,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Two complaints didn t like having to constantly re enter the wifi codes which changed daily Also the room would sometimes get a little hot and stuffy but the windows are bolted closed But these were small problems , Was really pleased overall and highly recommend this hotel Love the neighborhood the local pubs the cafe on the ground floor the Tesco across the street And was reasonably priced and still relatively central 
209997,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The check in system was down when we first arrived there was no back up so there was about 20 people waiting no comfort or refreshments provided until one of the other guests kicked up To make matters worse the girl behind the desk was rude passive aggressive and had little sympathy The man who looked like he was ment to be in charge just flapped through the whole situation and in the end we ended up being late for our appointment , Free breakfast was a great addition room was lovely and clean Great location
209998,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, On a prior occasion there was no hot water at the hotel Promised a call back from the manager which I didn t get On my last visit there was another maintenance issue that caused a broken nights sleep The manager ignored me when I brought it up on check out walked off and let his staff take the flack , All Restaurant and some Front of house staff are great Food is good too

210002,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The given room was more like a renovated storage room It was a corner room with a weird layout and we needed to walk two steps up from the corridor Room Bed Two beds are placed one feet apart from each other with one bed located just a feet away from the window Because of the jogged wall at the end of the bed that one feet from the window is blocked by the bed With that few steps up going to the room and the duct for air conditioning the ceiling is very low We do not feel comfortable A sofa bed is placed three feet in front of the closet We do not understand the purpose of it we did not request for a sofa bed given that the room is already very cozy That is why we felt like it is a storage room more than anything Area Safety A random fake tourist asked for direction and two fake policemen came to ask for our passport just a block away from the hotel We said No and walked away We have heard this kind of scam for tourists at other countries before We also heard frequent police sirens around the area after eight We just feel unsafe We thought that we were in some bad areas in NYC or Chicago Breakfast The waitress did not replace the tea cup plate and spoon after use and she wiped them with the cloth which was just used to clean the table We were eye rolling , Location One block away from Kilburn Park station and Paddington is just a few stations away

210082,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Everything the room was at the end of a very long corridor At dressing table was a TV and not mirror I have long hair and wanted to style it The long wall mirror had no plug socket near so when I asked what can you do about this the member of staff shrugged her shoulders Then decided to find me another room which had been occupied and didn t smell sweet Finally got hold of an extension lead At breakfast I ordered porridge which they forgot and I had to remind them when I was finally served it it was like concrete , Location
210083,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, i was very disappointed with the location as booking com recommend this when searching for camden locks hotels and it takes ages to get there on the tube or bus there are much better locations which are geographically further away but take 5 mins on the tube , the hotel itself was fine in every way
210084,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Since had to leave at 6AM we requested to have breakfast before then we had pre paid for it The staff responded that breakfast started at 7AM quite late for this type of hotel and that no one could cook breakfast at 6AM We then asked if we could just have some milk and 2 croissants no cooked breakfast as we had many times in other hotels when leaving early The answer was negative again Please note that we made our request when we checked in so they could have made arrangements for the following day , The location
210085,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, There was no one on reception and we had to wait once we alerted the bar staff that we had been standing aroundo Customers personal details were left out on the reception desk for all to see including full card numbers breaching Dat a Privacy and PCI requirements The more expensive room Executive compared to the the standard twin was really tight and difficult to move around the bed Left message for manager to call me still haven t heard from him Altogether a very disappointing stay , The bed was comfortable The bathroom was nice but the shower was making a very loud noise which did not make the experience pleasant Especially when you are trying to sleep and you can hear the shower in the next room
210086,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Room 319 a terrible noise of plumbing noises through the night and day a screeching noise it kept my husband awake i had ear plugs for night but the day time no so it made our stay not so enjoyble another customer complaining of the same noise as we and she was checking out the following day no reduction in cost of the room offered because of terrible noise because of this it would prevent us booking at this hotel again shame because even though i did not like the location the staff very welcoming, The bed very comfy
210087,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Basement bedroom therefore no window air con worked well but hard to sleep with it on I didn t know I was going to be in the basement if I had I wouldn t have booked the room quite claustrophobic Last guest s dirty towels were in the wardrobe Last guest s hairs were in the bath Fire alarm went off early morning Toilet flush was very stiff needed to push it loads of times before it flushed, Friendly welcome
210088,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Everything Rude unhelpful ignorant staff including the incompetent owner Food order took over an hour for nachos and a salad Coffee s etc never arrived despite continually asking Staff walk in without knocking or stating first and the place stinks of a filthy pond whuchbthey have tried to cover up with air fresheners Disgusting filthy place Bath doesnt drain Toilet seat isnt secured on Toilet doesnt flush Shocking The list is endless outside its like being in the ghetto Hooded gangs congregated everywhere , Nothing It needs demolishing 
210089,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Room was very nice but in the restaurant I ordered an 8oz medium rare steak that can only be described as more like 3oz flat chewy cheap bit of meat and on several occasions asked for ketchup and never received it tells you everything you need to know about the staff at the attached restaurant who would rather chat amongst themselves or one of their mates who was sat at the bar wouldn t recommend eating there to anyone,No Positive
210090,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The room was tiny hardly any room for my partner and myself to move at all The walls in the room were very marked and scruffy looking Very very loud noises coming from the pipes to the extent it kept me awake at night We were supposed to get a free drink on arrival and we didn t receive one we were supposed to have early check in and didn t receive it either , The staff were lovely and very happy to help The lobby was very nice and looks very posh 
210091,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The restaurant in the hotel The food was clearly not made fresh and it was definitely microwaved as the spaghetti was cold stuck together and tasteless , Location and helpful staff at reception when I needed an iron and ironing board brought to my room 
210092,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, No bowls available at breakfast Waitress told my younger cousin that this was basically tough It wasn t until I complained and asked to speak to a manager that we were actually given a bowl How did they expect us to eat cereal Room was far too hot and the air conditioning was poor We were close to stairs down to the basement and were woken any time somebody walked up or down them Nobody at reception asked us how our stay had been at check out I m guessing this was because they already knew our answer , The room was well presented Close location to tube although I would say this is more Kilburn Park than Maida Vaile so was a little disappointed when we arrived 
210093,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale,No Negative, Very nicely appointed hotel good breakfast Fantastic concierge Nuria who was so helpful and conscientious The location is superb for commuting all over London We will be mak
210094,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, We had room 3 in the basement so no natural light noisy with the fan stuffy but very quiet without it ok for our one night stay A bit pricey but then that s London , Two very nice reception staff 
210095,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Unfortunately the one thing that stands out for us is when my wife fell on the staircase on the first floor There is an unexpected step right on the landing as you move along the first floor landing I am describing this in detail in case it might help others to avoid the problem My wife fell quite badly injuring wrists knee and ankle Fortunately she could still walk though with difficulty I think the unexpected step on the first floor landing should be sorted out in some way signeage or putting in a sloping gradient but what was very disappointing is that when this was all reported to reception there was no action no information no sympathy or concern Nothing was recorded at the hotel Even just some information about nearby medical facilities would have been some help As a result we spent the morning searching for medical assistance eventually ending up getting a bus to an urgent care centre in White City There my wife had x rays and very good treatment Unfortunately this has coloured our view of the hotel measures should be taken to warn people about the step and those on reception should be trained to respond properly to accidents , This is a good Best Western hotel when you consider the problems of running a hotel in a fairly old London building Breakfast was very good with a wide choice of fruit cereals and hot buffet The rates which include breakfast are fairly good value compared with the rather steep breakfast charge if paid on the day The staff were excellent overall very friendly and helpful particularly in the breakfast dining room Generally fairly good and good value considering London hotel prices

210097,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Room very warm and it was unclear how to control the temperature Perhaps info should be included in the info folder Also would have welcomed 2 pillows each rather than just one , The staff were very keen to please

210099,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Didn t like the fact that the room did not have a window corridor access made it difficult to find the room There was a loud noise maybe the pipes when guests in rooms close by took a shower early morning , Lovely staff hotel very clean good location for underground access 
210100,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Room 213 The door to the room didn t open as it hit the bed Toilet was dirty Pigeons nesting on the window ledge which was covered in bird poo and very noisy Noise from pipes in room as other people showed in other rooms was unbearable When I phoned to ask to move room due to the noise of the pipes reception told me it was likely due to people taking showers and then hung up on me I heard other guests complaining about their rooms to management at breakfast , Nothing awful hotel
210101,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, On your confirmation email and on booking com it states you are in Camden but hotel is actually situated in Kilburn Park , Staff were very friendly Beds were comfortable
210102,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Internal room beautiful room spotless bed was so comfortable and shower was so powerful air con was much needed but the whole idea of a room so far into a building with no natural light is just awful for me never again I know we got a good deal for prices in London but not worth it to feel so claustrophobic so I would go back but never to an internal room , There was a great choice of food in the Continental breakfast mini smoked salmon quiche were especially nice breakfast and bar staff were just lovely 
210103,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, No appropriate points for hair dryers and no mirrors within easy distance of the plugs A little bottle of water would be a nice gesture for on arrival The throws and cushions on the beds a little off putting as they re nylon type material I didn t want to rest my head on them as they looked like they d seen better days I m afraid I was kept awake in room 204 hearing noisy pipes in the night and When turning the fan extractor off in the bathroom I d made ongoing noise for such a long time , I had a 2 night stay Room 204 night 1 Room 207 2 nd night This room nice and quiet and off the main thoroughfare Great shower Comfortable bed Lovely eating area and sofas on the ground floor Receptionists first class 
210104,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The breakfast was thoroughly disappointing considering the price spent also the air conditioning was broken which at humidity of the period I was staying was a NIGHTMARE For the same price I could have gotten a room in St Pancras with better facilities and breakfast , The bed was extremely comfortable and that went above and beyond to answer any question or help in anyway they could

210135,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Area is not the nicest Was put in a basement room which was small had a funny smell and no window It was next to the staff room where noise was heard till early hours and started again early morning Staff were apologetic but when you need a nights sleep and there is continuous noise by staff in a stuffy room then the apology isn t really beneficial , This is not a four star hotel

210138,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, our toilet wouldn t flush but we didn t bother telling them because we were only there for two nights and out partying all day and night until the early hours our room was in the basement with no windows but instead of a window one of the walls was just a giant mirror with curtains at the sides which was good for getting ready in but when we woke up the morning it was so pitch black that I couldn t even see my hand in front of my face which lead to me tripping over a few things trying to find the light switch , the decor and the fact they had a fridge in the room was good and the way the room was decorated made it feel like a much more expensive hotel the bar behind reception was nice and the staff were always polite friendly and willing to help 
210139,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The fact that their key card machine didn t work and wasn t mend within the 48 hrs we were there so we had to wait for someone to open our bedroom door everytime we wanted to get in staff was friendly enough and always ready but for us it was precious time wasted , Breakfast was good with plenty to choose The bed was very comfortable but what I appreciated the most was the possibility to sleep with a window open in many Hotels it isn t an option the location was quiet and safe enough The Hotel is very close to the overground 
210140,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, WiFi not working in the room only outside of the room no TV Signal for hours for security reasons window could not be openend should be mentioned on website as some people like to open window while sleeping at least a little bit reception staff just said we are sorry ,No Positive

210176,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The room was only just slightly bigger than the double bed so no room to move at all Worst of all though the plug socket was broken and I got electrocuted while I was trying to plug in phone charger When I complained to reception they said absolutely nothing and the manager wasn t around to speak to I have been waiting almost a week now for them to call me as every time I call them the manager is not available They are lucky it wasn t a child or someone with existing health problems who touch plug socket or this could have been a lot more serious , Good location next to train station and good decor 
210177,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, I got bitten on my legs pretty badly which I m sure was from the bed Which is a shame as the hotel was really nice This wouldn t be off staying again just in a different room , Bedroom was very small but perfectly appointed Shower pressure was excellent and plenty of hot water Reception staff were very friendly 
210178,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Asked for ID passport driving licence etc Has never happened to me before in a UK hotel Britain abandoned the national identity card scheme many years ago and there is no obligation for a British citizen to carry ID and I don t usually carry my passport with me If it is hotel policy that you have to provide ID then this should be stated on your booking pages Incidentally the Best Western in Bournemouth never asked so I am somewhat dubious this is the case , Highest concentration of plug sockets and light switches I have ever encountered in a hotel room 3 double sockets in the desk area alone Inadvertently switched the heated towel rail on but never managed to find the switch that did it to turn it off Despite the baffling array of switches very comfy and good value for central London Staff friendly

210180,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, My room 113 was exceptionally small So small my shins hit the end of the wooden bed frame when I walked in the room I would go so far as to say they have squished a double bed into a box room No space at all to manoeuvre around the room and that was with one side of the bed shoved up against the wall Also no mirror in the bedroom there was a huge mirror in the bathroom but not much use when wanting to dry my hair of check I was presentable There was a small window that doesn t open outside of which was clearly home to the pigeons Rudely awoken by the cooing at 5am wasn t great, The reception staff were helpful and friendly Check in was smooth Service with a smile Bar dining area was pleasant with a small but varied menu the food was very good Breakfast complimentary continental there was enough choice to start the day and for those with a bigger appetite you can order a cooked breakfast from the menu at a reasonable price 3 minute walk from Kilburn station
210181,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The staff were extremely poor Firstly the gentlemen behind the desk said we can pay on checkout as we bothwere paying cash next minute he had taken out of my card i booked with which left me overdrawn and charged Awful Secondly for breakfast the lady serving us got our breakfast wrong THREE times I am still shocked we paid for it ,No Positive
210182,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Despite the bed being a very comfortable king size the room was too small for such a large bed There was barely enough room to squeeze around the bed to the other side There was so little space left that there was really nowhere to put luggage , Staff were extremely friendly The bed was comfortable but there was a down side to this see what I didn t like A good size bathroom with a large shower Very handy to Kilburn tube station on the Bakerloo line 
210183,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The rooms were wayyyy too small There was no porter to help us with our 6 suitcases The restaurant was refurbishing when we arrived so only breakfast was available Our initial room was down in a cold basement and virtually impossible to locate Thanks to Martina she was able to change our rooms , Martina one of the receptionists was very accommodating Especially when we wanted to leave the hotel due to its very small rooms She calmed us down and her customer service was excellent 
210184,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, Don t book a taxi at the check in desk reasons waited nearly 45 mins for taxi to arrive the taxi firm they are using is 50 more expensive than a London Black Cab , Friendly staff 
210185,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, the noise during the morning due to cleaning fire doors room doors closing inappropriate time of maintenace and ppl speaking lound in the more over in the restaurant there was so much noise even the coffee machine was noisy adding up to the customers being lound i know it was not a relaxation spa hotel but i have been to other hotels this one had problem with sound , the location overground and underground very close the staff was great very helpful rooms where very clean we stayed in a no window room was an offer but make sure when you book they dont give one 
210186,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, First of all I was given a small room with no air conditioning remote control a tv remote control or a telephone I used my mobile phone to call down and ask for these things plus an iron and after 40 minutes I decided to get dressed and head to reception were I was told the guy I spoke to had forgot about my call I eventually got the above items ironed my shirt and was heading out when I switched off the iron which caused the socket to blow sparks and the room electrics to trip out Another call to reception and they decided to move me into another room The next night whilst sat on my bed doing some work on my laptop one of the reception staff decided to open my door and show in an old couple who appeared to be shocked by the sight of me in my underpants No apology just everyone turning around and walking out again Not a good experience and not one word of apology for any of it suggests the staff are used to this kind of stuff , Staff did their best room was clean but small Nicely decorated 
210187,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, One thing to improve on the room was a little dusty e g the cups next to kettle and the sink taps The bed throw could have been vacuumed before before putting back on top of nice clean sheets , Good location only 3 mins walk to Kilburn Park tube station The caf attached to the hotel wasn t serving food the night I was there but plenty of places to eat nearby Quiet room 4th floor with very comfortable bed and good air con Efficient shower plenty of hot water and pleasant toiletries for guests 
210188,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The room carpet was torn up and a few floorboards were broken in room 208 the mattress on the bed was rock hard and needs replacing Air conditioning in room was non existent and the heat from bathroom added to this problem TV Remote was broken in my room Hotel restaurant breakfast kitchen fryer or grill was broken so only 10 of restaurant menu on offer No cooked breakfast in the morning available either and staff didn t even explain this very poor communication with guests Also card payments were not working at the restaurant so I had to go to the nearest Street atm and return to restaurant , Friendly check in and check out staff at hotel reception Location is great

210195,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The room was supposed to be a king size but you could not walk around the bed There wasn t even enough room to open the bathroom door as it hit the bed There was no natural light in the room and it was difficult to negotiate the maze of narrow corridors and stairs with your luggage We had to change room at first as there was a strange smell in the room The location of the hotel is good and the area around the hotel has everything you need ,No Positive
210196,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, We were in room 008 in the basement as we opened the door it closed quickly behind us leaving us in pitch black we couldn t see a thing i fell down the 3 steps just beyond the door narrowly missing hitting my head on the corner of the bed to have a hotel room with no window is ridiculous i have a bruised hip shoulder because of this ,No Positive

210199,BEST WESTERN Maitrise Hotel Maida Vale, The room was very small Although friends of us booked the same type of room at the same rate their room their bathroom their TV and especially their bed were way bigger The interior of the room was obviously not very new you could not open the window and the amount of sockets was very little The safe in the closet was broken lights in the closet hung out and there were very limited possibilities to place your belonings on shelves etc After getting the room cleaned by room service there was still hair on the bathroom floor The choice at the continental breakfast was limited in comparison to other hotels were I booked a continental breakfast , Good connection to public transportation good value for money due to a special offer and free Wifi
