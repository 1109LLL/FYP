152770,The Westbridge Hotel, Could not use internet on my TV which was very disappointing That was the reason why I chose this hotel because it had a smart tv , Staff were helpful Facilities were nice Nice complimentary snacks
152771,The Westbridge Hotel, Was an idea location for visiting Olympic Park but whilst this part of city is being regenerated the area wasn t the best looking HOWEVER despite being on the High Street it was a quiet location and an easy walk from train stations, Very comfortable nicely decorated great food nice and quiet
152772,The Westbridge Hotel, Not a problem for us but there was no alcohol serviced in cafe , Staff were excellent Hotel looked recently refurbished and was very modern Great for ride London close and arranged early breakfast 5am 
152773,The Westbridge Hotel, I felt that the rooms could have been a bit more decorative more like the rooms advertised on the website , The bed was comfortable the restaurant food and staff were awesome The lounge was great although a bit cold 
152774,The Westbridge Hotel, I would ve preferred it if I had a bath tub instead of a walking shower as that would ve been romantic The tv kept on freezing so we couldn t watch the tv , I liked the comfy bed how clean the room was the fact that the gym was free and available 24h 
152775,The Westbridge Hotel, Noisy rooms as not soundproofed from either internal or outside noise and air con unit woke us up at 4 30am in the morning with a loud rattling for 20 mins the air in unit was switched off at the time despite making a complaint to hotel they have not bothered to respond so will not be using the mercure hotel chain again,No Positive
152776,The Westbridge Hotel, Be aware pork is not on the menu , Clean well appointed comfortable and quiet 5 minutes walk from Station and 10 minutes from QE2 Olympic Park Staff are very helpful and food is decent Rooms are quiet and comfortable 
152777,The Westbridge Hotel, N a, We were cycling in the PrudentialRide100 Return visit due to the warm welcome and seamless service received last time Was not disappointed Excellent front of house staff Incredibly accomodating especially as they were so busy with so many cyclists and bikes arriving on Saturday pm Well done front of house team 
152778,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, Service was amazing The staff couldn t do enough to help the facilities were fantastic and the Wi Fi was faster in the room than the general one Loved it 
152779,The Westbridge Hotel, I paid for junior suites x 2 and the noise from the high street was unbearable didnt sleep at all any of us Pre a 100 mile ride couldnt have been worse prep Very very dissapointed, Friendly staff and great with bikes etc
152780,The Westbridge Hotel, Some of the staff could not help re local parking and didn t seem too interested in helping , Efficient staff on check in and room was nice proximity to Stratford station and sporting precinct excellent
152781,The Westbridge Hotel, We found the air con controls difficult to understand Luckily this did not cause too much of an issue but had the weather been a little more extreme this might have lead to some problems However I trust that the staff would have been able to help had this been the case , Rooms were lovely clean and comfortable Staff were friendly and helpful Wish our stay had been longer 
152782,The Westbridge Hotel, Room was comfortable but compact small claustrophobic Bathroom was subject to overheating , Quality of finishes d cor Garden Patio for breakfast 
152783,The Westbridge Hotel, a city view was in desciption but we were put on ground floor with no view, Food was good nice breakfast room was ok for what we used for staff very helpfuul
152784,The Westbridge Hotel, The location the tube is nearby but from there it takes a while about 25 30 minutes to get into the centre The food at the restaurant of the hotel wasn t great , Rooms were very tidy and comfortable The staff was very friendly welcoming and helping There is a rather big gym in the basement and there is a nice little terrace We had an afternoon tea at the terrace that we enjoyed a lot 
152785,The Westbridge Hotel, The bed was slightly too hard same with the pillows The room was tiny and dusty , The staff was amazing The room was modern with plenty of free stuff 
152786,The Westbridge Hotel, Breakfast could have been hotter and some items had run out What they re was was good but I feel a little overpriced, Great location so close to SOS Olympic Park tube Fabulous staff
152787,The Westbridge Hotel, Unfortunately although the hotel offers a wide range of options for breakfast the hot options were not very good The coffee especially was terrible We d advise travellers to stick to the cereal and pastry options or alternatively go elsewhere for breakfast there is plenty to choose from in the area Another couple of small disappointments were the quality of wifi in the hotel it was quite slow and choppy as well as the lack of parking for guests coming via car This was a bit of a hassle in terms of loading the luggage although there is some really well priced off road parking about 10 minutes walk away via JustPark Still it would have been handier to simply park right next to the hotel , This hotel was in a great location very close to the Stratford centre and Westfield shopping mall as well as public transport links into the city centre If coming by car there is also no need to drive through the busiest parts of London or pay the congestion charge which was really great Also most importantly the hotel had comfortable clean and stylish rooms and a lovely outside terrace for fresh air when needed There were plenty of comfort facilities in the room to make the stay more cosy The staff were very friendly and helpful even offering to assist us with our luggage when we arrived If coming by car there is also no need to drive through the busiest parts of London or pay the congestion charge which was really great 
152788,The Westbridge Hotel, The bathroom lights made the bathroom so hot , The room was very quiet and the bed very comfy so I slept very well All the staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly 
152789,The Westbridge Hotel, The decor was oppressive and due to poor weather there was a constant dripping noise as rain fell on garden furniture outside the window , There was complimentary water
152790,The Westbridge Hotel, Hadn t realised until we got there about cooked breakfast being non pork And when we came home at 11 30 we had to stand out on street for a cigarette and cold drink as outdoor area was shut felt a little uneasy standing out there , Cleanliness good range of tea coffee facilities 
152791,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, Staff were so friendly welcoming and comforting rooms were very modern and spacious Location was great only a 10 minute walk to Westfields shopping centre and the train bus stations 
152792,The Westbridge Hotel, The price charged for the accommodation was over priced for what was actually offered The accommodation was 3 times over the normal rate This was to cash in on ripping off concert goers The room was tiny air conditioning was poor and the temperature never dropped Tiny window which looked out on the an eating area Tiny bathroom with no room which was exceptionally hot Breakfast was not included in the charge so thankfully we did not have to endure beef bacon what ever that was , nothing
152793,The Westbridge Hotel, The pillows are too hard and the mattress also a little hard the only thing I didn t enjoy was the bacon or sausages the sausages weren t actually sausages they were hot dogs deep fried , The little extras in the room hot drinks etc The staff were very friendly and helpful very informative The room we had was spacious with a great little extra amenities The breakfast was good lots to choose from cereals hot breakfast continental juices tea coffee and water available and as much as you would like 
152794,The Westbridge Hotel, Arrived for a concert at 5pm after a 4 5 hour drive 1 room not ready despite advertised 3pm check in A 10 minute wait promised by front desk became 30 minutes for room in the end we had to leave for concert Luckily we were able to change in 1 room and wait until after concert to access the 2nd room Without the 2nd room we would have had a major problem , convenient for Olympic Park
152795,The Westbridge Hotel, Arrived to book in after 3pm but no room and sat downstairs until 4 30 and then when I went to check again room was ready complimentry drinks but after travelling all day an hour and a half wait was bit too long Also lack of communication approx time etc, Only one night for a concert everything was good clean staff pleasant room had what we needed for a night bed was comfy 
152796,The Westbridge Hotel, The room was very small The air con only went down to 20 and we were unable to open the window not great on one of the hottest days of the year Staff did override the control and we were cooler the second day Being London the rooms are very expensive , Bed was very comfortable The shower was hot Staff were very welcoming and genuinely wanted to look after us 
152797,The Westbridge Hotel, Room and bathroom were on the small side No bath and the shower didn t have a detachable head But the space was well laid out , Super helpful staff Good food Quality fit out furnishings Very clean Tranquil oasis away from the hustle and bustle outside 
152798,The Westbridge Hotel, Nothing , Modern well appointed Felt more luxurious than we paid for Little extras like chocolate on the pillows hotel smart phones to borrow lovely comfy lounge 
152799,The Westbridge Hotel, Ground floor room we arrived a little early to be told oh there is only a ground floor room is that ok I understand why now there were french doors that looked out to a brick wall Pillows were really hard Air conditioning broken and at about 3am was really noisy we didn t call reception admittedly because we couldn t face having to try pack everything up to move let someone in to repair it when we were only staying one night were we staying longer we would have dealt with it differently Staff on reception the next morning really pleasant about it and it wouldn t stop me staying again but would ask for a higher floor room , Stayed here previously and had a great stay so didn t hesitate to re book when attending another event at the Olympic Stadium Location excellent for events and Staff really helpful and friendly
152800,The Westbridge Hotel, Arrived after posted check in time room wasn t ready due to linen delivery being late Complimentary drinks were provided whilst waited for room to be ready , Staff very friendly and helpful Breakfast buffet excellent just what to doctor order from night before Terrace garden is modern and definatley the place to be when the sun is out 
152801,The Westbridge Hotel, The room was a little snug but we went for the cheapest option so that was to be expected Plus the aircon wasn t too good and didn t come with instructions luckily we weren t too hot , Bed was really comfy and it was nice to just sit in bed and watch TV Shower was nice too 
152802,The Westbridge Hotel, Even though the room was ultra modern it was still very warm in the room and for us the curtains let a lot of light in come early morning but that s just us otherwise a great place to stay , Fantastic location as we were attending a concert at Olympic park Very safe area we walked back at 12 30 at night had no problems at all Lovely staff nice room Good facilities 
152803,The Westbridge Hotel, noise from the street the windows are ill designed with a slit to allow for ventilation But street noise gets through as well Luckily I was facing a not so crowded street , Clean good bedding towels good breakfast friendly staff
152804,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, Smart TV your name is even on the screen when your enter the room it s a nice touch The toiletries which include body lotion and conditioner Complimentary bottled water flat and sparkling The housekeepers respect the do not disturb sign and are efficient Friendly reception team Direct National Express bus from the airport to Stratford station 8 minutes walk to the hotel 
152805,The Westbridge Hotel, My only complaint would be that the room in which I stayed 105 was near to the reception desk outside seating and fire door As a result I was woken up on two or three occasions in the night with people returning back to the hotel after a night out and making noise from loud talking activity and the door closing Whilst this isn t specifically the hotel s fault a policy of consideration for other guests after dark might be helpful , Lovely hotel and so convenient just a block away from the underground DLR although further from the airport 10 mins from the O2 Staff were great naturally helpful informative and friendly without being false The room was small though beautifully designed and fitted Pretty clean too apart from a few little corners Perfect for a quick one night stay over I will definitely return 
152806,The Westbridge Hotel, Pillows like rocks with a mattress to match TV hanging off the wall and didn t work despite two visits from staff to fix No bar, The only redeeming asset of this hotel is the staff 
152807,The Westbridge Hotel, nothing, beds were extremely comfy very quiet room The service by all staff was amazing professional friendly and would definitely make me come back again for the third time
152808,The Westbridge Hotel, nothing honestly, The location is perfect just close to Stratford tube and train station Also close to a shopping centre with supermarket cafes and restaurants The staff was really helpful The room was clean and with good space 
152809,The Westbridge Hotel, Although it does say in the hotel details there is no bar I did find this inconvenient had to take quite a walk to find somewhere open after the concert at the London Stadium No one loathes drunks more than me but a couple of drinks to finish off the evening would have made my stay more pleasant , Friendliness of the staff everywhere was very clean Complimentary newspapers were a nice touch Location for the London Stadium is excellent 
152810,The Westbridge Hotel, nothing , excellent breakfast choice nearly didn t go when realised it was Halal as my partner wanted a full English turns out to be way way better than expected beef sausage instead of pork fresh juice bread selection pastry selection fresh fruit cereals perfect scrambled and also frid eggs smoked salmon cheeses sliced meats cucumber fresh cooked tomatoes mushrooms and more than enough of everything 
152811,The Westbridge Hotel, Signs to reception could be MUCH clearer No parking but you can park in Westfield schopping centre for 6 80 a day PLEASE let guests know before they go to the room how to insert the card key very different to other hotels , Location Near to transport and shopping centre sports Great TV with central controls to lights etc Staff very helpful nice Fridge lovely designed room extras water buscuits Highly recommended Loved it 
152812,The Westbridge Hotel, Nothing at all I enjoyed another excellent stay there Definitely come back again , Excellent view of the city and the O2 from the balcony Ironing board and iron in the room Good variety of drinks and very clean Also good for people wanting to go to the Olympic Park and pool 
152813,The Westbridge Hotel, Some small issues with the room such as the mini fridge being more like a toy one showering would wet the bathroom floor or the AC not working properly sometimes , Good location close to the Stratford stations Their restaurant is very good high quality food 
152814,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, Clean nicely kept Location was a 10 minute walk from the Tube and shopping center Met our needs very nicely Room was compact but nicely appointed 
152815,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, Such wonderful staff both on front desk and on room service The restaurant was excellent value and food was delivered to my room within 30 minutes every time Bathroom was immaculately clean with a sizeable bathtub Everything I look for and expect from a hotel at this price range was present at the Westbridge Hotel 
152816,The Westbridge Hotel, Parking isn t available and so is either expensive or a bit of a walk we opted to park on somebody s driveway via a parking app for 10 for 24 hours opposed to staying in one of the shopping centre parks for much more money , A nice central location The hotel is very clean and well kept The staff are friendly and efficient There is a nice touch of a tablet in each room but I didn t utilise it The rooms are well equipped with toiletries and complimentary teas coffees biscuits and waters sparking and still 
152817,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, Fairly new hotel very well located with Stratford Centre and Westfield within 15 mn walk or 2 mn by DLR Stratford High Street stop is only 2 mn away One can be in the centre of London in 30 mn 
152818,The Westbridge Hotel, The neighbourhood didn t seem very friendly but at least it was close to the Westfield Stratford shopping mall , The room though on the small side and facilities were impeccable and the breakfast was very nice 
152819,The Westbridge Hotel, Nothing comes to mind, Always like staying here I travel to London most weeks and like to get out of the real centre of town when staying over Westbridge has that bit of distance but it only takes 25 30 mins door to door from my office in Soho Staff are always great rooms are very comfortable gym does the job and room service is quick and tasty 
152820,The Westbridge Hotel, The coffee from the coffee machine at the buffet was not nice There is a proper machine with Illy coffee behind the bar though , Nice staff very helpful Hotel restaurant serves till 21 30 Good salad and smoothies No alcohol nor pork in this hotel 
152821,The Westbridge Hotel, No bar which I found a little disappointing However you were allowed to take your own drink to the restaurant which in all fairness probably saved a lot of money , The staff were extremely friendly and professional 
152822,The Westbridge Hotel, More milks in the room for the tea and coffee , The friendliness of the staff and how helpful they were Being able to check in early was really helpful It was great location wise for seeing an event at the o2 
152823,The Westbridge Hotel, I had a room on the ground floor the pavement is right outside my window which felt not only noisy but also unsafe, Clean nice room Not far from Stratford station Super friendly staff 
152824,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, This is the second time we have stayed here and it was as excellent as the first time Great value for London and easily connected to the rest of London by the DLR which is close by 
152825,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, We arrived early and the friendly receptionists let us leave our bags in storage so we could explore London a little when we checked in and got to our room everything was spotless the bed was super comfy and the black out curtains were amazing You could control the lights from the TV and the wifi was very good The size of the room was cosy but not too small The shower was good and the bathroom gleaming Overall i was more than happy with this hotel I would stay here again in a heartbeat 
152826,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, Very modern clean good decor Great technology could operate everything from the tv remote lights door etc Loved the free handy phone to make free calls travel around London easier Nice quiet room well sound proofed Great location near train station underground less than 30 mins into central London Well stocked hospitality tray loads of toiletries even scales in the bathroom Tip book direct for discounted rates they give you a free breakfast voucher for your next stay 
152827,The Westbridge Hotel, Our room was a weird triangular shape with a tiny bit of space to get past one corner of the bed a bit pokey Other rooms in the hotel I have stayed before are much better Housekeeping wasn t bad but wasn t quite up to the high standards as on previous occasions maybe hotel is asking their staff to clean too many rooms in too short a time Glasses were left unwashed and surfaces weren t wiped Small details but important , Staff are lovely hotel has excellent transport links and is clean and comfortable 
152828,The Westbridge Hotel, Even though I requested a quiet room there was still a good deal of noise from the corridors road my room faced the main road and people in other rooms Also I couldn t open any of the windows which I was very disappointed with as I really dislike air conditioning The air conditioning system was quite noisy and rattled sometimes I wasn t able to adjust the temperature below 18 degrees so I was also very hot at night as I prefer cooler temperatures The room got quite stuffy because I couldn t ventilate it with fresh air , The room was very comfortable Good tea facilities in the room and lovely bathroom Wifi was very good it s provided individually for each room so the speed is high The breakfast was delicious and had a good variety of foods drinks My room price included breakfast and dinner so I thought it was very good value for money I had dinner delivered to my room for no extra charge The food was delicious Also there were a lot of high tech aspects to the hotel The best one in my opinion even though I didn t use it was a Samsung phone provided with the room that had free internet calls and texts to UK numbers So if I was a forgein visitor this would have been extremely useful for navigation of the city etc as you can take it out and about with you while staying at the hotel I thought this was a very considerate and positive feature 
152829,The Westbridge Hotel, I didn t dislike anything and I don t have any complaints , All staff were very welcoming pleasant and approachable The room was very comforatble and had good facilities including a safe My TV stopped working properly shortly after arrival but was sorted within a few minutes of reporting it 
152830,The Westbridge Hotel, Price slightly high but London so expected some of the rooms were smaller than hoped for we had 5 rooms between our family so just juggled kids around to work , Friendly staff clean modern rooms handy extra android phone in room for kids to play games on watch you tube etc fantastic roof terrace fantastic breakfast spread great location thoroughly recommend 
152831,The Westbridge Hotel, No parking Hotel restaurant ran out of pasta the night before the marathon , Excellent hotel Very clean and presentable rooms Opened breakfast up at 6am for marathon runners 
152832,The Westbridge Hotel, The only drawback was the shower which wasn t at all powerful and only had the rainforest head which is supposed to be luxurious but actually means it takes longer to get washed and isn t invigorating , The bed was firm which I liked The facilities were exactly as stated The room was incredibly clean and easily big enough for the two of us The desk and chair were well positioned the TV with personalised greeting was a lovely touch and the room was quiet despite staying on a Saturday night 
152833,The Westbridge Hotel, Mattress and pillows a little firm , Used while running the London Marathon so the hotel put on an early breakfast Only a short walk to Stratford station and dlr Lights and a c controllable from the tv 
152834,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, The rooms were quite small and very warm despite turning down the room temperature Service at the reception desk was very good and all other staff friendly 
152835,The Westbridge Hotel, As stated we got upgraded to a suit which I was stunning the only draw back is that it faces the busy road at the front of the hotel so traffic noise was quite bad at all times and the curtains did let a fair bit of light through so the room was still fairly light in the middle of the night Would def go back and stay again but would request to stay in a room further into the hotel so not to be effected by the road , Excellent customer service and always wanted to make our stay special Upgraded to a suit as they knew it was my partners birthday and also surprised by decorating the room with balloons and a birthday card 
152836,The Westbridge Hotel, being charged a deposit 50 when we checked in and stayed for a couple of hours , Room was lovely and had a lovely balcony as well couldn t work the air con but overall good experience
152837,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, It is the best hotel of 2015 in London very tech hotel all room management via TV i e light WiFi temperature in the room movies weather alarm etc etc Reasonably located from the London center and the rest is superb Plus hotel provides you with cell phone with 4G connection which you can use for navigation in the city and local and international calls it is unexpected surprise beyond expectation 
152838,The Westbridge Hotel, Parking facility not available Closest was the bingo at 25 a night Used just park to find near by parking for duration of stay fairly cheap on just park , Great hotel with great staff
152839,The Westbridge Hotel, Our initial room was tiny queen Victoria and drab it felt very claustrophobic and over priced Our second room was lovely albeit very noisy as by the street The bathroom could ve been cleaner it wasn t awful but didn t look freshly cleaned The bathroom door didn t close , When we switched room it was an excellent size The bed was comfy and the food was good Staff were very accommodating 
152840,The Westbridge Hotel, On arrival I had to correct the receptionist on the price as they got it wrong and I struggled to understand them The junior suite was nicely decorated but the bathroom in room 6 is an absolute joke There isn t enough room to stand in front of the toilet It is so tiny you have to sit on the toilet sideways as the sink and bin are in the way It is the smallest bathroom I have ever seen in all the places I have stayed Really disappointed considering the cost , The decor is lovely 
152841,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, This is probably my 7th stay at the hotel and I cannot fault it anywhere It has been consistently excellent and has only been improving its offering Everything from the comfort level to the room facilities and the incredibly helpful staff is excellent You can t ask for more when traveling for business 
152842,The Westbridge Hotel, the view that gives you directly to a parking, the staff was extremely kind breakfast really great the room were very cleaned and the bed was confortable 
152843,The Westbridge Hotel, The little containers of milk with the in room tea coffee facilities were nasty Immediate skin on top of the cuppa , Fantastic staff decent location For a mid week break with my better half it was ideal and well priced Less than 1 2 hour by tube from Leicester Square great access to everything Not sure I think the kids would like it however Rooms are cosy with a very efficient use of available space Will absolutely return 
152844,The Westbridge Hotel, The ground floor room was a little cramped , I only stayed one night arriving late and leaving early without breakfast The staff were very helpful and polite It was excellent value for money and very well placed for Stratford 
152845,The Westbridge Hotel, The thermostat didn t seem to work properly Set it to 24 and it still didn t heat up the room, Staff were very friendly and helpful and the free mobile phone to use during the stay was an excellent touch
152846,The Westbridge Hotel, As in many modern hotels nowadays the windows cannot be opened , Ideal location for travelling from LCY airport Very good breakfast International newspapers and magazines to take to your room 
152847,The Westbridge Hotel, My room was quite noisy and quite cramped , Hotel was lovely and modern and finished to a high standard Food was excellent and you didn t need to pay extra for room service Very close to DLR station and Westfield centre Good alternative if you are at the Excel centre very easy to get too from here 
152848,The Westbridge Hotel, I like the hotel but found it litle difiicult to access as an elderly woman alone at night I got a lift from a colleague but there is no stopping outside the hotel More advice about how to access by car or taxi would be useful is there parking at the back of the hotel , The hotel was stylish spotlessly clean The bed was very comfortable 
152849,The Westbridge Hotel, where s the pork sausages i think I missed something Chicken ones were really nice though , Fast check in and check out Room was ready for us despite me booking an hour before 
152850,The Westbridge Hotel, Coffee was not up to scratch Room not naturally aired from outside as you cannot open the windows or doors that they have in place It will do some good to get fresh air into it rather than air conditioning all the time It was set at 24 degrees so i had to ask them to raise it and and they did so by only one degree to 25 Strange subtle odures accompanied by drowsiness at regular intervals , Staff are very nice and helpful Room I had was spacious and pleasant Overall it is a nice and clean place to stay even for a short one you will enjoy your stay as well as the area amenities around the hotel Breakfast was great A serving of english as well as continental A OK 
152851,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, Lovely hotel perfect location for o2 arena was a 4 minute walk to Stratford station from the hotel and then took us less than 10 minutes to get the o2 also didn t take us long at all to get back to Paddington the next day to go home There is a huge shopping centre next to Stratford station too which has loads of places to eat and shop would definitely come back again 
152852,The Westbridge Hotel, Room quite small, Very clean room Staff friendly and helpful Close to public transport links I requested a room decoration for partners birthday and they hadn t done it on our arrival however the staff were extremely apologetic and when we went out we returned to see they had gone in and filled the room with balloons and a card 
152853,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, The Westbridge hotel is absolutely the best we ve ever stayed The hotel is amazing gorgeous boutique look and super clean It is located 5 min by walk from Stratford center easy to reach and find The staff is very friendly polite and willing to help you with whatever you need Check in was quick and we got room 207 big enough for two people modern super clean and very quiet Big comfy bed for a good quality sleep smart TV smart phone mini fridge electric kettle with tea and coffee safe There is everything you need Bathroom is really nice and also super clean hairdryer toiletries weight scale and magnifying mirror are provided Towels are very big and fluffy If it is raining you can borrow an umbrella from the reception for free Also you can use the computers and printers in the Lounge Perfect and strong wi fi all the time free of charge The food in the restaurant is excellent My husband was really touched from the attention of the management our room was decorated for his birthday The Westbridge hotel is a perfect 10 and we will definitely go back there on our next visit to London 
152854,The Westbridge Hotel, Nothing , The staff were very friendly and welcoming and the room was great Great location only 5 10 minute walk from Stratford Station and Westfield 
152855,The Westbridge Hotel, Didn t get on very well with the hard mattress and we were only able to reduce the air conditioning by 3 degrees so had a warm night , Lovely breakfast Friendly and helpful staff The hotel is handy for Westfield just a short walk Parking though expensive is available nearby 
152856,The Westbridge Hotel, We ordered room service the food was nice but not exactly as described We tried to order a mocktail the hotel doesn t serve alcohol at 9 45 and was told that the kitchen had shut at 9 30 so we couldn t order it Seems a bit weird that a jug of juice couldn t be brought up Anyway we also ordered room service from the night time menu and we got a chicken panini when it came it was stone cold so we had to re order We were given a disabled room which is fine but we didn t request that Also if you say the name of the hotel to people then they tell you rumours about how it is a swingers hotel which is a little grubby feeling , Staff were lovely the room was very quiet and the bed was v comfy 
152857,The Westbridge Hotel, The carpet in the room we stayed in could ve been a bit more modern and soft The shower and toilet were cramped together into a tiny room When booking it said the room came with a city view although we could see the Olympic aquatic centre in the distance and the corner of Westfields there was a construction site directly opposite the front of the building and our room so our view was mostly a large pile of rubble , The lounge area was beautiful free wifi available throughout the building and use of computers The room was spotless The bed looked gorgeous with a big black headboard and was comfortable too There was lots of extras which was nice including chocolates tea coffee water and hot chocolate There was also a safety deposit box and a fridge The room also included a large flat screen to with quite a few channels Overall our stay was enjoyable 
152858,The Westbridge Hotel, Poor location with access to very little entertainment such as restaurants other than in hotel no bar in the hotel and lack of coffee shops Very small room so photos on website are deceptive TV didn t work properly but some came to fix it ,No Positive

152861,The Westbridge Hotel, The photos on booking com of the superior double room are of the junior suite We were also promised a room with a view of the City but this wasn t the case It s quite loud in the room with traffic noise , Awesome breakfast The bed was super comfy albeit a little small There is wifi in the hotel plus a different router in each room Everything is quite techy The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from Stratford station in an unassuming building
152862,The Westbridge Hotel, The bed was quite hard and there was a little bit of a draft The light from the phone and the digital clock was quite bright during the night , The technology in the room was very impressive Everything can be controlled from the bed through the TV The rooms were very modern with large mirrors and neutral colours The shower was great and the bathroom in general was nice 
152863,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, Always love the westbridge Stay there a few nights most months Staff make the difference Always smiling and happy to help Comfortable beds stylish rooms Great gym Love sitting and relaxing in their lounge area Close to the stratford station and shopping area Highly recommended Home from home 
152864,The Westbridge Hotel, The shower was constructed in a way that the water actually flood the entire area and we end up putting towels all over to prevent it but of course it could only be the room we stayed in Other than that nothing bothered us greatly , We were very pleased to have stayed at the Westbridge Hotel Location is perfect very accessible and few minutes walk away from Stratford Center and Westfield Mall If you are to go to London Excel the DLR Station is 2 minutes away from the hotel The hotel staff were very helpful and always friendly The room we stayed in was clean and nicely prepared They have this mobile phone you can take and use for FREE to make local and international calls only few countries access maps or google something Breakfast was ok there were enough choices just right to start your day with All in all we would gladly stay here again

152866,The Westbridge Hotel, The option of a non dairy milk would have been nice to have at breakfast, The room was clean and smart and the bed was comfy Facilities were good and the staff were friendly and helpful Well located for Westfield East London and transport links 
152867,The Westbridge Hotel, Road outside was busy at all times near enough but it isn t much of an issue unless you are especially light sleeper, Stratford tube station is a 5 minute walk away and from there you can to the centre of London in minutes There is also a bus which goes direct from the tube station to Stansted Airport so if you re flying to Stansted the hotels location is perfect
152868,The Westbridge Hotel, Nothing Everything was really good Would always come back , The Staff when we got to the hotel were very helpful Got there early and it wasn t a problem to them to hold our luggage for a few hours until the room was ready Walked in to a welcome smile 
152869,The Westbridge Hotel, unfortunate incident when one of the staff burst into our room early in the morning It was embarrassing to say the least The complaint was dealt with by offering us a plate of fruit but no explanation i would still recommend this hotel, Comfortable room lovely big fluffy towels Clean throughout wifi and television provided This hotel would be a great choice for visiting the London Stadium and also the City and West End of London as it is served by a great local transport system 
152870,The Westbridge Hotel, The air conditioning didn t work so I spent the night in a room that was too hot because it kept blowing out hot air regardless of the temperature set , It s a pleasant hotel with good rooms and facilities The location is right next to Stratford High Street DLR 
152871,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, The location is great This was our 3rd visit and we will deffo be back The breakfast is really nice The room is clean and everything you are looking for for a night away 
152872,The Westbridge Hotel, It would be even better if they had a bar social space to chill when on business , Love this hotel have stayed there many times business and pleasure Worth going that bit further out of central London I love that it s clean and modern and doesn t make me want to touch the door handles with toilet paper 
152873,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, My partner and I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights from December 27th Staff were really friendly and nothing was too much trouble They recommend nice places to eat and places to visit The VIP pass to the Westfield centre was also a bonus They also offered to keep hold of our luggage when we checked out so we didn t have to carry it around London Rooms were exceptionally clean and beds were comfy Each room came with its own private wifi and a good selection of tv channels We did not have breakfast here however the staff allowed us to order a Chinese takeaway to the hotel for the first night The hotel is a 5 minute walk away from Stratford station and it takes roughly 25 30 minutes on the tube to reach central London The hotel was good value for money My partner and I both agreed that we would stay here again if we were to revisit London 
152874,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, The rooms were fantastic the burger from the restaurant was perfect brilliant value for money Would 100 recommend to everyone The purpose of the trip was to watch Manchester City vs West Ham and they won 5 0 which made the stay even better 
152875,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, Helpful friendly staff Quality twin room very good value for money Great location for London Stadium Westfield and transport links to Canary Wharf central London and coach for Stansted airport 
152876,The Westbridge Hotel, That there were a very small selection of TV programmes to choose from, That there were a facility for late a dinner with a room service and a gym also at the hotel

152879,The Westbridge Hotel, Much quieter from housekeeping in the morning I could hear them extremely loudly when trying to have a lie in The restaurant should have a portable PDQ so that drinks can be paid for by cash or card for room service, Lovely bed clean room and great facilities Really friendly staff very welcoming So close to station 
152880,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, Very nice room extremely well appointed It was a flying visit so we couldn t really get the most of it but will definitely book again at this hotel Staff couldn t have been nicer

152882,The Westbridge Hotel, Nothing, Staff were very friendly polite helpful and professional There were several options for breakfast which was buffet style Room was comfortable and clean Would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family To be honest a great friendly comfortable hotel 
152883,The Westbridge Hotel, The lighting in the room was slightly odd needed better lighting over the desk , Easy to get to from the station and Westfield Lovely and friendly staff Comfortable bed and wonderful bathroom 
152884,The Westbridge Hotel, Nothing really, The room was really comfortable and I love that we had a chocolate on our bad and just the little extras like our names on the TV and that you can just turn everything off with the remote control also staff very friendly and helpful too
152885,The Westbridge Hotel, The rooms and communal areas were a little on the warm side but otherwise no issues, The staff were amazing and really put us at ease They couldn t have been more friendly The rooms were lovely with everything you could need 
152886,The Westbridge Hotel, It offers a halal breakfast This is not an option it s the only cooked breakfast choice and for me chicken sausage doesn t exactly hit the spot and nor do turkey rashers ,No Positive
152887,The Westbridge Hotel, There is no bar in the hotel and the room wasn t ready until 5PM due to a maintenance issue The staff were friendly and helpful though , Very clean and modern hotel Great location close to Stratford station 
152888,The Westbridge Hotel, Nothing, Nice clean room with window that opens Perhaps a little small but when no problem if you are alone Good shower and delicious breakfast It is only a minute from the Tube that takes me to my office As I visit London very regularly I will stay at the Westbridge more often 
152889,The Westbridge Hotel, I m a very light sleeper so the fan in the bathroom was quite frustrating But that s a minor gripe for an otherwise excellent stay , Helpful and friendly staff immaculate room with great facilities Recommended
152890,The Westbridge Hotel, Breakfast well I loved the breakfast but did not include it with my booking I cannot understand why the price difference is so big between continental and English as it is all buffet but still very good, I loved the hotel and staff and it was situated perfectly for us 
152891,The Westbridge Hotel, our heating in the room didn t work at all for the night we were there but they got us a portable heater that helped a lot , lovely staff great room service lovely food
152892,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, Location short walk to Stratford stations shopping and Olympic Park Nicely integrated use of technology including free use of phone Balcony Bedroom d cor 
152893,The Westbridge Hotel, Bathroom floor tiles were cracked and bathroom was tiny We paid extra for a junior suite but wouldn t do that again Would definitely stay in a standard room though as everything else was great, Staff and location were fantastic
152894,The Westbridge Hotel, It has a certain smell Couldn t work out what it was but was quite manly and heavy in the corridors , The bed was really comfy the room ticked all the boxes We have a late evening meal which was also really good I would stay here again 
152895,The Westbridge Hotel, The restaurant food wasn t quite as good as I hoped but reasonably satisfactory none the less , The bed was extremely comfortable had three great nights of sleep 
152896,The Westbridge Hotel, Whilst location is excellent for Westfield and public transport hub at Stratford short walk late at night might be off putting for some , Very friendly great facilities good location
152897,The Westbridge Hotel, The night menu was very sparse and should have more choice No hot drink to replace the lack of alcohol was a surprise Why no alcohol This was the first time I have stayed here I stay at a lot of 4 5 star hotels and this was good for what it provides in comparison, Really easy to get to close to transport and visible on main street The hotel was clean and efficient and staff good Unfortunately I had to leave too early to take advantage of the free breakfast The room was good modern clean and comfortable and the airconditioning perfect The TV was good size and well placed The use of mirrored walls made the room appear larger Although near the street the room was VERY quiet and the bed comfortable 
152898,The Westbridge Hotel, I really cant find anything , Excellent hotel great location and absolutely wonderful rooms and a great hotel gym with actual weights and stuff Loved it
152899,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, Amazing hotel Loved all the technology and the modern feel Staff were so friendly and helpful even offering to go and buy a bottle of wine locally as it is a halal Room was great and the addition of a free phone to make free national and international calls as well surfing the net was a unique touch Food in the restaurant from the half board menu was beautifully presented and tasty the teriyaki chicken was the nicest I ve had and the chocolate fondant pud oozed melted chocolate just as it should Would totally recommend this hotel to anyone staying in that area it s only 5 minutes walk away from Stratford High Street DLR 
152900,The Westbridge Hotel, Nothing , Staff helpful and welcoming Size of hotel small enough to be comfortable without being claustrophobic Excellent the best hotel I have stayed in in London Excellent transport links 
152901,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, The staff were very welcoming and friendly from the moment we stepped in the door although only staying one night Every member of staff acted professionally and cared about their clients needs and comfort The rooms were astonishing providing comfort a modern feel and vibe With many classy features that we adored 
152902,The Westbridge Hotel, Hadn t realised until the last minute that it was a Halal hotel so no alcohol on the premises but staff were happy for us to byo from the corner shop Not many options for dining out as location is a little remote , Lovely quiet outdoor courtyard to enjoy a drink Comfortable relatively quiet modern facilities Friendly staff 
152903,The Westbridge Hotel, It would have been better to have a bath in the room, The staff were so polite and welcoming The free mobile to use with Internet throughout the stay was an added plus although we didn t take it out of the room
152904,The Westbridge Hotel, Room was a touch small Corridor noise was high and lasted until after midnight room seemed to be close to lift entrance , Good restaurant and food Helpful staff
152905,The Westbridge Hotel, Bathroom was not ventilated well nor was it heated Part of the issue was that the bed restricted the bathroom door from opening fully , Most everything 
152906,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, I Literally loved everything about this hotel The most nicest Hotel in East London its round the corner from Holiday in but I d choose this hotel a millions time once your in there the deco staff facilities everything makes you forget you are actually in London still 3 min walk from Westfeilds Stratford Their full English breakfast was amazing and so filling with a very decent price I could write so many good things on here but all I can say you will not regret staying or booking this place to stay oozes quality and comfort Cant wait to be back 1
152907,The Westbridge Hotel, Nothing at all First time I have ever said that , The reception and the welcome from the Westbridge Hotel staff were exemplary We had an early wedding to attend of course rooms could not be expected to be ready but we were offered every comfort changing rooms showers restaurant and lovely lounge to relax and prepare Our left luggage was labelled and our room a welcome delight on our very late return Cudos to the staff every one of whom made our stay fabulous The modern key system was easy to use with bags in hand There was everything we needed and more including personal wifi code on the tv screen Fluffy bathrobes and slippers plumptious pillows and duvet crisp linens and thick curtains A great double bedside light with reading low light and brighter uplight So much thoughtful design I could go on but why spoil this brilliant surprise I would highly recommend this lovely oasis I would also mention the very warm and helpful Gala Bingo staff they helped me with my membership in house was easier than online which afforded me free parking once a game was purchased and number plate recognition details entered saving me 25 for 24 hour parking at the rear of the hotel 
152908,The Westbridge Hotel, Sliding shower door came off it s runners Poor breakfast sweated food and cheap wet bacon and some kind of hot dog sausage Pretty awful TBH Tiny room size of a phone booth complicated lighting in the rooms No car park , Bed was comfortable
152909,The Westbridge Hotel, The floors are full ancient wood Very nice to look at but very awkward to walk on because it creaks like mad The room I had was called a suite but honestly it does not qualify as a suite too small It was still very comfortable though , The bedding and the quality of the bed were outstanding It was in fact the most comfortable bedding I have had in years The airco was effective and not to noisy after only 5 hours of sleep I was fully refreshed 
152910,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, Reception staff exceptionally friendly and helpful For Excel this is a good location easy walk from Stratford station Exterior not inspiring but nice little boutique find inside 
152911,The Westbridge Hotel, Staff could not tell us about best way to use public transport in the area or information on hand over the bike hire scheme A map of the local area and highlights would of been helpful Lucky the wifi was strong that we could look it up ourselves , Great size room Outside terrace for a drink in the evening Close to High street and 2 minutes from DLR 
152912,The Westbridge Hotel, For evening meals maybe the lighting could be slightly lower and the music could be different from the day , The staff were very pleasant and attentive The hotel was very clean had a good deco and bedding Also complementary water and coffee 
152913,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, Staff were very friendly and helpful Room was super clean comfortable and modern Very convenient for the event I was attending in the Olympic Park Only stayed for 1 night so I couldn t take full advantage of all the facilities sadly Recommended 
152914,The Westbridge Hotel, cost of breakfast seemed high, very friendly and welcoming staff well use of room space decor so rooms didnt feel small good products in both bathroom and coffee area

152917,The Westbridge Hotel, The room was a little noisy from the traffic outside but this wouldn t stop us from staying again , The staff were very friendly and helpful We stayed for the hottest night of the summer and the air conditioning was such a welcome relief from the heat The hotel is ideally situated for the Queen Elizabeth Stadium which is a nice easy walk 
152918,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly and helpful staff Clean room that had space for suitcases as well as occupants to move around Breakfast menu very reasonably priced good variety 
152919,The Westbridge Hotel, They told me they could provide me with a plug adapter so I did not have to buy my own but at the end they did not have any as other guests asked first Just as a heads up if you need one bring it with you , Everything was perfect 
152920,The Westbridge Hotel, There was nothing I didn t like , The room the friendly very helpful staff the location close to the Olympic Stadium and the underground the little extras in the room coffee hot chocolate bottles of water fridge to keep things cool very useful on a hot day 
152921,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, Stayed for nearly a week due toy home flooding Staff could not have been more helpful and friendly during a chaotic time Top marks and would definitely recommend 
152922,The Westbridge Hotel, Minor quibble as with a lot of hotels couldn t open the window on a very warm night , Excellent from start to finish Staff were very friendly and efficient The whole hotel was spotlessly clean bedroom really comfortable and bathroom shower toiletries great Buffet breakfast was well presented well cooked and plenty of it We took our breakfast coffees to the 1st floor lounge which is amazing We would definitely stay there again 
152923,The Westbridge Hotel, I can understand previous comments regarding disappointment at the Halal policy no alcohol available or proper bacon sausages for breakfast but it wasn t an issue for me personally at all The breakfast buffet had a huge range of alternatives hot and cold to satisfy anyone and if you want a drink there s a pub opposite and several options a short walk up the street , Beautiful calm oasis Staff were professional and friendly letting me check in a few hours early at no charge Great room wonderful bed and lovely extras like the rituals toiletries and cookies chocolates in the room Wonderful breakfast options and dining area everything was fresh clean and tasteful Would definitely stay again and recommend to others 10 out of 10 many thanks 
152924,The Westbridge Hotel, I found one of the free water had been drunk half of the bottle when i first time stepped into the room I don t know if the housekeeping forget to change new one or someone really drink it before i check in the room , Very good and helpful staff 
152925,The Westbridge Hotel, Housekeeping was haphazard Some days towels would be changed others not Same for coffee cups Complementary creamers were months out of date , Very pleasant hotel Good breakfast Rooms small but functional Pleasant staff 
152926,The Westbridge Hotel, Couldn t fault anything Everything was perfect , This was my second stay at this hotel and I can t fault anything the hotel is always clean too a high standard and all the staff are very helpful and kind Hotel is just few minutes walk to Stratford so very handy if you wanted to do a little bit of shopping or go into London Breakfast was lovely too loads to choose from Excellent service 
152927,The Westbridge Hotel, Only minor point Sausages and bacon look poor quality , We ve stayed in lots of London hotels and this is the best by far in our target price range Staff are especially helpful 
152928,The Westbridge Hotel, Restaurant lacks atmosphere Large like a caf mainly empty Hairdryers work in short bursts only , Very modern hotel Rooms are excellent quality Staff very helpful 10 mins to Stratford underground bus station or Westfield shopping centre Bus stop outside to West End Restaurant good food and good value for money 
152929,The Westbridge Hotel, I thought I had paid for breakfast but was advised that it wasn t included , Reception staff very friendly and upgrade to mini suite a really lovely touch 
152930,The Westbridge Hotel, The hotel is Halal which isnt that well advertised on the site this means it doesnt serve any alcohol I wasnt drinking but it is an unusual feature there was a lovely outdoor seating area that would have been lovely with a glass of wine on a sunny day The room service menu which was advertised in the room and at check in wasnt available at 11pm when we returned to the hotel instead we were given a takeaway menu not the best experience , Staff on reception really friendly on check in Room a generous size and very comfortable Great location for events at the Olympic Stadium
152931,The Westbridge Hotel, Poor breakfast in my opinion Coffie machine broken first morning and no one had time to serve me from the espress machine Run out of bread etc , Nice hotelroom clean and comfortable The bathroom a little undersized but no probem with that really 
152932,The Westbridge Hotel, The exterior looks a little tired and doesn t compare to what you find when you walk through the door Rooms are slightly on the small side but in line with what you expect to get generally in London , Beautiful and stylish interior The staff were exceptionally friendly and extremely helpful Excellent base if visiting the O2 
152933,The Westbridge Hotel, Nothing, Great location friendly staff clean comfy room excellent breakfast Close to station great shopping Olympic park and great restaurants 
152934,The Westbridge Hotel, The room was small so no chair where I could sit and work and very dark even with all the lights on which made trying to read my work rather hard , Staff were amazing and the breakfast was good Location is fine and the hotel is clean with good amenities 
152935,The Westbridge Hotel, Only thing that I didn t like was I can t open the window in my room for some fresh air , Very clean and quiet place wonderful staff at the front desk My room was bright and comfortable modern bathroom complimentary coffee tea and cookies every day daily housekeeping The electrical switches were a bit confusing for me Free wifi in room The hotel is close to Stratford train station with ease access to central London Buy Oyster Card it works for trains buses the tube You ll need to enter only the zones 1 3 Not too many restaurants around Limited choice of Chinese Mediterranean and local pubs Overall I would recommend this hotel if you need to stay in this area 
152936,The Westbridge Hotel, The twin room and bathroom were very small The terrace was closed during our stay so we couldn t enjoy the good weather outdoors , The bathroom stocked nice toiletries The hotel was clean 
152937,The Westbridge Hotel, No bar Hotel a bit shabby from the outside , Nice contemporary room with modern furnishing and technology Nice to have a balcony The room had the personal touch fresh fruit welcome note chocolates on the pillows Hotel had friendly staff and is in a good location close to Westfield 
152938,The Westbridge Hotel, We were located on the the ground level and it is so noisy Lorries and passers by From 6am it was a constant flow , The staff were really friendly and helpful
152939,The Westbridge Hotel, Locked Windows , New modern confortable and clean staff very kindly graceful and professional Bus stop in front of hotel and near at stratford underground and rail station 
152940,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, The bed was so comfy you didn t want to get out in the morning Just what is needed after lots of walking around the capital Able to control lights and air con via the tv remote excellent You simply can t improve on perfection 
152941,The Westbridge Hotel, The location was good but it would have been ideal if there had been more reasonably priced parking at the hotel We parked in Westfield which was much cheaper , The rooms were beautifully done They were not that big really but very cosy and comfortable The place had a looked after feel to it 
152942,The Westbridge Hotel, Our room was on the side of the building and very noisy Other than the noise we had a very pleasant stay A bit of grime around the shower but nothing too major , Checked in and my 4 year old recieved a Westbridge hotel bear as a gift Lovely reception staff Bedroom well equipped even after a late change of plan to bring my daughter Hotel went a little extra to add another set of everything for her towels toiletries water biscuits etc 
152943,The Westbridge Hotel, No negative points at all , Wonderful hotel Brilliant staff professional and helpful Tastefully decorated and with every facility you can imagine Best mattress I ve ever slept on Thank you Westbridge see you again 
152944,The Westbridge Hotel, I didn t like the fact that my partner accidentally left his bracelet on the side of the bathroom sink in plain view for all to see and when we returned to ask if it has been handed in it hadn t even though the room had been unoccupied since we had left at midday This meant the only people who had been in the room after us had been the cleaners or another member of staff We were outraged to find that a sentimental piece of jewlerry had actually been stolen by a member of hotel staff We are both disgusted with how this happened when you are supposed to be a reputable hotel We definitely will not be returning and certainly will not be recommending this thieving institute to anybody else , Breakfast
152945,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, Really nice hotel Staff very friendly and decorated modern Located a short walk away from Westfield and transport links Rooms ok size and everything needed for s comfortable stay The only thing I didn t enjoy is the hard pillows but that s my own preference for a feather pillow Saying that though the bed linen way lovely and crisp Would Definately stay here again
152946,The Westbridge Hotel, Checking in and offloading cases was difficult as there was nowhere nearby to leave the car even for five minutes , Friendliness of staff Cleanliness of room and restaurant Breakfast appetising with a wide range of options Whole hotel stay was an enjoyable experience
152947,The Westbridge Hotel, As an suggestion the rooms should be changed from the current flor to something other than the actual like an flooting floor to be cleaner , Very clean and confort the location to the subway and other facilities its great 
152948,The Westbridge Hotel, We wanted to stay long term each week for about 1 year but the hotel would not do a deal etc, The location is very good for the work we carry out at Stratford market depot Tubelines
152949,The Westbridge Hotel, The rooms are abit on the small size and the pillows were really difficult to sleep on since they were too big, I liked the overall look of the hotel it was very modern
152950,The Westbridge Hotel, Nothing really, The room although relatively small was well apportioned with all the facilities you could need I absolutely loved the bathroom especially the shower Being a non pork eater I loved the fact that the hotel was halal and no pork products were on the menu 
152951,The Westbridge Hotel, Would be nice if the hotel had its own parking which would allow customers to have free parking , Hotel was nice and clean friendly staff breakfast facilities and varieties Lovely hotel with a lot to offer enjoyed my stay 
152952,The Westbridge Hotel, There was no bar no alcohol Halal hotel typically written in the small print as advertising on the main section page about the hotel would put many guests off Rooms were too small and the air con was rubbish and very noisy Couldn t open windows so no fresh air in the room Shower kept going from hot to cold continuously , Nice looking room and ideal location to o2 arena of where we were spending the evening Staff were friendly 
152953,The Westbridge Hotel, Reading lamps did not work and tv did not work after 1 hour of use as it kept freezing was unable to retrieve wifi password because of this Breakfast was not included and I was charged a deposit I was not notified about prior to my arrival as I chose to pay by cash and not card , Nice room comfortable bed clean tidy and well presented Tea making facilities and toiletries
152954,The Westbridge Hotel, The air conditioning u didn t know how to use it , The service provided by the team we and my partner really did appreciate it although the food should have a lot more of a variety and how to use facilities should ve been explained 
152955,The Westbridge Hotel, I arrived 9 15 due to traffic problems This is a 4 star hotel therefore I would have expected a little more understanding from the waiter in the restaurant and kitchen staff in trying to get something to eat I only needed a simple bar meal not 5 course s with wine , The balcony room was lovely and the quirky layout of the whole hotel is clever and well done 
152956,The Westbridge Hotel, It was lovely to have new bedding but the pillows were a bit hard Could you offer a softer grade And the toilet brush holder in our bathroom had some rather dubious looking liquid in the bottom , Very welcoming reception staff We were upgraded so although we couldn t sit out on our balcony due to awful weather we had wonderful views I never thought that if like plastic greenery but it was a really clever way to disguise concrete walls on the first floor 
152957,The Westbridge Hotel, Nothing , Everything Clean modern private hotel Arrived to a room covered with rose petals for our romantic break which was not asked for but provided The staff are excellent and location is a 5 min walk to Stratford station which has direct access to Westminster and central London Can t fault it at all Will stay here whenever we visit
152958,The Westbridge Hotel, The wardrobe wouldn t open 1 bedside lamp didn t work Couldn t control room temperature reception had to do The lounge door was banging fire alarm went off in the morning and didn t see any notice about it being a drill, Everything
152959,The Westbridge Hotel, Nothing, Only 10 mins to Central London On tube Staff are very welcoming Room was compact but well appointed Bed was super comfy and bathroom was spotless It is less than 10 minutes walk to Stratford bus underground and train stations and Westfield shopping centre which has excellent shopping and eating facilities I visit London on a regular basis and will definitely be back 
152960,The Westbridge Hotel, Nothing, Very friendly staff and received a complimentary upgrade Room was well equipped and very clean Close to Westfields and the Olympic Park would definitely stay here again and or recommend 
152961,The Westbridge Hotel, Just a personal thing for me The pillows were too firm and thick My husband on the other hand loved them, The hotel was easy to find and very close to the station The room was very comfortable and quiet 
152962,The Westbridge Hotel, Arrived back to hotel after an evening out 11pm and was unable to get a coffee nightcap in the lounge restaurant area we were informed that facility stopped at 10 pm which felt rather early for a hotel, Friendly staff and warm welcome very clean and modern interior in fact the frontage doesn t do it justice Received a complimentary upgrade to a very nice room perfect location for our needs velodrome and shopping areas Big thank you to all the staff who helped make our stay an enjoyable one
152963,The Westbridge Hotel, the bathroom was tiny with cracked floor tiles Very noisey outside room Doors banging all night which made it difficult to sleep , Very polite staff Late check out time Free upgrade to a suite which was very comfortable and plush apart from 
152964,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, Would recommend this hotel to anyone Remarkable price for location and facilities easy access to central London Walk from Stratford Westfield Bedroom and bathroom exceptional condition really comfortable and cosy Staff couldn t be more helpful felt really at ease with reception staff Would stay again
152965,The Westbridge Hotel, The restaurant staff could have looked more approachable and welcoming The parking facility well there is none very disappointing and extortionatley highly priced , The reception staff were fantastic and welcoming excellent service with a smile The rooms were small but well designed and very comfortable Very pleasant hotel to stay I would recommend this to my friends
152966,The Westbridge Hotel, The only thing that wasn t too clear on the website is that they don t sell alcohol but we didn t mind too much Also no bacon sausages for breakfast this is clear on website , Very comfy bed curtains blocked the light out and it was cosy Good shower nice white towels and staff were very friendly and helpful
152967,The Westbridge Hotel, specifically requested a quiet room during the booking unfortunately the access door to the patio stayed unlock with guest smoking and talking out loud near the window of our room on top of that the food was cold so the hotel offers to give us a 20 discount instead they charged our room twice The level of amateurism in this hotel goes beyond anything we experienced so far as frequent travellers ,No Positive
152968,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, The staff were so happy and helpful going above and beyond to ensure our stay was brilliant We spent Christmas eve in the westbridge and Christmas morning The staff made an exception for us to do a turn down service in the evening the room was fantastic breakfast was a lot better than I had expected with so much to choose from I would most definitely return again and stay in a junior suite again the value for money was amazing and the towels were so fluffy Thanks again to all at the westbridge 
152969,The Westbridge Hotel, I wish there was another one in a more central London location , Everything from customer service to cleanliness to a very high standard Love the lounge 
152970,The Westbridge Hotel, No suitable food No drink Small room Unsuitable if not I T savvy Very poor value and cold unfriendly atmosphere Nowhere to charge phone , Location
152971,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is located only fifteen minutes away from Stratford station which is perfect for people doing sightseeing Stratford has the Jubille line which takes you through every main attraction in London therefore I couldn t suggest a better hotel to stay at when visiting this city 
152972,The Westbridge Hotel, bedrooms a little small breakfast ran out and took a long time to be replenished, rooms very clean beds comfortable Close to great shopping amenities
152973,The Westbridge Hotel, The evening meal wasn t the best The food was a bit bland the Christmas turkey dinner was dry and the Christmas pudding was almost as solid as a brick The breakfast however the next morning was lovely , I thought that the hotel was very good value for money I booked a twin room and was offered a double room at no extra charge for my own comfort which I thought was lovely The room was exactly as appeared on the internet photos and I was impressed by the computer system you can access through the television which allows you to control the heating lighting access the TV controls alarm clock and internet etc The staff were very friendly and helpful and couldn t do enough for you I needed to print a lot of documents to take to court with me the next day and they offered to do that for me and or said I was able to do that in the guest lounge and to say that was probably an usual request the staff were more than accommodating 
152974,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location comfortable clean rooms including all facilities Staff were very helpful and kind and the food was delicious Overall a lovely experience 
152975,The Westbridge Hotel, We left items in the room and when called the next day to collect items staff told us that certain items could not be found I wouldn t recommend leaving anything in the rooms as obviously staff can not be trusted and will lie through there teeth This is the only reason I would not stay here again Very disappointed, The rooms are very well facilitated and good value for money Location was spot on as it is right near Stratford station 
152976,The Westbridge Hotel, Some of the bathroom floor tiles were cracked and wobbled a bit when we walked on them But everything else in the hotel was perfect The only other pointer is that the parking staff from the bingo next door where we park was unhappy we paid the old rate for parking by going to reception rather than paying the new amounts on the pay machine increased by 30 this isnt anything the hotel can change , Second time we visited this hotel and loved it just as much The rooms are so modern and the toiletries are high range The hotel staff were aware it was our anniversary and they kindly upgraded us to a suite room free of charge We re very thankful for this and was so amazing to check in to that surprise when we arrived after a stressful time driving through london 
152977,The Westbridge Hotel, The desk in the room didn t have a chair which made working was less than convenient , The location close to the Copper Box Arena was excellent The breakfast was good value for money 
152978,The Westbridge Hotel, Road was slightly loud outside the room although not too bad and shower for roll top bath room caused a bit of flooding as shower curtain did not go all the way round Otherwise amazing hotel , Lovely room bath and staff Room was very well presented and had a personal touch and made special perfect did stance from station helpful staff They even went to the trouble of purchasing a drinks on my behalf 
152979,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, Hotel close to DLR which is 2 minutes away from Stratford station so great for getting into central London Also close to Stratford shopping centre and Westfield shopping centre Lovely breakfast 
152980,The Westbridge Hotel, The room was a bit to warm for my liking and the thermostat would only turn down as far as 18 deg C so I woke up a little stuffy the following morning not a serious criticism just my preference really , The hotel is within comfortable walking distance of Stratford Westfield and Stratford domestic railway station from where trains run into central London central line and down to the O2 jubilee line the Olympic park and Olympic stadium are also walking distance but far enough away that you are not effected by noise or the hustle of crowds 
152981,The Westbridge Hotel, Gave me a room that had no Lights working then the maintainance guy checks out the room and wants me to leave whilst my wife is there what a joke of a staff, The room are always nice
152982,The Westbridge Hotel, Nothing really The only minor downside is that there can sometimes be some noise from the road but not every time It was a problem when I stayed in the superior room but never an issue in the standard rooms , I absolutely love this hotel The staff are brilliant and friendly the decor is beautiful and the rooms are incredibly comfortable and cosy I stay here frequently due to this Feel very much at home
152983,The Westbridge Hotel, i ended up staying 2 night the 2nd night I had initially booked first The 1st night i booked on the fly when i required it all that was available was a twin room For some reason even though I had booked a double room way in advance for the 2nd night these had somehow been overbooked Shame as everything else had been spot on , Very comfortable room and great location close to Westfield
152984,The Westbridge Hotel, Only one small thing Breakfast was OK but wasn t too sure about chicken sauages and bacon What s wrong with the real thing , Very clean with friendly staff Good location for Olympic stadium and Westfield shopping centre 
152985,The Westbridge Hotel, Unfortunately there was no swimming pool but the small gym was excellent and adequate for a short trip it had all equipment and I had the whole gym to myself nearly all of the time I spent in there which was brilliant , Brilliant location very clean friendly and polite staff that couldn t do enough for you the large balcony I had was also excellent and a real luxury It was great to be able to get to the Excel in such a short amount of time and with the Westfields Shopping Centre nearby you were spoiled for choice with places to eat out or something to do in the evening Somewhere I would definitely stay again 
152986,The Westbridge Hotel, No complaints, Clean comfortable and beautifully decorated rooms with extra touches like the welcome message on tv own wifi and the light control through the tv Staff at desk ultra polite and friendly too

152990,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, Very comfortable modern helpful staff everything of good quality great location for visiting Olympic Park venues Would definitely stay here again 
152991,The Westbridge Hotel,No Negative, Pleasant hotel situated close to public transport links into London and to the Westfield Centre at Stratford Comfortable bed and well appointed room Very good value for a London hotel 
152992,The Westbridge Hotel, The tv reception was very bad but we were only there for one night so it wasn t huge and we reported it to reception the next morning , Great hotel and within walking distance of the railyway tube station making it very good value for money 
152993,The Westbridge Hotel, Nothing , Hotel was beautiful We was upgraded to a suite which was amazing and the room was massive Staff were very friendly and helpful and let us store our bags at the hotel after we left the hotel to go shopping 10 10 will be back 
152994,The Westbridge Hotel, Although it didn t bother us it would be better if they highlighted the fact this is a halal hotel no bar no pork this was no obvious at time of booking which might impact some peoples enjoyment At check in a deposit was requested although when we paid cash upfront I booked the hotel in my name my ID is in my married name I am now separated and this caused hassle and embarrassment My new partner was with me when we checked in and it was mentioned out loud at reception that I had 2 names and I really don t think this is necessary I found this really frustrating and embarrassing They had payment and an ID what more was required I felt like I had committed a crime , Nice room nice shower and free wifi and perfect location for Stratford station 
152995,The Westbridge Hotel, The small room toilet and low ceiling The stairs to the room was very narrow Would not recommend someone who is old or with mobility issue The miniature toilet could barely fit one person There is excessive furniture in the room too , Modern facility the tv and room control is good and chic The lounge area is great too spacious and well decorated
152996,The Westbridge Hotel, Accessibility of hotel on busy road Difficult to reach to find out where to park then to park across the road and then haul bags to reception to check in , Clean good size rooms and bathroom Staff friendly and helpful Good location 
152997,The Westbridge Hotel, Air conditioning noisy at times Duvet only just the same width as the bed so although it was fine for one person in a double bed it would have not covered two people , Friendly staff both on the phone and in person Nice touches for the price Quiet 
152998,The Westbridge Hotel, Good experience with the hotel but I believe the double booking was an error with booking com as I did not receive a confirmation e mail for the first booking best regards Andrew Keenan, There was an error in the booking I did not get a confirmation so I thought the booking had not gone through so I booked again I got 1 e mail confirmation but when I arrived there were 2 bookings Manager arranged to move 1 booking to another date 
152999,The Westbridge Hotel, None, The staff were very friendly and helpful the room was nice and clean The location was also just 10minute walk from the Westfield so was great for my shopping too 
153000,The Westbridge Hotel, Friend commented on the lack of TV guide , The staff were very friendly and the Hotel itself looked very nice inside The room was fantastic nice beds good TV excellent drink facilities and clean bathroom 
153001,The Westbridge Hotel, TV satalite was really bad had to pay 3 for an on demand film just to be able to watch TV , The decor in the hotel room was beautiful Location was also very good 
153002,The Westbridge Hotel, Noisy neighbours but this wasn t the fault of the hotel , Lovely clean rooms mordern facilities helpful staff and good location Good value for money especially for London 
153003,The Westbridge Hotel, Tiny bathroom At 6ft 3in it made for an interesting experience The fact that this a Halal hotel should be advertised more prominently prior to booking , Lovely room
153004,The Westbridge Hotel, the room was spotless but spoilt by failure to clean shower door hinges at base Scum accumulation Get white vinegar and toothbrush and fix , Really well presented professional helpful staff 
153005,The Westbridge Hotel, Nothing really but some might find the overhead shower with no shower cap provided a problem Also an iron good but no ironing board that I could see But I m being picky here I m sure they would have provided one if I d asked , Everything about the hotel was a lovely surprise very stylish Comfortable bed with plump pillows Safe Big TV screen Excellent choice at breakfast Free Wi Fi that worked in the rooms Bottles of water Newspapers Good price for London 
153006,The Westbridge Hotel, The hotel is located just next to the main street and there is lot of noise from the street coming to the room even during night , The suite was very nice and the hotel personal was also great 
153007,The Westbridge Hotel, shower water is bit weak not warm enough but still bearable hotel location is a little bit far away from city center if u r concerning about the traveling cost time however still within an acceptable range , small but lovely clever designed hotel with friendly staff Easy access to tube system 
153008,The Westbridge Hotel, When I was there the hotel had a little trouble with the elevator and I had to carry my heavy luggage to the 3rd floor It was only out for a short time Room was a little small but still adequate for everything I needed , Modern hotel All seemed to be upgraded from the shower to the light controls Perfect feather bed Excellent breakfast Excellent condition and friendly staff Very close to public transportation 
153009,The Westbridge Hotel, My particular room was very small which wasn t a major problem for me but it was a real squeeze just walking around the bed This was an end corner room , Very nice modern hotel with friendly staff Breakfast was also very good Would definitely recommend

153011,The Westbridge Hotel, Only downside I had was the room we were in was beautiful but right on Stratford high street so the road noise was a problem for me Could probably do with getting some double glazed windows to sound proof , This is a lovely hotel situated just 5 mins from Stratford station so easy to get into London Centre Staff were very friendly and welcoming and even put balloons into our room as we were celebrating a special birthday 
153012,The Westbridge Hotel, My only quibble was breakfast it was a fairly good selection but it is a halal hotel so no pork is served in case this is an issue for you but I thought 12 50 per person was a bit pricy as it wasn t included in our rate However this aside we had a great stay and would definitely stay here again , What a LOVELY hotel We stayed for 2 nights it was beautifully decorated very clean and the staff were really welcoming I called for an ironing board and had to wait a while for it to be brought to our room shortly afterwards they sent us up a fruit platter and a note apologising for the wait which I thought was really nice

153015,The Westbridge Hotel, Had a good experience Things to improve on Hotel facade is unattractive A c was problematic in my room The standard room is overcrowded with heavy dark furniture The net curtains were off colour, Liked the courtyard in a busy city area Also the small size of the hotel appealed As above the staff was friendly efficient Free Wifi throughout Location was super for the QE Olympic Park
