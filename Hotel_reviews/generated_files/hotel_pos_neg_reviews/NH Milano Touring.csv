491749,NH Milano Touring, Nothing, All the staff from front desk security restaurant housekeeping were all courteous warm and professional Loved the tea selection in the room Breakfast spread was amazing and the restaurant staff were all extremely pleasant 
491750,NH Milano Touring, all the staff are completely rude I arrived and had to take my own bags to my room which the reception staff told me the wrong floor i gave them the benefit of the doubt they were having a off day so the next day I asked what was the easiest way and which tram or train to catch to get to the Duomo and they suggested a taxi or the underground and when I asked in which direction the undergound was they eyerolled and then told me Third day I asked if they could ring me a taxi as I was going to Navigli district and still hadn t understood how the metro underground so I thought I would get a taxi the staff didn t know I spoke italian also and made a comment about me which I replied and they were very stunned for a 4 star Hotel I have had better and nicer service in 2 star Hotels ,No Positive

491752,NH Milano Touring, The receptionist Vanessa didn t give good advice to get to Malpensa Airport she suggested a taxi for 110 if paying by card or 100 cash We later noted on hotel handout the 50min coach service from Milan Central station which was superb and cost 20 for all 3 of us , Modern conference type hotel located not far from Milan Central train station Metro tube station nearby two stops from Duomo 1 50 return ticket Good breakfast choice 
491753,NH Milano Touring, I arrived and checked in at 11am and I got my room ready at 3pm , Services are Very professional The room is big and clean They have also early breakfast from 4am that is good for early morning leave

491756,NH Milano Touring, The coffee area in the bedroom was absolutely covered in dust To the point where I picked something up off it and it all blew off Went to make a coffee and the water holder at the back of the machine had all old water marks inside almost looked moldy There was just generally a lot of dust in the room and quite a bit around the floor area bathroom etc Toilet also smelt like stale wee but didn t look dirty Also didn t like that there wasn t a supermarket near by , The beds were very comfy very nice modern room Staff very very friendly It s a shame about the dust etc because it would of been perfect But as someone who has OCD it knocked me sick 3 of us stayed in there we paid 60 each for 1 night The rooms in general are lovely Just a shame they hadn t been cleaned properly

491760,NH Milano Touring, Unfortunately the information about the Parking facilities at the hotel was ehm misleading to say the least We decided to go there by car as I relied on the information provided by Booking com that among the list of the hotel facilities there was parking as well I drove for almost six hours from central Europe only to find out upon arrival that there is no hotel parking but some third party parking space around 300 m from the hotel The hotel stuff reacted immediately to my complaint and I received their apologies for the trouble together with a room upgrade On the evening of the second day and when we returned to our room I even found an apologizing letter from the hotel manager and a treat waiting there An email from him was sent as well stating their will to correct the information For me that would be the most important thing to do It is about transparency and trust , The overall experience at the hotel was good considering that we were looking for a comfortable but not expensive hotel close to the center In this respect NH Touring hotel in Milano met our expectations 
491761,NH Milano Touring, I didnt like the fact that although initially it was writting on booking free cancelation after you booked it you coundnt cancel without paying the full amount Also they charger me twice for the room and nobody told me until i called them The money are not back in the account for at least 10 15 days from the ti e i left the accomodation and nobody apologized for that either Poor staff treatment,No Positive

491822,NH Milano Touring, So many guests and only two staff on te reception desk Almost always you have to wait in the queue 15 00 check in time was very uncomfortable If your flight arrives in the morning you have to wait for a long time The room was clean but the floor was a bit dusty, Very nice well decorated and cosy room Bed linen was just brilliant Tea and coffee facilities even a coffe machine are available in the room Complimentary bottled water teabags cofee Good mini bar Very goor and modernly designed bathroom Lots of towels Bathrobe and slippers Very nice shampoo shower gel and cosmetics with fantastic flavour Wi fi was available in the room Internet was very fast Hotel staff provided us on the front desk by our request with connectivity pack portable wi fi router so we had an Internet connection even on walking around the city
491823,NH Milano Touring, Staff neither motivated nor helpful at all queues at all the times at the reception poor toiletries no reason why not to provide a cheap toothbrush room booked and paid for 2 people but equipped for 1 pax Last but not least slowest elevator ever We stayed at 9th floor and took 10 mins 10mins every single time to go up Not acceptable , Location close to tube station breakfast was below expectations but ok
491824,NH Milano Touring, We felt the dinner menu could have had a couple more choices , With 3 women travelling we requested 3 separate beds and we were very comfortable with our room set up The breakfast buffet was excellent gave us a great start to our busy days The staff was excellent 
491825,NH Milano Touring, The fact I had four people but would not let us all stay in one room although it had 2 singles 1 double we had to pay for another room for one bed one person that was not needed , The cleanliness decoration of hotel room
491826,NH Milano Touring, Room service food was not as expected Can be way better Spaghetti with tomato sauce was bland Didn t get more than 3 spoonful Breakfast buffet was great Maximillano gave great service , Bathroom is the best we have ever seen in all our tours in Europe Not only with amenities but with function and usefulness Rooms and beds are very clean and comfortable Comforters are quite soft clean and changed Yes 
491827,NH Milano Touring, Unfortunately the view from my window was a whole load of ventilation pipes which was awful and made room a little claustrophobic , Hotel lovely right beside metro Staff friendly and helpful Breakfast large selection of everything Rooms lovely comfortable and spotlessly clean 
491828,NH Milano Touring, Hotel obviously had arrangements with restaurants in Milan We asked them for recomandations and the places they sent us to did not fit our requests This happened twice during our stay We wanted to dress up and go to some kind of sky bar they sent us to a cheap bistro We thought it was a misunderstanding and tried again the next night they sent us to a slightly better place two doors down from the bistro I mean come on this was not by accident Morale look up Your own restaurants Otherwise friendly and accomodating staff , Good location Good breakfast Accomodating staff 
491829,NH Milano Touring, Very slow free internet Property did not have a triple room upon Arrival My daughter had to sleep on a small loveseat No change to room rate or discount for inconvenience or mistake Room was tiny , Convenient to train stations Quiet room Bellman was was great 
491830,NH Milano Touring, The staff were not very friendly and their advice in terms of local facilities was not helpful often it was wrong We ordered food for room service and when this was delivered it was cold and not very appetising The cost for this was sky high and the staff forgot to bring some of what was ordered For what I paid I do not feel i go value for money I have been in much better 4 star hotels that have gyms and pools etc When I booked this I was of the impression breakfast was not included as I do not like to be constricted to one area In actual fact the breakfast was horrible and on our last day we ate somewhere else There was nothing major that made this stay particularly unpleasant but for a city break the atmosphere and general vibe within the hotel was not conjucive to a leisurely break Overall staff attitude and knowledge was poor , The hotel was clean and fit for purpose There is a little coffee shop around the corner where the food is reasonable and the dfood is delicious Highly recommend this 
491831,NH Milano Touring, Would have preferred to have a selection of Indian cuisine in the Restaurant menu, The place was really clean We had the view of the church from the window and it was soothing to wake up every morning to the chime of the church bells
491832,NH Milano Touring, Breakfast low quality and most products came straight out of their cardboard boxes packaging the only food that was really fresh were the boiled eggs and bacon and croissant The food would be plenty full if you were a skinny model visiting the milan fashion week Rooms very small for 2 persons with VERY limited space to move around Price one week before we arrived the price was 150 euro lower both booking com and the hotel would not adjust the price Staff only very few people actually smiled Elevator the elevator is pretty outdated and is very small , Location very close to Duomo apr 10 minute walk 
491833,NH Milano Touring, Internet connection on the 5th floor was not always good It would have been nice to have a better selection of bar food We came home from the opera hungry and only had the choice of toasted sandwiches , The breakfast was very good and varied The only criticism is that the fried food bacon sausage and scrambled eggs were a bit cold Very pleasant helpful staff 
491834,NH Milano Touring, We ate one dinner in the restaurant dining room We had a drink and the complimentary appetizers in the bar that we appreciated The restaurant menu we thought was limited and we were disappointed with our burgers Service was fine but the food quality was not to our expectation , We requested 3 separate beds and they were excellent Breakfast was very nice and staff were very helpful 
491835,NH Milano Touring, Can t think of anything we didn t like We were very impressed with the service the staff and our whole stay , I would definitely stay here again It s a little outside the central part 10 15 minutes walk which was perfect for us as we had no city noises keeping us up at night so we slept really well Arrival Speedy booking in despite other customer reviews We were upgraded very pleasant surprise Hotel reception very friendly and informative staff Room spacious modern very clean expected to be clean but it doesn t hurt to point this out for other guests Certainly adequate for 3 adults sharing I chose to sleep on the sofa bed very comfortable and good night s sleep Mini bar Didn t use however can advise the charges are reasonable for Italy as they reflect many restaurant charges for the same products Breakfast 7am to 10am on Sunday they serve until midday although we were out and about by this time but useful to know for those that like a lie in Great choice and they constantly top up and they accommodate you if you have allergies just let the staff know Choice The usual continental Sausages bacon eggs scrambled or boiled fellow Brits no baked beans if you feel you need them hahaha but really on holiday you can do without these for a few days Cereals yoghurts cheeses cold sliced meat selection salad bowls spoilt for choice when it comes to bread croissants plenty of condiments also fruit fresh fruit juices hot bevarages Could not go wrong to be fair Location For us it was just right We could walk everywhere and the Republica metro station is nearby Use Republica not Turati Just be careful as there are numerous exits and it s a little confusing at first to get your bearings We used the Barclays Bank as our landmark Handy as walking does get tiring when it s hot and humid Plus the hotel is walking distance or metro stop ride from Barigaldi Station which for us was good as from here we took the train to Lake Como for the day 
491836,NH Milano Touring, The hotel staff was very bad and unprofessional which I didn t expect from NH group We got Superior room but they gave us the worst room with the view of the place they keep garbage and not even in the same floor and very noisy The woman at reception was so listless and didn t wanna help with anything also the women who stands in front of breakfast hall with the name of Paola was so impolite and nerves and baffle in everything that was none of her business So so bad rethink about your choose they don t worth it at all A one or two star hotel will be very very better than this ,No Positive
491837,NH Milano Touring, They would not supply and iron to the room and we had to go to a room by reception to iron This would be OK if you only stayed 1 night but after 5 days it was awkward , Location good Great staff 
491838,NH Milano Touring, We were given upper floor on our request to give us the room with the panoramic view and change the previous room which views durty stairs and roof The new room at the upper floor was uncomfortable Although we were arranged to see the room before giving us that room however we would have expected that we were warned that it was mansard actually and during hot daytime it gets very hot It was so hot in the room that air conditioner could not cool the room Although we told that we are elderly having high blood pressure In addition we were confused with the so called double room with single use room I payed for this double room but in order to register my husband I was requested to pay additional fee for him If I pay for the double room doesn t that mean one person could be registered for free Why additional fee to register him her for the double room which was already payed This was really annoying ,No Positive

491845,NH Milano Touring, Water from the bathroom ceiling dripped down to our floor had to pack up and move into another room Closet was not clean and for a 4 star hotel I could not even get a water kettle Four light switches were broken and had to be repaired Just not up to standard for a 4 star hotel , The fact that I at least received a 25 discount on my stay for all the deficiencies 
491846,NH Milano Touring, Free WiFi in the room basically did not work properly so you need to go to the reception area For enhanced WiFi you have to pay 10 euros per day extra Shower half door design is no good with water splashing onto the floor outside tub , Breakfast was quite good

491851,NH Milano Touring,No Negative, The location of this hotel was excellent I had the best three nights sleep and the breakfast was varied and plentiful The breakfast staff were particularly attentive Just a hint the cue for breakfast is quite long after 9 15am An absolute bonus was being able to use the hotels bicycles for free Cruising around Milan was great fun and we found our way to the Duomo Galleria and some lovely parks in no time Highly recommend this busy but efficient hotel

491856,NH Milano Touring, I would recommend more variety at breakfast The choise was pretty poor Either the coffee machine or the coffe bun was not good because the cappuccino I tried was the worst Considering that it is Italy and you can taste the best coffee ever One of the staff a guy members at reception was quite rude We were waiting for quite a time looking for some1 to help us with our bags and he made a look he didn t notice us The hotel is situated quite far away from the city center though close to a metro stop , The room was a good size pretty clean with a big size bathroom

491883,NH Milano Touring,No Negative, We were denied to get a room on our first night in NH said some electricity problems but i guess it was overbooking and we were hosted by a more far distant NH hotel neverthess the hotel did its best to let us forget this unfortunate start and we are grateful for it
491884,NH Milano Touring, Only 2 baby chairs for such a big hotel A lot of parents had to have their small children on their lap The breakfast was nice but no where near as it is presented on the homepage , Nice room and a nice bathroom friendly staff Location very good with public transport near by 
491885,NH Milano Touring, There is a strong odor of sewer gas in the lobby The smell is most offensive in the morning , We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this property The rooms were clean and comfortable and we looked forward to breakfast each morning If management would fix the plumbing then this place would be perfect

491889,NH Milano Touring, WiFi is slow and for faster internet you have to pay extra per day Too much waiting at reception , Many rooms have floor boards and no carpets which is perfect for people who are allergic to dust carpet detergents and perfumes Staff are kind and go out of their way to please and accommodate the customer Beds are very comfortable 
491890,NH Milano Touring, Accidentally charged my credit card with the city tax for one person and asked me last day to pay city tax for both my wife and me It took 3 4 minutes to realize their fault and everything was clarified , Although we didn t ask extra bed for our 9y kid they upgraded our double room to suite without any additional charge Amazing breakfast and excellent location 2 min from Repubblica metro station and 7min from Natural history museum

491898,NH Milano Touring, It says that this hotel has got a sun terrace on your website When asking the hotel staff they said they had never had a sun terrance and that booking com made things up on your website sometimes Very weird to both me and my partner , Clean rooms helpful staff 
491899,NH Milano Touring, Hope to be equipped with an electric water kettle and easy pack of coffee or tea , Not so far from the railway station and famous Duomo Room was well cleaned breakfast was good 
491900,NH Milano Touring, They do not have their own car parking so we had to use a local car park at 15 euros a day , The staff were always very helpful and took their time with questions They also all spoke very good English which we appreciated The buffet breakfast was very good The location is great as it is a short distance from a Metro station only 4 stops from Duomo and also Tram Only one stop from Centrale
491901,NH Milano Touring, The reception staff were ok but we found the bar staff particularly unhelpful and quite rude The hotel maids start really early in the morning and are very loud They did not wait after knocking before walking into the room Before we had even made it down to breakfast one morning we had a maid walk into our room three times before we had chance to say we were still in there and ask her to come back later In an online description that we had read it stated there was a roof terrace yet we were told by hotel staff that there wasn t one despite the fact that we could see what looked like a roof terrace from the view from our room The breakfast and location are ok but all in all a very disappointing stay and certainly not value for money Some of the two star hotels we stayed in during our trip to Italy were better than this one ,No Positive

491904,NH Milano Touring, The shower in the bathroom was very hot and for some reason we were not able to reduce the temperature , The staff was very courteous and helpful They even upgraded us to a junior suite The hotel is about 15 minutes walk to Milan central station and if taking a taxi from the hotel it is under 10 
491905,NH Milano Touring, Mistaken booking , I liked the fact that staff helped us with the Booking com incorrect booking We could have faced real difficulty because the booking had gone through as 2 adults and 1 child when we had 2 children We had to pay more for a junior suite but the hotel gave this to us at a reduced rate 
491906,NH Milano Touring, only one english channel news so had to pay for extra wifi to stream entertainment 2 single beds no robe in room not in centre but good location for my meeting , great reception staff room clean room service food was nice
491907,NH Milano Touring, The hotel did not exchange money The only thing that was lacking , The location is great 15 min walk from the train station and 25 minute walk to the cathedral right next to a park The hotel was clean and newly renovated and modern The brreakfast buffet was fabulous Lots of selection of cheese fruit and breads Would stay there again 
491908,NH Milano Touring, Room service claimed to be 24hr but when we ordered the kitchen was closed so limited choice, Clean modern close to metro and walkable to city centre 
491909,NH Milano Touring, WiFi is free for all guests there was an incorrect information that it is a benefit for me as Genius traveler In addition it was slow and unstable Usually 50kbps max 400kbps , Very comfy room upgraded for free with an extra bed for our child Location is great 20 minutes by walk to Duomo or 3 metro stops Breakfast was very rich everyone finds what he likes Staff was very friendly and helpful 
491910,NH Milano Touring, Not enough information about the hotel facilities in the room Male receptionists 2 were not very amicable Room service food was poor with dry burnt pizza Breakfast was just average Wifi was atrocious Free wifi only worked for short periods and even upgraded paid wifi was very poor With a business to run it was frustrating and well below average Room was cold and temperature couldn t be adjusted and it was May not even Winter , Room bed and bathroom were excellent Rooms were cleaned to a very high standard Breakfast staff and female receptionists were pleasant When there were problems with room these were attended to quickly although in regard to wifi they were never solved Intention was good but no satisfactory result
491911,NH Milano Touring, Location parking staff, Decent hotel but staff aren t very friendly Location is ok however for what you pay I d expect to be little more central FYI if you are driving your own car or rental be prepared to pay 22 euros at a parking garage nearby The hotel advert on booking com is not clear on the extra charges associated if you require parking 
491912,NH Milano Touring,No Negative, Friendly helpful staff central location close to the major places of interest comfortable decent sized room excellent breakfast choices 
491913,NH Milano Touring, Nothing to mention, Everything was fine convenient location in walking distance from the main train station delicious and variety of breakfast cleanness in room good Wi Fi connection On the top of that i want to emphasize the friendly and very supportive staff at the reception desk and during the breakfast We received the detailed advises on convenient restaurants for dinner and it was really delicious and fit for purpose Many thanks for that Hotel is highly recommended for all visitors of Milan 
491914,NH Milano Touring, Diner at famous Grabd Hotel Milano Restaurante Don Carlos 1 Food nicely done but tasteless 2 service very arrogant we spent more then EUR 350 ribb off, Loation by tram No 1 in minutes to Duomo Scala Opera you can buy balcony tickets for EUR 25 directly via internet 5th floor

491916,NH Milano Touring, There should be a private room for breakfast for adults only as too noisy, The receptionists were more than helpful and soooo patient and so professional and polite and spoke perfect English
491917,NH Milano Touring, Not much English language TV channel to watch unfortunately, room size hotel cleanness location price Modern room furniture and nice double bed Room had sofa bed also so great for kids to stay

491919,NH Milano Touring, The aircon heater was too noisy for me No extra blanket There was nowhere to put our suitcases and the floor area was quite small , Breakfast was excellent Bed and pillows comfy The room had a bath and shower 
491920,NH Milano Touring, If we had had a better view from our window, The hotel is situated in a ideal place just outside the main centre but closer enough to enjoy the sites The room we had was lovely even though the view was poor the bed was super amazing 
491921,NH Milano Touring, Early breakfast, Great breakfast one of the best I had during my trips Although so called early breakfast 5 00 7 00 was very very poor almost nothing and no working coffee machine

491926,NH Milano Touring, Extraordinarily bad attitude of staff No smiles whatsoever like what you normally see in every hotel From check in to check out except for one staff girl in restaurant nobody was happy to see us The porter never even bothered to look at us whether we need help with the luggage both during check in or check out , Room n bed were comfy
491927,NH Milano Touring, No complimentary water coffee or tea No porter service offered , Location Location location The staff were friendly and helpful The room comfortable but small that is just relative to what you are used to Breakfast was traditional and tasty

491932,NH Milano Touring, Location is a little bit far from dowtown The place for the breakfast is very noisy espacially on Easter weekend when there was a lot of people Our room on the first floor was sometimes noisy because it was just above the kitchen or something like that and we could hear noise early in the morning and sometimes noise like a hammer , Hotel is nicely decorated and very clean
491933,NH Milano Touring, We had to wait 15 minutes to be seated in the breakfast area as it was to crowded and we had to wait along with other 20 people, The room was very cosy and quiet The location of the hotel is great close to the sights worth seeing and to the central train station as well as a metro station The breakfast was great with a variaty of fresh fruit pastries and eggs 
491934,NH Milano Touring, Coffee was not the best The lift was quite slow so not ideal if you are on a top floor , Rooms nice and modern The location is quite central Breakfast was the best we had in our trip Good selection Friendly and efficient staff

491938,NH Milano Touring, Advertised free Wifi is misleading NH offered two accounts for internet A free but slow too slow for browsing and e mail and a premium for higher speed but at cost of EUR 10 per day I found this disappointing as this is not to be expected from a 4 star hotel in 2016 and also compared to other same star rated hotels Very hot in the room Despite a control unit in the room the heating was controlled centrally We had to manage a lower temperature by opening the window One of the two main elevators servicing 9 guest room floors was out of service for multiple days causing long waiting time , Clean room and very friendly staff Well located on walking distance from Duomo Cathedral Very good soft beds Overall we had a good stay
491939,NH Milano Touring, We had problem with electricity in room 244 which resulted in us being unable to charge phones Also while working out monies between my friends they charged fee to credit card given within booking when I had not agreed to this Felt we were being rushed , Lovely d cor staff friendly
491940,NH Milano Touring, Paid 9 90 eur for WiFi as the free version is bad But There is no differance between the pay primium and the free version A waste of money Very bad to ask 9 90 for such WiFi PEASE DON T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE WIFI IT S THE SAME BAD QUALITY AS THE FREE VERSION NH HOTEL SAME ON YOU ,No Positive
