60909,Au Manoir Saint Germain, We Booked A Triple Room The Third Bed Was An Extremely Uncomfortable Fold Up Camp Bed Which Was Far Too Small For An Adult The Thin Pillow Completely Different To That Provided For The Other Beds Certainly Didn t Help , Receptionist Was Brilliant Extremely Helpful Courteous At All Times Old School Mini Bar No Electronic Nonsense Convenient To Chill Bottled Water
60910,Au Manoir Saint Germain, Extra charged for Museum Pass and Laundry Wash 1 The 2 Days Museum Pass sold by the front desk to me for 55 cash I found out and asked a refund for 17 the extra charge when I checked out yesterday 2 I sent 3 Polo shirts and 2 Cotton pants for Laundry it charged for 81 It had 23 over the price that was told by the front desk But it was counted 3 Cotton pants on the bill and each pants was charged 13 The charge was wrong because each Cotton pants s price is 10 told by the front desk The Shower s temperature was very hot and hurt my son at night on 6 25 1 Even though I turned the holder to the end of the right side I reported 2 times to the front desk then the staff came to the room for adjusting 2 When he came and turned the holder to end of the right side the temperature suddenly down to cold But the water temperature never turn hot after the adjusted even though turn the holder to the end of left side ,No Positive

60913,Au Manoir Saint Germain, Staff is a bit odd and didn t help much The decor is not particularly nice and it felt like the owners didn t hire a proper architect for the renovations but did it themselves Entering the room literally through the bathroom didn t make much sense Safe in bedroom wasn t working , Location is perfect and there s a cab stand just in front of the hotel Bed is comfortable Clean hotel

60916,Au Manoir Saint Germain, this is not my first visit to Paris hotels at which I can check in at any time I reach while in Au manoir Hotel I cannot check in even at 14 00 pm Due to the shortage of cleaning room One of The staff was so bad in communication I will never visit again, the room is comfortable and the location in Saint Germain is so appropriate as other hotels in same area

60928,Au Manoir Saint Germain, If you are a light sleeper request a room away from the front of the hotel The street is an active busy street so there is noise until late in the evening but the view out the front is really nice , Aziz was very accommodating and did his best with our special requests as well as making reservations and recommendations for local restaurants The location of the hotel is perfect within walking distance to everything Very clean and nice decor with comfortable beds

60934,Au Manoir Saint Germain, The only negative I have about this hotel is the first room we got we were shocked that the doors opens to the bathroom directly , The second bedroom we got the cleanliness the location absolutely great the receptionist unfortunately don t remember her name but she was so helpful and made sure that we were happy during our stay Will definitely stay here again 
60935,Au Manoir Saint Germain,No Negative, Everything about this hotel is great Location staff service rooms price quality everyting I will recommend this to every family friends that travel to Paris 
60936,Au Manoir Saint Germain,No Negative, Management and staff were extremely kind and polite Any time spent in Paris makes you brush up on your manners Our room was spacious and quiet even though overlooking the main street across from Cafe Flores Great as a base to explore the great St Germain neighbourhood A charming French hotel The cafes nearby are great for breakfast and historic Brasserie Lipp is right next door having dinner there was an experience the room just gets buzzier as the night progresses Waiters who are so professional they love their work and the restaurant St Germain is a wonderful area 
60937,Au Manoir Saint Germain,No Negative, Location was fabulous in a very vibrant area and metro close The river was just a 5 minute walk away The room decor was lovely full of character and interest 
60938,Au Manoir Saint Germain,No Negative, This hotel is absolutely lovely It is in a great location and was very clean and comfortable The room was very well designed tasteful decor and plenty of room for our things It felt very spacious We had everything we needed The windows opened onto a lovely quiet courtyard The hotel itself is quite small and we liked the cosy boutique feel The staff were lovely really friendly We simply adored it We didn t get around to having breakfast in the hotel but probably should have As we felt a bit ripped off by the cafe directly across the road Highly recommend this lovely hotel and would go back in a heartbeat Thank you for a wonderful and memorable stay for all the right reasons 
60939,Au Manoir Saint Germain, Breakfast choices were adequate but not extensive Also needed a chair for the desk though we moved the lounge chair and added pillows to make it work Provision of lovely big bath left minimal space for the toilet , Location and ambience are superb including shops cafes metro access taxi rank easy walk to many noted locations We had a classic view of Blvd St Germaine Staff are excellent friendly and very knowledgeable about the area 
60940,Au Manoir Saint Germain,No Negative, Spent just one night here with my teenage daughter and we had the best visit Everything about this property including the location the atmosphere the staff ranks very high in my book I will absolutely return 
60941,Au Manoir Saint Germain,No Negative, Good breakfast for 15 euro Excellent customer service They not only answered our questions but asked additional questions of us so they could really get a good solution with regard to dining entertainment and airport options 
60942,Au Manoir Saint Germain,No Negative, Bed was very comfy shower was great pressure walking distance to everywhere great places to eat great places to shop We had a little bit of street noise but our room faced the Main Street Tea and coffee facilities 
60943,Au Manoir Saint Germain, The hotel was not even close to four stars Maybe two but only because of the location The accommodations were very cramped They did not supply wash clothes instead they used disposable clothes much like a Clorox Clean Up You walk directly into the bathroom when up enter the room so if you re in the shower the person entering the room will get a show too The coffee cups weren t washed they both had remnants of a prior guest s lipstick on them as did the teaspoons The water in the coffee pot was left for days without the housekeeping service ever looking at it leaving it with a stale smell and film on it The carpets weren t vacuumed nor were the chair cushions ever fluffed or turned The fabric on the chairs dust ruffle and foot blanket were all worn faded and tattered on the edges And the ultimate worst part of the stay if you could stomach the accommodations was the constant jack hammering that persisted from 7 30 8 00 am until 5 00pm everyday with the exception of Saturday and Sunday which the staff did absolutely nothing about completely disinterested in helping several of the guests dealing with issue and tried to say that moving to another room would be better FYI moving to another room was just as loud as it was in our room and every other room in this hotel we originally tried to cancel our reservation because we had an opportunity to stay in Northern France but the contract that we had through Booking com would not allow us to do so without losing all the money we paid for the 5 night stay Booking com stated that we could ask the hotel for a refund and of course the hotel stated they would keep our prepaid 5 night deposit Well now we know why they couldn t get anyone to take the room if they gave them away coupled with the constant jack hammering It was truly one of the most unfortunate situations when you re on holiday to have to stay at this hotel, Located right on St Germain Blvd 
60944,Au Manoir Saint Germain, Elevator is only big enough for one person and suitcase but I m sure it s hard to retrofit an old building I was glad to have an elevator since we were on 6th floor French tubs are hard to get in and out of due to smallness of bathrooms and height of tub sides but that was true everywhere , Beautiful architecture and location in Saint Germain de Pres Gave me the feeling of Paris that I wanted Very convenient to Metro and famous Cafes Rooms were beautiful and well appointed Loved white linens firm bed was very comfortable Loved the outer door that locked to allow our two corner rooms to become a true family suite Staff was very helpful 
60945,Au Manoir Saint Germain,No Negative, This place is so so charming Aziz along with the entire staff were so helpful kind and professional As an American on her first trip to Paris with my mother and daughter this was magical The hotel is quaint beautifully decorated and in a PRIME location in the St Germain de Pres district We especially loved Cafe Louise just next to the hotel for drinks lunch dinner and sidewalk cafe people watching The room was smaller than American rooms that was a bit of a shock but being that we just needed a clean comfy bed nice towels nice bathroom with products Hotel Au Manoir really served Highly recommend 
60946,Au Manoir Saint Germain, I wouldn t want to be a larger man in the bathroom as the toilette space was so tiny that you would burn your bottom on the lovely hot towel rack on the toilette wall when relieving yourself All in all though a good hotel , Breakfast was great value considering the prices in the local cafes The decor and bedroom were wonderful but quite quite small I would stay again as I love the location and the beds are really comfortable 
60947,Au Manoir Saint Germain, We chose this hotel because of the French provincial look of the rooms We were a bit disappointed Although knowing the rooms in Paris are generally small this room was very small As was the bathroom with the inconvenient placement of the shower and the tub being too high to step into The entire room needed to be refreshed because it was extremely dated unlike the photos on the website The staff at breakfast and maid service was very good however the front desk was not overly welcoming and barely interacted with us which gave us the feeling we were invisible , The location was perfect Walking distance to every major attraction Hotel accommodated our requests Overall the hotel was good 
60948,Au Manoir Saint Germain, Noise in courtyard, Staff especially Aziz was friendly and helpful Location is excellent easy to get anywhete Breakfast good Only negative was the noise We had courtyard facing room and the noise level was awful As it was only for one night I didn t complain but the noise made sleeping tough 
60949,Au Manoir Saint Germain, I like thr room with a view over Boulevard Saint Germain , The room was fantastic the staff extremely helpful and in general the quality of the hotel can only be surpassed by its location which is right at the heart of Paris 
60950,Au Manoir Saint Germain, The bathroom didn t had a door and the shower directly faced the room entry door This could have some embarrassing outcomes , The location was great and the King size bed was so comfortable it guaranteed a good night sleep

60954,Au Manoir Saint Germain, Bathroom was a bit small but it s understandable given the size of the room Just would have liked a bit more elbow room in the toilet area , Great location and friendly staff 
60955,Au Manoir Saint Germain, It s a boutique hotel so if you want extra facilities like a bar gym and spa then this is not for you, Great hotel excellent location and friendly staff
60956,Au Manoir Saint Germain, Could have done with more tea bags in the room The room was slightly smaller than I was expecting , Very helpful and friendly receptionist greeted us on arrival and the location was excellent 
60957,Au Manoir Saint Germain, The first room I was offered was shockingly outdated and shabby and looked dirty There were very few facilities in the general areas small drinks menu Only very bad red or white wine or champagne The carpet in the bedroom needs throwing out Sticky underfoot , The staff were very accommodating and tried very hard to help and please us They were let down by the general condition and lack of facilities of the hotel 
60958,Au Manoir Saint Germain, the cost is slightly high for what u get but probably reflect the perfect location , The location empowers the experience for a perfect vacation in Paris The rooms are small and cosy The staff is very friendly and willing to help 
60959,Au Manoir Saint Germain,No Negative, Room was very comfortable and a good size Shower had massive shower head and running water was always hot Stayed in superior double with a street view Boulevard St Germain was an excellent location with designer shops and restaurants and bars that were good value for money The restaurants recommended by the hotel proved to be excellent and not expensive The hotel provided a very useful handbook with map of the local area identifying restaurants and bars 
60960,Au Manoir Saint Germain, Bathroom in our room a little small but did have the bath we asked for , Fantastic location both for old Paris but also easy access to right bank but much cheaper Easy walk to Notre Dame and Ile de la Cite but also to Louvre Place Vendome and beyond The St Germain district is real Paris

60964,Au Manoir Saint Germain, Perhaps the breakfast could have provided a somewhat wider choice and in a more comfortable setting , Such a wonderful location we have stayed in many hotels in Paris This is the best as far as location is concerned Facilities in the hotel are also good We ll definitely come back

60968,Au Manoir Saint Germain, The Wifi Because it did not work It should not be neccesary to have problems with the Wifi all the time in 2015 We had to go to a cafe to check our mails and everything very difficult when you are at a work trip A little special to have a bathroom without the last wall or a door , Nice staff and perfect location Very good space in the room to be in Paris
60969,Au Manoir Saint Germain, The pillow was lumpy but otherwise comfy , Locality to restaurants was excellent they were really good restaurants too Close to the Lourve a lot of the other major tourist attractions are within 30 40min easy walking distance 
60970,Au Manoir Saint Germain, Breakfast was a little too pricey for my taste but I hear it was wonderful The safe in my room I couldn t get to unlock I had to get help twice I was embarrassed however the receptionist never made me feel bad She was wonderful, We loved everything From the moment we arrived the receptionist welcomed us with genuine greatfulness offering maps and highlighting routes to take Our room was charming and romantic excellent decor with long windows opening to the Paris street below privacy charm and modern amenities Excellent cleaning staff as well All took time to greet us morning or evening Beautiful bed most comfortable we ve stayed in All helped when I couldn t get the safe to work Sweet people inviting us back again and I will definitely stay here every time
