303535,Hotel Lloyd, The air conditioning was awful they changed my room on complain but the new room had the same issue I was sweating in the room and couldn t sleep properly Wi Fi signals were very week and often not available at all The staff hotel policies were very rigid specially at check in and check out The breakfast was OK but 2 times the scrambled egg was not available till 08 00am , Bed was comfortable Room size is reasonable 
303536,Hotel Lloyd,No Negative, Nice hotel very good location until the Duomo is 10 minutes by walk the tram and bus stop are right at the hotel underground 5 minutes walk The room was well cleaned every day friendly staff
303537,Hotel Lloyd, Air conditioning didn t work and carpets were filthy a very depressing hotel in a very depressing location , It could be a nice hotel if refurbished a bit 
303538,Hotel Lloyd, Not that it made any noise but water was running in the shower room 33 all the time , For 120 Euro a quiet airconditioned hotel room single occupancy with a good bed good breakfast just five M3 Metroline stations away from the Central station and one from the Duomo I consider a good deal All staff at the Reception were friendly and helpful 
303539,Hotel Lloyd, very small rooms coffee very bad staff very bad during breakfast they see and count what and how you eat breakfast poor no umbrellas people smoking in nearest rooms 2 stars maximum only for being in center , is near center
303540,Hotel Lloyd, Air conditioner wasn t working It was the worst night during our trip The weather outside was hot and we couldn t sleep The room wasn t clean at all dogs hair was everywhere The check out time was 10 30, Nothing
303541,Hotel Lloyd, I would have liked a proper hairdryer to be in the bedroom the appliance that was in the bathroom seemed to take ages to dry one s hair , In the day of arrival I was greeted by an exceptionally friendly helpful Alberto who couldn t do enough for you 
303542,Hotel Lloyd, The facility is a bit old Rooms are a bit small , We stayed with our 10 months old daughter The hotel staff did their best to comfort us Rooms are clean Breakfast is fair 
303543,Hotel Lloyd, The lady in front desk and inside bedroom was kind of hot, We have a quadruple and big and comfortable It was a little hot inside and could not find AC Room was good and big Clean was good Staff were friendly less the lady who works there was not friendly at all Distance from Duomo about 6 blocks walking I thought it was less Breakfast was good The staff was kind Overall good
303544,Hotel Lloyd, The fixtures in the bathroom need maintenance , It was a good location and the staff was very accommodating The breakfast selection was quite good but with the full hotel the small place was overwhelmed 
303545,Hotel Lloyd, breakfast staff too noisy Asked for scrambled eggs which had finished told to wait 15 to 20 mins I didn t second day i waited water pressure in bath rather low toilet I thought was small Everything else was ok , Overall quite satisfactory 7 minutes on foot to Duomo Underground stone s throw away 
303546,Hotel Lloyd, wifi is rubbish hotel is next to the main road so very noisy no air cond so have to open the window and listen all the cars go by at night, Quite Close to town
303547,Hotel Lloyd, Some noise from the road in the early morning but not really a great problem , Few steps from the Duomo The room and the bed was large comfortable and clean Nice bath too 
303548,Hotel Lloyd, Wifi Noice coming from the rooms around Breakfast in small room and with limited choices of food High price during business shows in Milano , Location staff high price usually during business shows 
303549,Hotel Lloyd, Beds and pillows are so hard it was impossible to sleep , Location is great staff friendly and helpful Interior rooms are quiet Pretty clean Great breakfast 
303550,Hotel Lloyd, We had the code for free wifi but the connection was so poor and we didn t use it , My husband and I enjoyed the location There was a parking garage right around the corner We parked our car over night and was discouted by the hotel and only pain 17 wich is a really good deal in Italy the Duomo was only a 7 10 minute walk and lots of store s to shop were near Restaunts were good and the night life was enjoyable I d definitely recommend this hotel 
303551,Hotel Lloyd, the room was a bit cold and there was smell of the paint from restoration which got even worse when opening the window , Breakfast was great perfect espresso and nice staff
303552,Hotel Lloyd, On my second visit our room faced the main road and we needed the windows open at night so it was a little noisy lots of ambulances However it was all part of the experience and looking down at the busy street and 4th century church opposite was fun more interesting than facing a back alley , I have now stayed here twice liked it the first time so returned for a second trip The location was excellent close to metro and a short walk to Duomo but away from the busy tourist restaurants My daughter is working in Milan for a year and it is close to her home We discovered a few places to eat close to the hotel frequented by locals Beds very comfy on my second visit I brought my mother and mother in law aged 74 and 80 and they were very happy We had a spacious room with three single beds Breakfast was good Desk staff helpful and friendly 
303553,Hotel Lloyd, Old facilities Check out too early 10am , Staff was great they were very effective with a problem in our booking Spacious rooms Location was good 15 walk to the center the hotel it s locate in a quite neighborhood near a metro station Just In front there s a very small restaurant with nice food u might need to make a reservation
303554,Hotel Lloyd, wifi not working in the room when we arrived we had to keep window open for strange smell in the room, good location Duomo in walking distance close to metro station clean safe in the room
303555,Hotel Lloyd, It really wasn t a 4 star hotel breakfast , The staff was really kind Location is perfect close to the city center close to tram bus stops and metro station Not a modern hotel but very clean 
303556,Hotel Lloyd,No Negative, It s not a 4 hotel it a good 3 Very good position in front of the hotel there is a tram station and just 3 5 minutes away is a metro station But you can also walk to the Duomo We asked a quiet room on an upper floor and we had nr 59 an excellent room with huge bad Everything was clean and nice The heater is working very good if you know to set it The breakfast is not so various but it s good quality 
303557,Hotel Lloyd, The place is old and clapped out The sheets and towels were washed with some cheap products the smell was rank of the towels and the pair of us were that itchy omg we were going crazy scratching ourselves Walls are paper thin you can hear next door rooms, Location was ok
303558,Hotel Lloyd, Maybe the breakfast buffet looked more as one in a 3 stars hotel than in a 4 stars Anyway the waiters were very kind , The bed was really comfortable and it was quite so we slept really well Internet worked well although sometimes failed 
303559,Hotel Lloyd, The walls are extra thin and a slightly louder conversation from the room underneath yours won t let you sleep Especially if they raise the TV volume at 2am , The rest was really good
303560,Hotel Lloyd, 1 Quite poor wifi without any signal in my room And Lloyd declined my request to change a room as they thought the wifi was fine 2 Breakfast is acceptable but the daily restaurant is nothing available 3 As all the old hotels in Europe the decoration is a little out of date The bathroom is not bright enough , It is a hotel with at least 40 or 50 years history Considering the room charge it is economical and practical The location is good with several restaurants bars pharmacies shops banks nearby 3 mins walk to the nearest metro station From the hotel to Duomo takes about 10 mins walk Also there is a parking area nearby 
303561,Hotel Lloyd, You have to go the Duomo area for restaurants as there were not many options closed to the hotel, Walking distance to Duomo and metro Staffs was really nice and helpful I had quite room as I need to have good sleep after long flight 
303562,Hotel Lloyd, We had a hearing in the room that switched on in the middle of the night and made a terrible noise which prevented us from any more sleep the hotel have us a 20 discount when we showed them ,No Positive
303563,Hotel Lloyd, The pillows are BAD the room was cold and no heating till 17 00 we checked in 14 00 the room is not clean minimum facilities the toilet sit is very small the hotel is 2 starts and not 4 starts at all, hot water ok the lobby reasonable smell in corridors is good
303564,Hotel Lloyd, The hotel doesn t have any parking facilities for itself we hve to go to a near public parking where a discount is made on the normal price around 30 , The hotel is well situated for visiting the old town and city center 
303565,Hotel Lloyd, Wifi was weak inconsistent times Required repeated logging on while using , Excellent location close to University of Milan Easy to walk to Duomo central Milan Staff helpful and courteous 
303566,Hotel Lloyd, Fairly standard corporate style hotel Nothing special but nothing to complain about all things considered , Good value and good location Close to the metro and only a short walk to the centre of town 
303567,Hotel Lloyd,No Negative, Everything was excellent Location door step cablecar garage availability of restaurants close to city center law firms courts banks Room excellent upper floor with view over cosy square with catholic church and small market 
303568,Hotel Lloyd,No Negative, I booked a single room for an overnight stay and the bed was large and comfortable The hotel is a few minutes away from the metro station taking you one stop to the beautiful Duomo I m sure I could have walked it A little tip For wi fi if you have more than one device to connect make sure you request from reception additional logins 
303569,Hotel Lloyd, WiFi a code was assigned which was valid only 24 hours Then whenever I went out and came back I had to log in each time which was a nuisance I didn t like this system at all , The location was great so central and with great public transport on the doorstep 
303570,Hotel Lloyd, Air conditioner made intermittent noises which would wake us The WiFi was terrible The breakfast was awful in particular the scrambled eggs which were grey in color likely due to excessive over cooking Desk man advised us that the airport car could be paid by credit card yet in fact I had to run into the terminal to an ATM for more euros to pay for the car , Location was good 
303571,Hotel Lloyd, Tired rooms needed updating A kettle would have been nice I know this is not usual but our other 4 bookings in Italy had coffee tea kettle , Location close to tram stops and Duomo can leave luggage polite staff 
303572,Hotel Lloyd, Staff weren t friendly Air conditioning wasn t really working only the fan option worked but it didn t cool Due to a booking error we were charged 15 more than we had booked for and if you looked online the price we paid was more than the price advertised if we had just walked in Only saving grace was location , Good location Within 10 mins walk to duomo 
303573,Hotel Lloyd, Staff were not very motivated but OK road noise could be a problem but we were on the 4th floor so OK , Good location to walk to the cathedral rooms are small but reasonably well equipped aircon worked fine room was clean Breakfast was simple but worked for us Reasonable value for money if you imagine it s 3 rather than 4 stars 
303574,Hotel Lloyd, Nothing major just the wifi connection was good but you have to insert the username and the password every now and then , Clean good breakfast a walking distance to the Duomo and the staff was very nice and helpful to me and to my mom This is my second time staying here and I will definitely stay again next time I m in Milano hopefully 
303575,Hotel Lloyd, Parking information was not available beforehand they should really let you know that there is no parking available But they give you a small discount for a nearby parkade which still ends up quite expensive , Wi fi worked well which is something you don t see often Walking distance to all central attractions 
303576,Hotel Lloyd, The breakfast was good but the veriety can be wider a bit , Quality price is very good We were staisfied with the room very much also with the stuff They were helpful and kind 
303577,Hotel Lloyd, 1 With all the staff we have met except the one in the breakfast room no one seems to be willing to smile to the guests but I am sure they do know how to smile 2 I was told the chechout time was 12 noon upon my arrival but on the date of my departure the woman behind the desk said their checkout time was 10 30 with a poker face only because I was back to the hotel at 12 15 3 Considering it is a 4 star hotel the breakfast SHOULD be better 4 I found mosquitos in the room but the guy said they got no way to deal with it 5 It is beyond me how this hotel obtained a 4 star I should have chosen somewhere else , The location deserves a 8 point It is 6 min walk to the metro station and 12 min walk to the cathedral plus a spermarket is nearby 
303578,Hotel Lloyd, All is well , Rooms are very spacious staff is good to interact with very close to dumo and shopping street just 5 kind walking distance also hop on hop off bus is just 2 minutes away from hotel below the hotel u will find tramp services which will take to dumo n a Indian restaurant for ur food 
303579,Hotel Lloyd, Biting nasty mosquitos in the room no kettle in the room Not great Also the the choices for hot breakfast is only egg No bacon neither sausages , Accommodating Staff convenience of the hotel to the Center 
303580,Hotel Lloyd, There was a horrible smell in the room I had to go out for hours opened the window but the smell stayed I had to buy an airfreshener 4 star hotel Never Maybe 2 I would never go back , Close to Duomo and shopping big room nice friendly staff
303581,Hotel Lloyd, I sustained a back injury 2 years ago which I did take care of But when I slept in the beds of a this hotel that pain resurfaced I was in pain and actually requested for an early check out which they refused The beds are like its made with woods or something And I had mosquitos some insects bite the next morning The man who checked me in has not hospitality gens in his vain as while I was talking to him he was busy doing other stuff The first rule of any resonable front desk agent is when a guest walks into your lobby you should make eye contact pause and engage the guest He was just rude when I walked in there was no eye contact no saultation just went straight to your passport please I was like maybe I caught him in a bad mood regardless of your mood your guest should not see it However the fellow on night duty was somewhat polite Overall sleeping experience was a nightmare those beds should be thrown out the window On a plus note the location of this property is amazing as everywhere is almost a walking distance is you are up for a good walk , The location is fantastic
303582,Hotel Lloyd, Room at 7th floor Windows with no view Breakfast can be improved No kettle in the room , 10 min walking to Duomo Near to tram and metro stations Indian Restaurant opposite the hotel Very clean room 
303583,Hotel Lloyd, This is not a four star hotel It is way overrated from the missing comfort and the miserable breakfast offer Let s start with the room its acoustic is terrible You can hear the other people in the next and across the hall rooms The furniture is old and smelly A MAJOR upgrade to both the room furniture and breakfast offer would be needed to make this a four star hotel So misleading , Location maybe 
303584,Hotel Lloyd, The city tax The lack of information of things to do in Milan ie day tours etc, The staff were efficient but I didn t find them that friendly The hotel is dated and does need a revamp It had a comfy bed and was clean It s near 2 metro stations Breakfast was fine 
303585,Hotel Lloyd, The breakfast was fantastic staff were great friendly and helpful great location easy walking distance to all the sights Nice decor comfy bed and nice linen ,No Positive
303586,Hotel Lloyd, A kettle would have been nice And wifi that s accessible to all your devices at the same time Definitely not 4 star , It was okay for 2 nights Breakfast was good 
303587,Hotel Lloyd, Air conditioning was switched off overnight and during the day by reception so the room got very stuffy in the morning Reception would switch it back on by request but you shouldn t need to The window opened straight on to a walkway which was being used as a smoking area and the window was left open during the day by the cleaners Shower temperature wasn t consistent it was constantly going up and down , Close to main attractions and near metro and tram routes 
303588,Hotel Lloyd, I understand the reason why but I don t like showers over the bath But this is a minor problem , If you wish to explore the historic side of Milan then the location is ideal Staff were good 
303589,Hotel Lloyd, WiFi was so poor that you better do not use it to save your nerves Reception staff were different some were good some were not In my view reception service has room for improvement But overall good hotel , Overall excellent location Breakfast was normal Bathroom was also good Adequate value for money But the best thing of the hotel location is closely located restaurant which is ran by Sardinians fans of Cagliari football club that is the real pearl that we were lucky to be recommended by the hotel receptionist 
303590,Hotel Lloyd, Breakfast was under expectations not a lot to choose from really disappointing for a 4 stars hotel , The location is excellent a 10 minutes walk to the city center We had to spend one day in Milano so we opted for an accommodation close to the cathedral The funniest thing happened because we booked and paid for a regular room at this hotel for one night and we got an apartment on 7th floor with a conference room a bedroom and a huge bathroom The view at night was not bad at all 
303591,Hotel Lloyd, The building is old and the facilities are old I have got a double room that was old and small the staff is not up to the standards of a 4 stars hotel, The location is strategic close to the city center
303592,Hotel Lloyd,No Negative, The personnel was helpfull and cheerful The rooms were large enough cleaned everyday We liked the breakfast a lot When I compare it with my other visits to Italy it made me happy to have cheese scramled eggs capucciono for free Everything was fresh There was plenty of different kinds of bread which I would I asked for I strongly recommend the hotel with its perfect location and good service
303593,Hotel Lloyd, Having experince from many other 4 star hotels I can t understand how this hotel can be rated four stars The standard is absolutely only a three stars Wifi is available but extremely slow and unstable , Very good location
303594,Hotel Lloyd, The wall of the bed side could use some paintings so it won t look too simple Buffet staffs plz smile more D, I love the curtains and decoration style of the room
303595,Hotel Lloyd, The service of wi fi or internet from hour to hourr you need to up date the passward and some times it does not works or go to reciption to get new passward, The breakfast need to get better
303596,Hotel Lloyd, There is a lot of automobile traffic in Milan Our room was on the second floor with a street side window and the traffic noise was quite a lot at times Wifi one device at a time with repeated login, The room was adequate in size and clean A public parking garage was just around the corner The metro station was a few blocks away as well a a grocery store We were traveling with a pet and the staff were able to accommodate us with a room with out carpeting 
303597,Hotel Lloyd, However at check in front desk person was slightly arrogant and inconsiderate There was a second person later at night much more pleasent This is not a 4 star style hotel rather looks and feels like a 2 3 star service , Breakfast and restaurant service was very good 
303598,Hotel Lloyd, Room smelled of smoke receptionist not able to do anything the first night Second night changed to another room Rooms in general very run down not what could be expected from 4 star hotel , Location is good easy access to city centre
303599,Hotel Lloyd, The facilities decoration are 30 years old or maybe more I believe they should renew the whole hotel Since Milan is the most important city of the entire world for fashion clothing industrial activities therefore the owners of the hotel at least must invest in image renewing the decoration , The location of the hotel is close from everything Visitors can get easily to the subway or any transportation to go any where The hotel is located a walking distance from la piazza del Duomo 
303600,Hotel Lloyd, The breakfast is too simple and it is not worth the value of money as you pay for a four star hotel with a 2 or 3 star hotel s breakfast , The room is spacious and it is a walking distance to some attractions in Milan like Church of San Bernardino alle Ossa the art pieces are made from skull and bone Milan catherdal Duadrilatero Della Moda etc You may keep the luggages at hotel s lobby after checking out if you still want to wander around the town before leaving Milan 
303601,Hotel Lloyd, Bathroom amenity water from shower don t have power Lift to old Internet finally is free but still annoinng tha you have to register every day and speed is slow , A walk away to Duomo car park near easy to reach Staff very good New flooring 
303602,Hotel Lloyd, Receptionist was rude We have just arrived and he could see that we are big family of 6 persons and 2 dogs with 2 cars outside plus many luggages with us Parking outside the hotel is not possible so we asked him where we can park Instead of telling us where garage is he insisted on showing our documents first to verify our identification This could have wait until we park but he was slow downed and could not get it After few minutes he explained where the garage is Obviously he was nervous young and unskilled Garage was little far away 7 min of walk especially when we have to take 2 dogs and all the luggage So again the receptionist could have warn us and offer to leave our luggage in the hotel We were accomodated on the 5th floor rooms were stinky and it was obvious that nobody was acommodated there for a wery long time absolutely no fresh air Breakfast offered everything needed However a 4star hotel could have better offer Rooms are very old and require better cleaning plus better maintainance of furniture Otherwise the rooms will be musty On the Booking Loyd claims to be in the city centre nevertheless it is 15 minutes of walk to reach the cathedral and gallery For a young person it is no problem but for older people it could be , Close to the city centre 15 min from the cathedral and gallery
303603,Hotel Lloyd, 1 Towels in this hotel were awful and those were smelling very bad If you use those towels on your face then you can t breath 2 Internet connection bad and disconnecting all the time 3 Very poor quality of breakfast but that is probably in most of the Italian hotels , Location
303604,Hotel Lloyd, Noisy First it was the noise from all the rooms around including the ones from the floors below and above And then at 6 30 starts the noise of vacuum cleaner 6 30 Vacuum cleaner I was lucky having windows to the courtyard the windows of my friends were to the street side and that was a night of sounds of the city , Nice location 10 minutes walking distance to Duomo And a Metro station is quite near 
303605,Hotel Lloyd, Breakfast could be improved, Hotel is old but extremely cleane Location cleanliness staff are kind polite and usefull specialy Alberto recrptionist 
303606,Hotel Lloyd, The hotel staff do not have any respect for the tenant Who wants this hotel must be attentive to all that has not put something if he left the hotel For I have been robbed by one of the employees When I started to make a complaint to the Director by Vagni responded that this employee worked for him for a long time and can not offer them any note Scam at this hotel be careful, The hotel is not quite
303607,Hotel Lloyd, The d cor of the hotel is still in the 80 s needs refurbishment badly Breakfast choice very basic , Staff were very friendly and accommodating 
303608,Hotel Lloyd, Upon arrival the staff member demanded our passports rather than ask for them and when we got to our room it stunk overwhelming like perfume as though a smoker had been in the room and they had tried to cover it up setting off coughing fits in both me and my mother We opened the windows and went out for a few hours and on return it was just as overwhelming We spoke politely to the same rude man who checked us in and send he couldn t do anything except ask the housekeeping staff not to use perfume the following day We requested complimentary water to stop the coughing and we re told it was not possible we could have water with our breakfast the following morning Eventually the rude receptionist pointed us in the direction of the nearest supermarket where we stocked up on water and cough drops and returned to the room for a very uncomfortable night sleep Breakfast was cold scrambled eggs that were never refreshed with croissants that had been fingered by the ungloved host as he moved them from the bottom shelf to the top Overall a very overpriced experience with very poor service Location is the only thing going for this property , Location is the only thing going for this property
303609,Hotel Lloyd, A little more effort on breakfast variety , Clean comfortable convenient Easy to get to central cultural locations I used the 94 tram and shanks pony 
303610,Hotel Lloyd, Price is really steep for what you get Rooms and common areas definitely need a refurbishment but in the meantime they can try improve the level of cleanliness Breakfast was poor , Location is really good between Missori and Crocetta underground station You can easily reach Duomo square with a 10 15 minute walk 
303611,Hotel Lloyd, It is expensive for what you get The rooms are okay but the breackfast is not as good as one would get in a pastry store near by , Location is great and easy to get to 
303612,Hotel Lloyd, Instead of getting a double bed we got two singles pushed together didn t bother us too much but was still a bit off Got weird bites all over our legs after the first night we suspected there was something in the bed sheets but we aren t that sure of this Also we could hear a lot of what was going on outside our room which was quite distracting and made it hard to sleep at night Some construction works were on right outside our window too , The staff were very nice and friendly Breakfast was okay not too much to chose from but whatever was there tasted lovely Room was big and the level of cleanliness was good The location of the hotel was amazing as it was very close to the duomo and other locations we wanted to visit were 20 minute walk away from the hotel 
303613,Hotel Lloyd, The one thing that was a pain but not a game changer was the Wi fi You will have to ask the hotel for wi fi cards with different usernames and password every 12 hours However it is not a deal breaker the hotel is very nice, The location is amazing it is just a 5 minute walk to the main square of Milan which have the cathedral and the Galleria The staff are really helpful nice and kind 
303614,Hotel Lloyd, very noisy room bad internet high price compared to facilities hotel does not match 4 , personal very close by the square Duomo 5 min on foot
