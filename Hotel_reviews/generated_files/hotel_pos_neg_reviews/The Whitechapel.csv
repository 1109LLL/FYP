194506,The Whitechapel,No Negative, In this hotel have a bedbams I have bitten by so many times Hotel I did complain to staff they didn t bother to reply me anything my arms are so low so bad
194507,The Whitechapel, Bathroom floor wet after shower and a problem if you then wanted to use the toilet while floor still wet post shower Would have preferred to be able to wash hands in sink within the toilet area and not outside in the bedroom are ,No Positive
194508,The Whitechapel, It was a bit creepy later in the day , The location was great for us because it was near our son s flat but I wouldn t choose to stay there normally as a tourist It was an easy walk to Brick Lane Tower Bridge etc but you could get there by The Tube anyway 
194509,The Whitechapel, One very rude experience with a staff reception named Nazmul night shift Very rude one night when I came back with my family from city I asked for something but without even listening he was like walking away from reception and turned his face back saying he dont know Its not his job Then i asked the restaurant staff he said its to be asked at the reception Then this guy Nazmul comes back to reception counter and he is like oh yeah its his job Come on you have only 1 JOB Whats with that RUDE customer service , The rooms are great clean and have A C electric kettle Convenient for Muslims Halal food besides cheap and delicious Street more to muslim area with mosques and restaurants lineup Very friendly and helpful reception lady day shift 
194510,The Whitechapel,No Negative, really well designed rooms small but perfectly laid out the windows actually opened which is rare in london so had fresh air spotlessly clean friendly lovely comfy bed and decent shower
194511,The Whitechapel, The bed was extremely hard and the pillows very uncomfortable I had a crooked neck for the following week , Hotel was relatively quiet location was pretty good and was cheaper than most other hotels in London 
194512,The Whitechapel, Inward opening of bathroom door in my single room made a neat space feel awkward and cramped , An extra sink at the dresser was quite convenient Air con and heating were both perfect once I figured out the controls Very pleasant family friendly environment Tesco and Whitechapel tube nearby opposite directions 
194513,The Whitechapel, Bathroom a bit small Folding shower screen beside bath very impractical , Was very suitable for our purpose to provide proximity to where our son lives Staff were helpful in assisting with room change 
194514,The Whitechapel, The area was poor and their were amounts of litter in the surrounding street , the hotel was clean and the the accommodation was adequate for my needs and in line with my expectations and provided good value for money
194515,The Whitechapel, The road outside was used as a sound strip with vehicles sound systems sending vibrations into the top floor room The bathroom seemed to be from a lower quality star rating due to the chipping paint no paint The staff were confusing and took payment without my knowledge The basin was in the room rather than the bathroom and the lighting by the basin and mirror would not be good for any lady applying makeup , The room was modern looking with plenty of windows for the view The air conditioning kept the room nice and cool 
194516,The Whitechapel, Didn t need the mini fridge in twin room, Very clean stylish and comfortable with lovely staff close to tube in a very quiet area with great places to eat we felt very safe All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly and we will definitely stay there again and my daughter felt the same 
194517,The Whitechapel, bedlinen was poor quality beds were uncomfortable their is no real social space the bar restaurant was suitable for back packers not business people , Pictures look good but the reality is not so good Area is OK and for one night it was fine but I wouldn t stay here again 
194518,The Whitechapel, It was a bit strange to have the sink in the main room and not in the toilet in our room Other than that all was fine with the room , The location was fine as we were staying for the London marathon and we were 25 minutes from the Greenwich tube station The rooms were well presented and comfortable 
194519,The Whitechapel, The space in the room was too small making it difficult to walk around the furniture and share the space between 2 people, The room was very clean and modern and staffcwere very polite 
194520,The Whitechapel, The room had a connecting door and I might as well have been staying with the person in the next room I heard every word of his conversation and his TV until 01 00 not good when you have to be up at 5 Need better sound proofing Why are biscuits for your tea a 1 a packet would expect them to be included , Clean and staff friendly reasonable price The flats away from the main hotel are much nicer 
194521,The Whitechapel, Next time please have some toilet paper in stock Still many thanks for using kitchen rolls Sometimes a bit noisy at nighttime people with cars passing by while listening to loud music nearby someone was seemingly having great fun partying Well apparently the area looks very quiet but during my stay it was quite noisy unfortunately That s the only complain I have actually , Lovely and an amazingly modern apartment neat and tidy greatly equipped Apartment worth a longer stay at least a week we only been there for 3 nights 
194522,The Whitechapel, The overall price was a bit exaggerated even for the Easter weekend 70 euros per person per night breakfast not included , Comfortable and quite Clean staff ok Located in the hearth of Withechapel close to the buzzing districh of Schoreditch and the trendy Brick Lane Tube station 10mins walk 
194523,The Whitechapel, Cleanliness was a problem Shofar bed linen was not clean Door handle was broken Hair on the pillow Bathroom floor needed to be scrubbed, Big apartment with all facilities
194524,The Whitechapel, Small and relatively old room calc on the bathroom floor shower door would not even stay still and open close as you shower loud had to disconnect the minibar to fall asleep Doorman was not exactly the friendliest Based on what I ve noticed from the corridors and my own room the whole hotel is need of renewal refurbishment , Nothing
194525,The Whitechapel, I had an interconnecting room and the doors between the two rooms weren t very sound proof , I had to make some late changes to my booking and the guy on reception was really helpful pro actively stepping in to make sure I could keep the same room when I had to stay an extra day Room was a good size with comfortable although a little small beds Well stocked mini bar I didn t get chance to use the on site restaurant but it looked good and seems very popular 
194526,The Whitechapel, The bathroom was very small and uncomfortable The bath does not have any support handles and can be slippery Water handles are put beneath the shower can be dangerous when water gets too hot The side of the bed has a wooden cover that reaches the floor It caused a serious injury on my big toe after bumping against it Not enough chairs for 2 persons to put clothes or suitcases on Pillows are uncomfortable Not enough towels for 2 persons No breakfast buffet only orders from menu , Wash tile separate from bathroom Plenty of tea coffee and coco in the room 110 and 235 Volt universal socket above wash tile 
194527,The Whitechapel, Location direct area around the apartment entrance wasn t particularly nice If you re taxi ing then it s all fine , Apartment was great Really liked it 
194528,The Whitechapel, Surrounding area didn t appear to be the best although I m just going on my initial impressions , Staff were fantastic really polite and professional room was spotless as if it had just been decorated the day before a
194529,The Whitechapel, Breakfast was a little haphazard and a pot of tea would have been preferred Other than that just the area is a little run down but the hotel is immaculate inside , The property might not be in the best area but it was clean quiet and had everything I needed Even a fridge with juice and sweets which were paid for on departure if consumed It was a lot quieter than I expected being on a road and near the hospital I never heard a thing Not even other guests No banging doors or heels despite the wooden floor in the room Facilities to make tea and coffee as well I d certainly return 
194530,The Whitechapel, Wifi wasn t best in my room Receptionist was cold not very friendly Shower drain was draining very slowly I thought it was going to flood the room , Clean warm room super quiet Comfy bed Big TV Reasonable price 
194531,The Whitechapel, The shower screen didn t stay put so the bathroom was very wet , Good shower despite water logging Nice touches with the water and tea and coffee plus the mini fridge contents were very reasonably priced Comfortable beds and very clean Great location for exploring London s East End 
194532,The Whitechapel, Room could have been bigger to enable access to the wardrobe , Very convenient for my meetings but not a tourist area Single bed in small room was quite comfortable decor was good and quite stylish Halal breakfast was enormous and very good 
194533,The Whitechapel, It s small not really near anything and there is no gym , This is worth the money While it is small and meant for one person it is surprisingly quiet 
194534,The Whitechapel, The Shower drain could be better placed in the bathroom so as not to flood so much but you can work around it , The room and hotel looked amazing Staff was nice and helpful Just had breakfast in the restaurant but the rest of the menu for the grill restaurant and atmosphere look worth giving ago next time Good location close to tube and quiet street for London despite the hospital being close 
194535,The Whitechapel, Nothing , The room was a great size for a single one I loved the layout and the view I stayed with my baby and the crib provided was great for her The staff were really friendly The mini bar was super cheap and the location was in a good area too for London I will definitely stay here again 
194536,The Whitechapel, Some of the staff were rude One member of staff argued with me over the phone regarding an item on the menu claiming it wasn t something they did although I was looking at said item on the menu provided in the room Was very rude and unprofessional ,No Positive
194537,The Whitechapel, The fridge was a really great addition to the room although quite bright and had hum which if you are a light sleeper could be a little annoying , This was a lovely well presented hotel The room was well laid out and had everything I needed and more if I had wanted a soft drink or snack Staff were friendly I would stay a gain now I know the way as using post code for directions on my phone did take me around the houses 
194538,The Whitechapel, We thought it would have been better if the wash basin had been in the same room as the toilet , The staff were friendly without being over the top I don t like being called Sir all the time The hotel was nice and clean and we had everything we needed 
194539,The Whitechapel, I stayed for a week my bed was made but floors or surfaces were not touched There is no desk but I do realise space is premium in London, Great service nice people very central Breakfast service very friendly 
194540,The Whitechapel, No hot water through the hotel the night I was there it was fixed by the morning thankfully so I could have a shower The sink in the bedroom leaked whenever I used it Breakfast two poached eggs on toast arrived with one watery egg on a bit of toast and butter on the side to add myself but by that point the toast was soggy and wet Second egg arrived and wasn t cooked properly Not great , The bed was really comfy great pillows The staff were very friendly Good location close to the centre of London 
194541,The Whitechapel, All halal so no bacon Eggs poached weren t cooked enough and the majority of the eggs were still clear Top half of the cooked breakfast was burnt the underneath cold Nothing good about the meal at all Really not worth the money I paid good news is there s a Costas opposite So would still stay there but go over the road for breakfast next time Staff were good though , Not much 
194542,The Whitechapel, During some windy days there was a light draft from the window and the blankets could be a little bit bigger , Clean and tidy small room with good size twin beds and flatscreen TV clean bathroom with shampoos conditioners etc We got a quiet room with windows facing inner garden Staff was helpful and nice and lended us an umbrella Location is perfect for the price just a 2 minute walk to Whitechapel underground station Around are several coffee shops especially Alhambra Cafe with perfect latte to go I would say that this was a good value for money paid I can t say that it s a bad area just a regular for UK 
194543,The Whitechapel, Location can be a bit weird in the pm evening, Font office people are nice and will take care of you forgot some items in the room and they kept them for me 
194544,The Whitechapel, 2nd night restaurant staff were not very good could not get attention starter arrived very nice then half way through starter main course arrived with no apology , It was very clean reception staff very friendly Restaurant food very good 
194545,The Whitechapel, I think that the room is a twin executive room is a little small And sometimes the water in the toilette is not very hot , The restaurant is very good Very clean rooms and the staff os very nice 
194546,The Whitechapel, Very loud and annoying extractor fan that would only turn off when you disconnected the electricity Internet was a bit temperamental , Room was clean Bed was nice and comfy Shower was warm and powerful 
194547,The Whitechapel, hmmmm not much , Extremely comfortable quiet well appointed stylish boutique hotel very courteous staff easy on street parking locally no charges on weekend 
194548,The Whitechapel, The breakfast wasn t brilliant No dietary needs considered Ie gluten free The plate was cold so the food didn t keep warm, The penthouse was worth the money staff where really friendly My boys enjoyed every minute 
194549,The Whitechapel, The hotel is situated in quite a run down location but still charge a premium price Rooms were on the small side and even though it said I booked a king suite the bed was actually only a double The sheets were covered in hairs and fluff and also had a burn hole in Stayed for two nights and bed sheets were not changed during our stay The room in general was ok Smart enough looking but with a weird layout Sink separate from the actual toilet bathroom Staff were preoccupied with phones or friends but were nice Curtains were broken and didn t actually shut fully or match Toilet was very loud when flushing Wouldn t stay again Should be half the price they may think about staying again ,No Positive
194550,The Whitechapel, They forgot to give me the bill even though I requested it in my reservation and with checkin You can still hear a lot of street noises on the 3rd floor , Very clean conveniently located near the tube Neighbourhood not nearly as bad as other reviews stated and staff was very friendly 
194551,The Whitechapel, Some men in the reception was not so nice should try to be more friendly The girl was friendly and made it easier to like the place , The room was very nice modern and clean Really liked it The area is also very cool Also a plus for an OK restaurant in the hotel 
194552,The Whitechapel, Could throw in a coffee and orange juice in the breakfast cost though instead of a choice , Everything from check in to check out room was awesome and breakfast Devine could throw in a coffee and orange juice in the breakfast cost though instead of a choice 
194553,The Whitechapel, nothing it was all ace , Really nice hotel couldnt fault it in anyway staff were ace beds comfy very modern and trendy centre of shoreditch with everything you need in walking distance 
194554,The Whitechapel, Noisy even though advertised as soundproof ugly design shower splashes everywhere no cabin super small bed 1 83 and feet sticking out of bedcover cold inside and cannot control temp Bad location in the lobby there is a restaurant with a certain niche target with restrictions on alcohol and certain type of meat Certaintly not a 4 star hotel more like 2 , The price was the only good aspect
194555,The Whitechapel, Was charged for two full breakfasts and severed a single egg on toast which wasn t great The fridge in the room and air conditioning made a lot of noise even when the the air con was turned off Staff we impolite and inflexible in the morning I wouldn t stay here again , Room was ok size Location was good for working near Aldgate
194556,The Whitechapel, Bathroom smelt damp as the extactor fan did not seem to clear away the hot air sufficiently Nowhere to put the suitcase , Very clean good sized room for a single traveller Good facilities in the room
194557,The Whitechapel, At the beginning if you re not used to the neighborhood might seems dangerous but is really far from the thruth is a very safe place and the metro underground is about 400 m away from the hotel even thought I stay at the apartments , The apartment is big and comfortable It has a washing machine and all the facilities in case that you re traveling in a budget so you can cook your own meals A TESCO supermarket is nearby 
194558,The Whitechapel, Booking com didn t tell me there d been a problem with my card so check in was a little awkward Some bits weren t as clean as I d expect eg the bathroom tiles under the kettle tray and is showing a little bit of wear Not a deal breaker but would ve given an 8 5 if that was fixed If you re not London or big city confident this may not be the location for you , Comfy bed no bothersome street noise and a great last minute deal via booking com Very close to Tyyabs and Needoos if you re looking for an outstanding plate of spiced lamb chops 
194559,The Whitechapel, The bedroom was tiny Not enough room for me and my husband to move around the room at the same time Toilet was in the shower room which had heavy limescale on the floor and mould in the grouting No hand basin in the toilet had to go into the bedroom to wash hands Air conditioning noisy and not efficient Glass door to toilet so at night had to turn light on and lit up bedroom Mini fridge was very large noisy and had a glass door which lit up room at night TERRIBLE HOTEL,No Positive
194560,The Whitechapel, I didn t like the location and the entrance of the apartment narrow steep stairs It was not clear to me that I booked for an apartment I believed to stay in a 4 stars hotel The apartment was very new and clean though with a beautiful modern kitchen and a good although little bedroom ,No Positive
194561,The Whitechapel, Told there was no sofa in the apartment when there were actually 2 x 3 seater sofas, Hugely surprised and impressed by the size of the 2 bed penthouse and standard of furnishings in the apartment 
194562,The Whitechapel, You have to unplug the fridge if you want to sleep well The recurring sound every 5 10 minutes is unbearable , its not expensive but there are boutique hotels in London which are more central same price and better 
194563,The Whitechapel, Staff rude poor attitude no customer service skills Floor very dusty Shower Toilet is a wetroom Room very small , Location really good near Whitechapel subway easy to access Gatwick Airport and St Pancreas Station Comfy bed Air conditioning Generally quiet location Costa coffee across from hotel 
194564,The Whitechapel, The hotel is in a very Muslim neighborhood so as a non Muslim woman you definitely stand out , Air conditioning worked great bed very comfortable very quiet room Staff accommodating and friendly 
194565,The Whitechapel, A little difficult to find The breakfast was a bit bland and restaurant service in the morning a little slow, Comfortable beds and modern decoration Very clean with friendly staff 
194566,The Whitechapel, Asked for a quiet room our room overlooked the bins for the restaurant lots of noise from midnight till 1am Air con noisy turned off but with noise outside had to keep window shut Fridge had a light on all night and noisy Beds were close to being on a bouncy castle Room was very cramped bit too cosy as a twin room , Shower wet room was good but would expect a sink in the bathroom rather than at the table by the door 
194567,The Whitechapel, Breakfast is cooked to order and was good but the service was a bit chaotic and slow and they didn t have half of what was on the menu , Good location on a quiet street 15 minute walk to the nearest underground station and close to Brick Lane Spitalfields market very multicultural area Good size room although the bathroom was rather small 
194568,The Whitechapel, 1 the minibar machine is extremely noisy in the evening 2 it is too noisy in the reception 3 The staff in the reception checked my payment card It seems unusual to me because I traveled a lot and this is the first time , The location good for the money 
194569,The Whitechapel, The room I believe I was in 1 5 and bathroom were super small It didn t really matter to me because I was only there for one night but I can imagine you d maybe want a little bit more space if you re staying there for more than one or two nights , The location was perfect for me and overall the room was clean only the bathroom could use a little better cleaning Staff was very polite and I think the price was really good for London 
194570,The Whitechapel, Apartments located down a side street from the hotel No lift for baggage or babies buggy Had to climb two flights of narrow stairs to the level of our room , Apartments well furnished very clean and all the mod cons 
194571,The Whitechapel, The man at reception was very unfriendly didn t seem to make an effort with us at all When we asked him questions regarding the room and other information he was not helpful and seemed arrogant He was very blunt and made us both feel very uncomfortable The bathroom was also not very clean i could see mould around the floor and tiles , The bed was comfy and the room accessories were nice Dressing table and large mirror was a nice surprise 
194572,The Whitechapel, Wi fi or electricity did not work after asking the receptionist when this would be resolved they were rude to me I was then called numerous times by the reception desk at around 5am to be woken up and told it was the wrong number I am assuming because I had complained regarding the Internet This is unacceptable behaviour it was intimidating and I felt uneasy and actually passively threatened throughout my stay here Breakfast here was also an absolute joke , Nothing
194573,The Whitechapel, The receptionist was very rude and didn t offer to take our bags when we arrived early and wanted to travel around London for the day , Value for money
194574,The Whitechapel, The room particularly the VERY small en suite bathroom smelled musty My colleagues complained separately of late night corridor noise but I wasn t affected , The location Pleasant reception staff Room decor 
194575,The Whitechapel, Milk cartons in fridge were six months out of date Missing cutlery though we didn t need them I only mention so the hotel can restock I also mentioned at reception upon check out Side lamp needed fixing Mentioned all this upon check out and hotel were apologetic and more importantly vowed to fix Can t ask for more than that , Spacious and clean Lovely products in bathroom which was quite unexpected 
194576,The Whitechapel,No Negative, Lovely hotel and was surprised at the lovely modern decor Very close to tube station and if necessary the Royal London Hospital is within one minute walking Lovely place 
194577,The Whitechapel, Unfortunately although it was not the Hotels fault our stay was made difficult because of the location and the tubes being out of use all weekend This would be the only reason not for me to stay at the Whitechapel again If the tubes were up and running I would definitely stay at the Whitechapel again , The Staff were lovely and very very helpful The room was lovely and clean
194578,The Whitechapel, Sadly there was an electrical issue so I had issues getting into my room the WIFI was also down due to this so over the 2 days I was there I had no wifi , This place has really good potential nice clean spacious single room close to Whitechapel and Aldgate tube stations Nice and well presented rooms well priced for London and if they can sort some issues out I would certainly stay here again 
194579,The Whitechapel, Decent stay check in was terrible Stated my provisional driving license with me photo and address wasn t a form of ID after long discussion and manager phoned finally was allow access to the booking Apart from that nice room location not the greatest ,No Positive
194580,The Whitechapel, A lift would have been useful as travelling with my elderly mother who struggles with stairs However only one flight and she managed just fine , Loved the independence of having our own apartment although not there long enough to really take advantage Excellent for self catering and comfort 
194581,The Whitechapel, They overcharged me close to 500 for a 2 night stay and I am still waiting for my refund, The hotel is in the West End so you get to see a different side of London The room was clean and what we expected 
194582,The Whitechapel, First impressions counted Noticed when checking in that reception desk was a bitworn damaged round edges when checking in this kind of problem exhibited itself in the bedroom 3 1 too Staining on coffee table from cups etc toilet brush holder rusty and rust staining on floor etc A bit of minor TLC required I would say Our bedroom configuration not quite ideal bath and toilet in bathroom Sink in main bedroom Breakfast could have been improved e g toast with Full English Halal interpretation of would be good Also coffee refills or a pot would be nice , Location probably a bit strange for many customers but was good for us as close where we wanted to be Bedroom was fair size and clean Receptionist was helpful and kindly stored our bag for us whilst out for the day Best priced mini bar I have every seen in this country 1 for can of fizzy orange 
194583,The Whitechapel,No Negative, The receptionist Nazneen was very helpful in sorting out an ironing board and iron for me I have already re booked another stay later in the month excellent hotel and excellent staff 
194584,The Whitechapel, Breakfast is served in a restaurant which is in the same building but is totally independant from the hotel A few dishes on the card were recurently missing The service was rather slow We recommend not to take breakfast there There are a couple of places outside where you could do it ,No Positive
194585,The Whitechapel, I thought the hotel lacked in every aspect from hospitality to basic cleanliness I can t think of one thing that would make me want to come and stay here again There s were stains on upholstery throughout the room from bed linen to curtains and the room in general looked very very different to the pictures I couldn t wait to check out in the morning , I thought the hotel lacked in every aspect from hospitality to basic cleanliness I can t think of one thing that would make me want to come and stay here again 
194586,The Whitechapel, Staff especially in restaurant did not feel like serving us Had to wait long before I could order and could not order everything on the menu , Clean and modern rooms 5 10 min walk to underground trains Close to city center 
194587,The Whitechapel, The apartment was a little distance 150 metres from the check in it was on the first floor with no lift and a quite narrow staircase There was a reasonable amount of living space but the bedroom was on the small side with a 140 cm bed no bedside table no room and the door to the bathroom was barely 60 cm wide and the shower cubicle also seemed to be the smallest available There was also only one mirror a good one but no electric socket nearby so to dry my hair I used the reflection on the high gloss kitchen units , The property was clean and well decorated and well presented with everything you would need for a longer stay The living area was a good size and the kitchen was very stylish 
194588,The Whitechapel, Every thing was good highly recommended Needos A couple of doors away Nice , Very clean well equipped with every thing you need A mini bar reasonable prices Nice and warm cosy quiet I was in 2 7 A five minute walk to the Thames and st Katherine dock Beautiful 
194589,The Whitechapel, The shower took a long time to drain and so did the sink, The bed was really comfortable The apartment was really nice and clean The staff were very helpful Near central London Walking distance to food places 
194590,The Whitechapel, Skip the restaurant downstairs for breakfast if you re in a hurry Took ages to give my order there was only myself another guy in the place so it wasn t as if it was busy and then asked if I wanted tea or coffee giving the impression it came with the breakfast Upon seeing my bill it turns out they d charged me for it it was crap coffee too It was only a couple of pounds but I felt a bit ripped off Seems v busy in the eve s however so I guess the food then must be good , Small but perfectly fine room clean and nice check in guy on the desk 
194591,The Whitechapel, The neighbourhood in the evening, Welcome was superb and so were all the room details The materass was probably the best I slept on so far and even the colours in the room were nice and coordinated 
194592,The Whitechapel, It was not in the same building no left so I carried my luggage up the stairs Bathroom looked clean but smelled very bad , Newly refurbished modern apartment 
194593,The Whitechapel, The reception staff were a bit quiet It s a small area with one staff member , The room was spacious and a great bath tub Very clean My son was filming in Whitechapel so the location was great Very quiet Mini bar in the room and the food and drink were not over priced It enabled me to store some fresh milk for tea and coffee as well as a few sandwiches I wish all hotel rooms had a small bar fridge We stayed in room 2 1 This was an Twin executive room 
194594,The Whitechapel, Smallest rooms I ve ever stayed in for similar price bracket to larger slightly more plush hotels but location and pleasant staff win over that issue, Location for my work Ingenuity of room design
194595,The Whitechapel, The shower and toilet sink can t get the water away when using them I need to wait for 10 minutes until all the water gets away , The apartment is gorgeous Very clean with air conditioner good value with best experience staying here 
194596,The Whitechapel, Sink in the bathroom not round the corner and other side of the room No view quiet area on Sunday eve, Close to station good size room TV and towels and toiletries near shops
194597,The Whitechapel, This is not a four stars hotel The receptionist are not qualified and very slow the room is very small with a particular toilet the shower drain is not into the shower but near the wc so when you have a shower you flood all the toilet plus the sink is in the bedroom In addition the breakfast is orrible everything smell of fish and is burned For two dishes we have wait for one hour NEVER AGAIN , Free and fast wifi The room is new and well furnished 
194598,The Whitechapel, I didn t like the location the room was nothing like the pictures A non smoking room that smelt of cigarettes Walked in and walked straight back out , Unfortunately Was a very bad experience I didn t like anything 
194599,The Whitechapel, I wasn t so keen on the noise from the fridge so had to turn it off I had paid for breakfast already but when I went to breakfast they had no bacon muslim facility which wasn t advertised no issues except was looking forwards to bacon I chose three other things off the menu and they hadn t got any of them The only thing they could offer me was beans on toast and that was 1 3 the price of the breakfast I had already paid for online they make you pay per breakfast and if you paid already they let you pick stuff up to the value of what you have paid In any case it was an argument with the staff member to get my money back for breakfast He gave it eventually but at this point I had run out of time to go somewhere else before I had to go on my course , The hotel was very clean and the room itself was nice there were a lot of products the towels were soft the bedding was very comfy I can t complain about the room itself at all with the exception of it being a little cool until I had worked out the heating 
194600,The Whitechapel, The apartment was incredibly noisy on at least 4 nights to the point where I nearly booked out Washing machine needed to be cleaned , Well set out accommodation and kitchen more than adequate 
194601,The Whitechapel, Room was quite small and I was not a fan of the shower toilet layout The tempature of the room was a little too warm for my liking as well , Staff were great and very helpful Food at the restaurant was very good as well Location is central 
194602,The Whitechapel, Staff could have been more friendlier Not in a tourist area Dodgy neighbourhood But saying that we were okay Will probably come back , Very nice rooms Well equipped apartment Very warm Direct transport link to embankment Short walk from the tube 
194603,The Whitechapel, all VERY good especially for the price, Excellent Value apartment for 4 people private entrance seperate from the hotel just a few doors along the street Warm everything seems brand new super bedlinens fully equipped kitchen and great bathroom This was our 3rd visit 2nd in an apartment and very very happy 
194604,The Whitechapel, I found it very difcult to find the Hotel and I didn t like the area it was in For a one night stay you would be better paying a bit extra and staying in a more central location , Hotel was very clean and staff where friendly The rooms where modern and well fitted out 
194605,The Whitechapel, Breakfast was included but most dishes were not available or parts of it were missing Still we were asked to pay additional money as we spend more on the icluded breakfast than allowed by the owner We entered the hotel with our hands full of lugage a push cart and a 2 year old and although the girl at the reception was not busy and only 2 meters from the front door she did not bother to assist,No Positive
194606,The Whitechapel, The living room did have a slight strange smell to it when u first walk in maybe needs a deep clean of curtains and sofas, We stayed in the penthouse u have the whole top floor to yourself no one disturbs you wonderful nice and modern very clean
194607,The Whitechapel, Nothing , I also booked s room for my mother I have previously travelled alone and large hotel rooms can make you feel very lonely She was in a single room and it was brilliant Cosy comfortable and clean The hotel was very quite It was a 2 minute walk from Whitechapel tube station Absolutely brilliant and I would 100 stay again 
194608,The Whitechapel,No Negative, Really helpful staff who helped me out with their knowledge of the local area Very friendly and polite Location and facilities were excellent value for money Very convenient for me as it was just round the corner from Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry I was there for an interview Only a 5 minute walk from Whitechapel tube station 
194609,The Whitechapel, The location and area was really disappointing A total opposite to the apartment itself The Wifi was not working properly and they were quite hesitant to fix it, The apartment was quite nice
194610,The Whitechapel, When we asked for a taxi on leaving to only go a short distance we were most certainly judged by the hotel staff who said we were being lazy One of the members of our group can not walk long distances due to ill health but in this case the customer was no right Also the apartments are not within the hotel but down the road so did feel a little uneasy as a group of girls in whitechapel, The apartment was a good size for london 
194611,The Whitechapel, The only negative I would say would to be to improve single bed and put a double duvet as the single given just fits to the end of bed and when you move you find yourself cold because of lack of cover, compact but with everything I needed and convenient
194612,The Whitechapel,No Negative, The apartment was very conveniently located and spacious and also provided all of the necessary amenities needed for a 9 night stay The bed was comfortable kitchen and living room provided enough room to entertain guests and the staff came by every day to clean the apartment which was very nice 
194613,The Whitechapel, Room was cramped The fridge made an intermittent noise which woke me several times during the night So I didn t get a very good sleep , Staff were friendly place was very clean and tidy 
194614,The Whitechapel, Everything It s a dry hotel If you are a devout religion and want a dry hotel then say so on your website they don t as money is more important to them The rooms are tiny delux King minuscule and bed lumpy Room no better than travel lodge and in an awful area Lacks any character and is massively over priced, Nothing Awful place It s aimed at Muslim travellers and no one else this is fine if they advertised this on the website It s not and makes you feel unwelcome as you can t order an alcoholic drink or non halal food
194615,The Whitechapel,No Negative, very nice and clean hotel modern interior friendly staff not far from metro so easy to reach other parts of London interesting area with many different cultures and related places to taste different food 
194616,The Whitechapel, A bit far from Whitechapel underground station with luggage 10 minutes Located in Zone 2 more expensive to travel by underground because of crossing zones , Excellent service comfortable modern accommodation very clean good elevator magazines and newspapers available close to great curry shops and coffee shops tea coffee and water provided in the room Fun and vibrant multicultural section of London 
194617,The Whitechapel, The wet room style of the shower wasn t great making the floor by the toilet very wet Weird layout of whole room with not much room by the beds but more space near the table and sink separate to the bathroom Breakfast was adequate but we felt a single egg on toast was a little stingy and would have expected and preferred fresh milk in our tea , Comfy easy to find helpful and accommodating staff 24 hour reception and felt safe enough 
194618,The Whitechapel, F B was very poor Only meal we tried was breakfast but our first three choices were unavailable I watched my cup of hot water with a teabag in it sit there for a long time while the waiter made coffee delivered food to other customers fetch and carry this and that before delivering a well stewed drink to me Tip there s a Costa across the road use it , Room was clean everything needed for our stay was there Five minute walk to Whitechapel tube station 
194619,The Whitechapel, The hot and cold alternating temperature the noise from other rooms the really noisy fridge in the room that groans all night the tiny uncomfortable beds trying to find the hotel from the station , when it was time to leave
194620,The Whitechapel, The room was a bit small and the wifi system overly complicated , The staff were friendly and efficient I ate in the restaurant and the food and service were very good 
194621,The Whitechapel, Wireless did not work and I ended up having to use the restaurant wireless instead Several guests complained and were told that it was their computer set up which was not correct I would not recommend the hotel and would suggest others at similar pricing , The room was clean and no noise able to sleep well
194622,The Whitechapel, The WiFi was slow and usable only for 1 device The only available desk was small partially taken over the sink and the normal power supply was across the room , It was clean and relatively new It has easy transport links via the Whitechapel station nearby 10 min walk maybe 
194623,The Whitechapel, There was little space for me to get round the bed and I caught my leg a couple of times room 1 1 the bed has a firm mattress which would not be my personal preference , Staff were very friendly and were keen to help by providing me with an umbrella for the evening as it was raining My room was very quiet and I got a good nights sleep Lovely hot shower in the morning 
194624,The Whitechapel, We think that our nightly fee should include a simple Continental Breakfast as standard There was no proper hot water from the tap on our bedroom sink only lukewarm not acceptable in a so called executive room no 1 6 , The room was spacious clean and fairly quiet despite overlooking the busy road Nice hot shower We appreciated being able to use the wi Fi facility 
194625,The Whitechapel, Very poor WiFi connection I was able to use WiFi only near reception , Clean and comfortable room Close to city center and metro station Highly recommendable if you do not care about poor WiFi 
194626,The Whitechapel, The bed settee bedding had not been changed It is a little noisy from inside the building and outside Shower head is not practical for that shower cubicle ,No Positive
194627,The Whitechapel,No Negative, Rooms are small but if you re ok with that this is a great bolthole in a cool and up coming part of the city close to Brick Lane Front desk were incredibly helpful and rooms were spotlessly clean and well appointed Would benefit from 24 hour room service as it was past midnight when I checked in and the restaurant was closed But overall would thoroughly recommend 
194628,The Whitechapel, Very cramped room TV didn t work and my room was separated from the room next door by a flimsy door through which I could hear the occupant snoring , Friendly welcome
194629,The Whitechapel, Though having a fridge in the room is great it was very noisy we had to unplug ours The walls are quite thin and you can hear people talking at all times , The hotel is in a good location is very clean and the decor is very well considered apart from the terrible red bus pictures I would definitely recommend staying here 
194630,The Whitechapel, There were gangs of asian men on the street corners I would nt have felt comfortable for my wife and daughter to go out on their own There are no local bars and you can t get an English newspaper , The appartment was good and well stocked for self catering 
194631,The Whitechapel, Mini bar fridge Motor kicking in and out noisey Also not knowing what was complimentary or to be paid for Other hotels have biscuits by the kettle as free These had biscuits by the kettle but you have to buy Air freshener is auto and squirts a puff of scent every now and then Noisey and the sent just goes direct to my chest and leaves me coughing for a bit No alcohol in the attached restaurant TV way too small for that viewing distance Easier to watch on my phone Free WiFi is shocking Got connected and it would take 5 mins to display Google without a search No point offering wifi if it is not usable Ended up using my phone as an hotspot , Location was ok and the general upkeep of the room was ok Staff seemed OK did not have much to deal with them other than check in and out 
194632,The Whitechapel, We didnt like having to go straight up to our room as there was no where to sit downstairs I also I think this hotel should state no bar on premises when it is being advertised , The hotel room was spotless The beds were very comfortable Most of the staff were friendly and helpful that is except one guy who did not seem to have any interest in serving us 
194633,The Whitechapel, N A, The experience was EXCEPTIONAL I have travel a lot for business and have stayed at luxury hotels and this hotel was superb The staff and the upgrades of it being a modern chic hotel was awesome I loved the diversity in the neighborhood as well with eclectic food and the multicultural atmosphere It was close enough to city center but far enough to enjoy the charm of London Absolutely lovely 
194634,The Whitechapel, Not the nicest area of London but close to Whitechapel station We were upgraded to one of the apartments which was a good size and had everything you would need Neighbours were pretty noisy and the road a bit rough though , Very helpful staff Clean rooms 
194635,The Whitechapel, was quite taken aback leaving tube to hotel with population although nobody bothered us, very handy for tube steady walk to London tower room nice and quiet
194636,The Whitechapel, sink in room and not in bathroom ineffective little shield supposed to avoid a huge splash zone in the bathroom this system needs to be thought again neighborhood I m not confortable with its atmosphere , cleanness nice decoration modern style friendly staff
194637,The Whitechapel, WIFI was really slow like Dial up speed and you had to move around the room and find sweet spots or it didnt work the location itself doesnt have a lot going on in the immediate area a lot of Grill restaurants but you wont find much british cuisine there, friendly staff close to public transport 
194638,The Whitechapel, No alcohol allowed on premises but no mention of this on website booking sites Mini bar lit up the room at night Air con knocked off after 1 hour annoying at night Staff seemed disinterested when we arrived were made to wait for 15 minutes as room not ready , Very quiet Comfy beds tall people would struggle with the size though 5 mins walk from tube station Mini bar fairly priced Shower excellent 
194639,The Whitechapel, The close neigborhood is not exactly beautifull actually is quite dirty sometimes and is mix of different cultures and nationalities But really not a big issue we felt quite safe there even walking at night Could have a second toilet at the apartment as it has only one bathroom for apartment that can accomodate up to 6 people , We stayed at the Penthouse 2 bedrooms comfortable beds but the second bedroom has more like a sofa rather than a bed Apartment was very nice clean newly equiped nice view fully equipped kitchen Staff very friendly Great location from distance point of view 10 min walk to Tube 25 min walk to London Tower Easy reach to city center 2 direct bus lines very close Some nice restaurants in walking distance 
194640,The Whitechapel, Nothing in particular although bed a bit short for six footers like me , Good location in East London 5 10 mins walk from Aldgate East Just off Whitechapel Rd plenty of shops and restaurants close to Brick Lane too Clean nice staff in house restaurant Great showers too And decent value

194642,The Whitechapel, The area of Whitechapel is not the most idyllic place in London , Clean and cozy standard hotel Good connections to Paddington and Kings Cross stations Free Wifi 
194643,The Whitechapel, The location was not the best as the area is quite run down Some people may feel uncomfortable walking from the Tube Station to the hotel especially women on their own at night I was also awoken by noisy guests , Very clean and very modern hotel It has everything you need and is very well presented 
194644,The Whitechapel, I was not pleased with reservation Booking com showed to us the facility that we booked was for 4 adults and 2 kids While the hotel insist is only for four guests What Booking com confirmed to us is not what we received I am not happy with this reservation My view to booking com is declining ,No Positive
