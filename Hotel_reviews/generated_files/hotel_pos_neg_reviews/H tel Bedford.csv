70898,H tel Bedford, Maybe one more towel rack in the bathroom would be good to dry towels overnight , It is well situated Staff was all fluent in English and very helpful A very international sense of customer service 
70899,H tel Bedford, Only one lift no curtains in the room net curtains only so the sun would wake us up as it would beam into the room on our faces as the windows were faving the bed , Beautiful decor and great location 
70900,H tel Bedford, Breakfast was good but could always be better However that is one of the joys of Paris going on a search for the best croissants at lots of different places Otherwise I wouldn t change a thing , The staff was amazingly helpful the place was cozy and elegant The location was perfect for us as it was not in the middle of all of the tourists yet close enough to access anything 
70901,H tel Bedford, I would have liked free coffee tea making facilities in the room thought that the breakfast was quite overpriced , A very clean well maintained perfectly located family run hotel I would definitely recommend it to friends family stay for future visits to Paris We were very happy with it all This is not a flashy place but it s perfect 
70902,H tel Bedford, Toilet was fully blocked on 1st night They fixed next day Room with Eiffel Tower view was far away situated on the side of hotel Wasnt visible through window unless u step out on balcony and look to the left also you only see half of Tower I think hotel should specified this , The Decor and location 
70903,H tel Bedford, The bedroom was drab The wallpaper was coming off the wall The bed was so hard it felt like i was sleeping on the floor The shower was painful The cold wet shower curtain was uncomfortable in the shower blowing around There were no coffee or tea facilities in the room Toiletries disappointing , Friendly staff Good location Dining room and bar in the hotel Fairly quiet street 
70904,H tel Bedford, I m not sure how this hotel could get 4 stars as it definitely would not get more than 2 stars from me The customers is king at least that is what they say but the stay made me rather upset than happy First of all the parking situation is a disaster They have a car park where customers pay 28 a day which is not cheap already btw but for this you need a customer card which you obviously get in the hotel if you call in and let them know that you need a parking spot I did so but when I arrived they told me that they didnt get my message so I had to pay 50 a day which is quite heavy Besides the rooms did not look like they did on the pictures at all I was literally shocked when I saw the rooms we got It was my first stay in this hotel and there will definitely not be a second one The only good point is that the hotel is pretty central but to be honest this wasnt worth the stress we had when we arrived We came a long way from Germany and the only thing we wanted was to relax but that was sadly not possible Instead of relaxing and calming down I was even more stressed Sorry to say that this hotel ruined my stay in Paris , The hotel was pretty Central 
70905,H tel Bedford, The toilet had a leak , The staff were really Friendly and helpful And upgraded me to an air conditioned room The room was so clean And I love the colourful decor 
70906,H tel Bedford, Initially placed in a claustrophobic loft room and staff took long time to find alternative room, The room to which we were relocated was very good and airy 
70907,H tel Bedford, I honestly liked everything during my stay , I liked how easy it was to secure a comfortable room for three people They added in an extra little twin bed for our third person and the bed wasn t some shoddy cot like I ve seen before but a real mattress I also liked the size of the room and the fact that we got an individual thermostat for the room 
70908,H tel Bedford, Would have expected free car parking considering the cost of the rooms No onsite car parking but there again the hotel is located in a small street therefore parking is at a premium Underground car park was a short walk but absolutely fine, Bedrooms very spacious decor was a little tired in places but not bad Rooms were clean beds spacious with good air conditioning Breakfast was very good All staff at all times were very accommodating and friendly
70909,H tel Bedford,No Negative, Fabulous bathroom layout extremely comfortable bed quiet efficient air conditioning within the room The breakfast buffet was a great start to our days in Paris The staff within the hotel were all friendly helpful 
70910,H tel Bedford, The safety box is very small and the door of the room is with key is better open with card and most of the staff don t talk English , The size of the room
70911,H tel Bedford, Would have loved to have been able to make coffee or tea in the room, Close to ar least 3 Metro stations Excellent location for shopping lots of quaint little resturants closeby Staff very helpfull and friendly Hotel had a lovely old homely feel Not the usual stiff hotel lobby 
70912,H tel Bedford,No Negative, This building is absolutely beautiful Eat in the dining room for an art museum experience The staff is professional helpful and understanding 
70913,H tel Bedford, Staff were hopeless Got the booking wrong room wasn t ready at 1530 then given the wrong bed configuration Ordered 2 glasses and Ice at reception and plates and forks turned up , Linen room size decor style location
70914,H tel Bedford,No Negative, The location cannot be beat The staff was extremely accommodating and polite but if you ask a question to the wrong person they are immediately going to tell you that they don t answer that particular question and you should ask the next person I made the mistake of asking the concierge for a question that the check in person was to answer only to be reminded by him that he was the concierge it was not his responsibility to answer the question and to ask another person at the desk All I asked was whether I should dial o before the number in Paris In addition depending on who you have seating you in the restaurant they are either adamant that they will serve you breakfast or that you should get up yourself as it is a self serve All in all the location is amazing as you can walk everywhere The cleanliness can t be beat and I would certainly book there again 
70915,H tel Bedford, A better menu for the bar snacks would have been nice , The hotel was central for sightseers Breakfast is served until 10 00 on weekdays 11 00 at weekends so plenty of time for a relaxing breakfast Easy to get to the metro and tour bus stops for getting around and close to the Champs Elysee and other places of interest Plenty of cafes and bars locally for eating out The hotel bar was no more expensive than some of the bars we encountered on our meanderings 
70916,H tel Bedford, Can honestly say there was nothing we did not like , convenient location Close to so many things Felt very safe The staff was very very helpful and very nice 
70917,H tel Bedford, Entry level rooms quite small but this is expected in France Ironing room located far from rooms so a little inconvenient , Beautifully appointed boutique hotel High standard of cleanliness and helpful staff Well located in side street from main shopping areas Plenty of cafes and great restaurants within walking distance 
70918,H tel Bedford, Everything the room is so small and old fashioned The toilet is separate from the bathroom The worst thing is there is no sink to wash your hands in the toilet There was no kettle to boil water for a cup of tea There were no cups and only two glasses in the bathroom If you want to drink water you have to buy from the hotel Then there was still no glasses to drink from There is only switch to control all the lights if you switch off you switch off all the lights include down lights We have to leave the lights on so we did not sleep well , The location

70928,H tel Bedford, Gym facilities, The staff were extremely friendly and helpful My room was clean calming and quiet with a nice juliette balcony overlooking the street Lovely shower which is a big plus for me and the shower gel smelt incredible Great location to go for a morning run to the Eiffel Tower or the Louvre if you are a runner

70931,H tel Bedford, the staff was not very helpful in the reception I requested an invoice at my husbund s name and they denied because the reservation was at my name i changed that in Booking com and they still issued an invoice at my name having no intention to facilitate me Plus for returning customers they should have a data base we have stayed in bedford more than 10 times and this time they gave us a really mediocre room I m not asking for an upgrade but in all hotels returning customers that visit again and again the same hotels happen to have some privileges or some better renovated rooms especially when reservation was made more than 3 months before arrival , location is fantastic we stay many years in this hotel and the main reason is the location
70932,H tel Bedford, A c didn t seem to work although header did Also bathroom was totally redone and looked gorgeous BUT there was a wiff of smelly shower water so plumbing probably not done 100 Otherwise beautiful old style hotel with modern rooms and gorgeous bathrooms ,No Positive

70935,H tel Bedford,No Negative, This property is ideally located in a nice area in Paris It is nice and quite yet close to cafes and shopping mall and Opera The service was really good from the staff Friendly and polite Good value for money 
70936,H tel Bedford, I stayed a lot of times in this hotel because the location is the best It is though really odd how they do not have a data base for returning customers as this time they gave us a room of poor quality non renovated with poor bedcovers and four pillows for 3 people They shoud be two per each It would be really a pity for a hotel with such good and polite stuff not to have the possibility to locate customers that visit again and again and offer some benefits such as a better room type or even an upgrade , Location is great Breakfast is very well presented and of good quality stuff is very polite
70937,H tel Bedford,No Negative, The single room was clean and well equipped The staff were friendly and well informed about cafes and bars in the neighborhood I will certainly return

70945,H tel Bedford, check out took too long just one person behind the desk with a queue of 5 guests while 3 concierge chating also behind the desk pillows were poor and bathrobes large towels should be expected in a 4 star hotel, great location
70946,H tel Bedford, Maybe I didn t like the pillows Or is it because I am used to my pillows which are the best Also I would like to have a kettle for any hot drinks or even a hot lemsip medicine , Great hotel amazing staff excellent service They are really taking care of you you also feel comfortable and like home Thank you very much 
70947,H tel Bedford, Nothing , The hotel was welcoming spotlessly clean and the room was fantastic We drank in the bar which was lovely We will definitely be coming back 
70948,H tel Bedford, Breakfast is overpriced 21 euro and even no hot meal like scrambled eggs or omelette I lived on sixth floor under roof and right above my head there was waterpipe that sometimes produced noise of running water It is especially uncomforatble if someone one floor above takes a shower in the middle of the night , Location is awesome 5 min walk from Madeleine subway station and 7 min walk from Opera Garnier and RuassyBus stop Bed linen is of very good quality 
70949,H tel Bedford, Breakfast charge too high with a family of 5 it was much cheaper to go out for breakfast , Good hotel in great location plenty of restaurants in the area to have breakfast

70953,H tel Bedford,No Negative, The hotel is clean and lovely As an American I was thrilled with options for breakfast such as eggs mueslis yogurt The staff was friendly and very helpful The one restaurant they recommended ended up being our favorite out of a 3 week stay and it was reasonably priced It is a very convenient location so we walked everywhere We will go back 
70954,H tel Bedford, No slippers bathtub toothpaste toothbrush provided which we expect for a 400 per night hotel also a leaking water pipe over night which we didn t notice flooding the floor that I nearly slipped , Staff are helpful
70955,H tel Bedford, Perhaps tea and coffee making facilities in the room make a more comfortable stay , Although it is very centrally located the hotel is situated in a calm street which is an added bonus for a vibrant Paris hotel The room was spacious clean and with a very comfortable bed The staff were polite helpful and very professional I will definitely return 
70956,H tel Bedford, Old rooms Definitely are not up to the standard No drinks availabie in the room No boiler It was The only annoying thing, Quite area Bit of distance to champs lysee Staff very friendly New rooms are fab The young lady in the reception was extremely helpful nice 
70957,H tel Bedford, Could not control the temperature in the room AC was either ON or OFF no choice if it was too cold you have to get up in the middle of the night to shut off the AC WiFi was very slow No kettle in the room to make tea or coffee asked for a hot water thermos its cost 3 Euros and you have to go down to the bar to get the hot water Breakfast Buffet was miserable and over charged no variety at all Rooms had no tissues or tissue boxes whenever you sneezed or dropped some food on the carpet you had to go to the bathroom to take some tissues to use Next door construction made us fully awake by 7 00 am no more sleep if they start working they need at least three months to finish in my opinion I am not accustomed to tipping and the concierge sure made me feel guilty with his looks upon departure and had to tip him one minibar was out of order called the reception and asked him to change the small fridge he was very angry he said its a minibar and not a small fridge they changed it after 2 days I asked for a late checkout on the phone with the receptionist she said You have to come in person to the reception desk and ask for a late checkout I felt very guilty sent them an email thru booking com the next day and they sent me a letter thru booking com approving the late check out yeaaaaa booking com is backing me up The nearest food store was in the train station one kilometer away carrying the water bottles all the way for us was very tough business No in house self service for washing clothes had to go to a public laundry 4 km away by car , Three rooms with connected doors family was all happy to be together all the time Daily cleaning was a plus Very quiet and peaceful hotel except the next door construction which starts at 7 am they need at least three months to finish in my opinion Chinese restaurant in front of the hotel was very quick in sending our food but still overpriced 30 percent over the price of items from the USA Small restaurants all around the hotel meant you could have a variety of sandwiches and pizzas whenever you wanted till 9 pm Upon entry the bell captain delivered our luggage with out asking for a tip For Muslim users if you intend on connecting a hose for cleaning use 3 4 double threaded connector and a hose with head I could do this in our room however my kids rooms had no source of water to use after using the toilette so used hand held hook shaped cleaning bottles 600 meters away we found McDonald and Burger king Uber is a plus in Paris cheap and always available however once you leave Paris like going to euro Disney you are on your own compadre

70959,H tel Bedford, I never complain about staff but reception in Bedford did not attend us very well in Check In Looked like he was bothered just to be in there In check out we were previously authorized to leave by 2p m instead of normal check out hour but one attendant kept repeatedly calling us to leave the room by 12 30 Really unnecessary once we got a late check out Other people from staff were really nice to us , Nearby important places in Paris easy to come and go nice restaurants around 
70960,H tel Bedford, I just couldn t understand why there is a bathroom in which there is a bidet and next door in a separate room there is a toilet seat they usually put these two things next to each other unless the French do things differently, Location

70985,H tel Bedford, We were disappointed that the hotel did not offer dinner in the evening There was a lunch menu but this could only be taken in the bar area such a waste of a lovely dining room The towels and bedding at the hotel were less than one would expect at a four star hotel No duvet which we usually expect in continental hotels and poor quality towels , The lounge area and dining room were very beautifully decorated The situation of the hotel is perfect for the main shopping areas The staff were very pleasant and helpful 
70986,H tel Bedford, felt waiting staff were not as attentive as they could be eg not filling coffee cups unless asked and also they seemed to be paying considerable more attention to the business men who breakfasted there than the hotel guests , lovely hotel dining breakfast room beautiful staff polite
