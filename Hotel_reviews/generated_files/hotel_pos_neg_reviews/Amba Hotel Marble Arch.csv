290161,Amba Hotel Marble Arch, The room was very small pretty typical for London so all of our floor space was covered by our suitcases The hotel is in a major shopping district but isn t close to as many restaurants as we would have liked , The hotel was clean and well appointed Everything was in good working order It s a few blocks away from the Marble Arch tube and bus station which will take you all over the city 
290162,Amba Hotel Marble Arch, The staff at counter seems to be inexperienced as they double charged me for Room and then also for Breakfast and it was big problem to not have funds in my Prepaid travel card for regular Tour Expenses and even now we have balance double charge reversal pending,No Positive
290163,Amba Hotel Marble Arch, The prices continue to increase with every stay the service is adequate but not enough staff Parking is expensive and typical of London, I am a regular in this hotel for business only The location is the only thing to like

290165,Amba Hotel Marble Arch, The trap in the basin pulled a couple times and the smell from the drains entered the bathroom It needs a vent installing to prevent reoccurrence and it may be a problem in other rooms I made the booking but my wife travelled separately from Dorset and arrived before I did On probably the hottest day of the year and tired from the journey she was initially refused check in and entry into the room Only after complaining to the duty manager was she permitted entry , Good breakfast and complimentary fridge items

290168,Amba Hotel Marble Arch, We had a problem with the shower water was boiling hot but was fixed asap Also complimentary mini bar had half eaten snacks and bath robes had a packet of opened cigarettes so could do with housekeeping checking these areas These are just small areas to improve on but staff were very helpful and we enjoyed our stay overall , Beds were really comfy and the room was nice and spacious compared to other hotels I ve stayed in at London Will definitely come back and recommend

290180,Amba Hotel Marble Arch, The room doors do not fit that well and consequently allow in corridor noise a common problem in London hotels, The efficiency and helpfulness of Sarah at reception
290181,Amba Hotel Marble Arch, It was great experience but I m disappoint the service in the morning when I checked out I was supposed to check out at 12 and the cleaner knock the doer loudly to reminder us which was oaky But they was continued to bother us another two time before 12 o clock That s was the thing annoying me which I advise you should improve Otherwise it was great to stay in the hotel I checked in on 31 and check out 1 June and stayed the room was 219 , Cleaning was excellent and close to shopping mall

290183,Amba Hotel Marble Arch, I have been coming to this hotel for the past 20 years and although it s been recently refurbished under new management the bathrooms seem to have been made smaller and the bath replaced by a shower which my 2 year old grandson did not enjoy very much They also laid down a sofa bed for my grandson and my daughter who had to lay down next to him until he fell asleep found it very uncomfortable The mattress was too thin and depending where you sat on it the bottom half of the frame would tend to raise from the floor The room could have done with a new sofa bed seeing as the room rates have gone up considerably , We ordered breakfast in the room most days and it always arrived on time with hot coffee and warm toast The room was very clean and tidy and the minibar was replenished daily Great location for shopping in Oxford Street and with taxis waiting outside and the underground just round the corner no problem getting to all the major tourist attractions 
290184,Amba Hotel Marble Arch, Execute what they manager would promise , My suitcase was lost due to the British Airways IT issue The front desk turned away my bags the first time I had asked them to hold it as I was a student during the day Every day afterwards they said We will send a courior and it will arrive the next morning That was from Monday morning until today Thursday The tomorrow arrival is all they have responded to when ask when my clothes will arrive EXTREMELY POOR SERVICE when the unexpected occurs One woman at the desk was extremely rude 
290185,Amba Hotel Marble Arch, Not enough floor space for a couple on an extended trip with two large suitcases, Quiet location with ready access to the London transport system Very pleasant and helpful staff and the complimentary mini bar is a nice little touch 
290186,Amba Hotel Marble Arch,No Negative, The room was beautifully modern clean and airy The rainfall shower was devine The complimentary minibar is a super idea and was very welcome The ipad allowing us to place room service orders or make reservations is an excellent idea too and very convenient My request for a mattress cover for additional comfort on the sofa bed was met with whatever we can do to help This very kind person had the sofa bed beautifully made up on my return from sightseeing and it was very comfortable I only wish I asked for the person s name so I could properly thank them Overall a lovely stay and I would most certainly book again 
290187,Amba Hotel Marble Arch, No problems other than cost but realize lack of hotel rooms in London due to BA problems was the catalyst for this , Hotel was clean and staff were very proffesional

290192,Amba Hotel Marble Arch, Sorry to say that but some of the front disk staff was rude The front disk lady that she helped me during the check out was impolite and trying to embarrass me infront of may family and this is when I told her that I called room service to bring my luggage down as she start laughing and talking loudly and saying no no no room service is for food services only and not for luggage as also the other front disk lady beside her was laughing and you can feel the impolitness of the staff I did not want to talk and argue with her in front of my family as I felt that she does not have the basic and fundamentals in how to deal with customers as well as she does not know that all services provided to the people within the hotel are by it self considered as services whether it is under room service front disk concierge or any other , The design of the rooms and the location of the hotel are the best things

290198,Amba Hotel Marble Arch, The staff at the breakfast the grill So unprofessional and loud speaking to the guests Specially the supervisor Indian man , The size of the room and the clean rooms
290199,Amba Hotel Marble Arch, The only issue is that the main entrance of the hotel was at an elevated level that you should use an escalator There is no escalator when you go down and I think that doesn t suite elder people , Overall my experience with the hotel was perfect The staff were friendly The facility was perfect rooms were big compared to other hotels in London Bed were comfortable The location is amazing couple of steps to oxford street

290204,Amba Hotel Marble Arch, Some bad behaviors by certain customers , The excellent customer service provided by the hotel staff members especially those working at the Amba Lounge e g Amare Mercedes We stayed for 3 nights so we got chance to observe unluckily some very demanding rude customers during the breakfast hours Amare dealt with those customers with extreme patience made sure every customer was happy I wish everyone working at hospitality would be professional like Amare Mercedes was the quiet lady working super efficiently in the lounge After breakfast hours She was able to clean up the lounge within 20 mins From Amare Mercedes every staff member we dealt with at Amba hotel Marble Arch I saw the high quality high standard of its management team Also I would recommend the Executive Room to people who wants to book this hotel You would regret the money you pay because you get to have so many complimentary stuff including buffet breakfast in room mini bar access to the Amba Lounge which gives you free coffee tea soft drink alcohol fruits until 10 30pm every day What a great place to rest after you spend whole day in shopping 
290205,Amba Hotel Marble Arch, We paid to use the executive club however we found the breakfast room very crowded and rather hectic the staff did their best but I think it needs expanding and more tables and staff, The room was very quiet clean nice decor good size bathroom lovely

290214,Amba Hotel Marble Arch, We ordered from external resturant and the delivery man in casual clothing not a uniform came all the way to our room which never happened to me elsewhere always I get a call to pick up from the reception Felt it was not safe To be fair delivery was from a third party so maybe they knew the company Another thing you ll not always find a guard standing The hotel was so crowded and anyone not staying in the hotel and come lifts without acess cards without being noticed Found that not safe comparing to other hotels I ve been in London , Location perfect for exploring London and shopping Alot of close by Halal resturants Concierge
290215,Amba Hotel Marble Arch, Nothing in particular, I liked the reception person who checked me in I liked that I was given an available room although I arrived at 7 00 am this was exceptionally great and greatly appreciated after 8 hours flight The showers have been upgraded and this was nice

290310,Amba Hotel Marble Arch, Despite the friendly staffs somehow whenever i contact the lobby or even the operator no one seemed to answer Regarding the facility it is invonvinient that whenever we want to go down we have to use the stairs because there are no escalators and if you want to use the lift it is quite far this is quite a concern especially for the elderly In my previous stays before Amba the room seemed bigger that it is today, The location is great as it is close to the shops and the hotel staffs are friendly The room is clean and the espresso coffee machine in the room is wonderful In addition I find the breakfast is good

290313,Amba Hotel Marble Arch, I havf been staying in this property for the past almost 40 years when i come to London But i am disappointed with no improvements of the lifts facilities Only four lifts to transport the whole hotel of 8 flours of which at least one of the lefts stayes out of order for a long time and quite often two out of order in the same time This what happened to us for the whole week we stayed in I can tell you you can wait for long long time to get a ride down Another thing the breakfast resturant is quit busy and line could strech all the way to the reception area waiting to get in so see little food veriaty Better to have your breakfast outside , Location is great Colse to shopping 
290314,Amba Hotel Marble Arch, Road works all around the entrance made it hard and dangerous to cross the street getting in and out of the hotel Not friendly staff and I found it very expensive after all that s not what you would call a luxury hotel , it was clean and the location was good 
290315,Amba Hotel Marble Arch, This is a big hotel and feels often overcrowded especially at breakfast time I do not appreciate vaporisers sprayer that you smell everywhere In my opinion very artificial Very limited window opening not possible to get much fresh air in My room was very quiet but if you get a room from Oxford Street site I suppose it may be quite noisy When I stayed there 2 lifts were broken out of 4 so it was a long time waiting we stayed 6th or 7th floor , Location is fantastic if you are up for some shopping at Oxford Street area however it is easy to manoeuvre from here all over London If you decide for breakfast for 12 pounds you will not be disappointed But it will be crowded recommended to go early Reception and concierge very helpful and quick There is Costa shop inside the hotel And 5 minutes walk from the hotel there is Winter Wonderland with loads of food stalls and crazy themed rides that in my opinion is definitely recommended to visit if you stay here hydeparkwinterwonderland com 
290316,Amba Hotel Marble Arch, I liked this hotel because of the location however under previous management room and bathroom had adequate space according to London standard but now under new management they have knocked out couple of square feet from each room to make way for extra rooms per floor This congested the space for 2 people if travelling with luggage , Rooms had all modern amenities for business or couple travelers but it was with a twist fixture and fittings as if it was supplied by DIY Because of location it will be my preference
