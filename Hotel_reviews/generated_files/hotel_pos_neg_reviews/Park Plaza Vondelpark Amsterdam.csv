359317,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, You have to get your luggage to your room in a round about way ask for help , Staff were very accomodating extra pillows towels chairs Nice bar good room service On the tram line and a few blocks out of the noise of downtown 
359318,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The rooms had poor isolation and in my honest opinion not the standard I usually get in a 4 hotel It wasn t 20m2 like in the ad here on booking and the rug in the room wasn t very fresh, super friendly staff they definitely met my expectations and made us feel very welcome 
359319,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, No milk provided with kettle lack of privacy when using toilet, Located in a quiet area helpful staff easy access to public transport spacious and modern rooms
359320,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The breakfast was also really expensive and luke warm Only had it once but it was on our last day which killed it a bit I left all of mine and at 19 50 a day that s not amazing , The staff were so so so helpful and friendly booked our taxi to the airport Ordered us a pizza at 3am Always smiley always say hello Very very good Made sure we were comfortable nothing was ever too much trouble and everyone went out of their way to help us and deliver things to our room Our room was upgraded for free upon arrival which was a lovely gesture and it was absolutely gorgeous Located in the old building it was really nice and quiet 
359321,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, No complaints , The location of the hotel was slightly outside of the main city but everywhere was easily accessible via the tram system If you would prefer to stay in a quiet and tranquil part of the city nearby a beautiful park then this is he place for you 
359322,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The cleaners need to pay more attention to things like cobwebs, The area around the accommodation is fantastic lovely cafes shops and parks Makes for a nice walk into central Amsterdam
359323,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Bathroom door transparent no bedside sockets very squeaky chair Charged the room to my card when I was paying cash so was charged a fee and also lost money through exchange, Spacious room clean great location
359324,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The gym I was not really interested in , The vondel park plaza sadly had no restaurant However you could get bar food but with limited choice However the bar staff were very obliging All staff were excellent and pleasant 
359325,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, My room was dark from both day light and room light point of views and not so quiet for morning nap And the room vs bathroom arrangement was unusual and unpractical a very small sink was placed directly in the room with no alternative in the bathroom , Cleanliness of the room the lovely neighborhood of the hotel with a big park and the lavish variety and quality of the breakfast and last but not least the friendliness of the staff 
359326,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Paid for the queen superior room which was very small not worth the money I took a shower the second day of my stay and the carpet outside the glass became damp and smelly when I approached the staff about this problem they said it was the toilet over flowing They relocated me to a generic room with no compensation for the hassle the second room was uncomfortable and I did not enjoy my last stay at this hotel Other than that the overall stay was perfect the area was relaxing and central to everything ,No Positive
359327,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Open style shower toilet not separate from the bedroom Not ideal when there is two of you We weren t actually aware of this when booking so was a bit of a surprise when we turned up , The location and the staff were very friendly and helpful 
359328,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Not being able to use the elevator to get to the lowest level before walking through the pathway to the extension elevator Carrying luggage up and down one flight of stairs is inconvenient The breakfast fee was far too expensive so we opted out and enjoyed the local bakery instead , The room was modern clean and comfortable The staff were very friendly and helpful Great location with tram 2 right out front to go to all the major plazas as well as central train station 
359329,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The doors to all the rooms and corridors slammed when closing made it difficult to get to sleep at an early time as each time someone returned to their room they d wake the entire floor , The wifi was excellent 
359330,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Staff member who checked us in was so unwelcoming it shaded our whole experience Made us feel singled out and as if we don t belong Weren t helped with our big bags either I paid with card asking for a separate damage deposit is absolutely ridiculous It was one night ,No Positive
359331,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The fact that they refused to cancel breakfast we were leaving early the next morning for Venice even though we requested to do so about 18 hours prior The breakfast is also nothing special and the price ridiculous Only negative about this hotel , It is close to the park and about 200 meters from the tram stops making trips in and around Amsterdam extremely easy The staff were very friendly and helpful A conveniently situated and comfortable hotel 
359332,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, I had requested an early check in 3 months previously and at nonpoint was I told this was not possible, Elemis bathroom products stylish design hard working staff
359333,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, It would have been value for money if they had included breakfast in the price as 19 50 Euros is pricey when u can get a cheaper breakfast nearby, Liked being very close to vondel park especially as the weather was so nice in June Close to tram and about 15 min walk to museums
359334,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The noise from the cleaner getting equipment out in the morning which woke us All the lights in the room on one switch which meant we woke each other up in the night when using the bathroom, The comfort of the bed The location by the park and proximity to local coffee shops and restaurants
359335,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Wasn t as close to the centre as we hoped for it to be but it was just down the road from a tram stop that came in very handy , The hotel was beautiful and very clean in a quiet location the bed was perfect
359336,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, No lift or escalator to the connecting building cases have to be lugged up and down stairs Also rather expensive , Superb situation on the perimeter of Vondelpark and within walking distance to the tram which takes you into the centre The hotel is ideally situated in a quiet neighbourhood and features free wifi Staff very friendly and helpful 
359337,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, this pictures on booking com do not show the current status of the hotel This is NOT a 4star hotel the rooms a very tiny i booked a double twin bed superior room it was not ready and after changing rooms 2 times they were very old and one had the toilet behind a glassdoor in the room we finally got a room that was very tiny but at least modern , nice location 2 min walk to vondelpark and to tram
359338,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Overnight noise doors banging and corridors easily transmitting voices to be expected though as assume people leaving to get flights , Excellent breakfast Able to adjust room temperatures easily Very comfy beds Friendly staff 
359339,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, I am afraid my room was not 4 star quality as 1 of my slatted blinds was damaged and too much light was able to come through The kettle was tatty there were some scuff marks on the walls the base of the bed had scuff marks too The view from the side window was of the roof with bits of broken concrete I really felt the room was 3 star at a push The only full length mirror was inside the wardrobe and the door would not stay open so was alomost impossible to use the mirror I was very dissapointed with my room , Staff as they were well presented and polite The Location was perfect Cleanliness was excellent The hotels Vibe bar was relaxing with a pleasent outlook from its veranda 
359340,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Small room sloped roof light shining in poor blind and curtains Carpet pretty stained and just seems tired , Friendly reception staff Breakfast area and buffet breakfast nice but 19 euros is a little overpriced 
359341,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, A little noisy There is no clock in the room The breakfast is expensive so we did not check it out May have been worth it , Friendly helpful staff Very clean Has a room safe A little over a mile to Old Town but we like to walk and you can walk the whole way in beautiful Vondel Park The metro tram runs right past the hotel 
359342,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Not many places to eat in the immediate vicinity so need to enjoy a walk or tram ride Doors very noisy and were slammed a lot by staff so not a good place to sleep in , Close to tram and beautiful Vondelpark Only two tramstops to VanGogh museum Quiet street and lovely safe neighbourhood
359343,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The bathrooms were see through so if you share a room with someone just be careful because you ll be seeing each other go to the toilet shower bath , The room was massive the staff were happy and helpfully really enjoyed my stay 
359344,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, There is no bath room in a room Bed is separated from a toilet and shower by thin glass with a slightly mat strip in the middle It is not top to bottom meaning you can hear everything what is going on which is very uncomfortable if you do not travel on your own , Good British Breakfast however it is slightly overpriced 
359345,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The see through bathrooms The beds were 2 pushed together and had an uncomfortable lining underneath, The rooms were nice and big The beds were lovely and bright
359346,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, There was nothing I disliked, The beds were extra comfy the toiletries excellent quality Elemis staff really friendly and helpful Being close to the beautiful Vondelpark was perfect The breakfast was also of superb standard 
359347,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The bathroom No privacy at all The bathroom is part of the room It is made of glass walls and everything is visible trough them There is space between the glass doors and the ceiling so not quite a bathroom The owners should definitely fix this problem The canal smell in the room That was a problem as the only reversible window could not be fully opened The breakfast has no variety The omlette is tasteless Same menu every morning I would not choose the breakfast next time especially that it s very easy to get to a nearby restaurant Not worth it The price is too high for the services Not quite 4 star services , The personnel is very very polite and helpful We received guidance for the city and there were no issues during our stay Perfect location The hotel is in a rezidential area The tram no 2 is right in front and takes you directly to all Amsterdam highlights on the same route with Rijkmuseum van Gogh Dam square etc Also there are shops and restaurants next to the hotel The cleanliness Every day the towels were changed and the room was very clean Very comfortable beds clean sheets and towels Our room at the 5th floor mansard had a lot of light I liked that 
359348,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Our room was difficult to reach from the lobby we needed to go down the stairs and take a lift just to arrive on the same level as reception there was no direct lift walking access to the same floor so having several luggage pieces it was not easy Breakfast just one objection the chocolate cream was really not tasty at least for Nutella lovers , The room was a bit different the bathroom was separated by a glass wall so I could watch TV while in the bathtub D Water was hot enough nice pressure lots of TV channels comfy bed and lots of pillows Iron safe coffee tea all was there Also the breakfast was generous Reception staff was very friendly especially night staff Very close to the park 10min walk to Rijksmuseum 3 min walk to tram stop 
359349,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Our twin room had uncomfortable mattresses and the room was small and the air con didn t work, Very helpful staff especially as we had a problem with the first night s room
359350,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, I was accommodated in a room below the category that I paid for to my question why the room looks different from what I booked I heard that they sold another building 4 days ago as it is not professional I do not want to return to this hotel ,No Positive
359351,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The glass toilet shower room so while lying in bed you can see hear all that your partner is doing in there Very expensive for what you get The tea making facility and kettle are next to the bed inches away from the pillow in my opinion not safe and not convenient , The rooms are clean and staff very polite the tram stop is very close to Hotel so easy to travel 
359352,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Nothing , The staff s quality of the English language was amazing they really went out of their way to help us with tourist information and spent 10 minutes explaining lots of useful things even though there was a queue waiting to check in We thought this was really lovely Everybody from the cleaning staff to the hotel desk staff were lovely to us and made our stay even more enjoyable 
359353,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Location was beautiful but took a little longer than I thought to get to the centre but the tram stop was just a 5min walk and took around 20 minutes to get to the centre, The bed was amazingly comfortable The best sleep ive had in a long time
359354,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The hotel is not a patch on those in London to which we are regular customers The room bathrooms are just not acceptable as a glass box within the room This hotel is not a 4star as it is advertised , Location
359355,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The room was far to small no room to move The shower was hanging off the wall stayed before and enjoyed my stay don t think I would stay here again Feel let down and not very happy, Not much this time
359356,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The amount I paid for the room at this hotel was daylight robbery and yes I am taking account of the fact it was Easter Has I have paid half of what I did it would still have been expensive for what I got but more realistic The room had a see through bathroom which is apparently the hotels concept I queried why this wasn t mentioned on the website but they said they can t as people wouldn t stay as no body likes it they had a limited amount of rooms without that type of bathroom but unfortunately we weren t first in the q to be moved The worst part about this bathroom was the drain mildew smell that filled the whole room the room was also incredibly dark the only main light was in the bathroom meaning very little light in the actual room , The location was fab the staff particularly the bar staff were excellent the food was very good
359357,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Our phone nor safe worked in our room and when we told the front desk they never sent anyone to repair them , I love the neighborhood in which this property is located It checked off every box was close enough to central location of everything but far enough to enjoy a totally different vibe The tram ride was 15 minutes tops and it ran very frequently Never waited more than 10 minutes 
359358,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, When we checked in the receptionist wasn t in the least bit friendly or helpful , The bedroom was comfortable clean well equipped with good use of space 
359359,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Since there are also Asian guests in the Hotel there can be some Asian Indian Breakfast added Eggs can be done in different styles , Some more varieties of Croissants can be added 
359360,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Being given a tiny single room for 2 OAPs Which they called an Executive room It was furnished with a large bed against one wall one would have had to crawl over to get into bed just enough space to pass on the other side SHOCKING Requested a quiet room After complaint we were given a slightly bigger room Comment definitely not Park Plaza standard A really big disappointment And certainly not value for money , Public areas very pleasant
359361,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, NA, Great location few minutes walk to Valeriusplein stop Easy to get to by taxi or uber if you are on a night out in Leidseplein or checking exhibitions and arts in Museumplein Vondelpark is stone s throw away and 30 40 minutes walk to Centrum If you want to go a little further away from the hustle and bustle but convenient to get to and from check this hotel 
359362,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The bathroom wasn t very private as there are no walls around it just matt shower glass so my boyfriend had to go poop on the ground floor the first night Also our order for room service was not picked up but the staff more than made up for it by allowing us to check out late and bringing us breakfast in the room , We got upgraded to a better room because the original room we had booked was sold out The room was big and nicely decorated 
359363,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam,No Negative, The location was excellent only a few stops with the tram number 2 to the center of Amsterdam The staff was very friendly the room comfortable and cosy we haven t enjoy the bathroom no personal space and we hadn t not a vue of any kind from our windows only cigarettes Furthermore our rooms was in the basement and the absence of the elevetors or a bell boy was not a positive element Especially with our baggages
359364,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The room we stayed in was vlose to the main entrance so it was noisy and could hear the door banging all night as people walked in and out , Well situated close to the park and centre and great bike facility to rent bikes for the day 
359365,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The price is very very above their service quality When me and my wife got the hotel we offered to pay the amount before check in although it is not a requirement They said that we have to pay the hotel amount with a 50 eur deposit additionally although it was not mentioned in their website We did not approved that The staff was not friendly and helpful even the did not smile for once Especially the young guy at the reception is not well qualified We will never stay there again It is very very far away from everywhere even Vondelpark , The room was clean and the hotel is located at a silent district of the city 
359366,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Restaurant did not open for our stay although hotel was busy Food choices consisted of 5 choices of food in the bar which i must confess were more like readymeals but cost around 17euros each If you have a very small selection at least do them well Had a rather expensive superior room which was tiny and tbh naff Nothing would posess me to call this room superior and im still cross about the price we had to pay for it As the queen size bed was two singles pushed together with two single quilts , Pleasant staff stylish reception lounge and bar 
359367,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, I was charged twice once the price advertised on booking cOM and the hotel also chared me also 569 pounds I am very unhappy and never use booking Com again ,No Positive
359368,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The Bathroom having a glass door not good at all No privacy or sound proofing Please change the doors , Comfortable rooms good food friendly accomodating staff

359370,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, I didn t really like that the shower and toilet were in the bedroom and not in a separate bathroom because there wasn t much privacy when using the toilet and the steam from the shower steamed up the bedroom , The room was modern and the bed was really comfortable and it was huge Also loved the shower it was very spacious and modern The hotel is in a great location only a few tram stops from the centre too so you can stay nearby where it s quieter or go into the busy centre 
359371,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The room was tiny and not very clean We stayed 9 nights but bed linen was not changed even once , The hotel is near a big park not far away from the center of Amsterdam 
359372,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Didn t like the bathroom it was made of glass so you could see the person using the toilet On checkin reception asked us if we wanted to have our towels changed every day or if we would make do with the one set they gave us to be eco friendly Also we agreed to donate 3 euro to some charity instead of having our room serviced every day We were told that at any time we could have fresh towels just ask anyone at reception This was not the case at all We were there for 4 nights and never had our room serviced at all We got no towels changed no toilet paper no bins emptied The room was a mess as there s nowhere to put anything no shelves in bathroom for ur towels so we had to leave them on bedroom floor We twice asked at reception for our room to be serviced but they didn t do it When we were leaving we complained to them about this and they did nothing We were disgusted I would never stay here again The reception staff don t seem to communicate with the rest of the staff and no matter what we asked them they didn t know They look confused all the time Also the breakfast was very limited which is not how the hotel sells themselves Our room was outside the hotel in another building which was a annoying as it was raining every day and we had to wear our coats to breakfast every morning Another thing they don t tell you , The beds 
359373,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Not happy that the hotel have not given us our damage waiver back even after calling numberous times being told that I will receive an email and still haven t first told it would take 2days then 3 then once calling again told it would take 30 45days and still nothing Due to this I would not recommend this place because we have not been treated fairly, The hotel was perfect in a quiet area but still wishing distance to many trips out
359374,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The bathroom was glass and quite open in the room Fine as I was with my partner but not the best if ur in a new relationship or friends , Great staff Perfect venue Great value for money Really enjoyed my stay
359375,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, At these prices breakfast should really be included in our view , Nice friendly hotel in a great location in the prosperous west side of the city Tram route 2 stops right outside the door and goes right into town and up to the central station Tram travel is cheap into town esp if you buy rover style tickets by the day s The hotel also does reasonable bike hire too and the city centre is a 15 min leisurely cycle through the park Staff helpful rooms comfortable bar okay didn t choose to eat there so can t comment on the food We will definitely stay there again 
359376,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Nothing, The location of the hotel Vondel Park is just behind the hotel The hotel is 5 mins form tram that wifi take you to all the main spots in Amsterdam 
359377,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Some body came inn to are room and took are money while we were out side The hotel didn t do any thing about it I would never recomend this hotel to any won ,No Positive
359378,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The bathrooms were very uncomfortable due to glass wall and being with colleagues or relatives it makes it very uncomfortable , The Bed and pillows were great and also the room facilities
359379,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Size of bedroom size of bathroom No place to put suitcases not enough hanging space or shelf space for clothes only room for one chair in room , Cleanliness Location and staff
359380,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The walls of bathroom in the room were entirely glass which didn t really bother me and my partner but I wouldn t have liked it if I was staying with friends , The room clean and the bed was HUGE and very comfortable Bar staff were super friendly when we went for a drink 
359381,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff were so lovely and welcoming and very helpful when we was looking for directions and they helped us with the local transport the hotel was very clean and the breakfast was excellent with lots of different options the hotel is very close to central station about a 20 minuet tram journey which was perfect Excellent hotel 
359382,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The room we booked was not available but we were then apparently upgraded to an executive suite Small room dirty carpets and on 3rd floor with faulty lift Nothing like the pictures on Booking com website General cleanliness not up to standard but was handled appropriately from PRO perspective Bike rental expensive should be offered to customers as a service not for profit Breakfast good but minimal variety and after 7 days difficult to enjoy, Situated in a good area Easy access to museums etc
359383,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Booked a suite I extra bed consited on 2 singled pushed together Orange stained carpet Mould in the bathroom Seating area consited of 2 arm chairs Faded fabric Mineral water that was supposed to be conplimentary as part of the upgraded room was charged for on my credit card Just under 500 to stay here could have got hotels for 250 said we would treat ourselves and were left disapointed I wouod not recommend to anyone It is sold as something completely different to what it actually is ,No Positive

359386,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The lift was out of order and we were on the 4th floor steep stairs The staff were apologetic on arrival but we were not informed in advance anyone with any issues with walking or fitness would not have been able to get up the stairs The room was so so hot and the heating controls didn t work This was rectified after we complained at reception but we had an uncomfortable night of what must have been 30degrees plus Water in the room costs 5 euros so I recommend you take your own plus the drinks at the hotel bar were really pricey approx 12 euros for a G T , The room was a great size with a huge bed The shower wet room was clean and new The hotel is really close to the museum district and there are some great restaurants within a 5 minute walk 
359387,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The lift didn t work the 3 night we was there Taking our suitcases up and down 3 flights of sprial stairs was a massive pain and really dangerous Also carpet in room very dirty, Our room was lovely and the bed very comfy with great views

359394,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, On arrival we were given the smallest room in the hotel as said by a member of staff despite paying and questioning the queen superior room we had booked and paid for The furniture was old and worn the bathroom barely fitted one person and there was a dead fly on the bed sheets We then had to call reception And explain our problem to which the response was oh yes you have the smallest room in the hotel but I can show you 2 others so we had to take our own luggage back down to reception and wait to be accommodated to a room we should ve been given straight away We weren t compensated for any of this , The Queen superior room we ended up in was lovely and as shown on the pictures The gym facilities were lovely and the reception area was modern and clean

359412,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Well firstly when we checked in they didn t have the room we had booked which was a queen size double bed room instead we were given a very grotty very small twin room their excuse well they said booking though booking com are only suggestions not guarantees but they did have nicer rooms that we could pay extra for surprise surprise After complaining the room really was very poor and not what we paid for they changed us on the second day of stay to the room we had booked a queen size double bed room Which was nice and we then thought happy days nevermind about first day mistakes happen That was until we got the bill they charged us over 25 more for the stay that what was agreed when I booked the room In short we didn t get the quality of room we d booked and on top of that they charged us a lot more for it than the price quoted when booking in fact it cost more than if i d just walked off the street and got a room I ll never stay there again and I would recommend others not to either , Nothing really stood out but to be honest because I feel ripped off by them it going to cloud my opinion on this I m sure they re not all bad 
359413,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam,No Negative, We liked absolutely everything not one for fault We were so happy with the hotel the survice room staff everything We stayed for my husbands birthday and they left balloons card and cake in our room was just fantastic The hotel was about a 10 min tram journey to the central station but we loved being on the tram 
359414,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Location was out of the hustle and bustle but within walking distance through the beautiful park Tram service was a 2 minute walk away and never waited more than 5 minutes for one , Excellent facilities beautiful modern rooms but still cosy 
359415,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, My room was in another building which requires going outside of the main hotel Room and common areas desperately needs an in depth clean especially carpet Lighting in room and bathroom is awful I wouldn t want to be a woman putting make up on or needing a full length mirror Breakfast eggs are inedible but the rest is quite good , Good quiet location with easy access to town 
359416,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The bathroom was way too compact with only a tiny space to squeeze past the sink into the shower or toilet Couldn t close the door whilst using the sink Would use this hotel again but only if upgraded to a bigger room Breakfast was quite expensive , Very upmarket area close to the Vondelpark Excellent buffet breakfast Close to tram line Very friendly and helpful staff Nicely decorated trendy and well equipped rooms Really liked the glass bathroom 
359417,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Had to change room as original room smelled very badly of smoke Nothing was proposed by way of compensation for the inconvenience caused Whilst a new room was provided we didnt have access until the afternoon Not a good experience, Breakfat good
359418,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Room was strange large shower and toilet but small room Also shower toilet was not fully separated from rest of room which was very odd , Location is good quiet area but with the 2 tram close by Vondelpark also right next door which is lovely
359419,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Four star rating does not feel correct more two three star Bright pink doors everywhere and you feel you have walked in to an eightys timewarp The decor is worn chipped marked and beds had black tape on the scuffs holes watermarks present from leaking radiators Bath chipped all over bottom bathrooms based in bedrooms smelt of drains , Staff very nice and good location Restaurant on site
359420,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, We arrived at 4pm and still had to wait for our room to get ready although check in was at 2pm We kept having a bad smell come and go in the room through the stay The room was freezing cold when we arrived didn t really warm up even with the radiator on , The reception staff gave us an old umbrella when we checked out as it was pouring rain 
359421,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The toilet The walls are Windows It is difficult to live with It Another thing is the shower Split some water off Expensive food , Good bed great room good service Public transport very good 
359422,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Total false advertising Rooms very small just to fit a bed with sink in the room and a very small so called bathroom with just shower and toilette Not clean Priced as if they offer quality accomodation when in fact it is poor , The park is nice Location is far from center
359423,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The doors were very noisy slamming closed and there must have been what I assume was construction work in some of the rooms which started very early,No Positive
359424,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Reception Staff were painfully slow both at check in and check out No breakfast included in the already very high price Bed was not firm and pillows hollow Hotel is too far out from the centre , The room was lovely and very nicely decorated There was good storage and a beautiful bay window Bar area was lovely and bar staff very nice 
359425,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Our room It was scandalous I saw so many fantastic rooms online that were 12 20 metres squared and we were so disappointed to be wedged into a room we clearly did not book or pay for There was no picture on the website of such a poor room The bed is squashed into the corner so you can only get out on one side which is inches from a bathroom door so standing up is awkward There is just enough room below the bed for a table chair and your bags to not be hit by the door being opened I had booked two rooms and the other couple were given a room that was tunneled to another building a few metres away We went to see if they were okay with theirs as well and it was enormous It was the exact thing we came to expect only that we did not get such a beautiful room Further i had ordered a drink at the bar for my girlfriend a gin and tonic which later i found out on the bill was 14 I was given no prior warning to how expensive it would be residents bars at fancy hotels usually are more expensive but it was labelled as an open cocktail While it looked fantastic nobody asked him to arrange a fantastic looking display when lets be honest what we wanted was basic alcohol and merryness His saving grace was his quintessential politeness and professionalism we did feel aristocratic Placement Now I have been to Amsterdam a few times so i know my way around This hotel is a bit away from the city centre we walked from the train station to the hotel in about an hour at a leisurely pace so my friends could see the city The trams do bring you to Dam square city centre however if you are a bit apprehensive travelling on the trams always using maps maybe get somewhere closer You can pay for day passes approx 2 40 2 day passes and weekly passes that can be used for the damrak trams and buses to get to anywhere in the city, We were a two minute walk left of the hotel front door from a side entrance into Vondelpark right into the heart of it which was bustling full of people who were running roller blading out for walk and cycling of course It was the first morning we traveled into the park to have breakfast on the edge of the water The Hotel itself had a stylish contemporary reception with hanging egg chairs that were very comfortable and relaxing Just down to the right of the hotel entrance was a tram stop for two different trams to bring us toward the city centre 
359426,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, It wasn t completely renovated but the part we stayed in was It was fine though there was no construction or anything going on during our stay , It was in a fantastic residential part of town with lots of local shops and eateries Also very convenient to the 2 tram which you could take just about anywhere 
359427,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff are very welcoming and helpful Everyone speak English and it s just the best place to be The actual location itself is very Peaceful and convenient to public transport 
359428,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Didn t like the size of the room It wasn t as clean as expected , The staff were so helpful and the location was good just a 15 minute tram journey into dam square
359429,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Would have liked a king bed as asked for Got 2 singles pushed together Would have liked to been higher up as ground floor was a bit of noise from the lift Room no 6, Staff where fantastic and breakfast was excellent Trams in and out to central every few mins almost on hotel steps
359430,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Very disappointed for value for money photos were absolutely nothing like the rooms room very dated with cheep facelift Even the hall ways felt like a hostel with pink hand rails Double bed wasn t available on arrival so had to sleep in separate bed form partner If i was told it was a 2 star I would have said it was perfect but it was the worst 4 star hotel iv ever seen , Staff were helpful was clean 2 min walk from tram stop in very peaceful part of city and right next to park 
359431,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Room and hotel very dated old Furniture and not at all Modern , The Staff was very helpful and i want to thank them for that All of them Receptionists were great and the manager as well Room was very big WIFI great 
359432,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The pictures on booking com are misleading and not accurate at all Very disappointing as my room felt out of date no value for money The carpet in the hallway contains waterstains Room with twin beds feels a bit uncomfortable when relaxing Same goes for the TV that s close to the ceiling Non Dutch speaking staff no problem for me besides feeling annoyed when ordering your dinner in English because the kitchen staff doesn t speak Dutch , Quiet room and nice food 
359433,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The first night we were put in an awful room that looked nothing like the pictures The staff on duty didn t care that wasn t what we paid for Luckily the next morning the staff were much nicer and moved us to a correct room Only half the rooms have been renovated to look like the photos , Good location near the tram line to get into the center and right next to a beautiful park Good price compared to other hotels 
359434,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Room is small to handle big luggage Bathroom doors not closing Main door lock could not be locked from inside The bathroom fittings of gold colour were gaudy for my taste , Comfortable bed Location close to tram stop In room convenience like kettle etc good 
359435,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Double charged my card leaving me without money when I got home money taken from room broken shower and no response from management When I complained, Beautiful city
359436,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Room was smelly you could smell sewerage from our room and we had the last room available the staff were lovely about it but it wasnt a cheap hotel the location was really far from the main center but in a residential area so nice and quiet definitely not 4 stars in my standards the room was tired and the dust was really bad probably stayed in a cleaner travelodge was just ok , Staff were lovely very friendly and in a beautiful location of Amsterdam 
359437,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Empty minibar Poor Breakfast, Good location not in the croud part of center but not far near big park museums and shops Big rooms nespresso coffee
359438,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The bathroom in my bedroom had frosted glass walls This did not make a difference to me as I was travelling alone but in double occupancy situations some visitors might feel a little uncomfortable with that , Hotel is in a quiet and affluent location and is about 15 mins stroll from Van Gogh Museum No 2 and 16 trams also stop very close to the hotel Vondelpark which is behind the hotel is a a large city park and is a really nice place to spend an hour or so Self service breakfast was great and is served in a large bright room downstairs 
359439,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, It s the detail that does it no shower gel nowhere to place washing shampoo products in the shower except the floor Kept having to ask for extra coffee as only two sachets placed there each time minor things I know but should be sorted for a hotel of this standard , Great location by the park and easy access to the city centre Staff very helpful and room really comfortable 
359440,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The bedrooms are pretty poor although our bed was very comfortable The position of the room below street level not great What spoiled the room most however was a toilet and shower in the room behind a partially opaque glass partition which did not reach the ceiling Never seen anything like this before , Breakfast was good and the facility for the sister hotel close to our point of departure to store our cases was much appreciated 
359441,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Why have a mini bar that s empty Whats the point as it only causes disappointment Move the TV having one in the centre of the room is an eyesore , Rooms very good barstaff reception staff were excellent breakfast was very good and the location was excelllent
359442,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Small rooms not as shown in pics small bathroom with transparent door which is located near the room exit door so one has to be careful entering and exiting the room if someones in the bathroom shower , VERY good location near to 3 tram stops Helpful and friendly staff
359443,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Bathroom was a joke Light over sink was very poor Sink too high REALLY frosted glass for bathroom wall and not one hook in bathroom to hang tolietries Rugs in hallway and bedroom desperately needed to be replaced Dirty and stained , Comfortable bed
359444,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Booked an executive king room but when walking into our room on arrival we saw we had two double beds pushed together but with separate bedding Went to reception to see if we could change but turned out their executive king rooms were fully booked and they had upgraded us to a business suite but with two single beds We were told to come back the following morning to see if any more rooms were available Went back to reception in the morning to inquire and were told that we could upgrade our room to one with a king sized bed for an extra 20 euros a night Not wanting to kick up a fuss and part with our money we thought we d just make do with existing room especially as we were only there for a couple of nights Despite the bed issue our room was great it was huge and had everything we needed Just a little annoying that we didn t get what was originally booked especially as we were paying good money , Bar staff really friendly Room cleaned everyday Great location super close to Vondelpark and a short walk to the museum district Area is quiet too as is a little further away from the main centre 
359445,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Not crazy about the glass wall bathroom We booked room only as this was the best deal and had planned on just paying for breakfast on the day but at 19 50 per person is crazy So we had to go into town each morning and got a great breakfast in the city centre on both days for less that 8 each Only downside Everything else was great , The staff were very nice They noticed on arrival on my ID that it was my birthday so without even asking they upgraded us to a very nice room and left a birthday card and some treats in the room for us Location is great 2 mins walk from the tram stop and only 5 10 minutes from city centre by tram Fridge in the room is great for bottles of water ect Rooms were spotless Were able to leave our bags in a safe area on day of check out until evening as we had a night time flight 
359446,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Nothing, the staff were very kind and did their best to assist us the breakfast was good the location is not that close to the center but very near tram station to the hotel helped 
359447,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The location was out of the centre city You needed to take a tram not walking distance More suburban area The hotel setup was also strange The rooms were in a building next to the reception that was access directly from the street It had more of a hostel feeling than hotel , The room was spacious with balcony looking onto the street 
359448,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Room service and bar food meant to be served until 11pm but unavailable at 10 25 as the staff member was on her own and was busy with orders from other guests She was so nice but hotel management should ensure that adequate staffing levels are in place Walls need repainting both in rooms and bedroom carpets and curtains need cleaning The curtains in the room we stayed in 43 whirlpool suite were dirty torn and missing hooks etc otherwise this room was great lots of space and fab bathroom , Staff were really helpful with excellent English wonderful location on team line 2 tickets can be purchased at the hotel same price as buying on the tram We did the 48hr pass for 12 50 each The room whirlpool suite was nice Bed kingsize and very comfy nice pillows bedding Breakfast is worth the money 15 euro if booked on arrival otherwise more on the morning Nice bar Bar has small terrace decked area Toiletries are fab Elemis Vondelpark is gorgeous Nice area little bakery chocolate shop wine shop just up street 
359449,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Carpets could use an upgrade textiles could be softer more inviting for rest , Vibe is just right location was excellent low key away from heavy tourism but vibrant with authentic Amsterdam action 
359450,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, There wasn t anything we didn t like, The staff were very welcoming we liked the bar being open a little late and it was a nice setting close to many shops bars and restaurants which you could walk or get the tram to 
359451,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Our room was by the lift which was very noisy with the cleaners using them a lot , Really nice area and great location was able to hire bikes which was fun 
359452,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, It s obviously an older property and could use a little sprucing up for instance in the room we were in the carpet and drapes were a bit threadbare the silvering on the bathroom mirror was worn off and the tile grout was stained , Staff was extremely courteous and friendly The room was very large had a desk and sitting area Bath robes and slippers were provided as well as coffee maker and mini fridge 
359453,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Not a great fan of having a glass bathroom door that doesn t lock , Very sizeable and comfortable bed Also a fan of the fridge and safe in the room
359454,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, For a hotel I expected them to have more travel adopters or tell me honestly they didn t have any instead of asking me to ask everyday without the staff prompting me themselves They took over an hour for them to bring an iron up which had made me late The staff also could of mentioned that the room we upgraded at our stay was next to building works I could hear work going on every morning and the fact I had paid more to upgrade was a joke , Cleanliness of the room
359455,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, 4 Very tired in need of a re vamp Tea coffee with powdered milk and wooden stirrers Internet keyboard with no mouse Location a bit far from town 20 mins on tram we had ground floor on the front being on a tram route not the best start to the day , Huge Jacuzzi and a full size tv
359456,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Breakfast not included and too much expensive, Location super in very posh area Excellent hotel beautiful bedroom and bathroom Shower bath was the top 
359457,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, There was a broken door handle couldn t lock door leading to the balcony Reminded hotel twice about this no action Finally caught a maintenance worker in the hallway who fixed it This was a security risk for a single woman who needs locked doors at night Also a moldy smell in the bathroom leaky washbasin , I liked the general hotel cleanliness and orderliness staff attitude location and breakfast buffet Lovely balcony overlooking the park quiet at night 
359458,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Tough to point out something that we didn t like Maybe the price of breakfast which we didn t book therefor we would have to pay 20 EUR We decided not to and choose the nearby bakery instead , The people were extremely helpful and kind not to mention the location which is 10 min from the Musem Quarter away If you are looking for a nice hotel with reasonable price the Park Plaza has to come into consideration 
359459,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Tv in the suite was jumping when playing music one of the lights looked half fixed and the noise from back of house was really clear throughout the suite , Bed was amazingly comfortable the suite was nice and the layout of the bar with terrace was a nice design
359460,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam,No Negative, staff were excellent and very helpful There is no fridge in the room so be aware unless you have a suite There is a 30mtre walk from the tram to the hotel Close to shops and restaurants in the quite area of amsterdam
359461,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The hotel needs a major overhaul the rooms are outdated dark not enough lights carpet dirty bathroom not practical The interesting part is that most reviews have the same complaints for the past years and the management does not seem to care to improve this place So based on thiese facts I will not come back and suggest others to do the same and spend your money on better places, The hotel is well located just minutes away from the overcrowded city center The rooms are spacious executive rooms This is in fact the only positive fact I can find 
359462,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, did not like the first room which was small and not convenient for the price paid 180e we had a prb with the tv and I mentioned that I was disappointed with the given room and we were offered to move to another one which was better modern tv bigger room , location possibility of bike renting
359463,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The hotel is a bit tired and could do with redecoration The bathroom has a glass wall so no privacy if you are sharing Strangely there was no information about the hotel in the room No ironing facilities Only two coat hangers in the wardrobe , The hotel is located about a 15 minute tram ride from Dam Square Staff were friendly 
359464,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam,No Negative, Rooms very spacious and modern good transport links to the centre of Amsterdam very close to the museum quarter Staff were very helpful with all enquiries
359465,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, A little bit overpriced it s a good 3 star hotel not quite 4 star , Exceptionally friendly staff very good location close to a tram stop nice area Easy access to places of interest 
359466,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, We booked a Superior Double Room and got a Tiny Twin Room The hotel s supervisor didn t even have the mood to do something When we insisted he just asked 25 euros additional charge per day So rooms were available but they just wanted to get rid off the tiny ones The hotel is definitely NOT a 4 star hotel Apart from that there was so much noise from the corridors The doors were hitting like if they were next to you head We would wake up at 8 every morning because of the doors The cleaning stuff was making so much noise as well We could here them talking and hitting doors Finally I will say it one more time take care the rooms are TINY and the supervisor is rude , The Hotel was next to Voldenpark 
359467,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, There was nothing to we didn t like keep up the good work , We would be pleased to pass on park plaza to other folk as we found it to suit our needs 
359468,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Although the room was not exactly the photos in the advertising I was told that the rooms had no distinction between standard and superior rooms I thought I had booked a superior but it may have been my error It was still roomy and perfectly OK , Staff were very helpful and welcoming I liked the fact I could open my window but it meant I did have a little street noise my choice even though at the back of the hotel Comfortable bed and fantastic location easy to get to city centre on Tram 2 five minutes walk not two to tram stop I would stay again when in Amsterdam 
359469,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Night staff not very friendly also unhelpful Broken hairdryer Switches not working I asked for an extra blanket the a c has only cold setting the desk sent it 1 hour later also implied on the phone that maybe we have an extra person in the room , The desk lended us an umbrella that helped a lot Wifi is also good Location not that much close the Park but far away from the center 
359470,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Nothing negative to say about this place , The location is the best in amsterdam In a quiet area near the tram stop and near the vondelpark The staff also very welcoming Comfortable and big room with everything you need Great bathroom and shower Would stay here again no doubts 
359471,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam,No Negative, The area was just lovely residential but with nice bars and restaurants Perfect for walking around and very close to the City Centre The room was comfortable and good sized for Amsterdam standards 
359472,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Every thing in this hotel bad I visit the other branch and i have lunch there they have different service the only common between both hotels the name, Most bad hotel experience in my life 
359473,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, It was surprisingly far from town centre we had tiny room 1m from a both bed sides with a toilet in the room literally in the room without the wall only some partial glass fancies , park across the street
359474,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, This hotel is very very tired They should not be calling themselves a 4 star There is not even a hook to hang a towel on after you ve showered There are marks all over the walls and tiles blinds broken on the windows really poor lighting system and the list goes on and on , Great location with easy access to a main tram line and situated in a great neighbourhood bordering Vondelpark
359475,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The modern bathroom and toilet is separated from the room by a 3 4 high glass wall This is bound to give problems if you re not usually using a toilet together The ventilation is a joke so you can imagine the unpleasant side effects of a bathroom visit , Perfect location near the Vondelpark and relatively close to the city center 
359476,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, We made an order at the Vondelpark branch of the hotel our reservation was for 2 executive rooms with a connecting door and it was confirmed to us by the hotel via booking com prior to our arrival Upon arrival we have discovered that the hotel does not have such rooms After no other alternative Was available we have agreed not to completely ruin our vacation to take a suite at the Victoria hotel at the city center Needless to say this had significantly negative impacted our vacation stepping out to the Vondelpark area is a lot different than stepping out to Damrak street especially with a child with a disability for which the Vondelpark location was chosen to begin with , The staff and service was fine
359477,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, As we were not a couple the Huge Bed was unsuitable and a folding bed was provided for one of us There was little room to move around the room with the huge bed and folding bed Glass doors on bathroom meant no privacy Elevator noise was constant , The staff were very helpful particularly Patrick at reception and the barman The location was excellent and is right next to the Vondelpark Balcony was a bonus 
359478,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The room was very disapointing We expected to see a very nice room like the pictures but nothing match It was very old dated the window didn t closed well the bidet was broken the carpet looked very old and dirty corners in the bathroom very dirty the lamps full of dust the duvet cover had a strange smell the little fridge in the room didn t work at all and it was extremily noise We could hear the conversation of other guests on the corridor at any time and all the steps from the room above us plus the continuous tram with poor window isolation and because of that we were not able to sleep well The location its ok easy to go from one place to another with the tram but still there isn t much around Unfortunately the hotel pictures you can see at booking com or the hotel web is not the reality for the bedrooms , The staff was very polite and friendly They helped us with everything we needed Very happy people We have never seen a place with such amazing staff The breakfast was very good had different choices and good food quality 
359479,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The buffet breakfast is too expensive , Right near Vondel Park 1 block from the trams Staff is very helpful with directions and services Beds are great especially if you get an Executive Room Love the rooms in the old part with balconies over looking the park 
359480,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The corridor outside our room was a bit smelly Coffee and tea facilities in the room but no milk provided , Comfortable rooms free wifi nice toiletries 
359481,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, There wasn t really anything to complain about apart from the 50 euro holding deposit and city tax that I wasn t aware of , The young girl Amber was very helpful and loverly Beds were very comfy and room nice and clean
359482,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Slightly damp smell in the corridors but no whiff of this in the room itself , The room and staff were the best part of our stay the location is good too Always friendly and a room that was VERY comfy and well thought out 
359483,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The room I had looked a little tired in places it s probably time for a refresh however it was clean and everything available in the room worked , Excellent location for museum quarter and Vondel Park Plus stop for tram 2 5 which services all the main locations in Amsterdam is very close by Excellent breakfast and a good basic fitness centre should you wish to use it Staff are also very helpful and knowledgeable about the area 
359484,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The rooms with the bathrooms in slightly weird I think it s why our first room smelled weird a wet room that s not properly a wet room as the only surround is a frosted glass which is ok if your a couple but if your sharing with friends that frosting covers nothing and yes we are friends but that does nt mean we need to hear each other on the toilet Slightly awkward and meant one of us would use the toilet and the other would go downstairs Carpets need updating showing signs of wear, Extremely helpful friend staff room attendance ease of access to facilities Stunning location loads of local places to go eat Vondelpark is beautiful great place to walk around and take pictures tram line to the centre of Amsterdam takes about 29 mins 2 90 ticket for an hours travel if 7 50 for 24hr ticket for some weird reason Uber is illegal But everyone used it plus from the airport to the hotel via uber it cost us 20 rather than the 42 Via regular taxi Great that the staff organise my friends birthday breakfast food was amazing 
359485,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, We specifically ordered in advance a twin room traveled with my nephew yet when we arrived we were allocated to a double room The staff brought in an extra bed and we were promised to change to a twin room on the following day We ended up staying in the double room though because it had a double balcony Some of the items tea coffee creamer glasses and some of the towels were not replaced on a daily basis I would probably categorize it as a 3 star hotel The fourth one must be due to the location , The location is fabulous in a high class neighborhood quite close to the center but without all its noise and bustle Many upscale establishments nearby cafe s restaurants chocolatier etc The proximity to the Vondelpark is precious 
359486,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, We were given a twin bed room for a young couple not very suitable Our booking was for twin double and double was requested This wasn t even mentioned to us at check in Was too tired to even request to change rooms The rooms were quite old and dull looking definitely needs a refurbish Would only come back here for the staff , The staff were awesome very helpful and informative Not far from Tram stop which was super helpful and this was our main transport of getting around considering taxis are a rip off not to mention half the taxis didn t even have taxi metres 
359487,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The standards of the facilities are actually closer to a good 3 stars than to a 4 stars the en suite bathroom was a rather small box and it was not entirely closed , Close to the Museum Area and the City Center The area was calm and silent in the night The staff was nice and helpful The breakfast was rather expensive but close by there is a very good resto caf with fair prices 
359488,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam,No Negative, We spent three lovely days on our honeymoon here The staff were particularly helpful in finding a room to our liking Quiet location just minutes away from the busy hub of the center of town Two minutes to the tram station from the hotel leaving every five minutes or so Five to ten minutes later you are in the town center 
359489,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam,No Negative, The common spaces could be refurbished and more clean The elevator doors wouldn t open in the 3rd floor when we ask for it so many times we descend by stairs The acoustic isolation was as I think inexistent So I could easily ear all conversation and sex of next door As they could ear mine Never the less the front desk did give us a bathroom renovated room when we complain in the check in Breakfast was good with some variety but isn t worth the 20 person standard price You might consider low this to 12 50 1st night discount price as it is an important issue when choosing hotel and you might be loosing room occupation 
359490,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, I was not able to make it there on time and had to pay one night stay after I tried to cancel the reservation and could not find the confirmation number,No Positive
359491,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam,No Negative, The hotel is not too far from the central museum square and tram is available towards the central I loved the refreshing drinks which are kept at the reception which you can sip everytime you leave and come back 
359492,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, This hotel did not reflect how it looked on web site or the price paid we were supposed to end our European bike trip with two days here we only stayed one night We were so disappointed and had just driven 6 hours There was a horrible smell on entering which unfortunately was in the rooms as well The first room we were given was small cramped and very grubby I decided that I had to say something despite hating complaining The young guy was very helpful and showed us a bigger room which was bit better although very grubby bad smell and had the toilet and shower partitioned behind a glass box I told them that I would only stay for one night which was agreed To be honest we just wanted away as quick as possible couldn t stand the smell We booked another hotel for the last night and paid less and there was no comparison If this hotel had cost less we would still have left due to the smell and cleanliness Staff were lovely but this hotel needs a good clean and fix up The dining room was better This affected our last two days at the end of what had been a great trip Still love Amsterdam , I am really sorry to say our experience of this hotel was not good young guy at desk was very helpful and nice despite that 
359493,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Open style bathroom No wall from floor to ceiling to bathroom toilet Sink in bedroom Smelly corridors and sewage smell in room sometimes also in lobby ,No Positive

359496,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, No fault of hotel but wish location had a bit more going on in terms of restaurants and bars , There was a problem with our room so we let a member of staff know We were then upgraded to a bigger room which we weren t expecting Also the size and comfort of the bed was amazing after all the walking we did it was a blessing 
359497,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Since my train was leaving in the early evening the next day I asked whether I could book a late check out I was told there wouldn t be a problem since there were enough rooms available and I only needed to ask again next morning So when I did all of a sudden a late check out was not possible and the clerk did not even bother to check the system and was quite rude also the bathroom was inside the room only separated by glass walls this was not clearly stated before the booking, at least it is relatively quiet
359498,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The hallways need some work the red carpet and horrible pink doors were not great and there was often a funny and somewhat unpleasant smell , The room was nice and quite spacious with a great shower The bar area was nice too 
359499,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Slightly further from the center than we thought but in a pleasant residential area with good restaurants Also close to Vondelpark You can walk through the park to the museum district , Very stylish and comfortable with excellent facilities On tram route 2 which goes right through to central station 
359500,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Fridge didn t work sink plug didn t work bath plug was replaced with aftermarket one and was very hard to get to as the bath was so big Bits of left over weed still under the bedside tables under bed Trams noisy going past with there horns every 6 mins 20 hours a day , Jacuzzi bath very relaxing after walking all day
359501,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, My room wasn t ready when I checked in at 2 30pm, Staff were fantastic we had some minor issues with our room which were quickly resolved thanks to Marcel 
359502,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Room a little small with just a plastic screen separating the shower and toilet from the rest of the room , Lovely quiet location just a few hundred meters from the tram stop which took us straight to the centre in 15 minutes Good local restaurants in walking distance We had breakfast included and had plenty to choose from 
359503,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, We had top floor rooms so smaller then we expected plus bathroom is in the same room just cornered off with glass panels Abit uncomfortable but were a couple so was not too bad , Nice area in Amsterdam close to city centre but easy to get lost so maybe tram home in the evening as its around 15 minute walk Nice clean room with friendly staff Modern and everything you need for a short stay 
359504,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Our rooms were in the next building U have to walk outside with the luggages for the executive rooms located in the next building, Perfect room Executive room bigger nicer
359505,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, No garden area Decor was very dated in the corridors and rooms The pictures on the website bear no resemblance to the rooms we stayed in we had 2 rooms , The location was good and easy to get into centre 
359506,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Rooms need decorating walls can be cracked curtains need replacing I asked for a double bed and was provided with two single beds which had been put together which wasn t what I asked for and it was uncomfortable unexceptable and that is assymettric information , Friendly helpful staff Fast room service Clean room 
359507,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The room was very small and the bathroom door was weirdly missing the necessary hole for the latch to go in so we had to prop it closed with the dustbin The sink was an aesthetically pleasing slab but that meant you couldn t run a sink full of water you could only run the tap wasteful and it was poorly designed so splashed easily , Although breakfast wasn t included in our rate we were given a very good special rate which was definitely value for money compared to other breakfasts in the area and for a good quality buffet The bed was super comfortable I liked the free hydration drink at reception too and the quirky decor 
359508,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Floods down stairs made the place a bit messy with mats fans etc Thought the hotel was more central than it was it s the opposite side of vondelpark not the Leidseplein side , Penthouse suite room upgraded to this at reception was really really nice 
359509,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Limited head room as there was a sloping glass window and the frosted windows in the bathroom showroom left no privacy , The staff were v friendly and extremely helpful When I arrived with my two children they gave me a bigger room tho it was still small for a double in my opinion
359510,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam,No Negative, Hotel is next to the Vondelpark which is beautiful and lively with lots of unexpected features It is also on the 2 and 5 tram routes to the Centraal rail station 
359511,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Decor a bit tatty Hotel across three buildings and room quality seems to vary a lot Lots of up and down stairs with bags to get to reception and then room Noise carried from other rooms Breakfast mediocre, Location good Area comparable to Chelsea in London Quiet area and lovely to walk around Easy to get into centre by tram
359512,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, There was a funny smell in the room on arrival each morning and evening when returning to the room However we put this down to sewers , Clean rooms quiet beautiful location 
359513,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, There were little or no facilities for disabled guests Fortunately we were given an upgrade offer with a room at the side of the hotel which meant we had no stairs to climb etc but also meant my elderly guest did not use the restaurant or bar as it was very difficult for her to access the hotel itself , The staff were extremely helpful especially Room Service 
359514,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, could be more accessible too may steps for disabled people Could do with more staff in the bar , The room was comfy spacious and clean the staff were all helpful and they went out of their way to help my wife when she broke her ankle
359515,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, when booked i had a hope for a room without the normal disturbances of amsterdam especially night noise unfortunately even if the hotel looks to have been renovated recently the windows are a total shame you can hear steps even on the road and my room was at 4th floor Breakfast is kind of a rip off normally 19 euro but there is a cheaper option of 15 if you sign for it at check in what they don t tell you is that if you miss the breakfast you loose the money anyway Wireless facility exists in all the rooms maybe but it is quite impossible to use it for even emails , good position for business 
359516,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, When we arrived they had very little available on the room service menu and the corridors and lift smelt of smoke, Fantastic customer service made all the difference Very clean and modern rooms 
359517,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, I didn t like the cleaning Thing that cleaner staff should look around after our journey when we re back to the hotel I can see that there was still some rubbish that was still here , I love the hotel decoration the way it place there thing the staff was doing a very good work for us and helpful No more comment it was just perfect 
359518,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The bacon that is available as a part of the otherwise good breakfast remains soggy Apparently the challenge of allowing air to enter the bacon space is too great I have complained about this before and was thanked graciously , The room was very pleasant with a balcony and good seats to benefit from the occasional sun The tram connection to the city centre is convenient 
359519,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The building was dated the bathroom was a bit strange and it wasn t good value for money The staff weren t helpful in showing me to my room which was in a strange spot There were workmen in the grounds from 0700 making so much noise it wasn t peaceful, The bed was nice and comfy
359520,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The room was very poor and dirty not as I would expect for a 4 star hotel Also one of the managers on duty was extremely rude when I highlighted this issue However this cannot be said for all the staff as everyone else were pleasant and welcoming , The area although a little far away was beautiful and located near the tram line and park 
359521,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Drilling from workmen at 8 in the morning Not hotels fault , Location tram stop very close no 2 comfy beds safe in room no extra charge English TV channels Pleasant receptionists bar staff 
359522,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Very small room for a couple slanting roof open bathroom concept was very uncomfortable no exhaust in the bathroom made it too stuffy no room to put your luggage , Location near Vondalpark is a plus
359523,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Very small room old furniture and pretty old bathroom but considering the variety of hotels with the same price in Amsterdam it is a good choice , Good value of money Prices in Amsterdam are not cheap so it was a very good price and a nice hotel Breakfast was tasty Room was not noisy We had a good time in Amsterdam 
359524,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Room rate fluctuate a lot hence would recommend others to book this hotel closer to your date of arrival The room was quiet tiny , Comfortable bed and hotel located in an upscale area in Amsterdam

359526,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, No restaurant diner bar snaks available despite being on all the literature including the screen information in the rooms Extensive room service menu but only the margherita pizza was available and 28 euro for two frozen pizzas is taking the micky a bit I think The paving on the terrace outside the room was in need of serious attention, The staff were lovely and helpful The room was contemporary and nicely done The bathroom was quirky but spacious The location was great peaceful and very pretty and only a short tram ride to the museums and center of town
359527,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, I was initially offered a room in the main building it was dirty and everything looked worn off awful beds see the picture with the beds and the one with the door frame very little natural light Odd choice of colours in the lobby and hallways , Great location quiet neighbourhood The hotel staff was helpful as I needed to change the room I was first offered The new room was quite nice see the picture with the bead with the wooden headboard the one with the bathroom and the one with the desk They were also considerate of our privacy never disturbed us 
359528,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The rooms were not very nice in need of modernisation Everything was old and shabby Barely resembles the hotel website, Staff were friendly and couldn t do enough for you and the location is perfect
359529,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Stained carpets in room hallway elevator dirty walls needing cleaning No corrective action to address the above observations in spite of informing reception Outdated rooms old window frames no lock which kept window slamming all night Overrated and not compliant with Carlson Group worldwide hotel standards, Good location and neighborhood Good internet connection Friendly staff at reception

359532,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, rooms do not even look like the fotos at Booking Profile see for yourself Clearly a fake profile And worst at the check in the asked security deposit is for the full amount of the reservation plus the guarantee which has not been released yet after 3 days of the check out Booking com should really be more careful and demanding with its partner hotels trustfully info , nothing actually
359533,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The computer in the lobby didn t work 3 days Nobody took care of it There is no Minibar in the room I should keep my water and yogurt on the working desk , Smiling staff helped to find out addresses
359534,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Bigger cups in room so we could use the tea bags supplied and English Breakfast tea bags would be good , The quiet location but not too far from museums Tram so close Great to have bikes at hotel 
359535,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The noise of the elevator, Even that they cancel my room with jacuzzy they gave me a nice room with balcony at the park the huge bed was awesome and the staff really nice and helpfull Also the breakfast area and stuff was really good

359541,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, I didn t like that the bathroom was open to the bedroom there was just a half frosted and half see through glass separator which left little privacy This wasn t made clear on booking The room smelt of drains on arrival and smelt the same around the hotel in some areas including the foyer and corridoors , I loved that the location was out of the tourist area and was situated on a lovely street surrounded by nice shops and restaurants It was however within a good walking distance of most attractions if you have flat shoes The hotel staff were lovely and let us use the computer to print our boarding passes on the way home 
359542,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, We upgraded to a business room mistake I assume didnt see other rooms only five coathangers and worse of all one and small dark mirror in wetroom so make up a problem ,No Positive

359546,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The toilet was installed in a glass box in the room communicating with it The sink was in the room Not clean It is unbelievable and outrageous that it rates as a 4 star hotel The worst and most expensive 4 star hotel ever , The area
359547,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, Room Photos on booking com are not realistic photos of the superior room which I booked for one week of my stay Staff seemed to be aware of this issue they confirmed to receive several complaints about this issue in the past however no corrective actions were made till now obviously I was so unhappy about the room that I have decided to check out from this hotel and move to another right after the first night For sure I will not be back as my trust as a client was broken and I think it is really embarrassing from such a hotel to promote rooms which do not correspond to reality Internet I came for a business trip so I needed to work at the evenings however on 5th floor where my room was located WiFi had incredibly poor signal impossible to work Blocked money on a bank account even though I stayed only one night money on my bank account were blocked due to pre authorization for 8 days , Staff was able to solve out my complaint and decision to change the hotel with professionalism 
359548,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, I was accomodated in room that was not looking like the rooms in any picture in booking com The room was not acceptable for that price I planned to stay in hotel for 4 nights but after check in and see the quality of the room I decided to change the hotel , The receptionist was polite and kind

359571,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, The lack of staff which meant a slight attitude from some The ridiculous waiting time at the bar and although specifying when booking as per reviews being given an old room and told it was a new one When we realised we asked to be moved and was given a bottle of wine as my husband insisted on some kind of compensation , The hotel has been renovated so some rooms the bar and the reception area are lovely

359618,Park Plaza Vondelpark Amsterdam, We had specifically come to this hotel for the whirlpool suite which I had booked for my girlfriends birthday We the time up to be given the standard room even though our booking clearly said whirlpool suite The staff then tried to tell us that there was no difference in the 2 rooms that they were still the same room Evidently not as they are being sold as 2 seperate rooms at 2 different prices I was fuming at the fact they had even tried to blag this there s clearly a difference in the rooms hence the different price tags on each of them there comes a point where you need to accept responsibility for cocking up At no point were we apologised to for this but told to take it up with the website we booked it on So basically tried to disown any responsibility despite they had just double booked our room and completely shattered the birthday plans we had If this room was not available we quite simply would not have booked this hotel They had said come back tomorrow and we will be able to swap rooms We were only there for 2 days On the 2nd night the room we had booked was still not available so we were upgraded to the penthouse suite which don t get me wrong was lovely However for our 2nd night we were hardly in the room as we had made numerous plans were leaving early the next morning So for the 1st night which was my girlfriends birthday we were in a downgraded room to what we had booked which is fair to say completely ruined the birthday I had planned We spent days looking for a hotel with a whirlpool bath Although the upgrade was nice it still through a spanner in the works for the whole trip we had to unpack and pack again every day of our holiday as we changed room each day which was highly inconvenient Not the relaxing getaway we had planned that s for sure ,No Positive
