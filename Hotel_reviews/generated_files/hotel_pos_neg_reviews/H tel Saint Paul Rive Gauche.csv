190062,H tel Saint Paul Rive Gauche, Breakfast buffet was very early and picked over if we did not show up early enough Cleaning staff looked angry all the time We recommend paying extra for in room breakfast that was amazing instead , Location toiletries and bed were great Breakfast to room was great Desk let us check in early and was very pleasant 
190063,H tel Saint Paul Rive Gauche, The rooms are very small very typical of rooms around Paris we found But the shower was smaller than what we expected It was a struggle to get in and out The key that was provided to us was also difficult to maneuver , The staff at this little hotel are wonderful They were probably the nicest people we met in Paris 
190064,H tel Saint Paul Rive Gauche, Bathroom door was missing parit of the handle and we had to stick our finger down into a hole to get leverage to pull the door open , It was within walking distance of Paris attractions 
190065,H tel Saint Paul Rive Gauche, The breakfast was a bit spare and too expensive at 14 euros a setting , We did need a room upgrade the one we reserved was way too small and might be more accurately advertised on the site but once we did we had a spacious lovely room with a comfortable bed The staff was exceptionally helpful and the location truly can t be beat 
190066,H tel Saint Paul Rive Gauche, The only thing I wasn t 100 sold on at the front desk they offer tickets to popular attractions so that you don t have to wait in the ticket queues However these tickets don t get you out of the security queues we waited close to two hours to get into the Musee d Orsay Do you research it may be possible to skip those queues as well if you book through a tour company we didn t explore that option but it may have saved us some time that s not the hotel s fault though just a note , The lobby and common areas were in a word charming Comfortable full of character expertly decorated Our room was also beautiful and the lighting was excellent although it was on the small side not unexpected as we booked an economy double Just be informed The bathroom was sized proportionally to the room fine for us but I can see how this might be a problem for any travelers with mobility issues again not unexpected just be informed The bed was very comfortable and the linens were of very nice quality Overall the hotel was very peaceful and relaxing The location could not have been better it was close to public transit and within walking distance of restaurants attractions shops etc but did not feel overly touristy

190070,H tel Saint Paul Rive Gauche, Our room was up in the eaves and we could not comfortably sit up in bed to read We love the area but it is very noisy at night , The shower was excellent and so was the room service breakfast each day The lighting in the room was very good indeed we could see to read at night unlike at many hotels
