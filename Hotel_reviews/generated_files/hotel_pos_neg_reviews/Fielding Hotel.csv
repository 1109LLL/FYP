174891,Fielding Hotel, I paid 192 for the night might be nice if breakfast was included perhaps , There was a bottle of prosecco and box of chocolates left in the room for us as I had mentioned it was my boyfriend s birthday this was a lovely touch Loved the bath in the bedroom it gave the room a quirky feel 
174892,Fielding Hotel, My sister and I were in a twin room on the second floor It was a little bit smaller than we would have liked Also it was up two flights of stairs with no lift This wasn t great for my sister who has some mobility problems To be fair to the staff we didn t raise either of these issues with them , The location of this hotel was excellent About two minutes walk to Covent Garden underground Staff were helpful Room was clean and modern

174896,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Beverly the receptionist was brilliant a great ambassador for the hotel nothing was too much trouble we will definitely stay again The location is brilliant We were advised refurb and extensions are in hand as a lift would be useful 
174897,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, The location is fantastic in fact so fantastic I shouldn t even be telling the world but attempting to keep the Fielding secret It is a little cramped for space in the common areas but I don t care I m out at all the fantastic restaurants shops and galleries within walking distance And the people who run the Fielding are nice 
174898,Fielding Hotel, Not so much a don t like but breakfast on site would have made excellent into couldn t have been more perfect , Location couldn t be anymore convenient for the Royal Opera House 
174899,Fielding Hotel, Everything was perfect, Location was excellent Staff were so amazing and accomodating Quiet at night Room was very clean as was the bathroom The reception is open 24 hours you leave your key with them which actually works out great 
174900,Fielding Hotel, Nothing Are you kidding We are seasoned travelers This hotel was perfect , One block from Covent Garden marketplace is a major plus can walk to 3 West End theaters discount theater ticket shop underground tube and Opera House Restaurants and coffee houses and pubs nearby plus Neal s Yard The room was small but the bathroom shower were totally upscale The best the reception staff were superior Flat screen tv Great coffee in the room 
174901,Fielding Hotel, Didn t know there wasnt a lift or bar but that s probably our fault for not reading the details properly , The hotel was different to any hotel I ve stayed in before but in a good way More personal because smaller 
174902,Fielding Hotel, Bed was really uncomfortable lumpy mattress and squeaky bed frame Air con unit was over the headboard so blew cold air directly onto me , Great staff characterful fabulous location 
174903,Fielding Hotel, room a bit dated but clean and comfortable and had everything we needed including the air conditioning, location was perfect staff were really helpful and friendly
174904,Fielding Hotel, I thought the room would be bigger and more luxurious as it was a birthday treat for my mum, Our room was changed to a twin room with a little rest area with a tv Free passes to the Nuffield gym spa excellent 
174905,Fielding Hotel, Unfortunately the stairs between the bedroom and bathroom were quite steep we needed to leave the bathroom light on at night to light the stairs We did not complain as we were only there one night In future I would make my preferences known before booking , The location The very helpful reception staff comfortable beds Cleanliness Excellent for short stay Overall mostly happy with the hotel and would certainly stay there again 
174906,Fielding Hotel, Not sure why I had to give in photo ID The rumble of the tube trains could be heard as we were in a basement room , Great location Walking distance to Covent Garden On the hottest day of the year the air con in the room was brilliant Large room nicely decorated and furnished 
174907,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, The location is one of the Fielding s greatest assets It is well placed for Covent Garden Theaters etc but being in a traffic free zone also benefits from some peace quiet probably are rare thing in London The staff at the front desk were also very polite I would not hesitate to use again when looking for somewhere to stay in the West End 
174908,Fielding Hotel, The sheet was a bit dirty since there was a stain on it The location is so great that the Covent Garden underground is just a 5 min walk from the hotel The staff was really kind to help me take my luggage to my room on the 3rd floor ,No Positive
174909,Fielding Hotel, This is our fifth time staying at The Fielding Hotel It is really past time to replace the very worn carpet throughout The picture of the room is not what you receive That can be a bit of a let down or make a person feel deceived Fresh paint in rooms is needed , Staff as usual very nice and helpful Location is perfect You can walk anywhere you wish to A taxi is always available if you wish to go further afield as well as public transportation 
174910,Fielding Hotel, The air conditioning unit was noisy so we had to switch it off so it did get quite warm in the room late at night , Brilliant location to explore Covent Gardens and the shows and surrounded by some excellent restaurants which was good as the Hotel does not provide food 
174911,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, It s only 8 min walk from Covent Garden station There is a M S food hall nearby which is super convenient for travellers who want to save money on expensive restaurant food 
174912,Fielding Hotel, Nothing to complain about regarding hotel but disappointed there was nowhere open on Sunday morning to have breakfast , Breakfast not applicable room very comfortable and pleasing decor First class location for eating drinking etc Would recommend to others 
174913,Fielding Hotel, No lift the stairs were very shallow and steep Our room was basic and we had an other flight of stairs to our ensuite Unable to settle our I ll as we left as their card machine wasn t working initially expected my husband and I to go find an ATM to pay cash , The hotel was in the centre of Covent Garden and close to the theatres etc we wanted to visit
174914,Fielding Hotel, Nothing I can think of , We loved the location the hotel was homely and the staff were very pleasant and helpful would definetly stay there again and would recommend it to friends and family 
174915,Fielding Hotel, Nothing , Good firm bed quiet room thoughtful extras like slippers Excellent location Friendly staff Did my research so knew what to expect and it exceeded expectations It s a quirky hotel that s not going to suit everyone but if I come back to London this did where I will want to stay 
174916,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, The decor was beautiful the beds super comfy and the location perfect and one other thing the hotel is in a courtyard so is off the road meaning a peaceful nights sleep heavenly
174917,Fielding Hotel, A very minor point the toilet roll holder kept falling off That s as bad as it got , Spacious comfortable quiet pleasant The old fashioned bath was lovely 
174918,Fielding Hotel, Nothing really if there had to be something then there was just a little noise during the night from late night revellers but only to be expected in such a central location , Situated between Bow Street and Drury Lane this is an ideal location for many West End theatres and Covent Garden Vast choice of restaurants and bars within a few hundred yards so both breakfast and eating in general were easy Staff very helpful and informative luggage room available for later collection of bags or cases Would certainly stay again 
174919,Fielding Hotel, Nothing not to like if you are happy to go out for breakfast, The Fielding is in an excellent location within walking distance to Covent Garden Embankment shops theatres etc Quiet location away from traffic lovely secret little hotel tucked away and unassuming Staff were very friendly and couldn t do enough for us very clean and comfortable perhaps could with a lick of paint here and there but would definately stay again

174921,Fielding Hotel, Hard to get reservation always booked up , Accommodating staff kept our prosseco in the fridge Brilliant location Accommodated our room request also top floor room ready early luggage storage helpful Would definitely stay again 
174922,Fielding Hotel, Our room was quiet at the back but quite small , Ideally situated in quiet side square close to Opera house friendly and helpful staff Lovely shower and toiletries 
174923,Fielding Hotel, Price reflects location but not level of space comfort or facilities Ok for one night No lift if you are on an upper floor , Clean and comfortable for 1 night Brilliant location 
174924,Fielding Hotel, Upstairs rooms are not for anyone with physical limitations , Location makes this hotel the best Around the corner from Covent Garden tube station Easy walking to theatre district Staff is always friendly and helpful We ve stayed here many times and always feel lucky if they re not completely booked 
174925,Fielding Hotel, No complaints Only wish that the other people staying in the room next to ours were more considerate as banging their door loudly at midnight was not appreciated , Quiet room with comfortable beds Good sized room no breakfast provided but plenty of caf s nearby Close to Covent Garden markets Good choice of restaurants within walking distance Reception staff were friendly and helpful 
174926,Fielding Hotel, An elevator would make a huge difference if you have big luggage , Excellent location professional and friendly staff On a previous stay I left a review pointing out some areas for improvement in the room amenities and was pleasantly surprised to find them addressed on this stay not sure if it was as a result of my review Great little room with everything you need 
174927,Fielding Hotel, Nothing significant The hotel is a little bit shabby had to put a book under the window to keep it open carpets rather worn etc but that didn t make the stay less enjoyable Only one person on duty again this didn t cause us any problems though it might have done if we d needed help as they couldn t leave the reception , Location was excellent and it was very quiet Room was a good size especially for London and the bathroom was modern and clean The bed was big and comfortable Staff on duty friendly A good hotel and one we would definitely go back to 
174928,Fielding Hotel, Not much hep from the desk staff about local services and we miss the British breakfast they had 20 years ago , The location is perfect for theater goers Not fancy but unique with it s own style Not
174929,Fielding Hotel, Room was quite small No breakfast but you are so central that there are plenty of other places to eat Unfortunately there was an issue with another guest during the night A lady was shouting at the top of her voice at the porter at around 2am Whilst this kind of behaviour is unacceptable I feel that the night porter could have dealt with the situation better as this issue continued for over one hour We therefore did not get a good night s sleep in an otherwise great stay Also when we checked the same porter did not offer any apology for the events I would have expected some sort of discount to be offered but this didn t happen , Fantastic location Staff very friendly Easy check in check out experience Bed was comfy The hotel is situated on a quiet pedestrianised street and as such is pretty quiet at night 
174930,Fielding Hotel, Although rooms on only 3 floors there is no lift If you are very safety conscious the only fire exit is down the stairs , Surprisingly quiet considering its location Very convenient for theatres and a wide variety of restaurants and bars Staff extremely friendly and accommodating allowing a relative to put flowers and champagne in the room in advance of our arrival Facilities for leaving luggage in a locker if required to be collected later in the day having already booked out 
174931,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Room was lovely and very roomy The downside of it being in the basement was that there wasn t a window but it wasn t a problem as we weren t in the room much Reception staff were very friendly and helpful We booked the hotel as it was near to the theatre we were going to and the location was excellent Had to go out for breakfast but it wasn t a problem as there are so many great places to eat in nearby 
174932,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly staff great location but not noisy offer of free gym access room was a great size and well decorated with tea coffee supplies Very happy overall would definitely recommend 
174933,Fielding Hotel, Nothing really Not a good place for people with disabilities No lift Stairs are steep and narrow, Superb Location Quiet Great complimentary items in the room 
174934,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, This hotel was amazing The staff were very helpful and friendly our room was so spacious The location was perfect really did find everything at the door 100 would stay again and recommend to anyone 
174935,Fielding Hotel, The walls are quite thin so squeaky beds and floors can be slightly disturbing at night Some small things need to be painted or fixed , Nice atmosphere charming house still and quiet even in a very lively area 24 hours desk Perfect situated a lot of public transport Lot of places to eat for every taste 
174936,Fielding Hotel, The only thing I could possibly say is that the bathroom didn t have any toothpaste , Liked the complimentary tea and coffee Staff were all lovely and welcoming The location is perfect There is a huge amount of amazing restaurants bars and entertainment jut outside the door 
174937,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, A comfortable room with fantastic facilities on doorstep of hotel It was lovely to go out for breakfast and every other meal and the hotel is in an ideal location Staff could not have been more helpful 
174938,Fielding Hotel, I liked it all , Location Great Just few minutes walk from Covent Garden market and attractions but all the same very quiet Staff Every one very helpful and friendly We could leave our bags in a locked room prior to check in Room Nicely decorated with comfy bed and large powerful shower Complimentary tea coffee and water Complimentary toiletries Would definitely stay there again 
174939,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Cosy little hotel in the midst of Covent Garden Perfect for visit to the Royal Opera House one minute walk away from the main entrance Quiet and comfortable beds No minibars in single rooms but coffee making facilities 
174940,Fielding Hotel, Paid for a double room and wasn t to happy to find the bed was two singles pushed together Even though the WiFi was free it kept cutting out and the tv didn t work properly As we were only staying 1 night it wasn t to much of a problem but had we been staying longer it may have been , The rooms were clean and staff at the reception desk were friendly Quick check in and check out also 
174941,Fielding Hotel, There was nothing i didn t like, The staff were extremely helpful and couldn t do enough to help us Mom walks with a stick and I hadn t realised the property didn t have an elevator The receptionist moved us to a 1st floor room which made this much easier for access We arrived early and were allowed to go into a room as it was ready The staff were all pleasant obliging and friendly 
174942,Fielding Hotel, Old dusty poky and not perfectly clean rooms and facilities, Location is really great close to theaters and city center on a quiet and not crowded street Stuff is always very friendly and helpful 
174943,Fielding Hotel, The beds were a little hard but everyone is different , Excellent location friendly and helpful staff Lovely little hotel Would definitely go back again 
174944,Fielding Hotel, Very steep stairs up to first floor and then changes of level once up there Bathrooms are small with very little clearance to get around open door to the facilities , Really excellent location for west end shows Good access to all other a amenities restaurants bars shops etc room was very comfortable Lovely toiletries provided Good tea coffee provision 
174945,Fielding Hotel, They have plumbing problems and the shower was freezing as we were the first ones up The water needs to be flowing in order for the hot water to feed through we learned , Location was amazing
174946,Fielding Hotel, Obviously no food available but knew that on booking so no complaint Enjoyed complimentary water tea coffee and biscuits , Comfy beds and excellent en suite 
174947,Fielding Hotel, Nothing, We liked everything from the service to the quirky layout with separate bathroom downstairs in room which suited us as friends staying in a twin room allowing us privacy yet company Everything in Covent garden was on the doorstep Staff printed maps gave us a brolly they were Very helpful Loved it and definitely booking again
174948,Fielding Hotel, The heat was very hard to adjust in our room and most nights it was far too hot for us at about 26 degrees Celsius While the room was perfectly suited to two travelers it was close quarters though for the location and the price a sacrifice we were very willing to make with twin beds only separated by a tiny nightstand , The staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating we really can t say enough about how much we enjoyed them The location was very convenient it was a straight shot on the Piccadilly line from Heathrow Transfers were very easily made from the Piccadilly line to many of the other lines There were also a number of places very easily walked to the theater district seven dials and Covent Garden Restaurants and museums were easily accessible While we didn t visit the hotel was directly across from the Royal Opera House There was a luggage storage room so you could explore unfettered prior to check in and after checkout We loved that the wi fi was included in the price of the hotel and they were very generous with tea and bottled water They cleaned the towels daily without an extra charge unlike some of the other budget friendly hotels we d looked at The bathroom was in the room and quite large compared to some others we ve had in London 
174949,Fielding Hotel, Having previously stayed in the Fielfing Ina Lovely room upstairs this time we stayed in room 5 on the ground floor it was very small and the bathroom in my opinion could be better the shower and tiles weren t in great condition Apart from that it is a very nice place and has a very relaxed atmosphere in a really central area, Location is fantastic and the rooms are lovely also the lady on reception was lovely and very friendly and helpful
174950,Fielding Hotel, Whilst it was a very nice and well located hotel I did think it was a bit expensive especially as no breakfast was included I guess the location comes at a premium We 12 year old daughter and I stayed in a twin room 14 which was nicely presented and big enough for the two of us albeit the en suite was rather compact even my daughter had to manoeuvre round the door in order to get in Whilst internally the hotel was nice and quiet was pleasantly surprised based on how close the rooms appeared to be we were on the first floor to the side of the building which overlooked an alleyway and which was used frequently as a walkway by late night early morning noisy revellers which and I guess not helped by the fact I am a light sleeper my daughter slept ok unfortunately lead to a bit of a sleepless night for me , Very friendly and helpful staff The electricity supply to our room cut out first thing Sunday morning but a quick call to reception and it was sorted straight away Unfortunately power went again a few minutes later but again sorted immediately also brought up a replacement hair dryer which appeared to be causing the problem We arrived before check in and were able to leave our case in a secure luggage room which freed us up to hit the shops same when we left and popped out for breakfast Location was great for us less than 5 minutes walk from Covent Garden Tube and a very short stroll to the Aldelphi Theatre where we had booked to see a show Also easy walk to Oxford Street Regent Street and of course Covent Garden just round the corner 
174951,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Easy to find just round the corner from the Covent garden tube station and only 5 10 minutes walk from Holborn tube station Clean and comfortable room welcoming staff who are happy to help Felt very secure there as they Lock the entrance door when away from reception even though its just for a few moments Great that its 24 hour reception No problem that there is no restaurant as there is an abundance of places to eat just steps away Thanks for a nice overnight stay 
174952,Fielding Hotel, The decor is very tired and the room was on the small side Although that said it was perfectly adequate , Hassle free as everything is included and exceptionally clean Very friendly staff You
174953,Fielding Hotel, My room was a single which felt like a bit of a box it was sooo small It was also right at a street corner were people stayed an chatted for ever until midninght Bad insulation could hear all the noises from the street Breakfast is not included , Great location as it is in the centre of covent Garden Very well decorated and very clean
174954,Fielding Hotel, room 33 was tiny too small for a twin room which wasn t expected being rang dead on 11am by reception as we hadn t vacated we were just walking out of the door, location is superb 
174955,Fielding Hotel, Seal in the shower needed replacing as water flooded out even during a short shower The free WiFi was not accessible in our room basement but only a minor issue as we didn t really need it , Great location in Covent Garden very close to tube and theatres Nice clean spacious room and friendly staff 
174956,Fielding Hotel, No bar or restaurant however the location was so good it didn t really matter lots of choice nearby for breakfast dinner drinks etc, Location was brilliant
174957,Fielding Hotel, room exquisitely tiny barely fit the bed and desk shower water was cold would never stay there again If you weigh more than 150 pounds you will have a hard time fitting up that narrow staircase, located very close to covent garden I could make a cup of tea in the room the staff were nice Easy to get to on public transportation from St Pancras
174958,Fielding Hotel, The bathroom could have been refurbished However it had all the necessary features and was clean , The room was bigger than shown on pictures and the lobby area was a lot nicer Also the staff was very helpful helping me with finding a connection to the coach station after the train services were suspended 
174959,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Brilliant location Room had various things a 4 star should have but it was literally a box room No bar coffee bar or food if any kind Wifi poor BUT brilliant location and my bed was comfortable 
174960,Fielding Hotel, Bed was fine but not as comfortable as it might have been , Great location just minutes walking distance from central theatres cinemas galleries and museums and round the corner from Covent Garden shops Friendly and very helpful staff Would definitely recommend 
174961,Fielding Hotel, Hotel needs some refurbishment ie carpets and blinds Pillows very hard but lovely big bed if also a little hard, Good for short stay Location really great Bathroom had lovely shower with some toiletries provided Free water and coffee etc was a nice touch
174962,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, I used to live in a flat opposite this hotel with my daughter so we came on a memory trip We of course know and love the area for other visitors it is quiet comfortable and walking distance to theatres restaurants and galleries If you like shopping that is on your doorstep too Friendly helpful staff made us very welcome 
174963,Fielding Hotel, A fridge would be useful in the room with there being no bar Which I don t think there should be a bar there it s just perfect as it is , The location was fantastic in the center of everything but so peaceful and quite Wouldn t have known you were in London 
174964,Fielding Hotel, On arrival I found the male receptionist to be less than helpful even obstructive however other members of staff were helpful and friendly , The location was central the room was comfortable and clean 
174965,Fielding Hotel, The decoration was shabby cigarette butts left outside the window sill Rubbish in street outside Stingy with toiletries had to ask for shower gel Staff not particularly welcoming Overpriced for what you get , Location was handy for theatres Use of nearby pool was good 
174966,Fielding Hotel, No soap provided in room but other than this room very comfortable if a little cramped , The helpfulness of staff Location Comfortable room with all expected extras
174967,Fielding Hotel, A pity that the hotel no longer supplies shower caps or tooth brushes it caused me some difficulties Why not keep a small supply at reception , Comfortable bed great location and friendly helpful staff
174968,Fielding Hotel, there were no breakfast facilities as expected but plenty of restaurants offering breakfast within a few yards, large and well equipped room and comfortable bed Both bath and large shower with newly decorated bathroom
174969,Fielding Hotel, The property was very dated needs to be fixed up a bit inside the hotel The rooms were nice but a lot of the things were broken and not looking at their best , Good location Right in the heart of Covent Garden Staff very friendly and helpful Nice size rooms 
174970,Fielding Hotel, Only minor things bedroom was beautiful but there were huge cobwebs in corners of room and flowers on bedside tables which gave the extra wow factor in pictures when booking weren t in the actual room which was a little disappointing , Loved how you were so close to main Covent Garden yet you couldn t here all the noise at night Loved the decor and set up of the room and how they went that little bit further to give each individual slippers for walking around the hotel Loved the black out blinds could have slept in way past check out time with them 
174971,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, There s nothing to not like about this hotel the staff are always lovely and welcome you with warmth and with a smile We have stayed in two single rooms both impeccably clean and well presented and designed Our recent room we stayed in had a set of stairs in that lead down to a bathroom and I could easily and happily live in that room it was perfect You have everything you need and it s nice to stay in a hotel that works on an actual key and lock system instead of a card that deactivates whenever it goes near your phone This hotel is charming in every way and is always a pleasure to stay in We will be returning again next January Only criticism I have is to the people on here that complain there is no breakfast and no lift the hotel states there is no lift so read before you book and breakfast it is only complimentary for hotels to give free breakfast away they have recommendations for nearby places that do breakfast which is kind of them to do so most hotels in London do not offer free breakfast or charge a ridiculous amount for it anyways Buy a packet of croissants make some tea and watch some morning telly together or if your travelling alone and have that in peace and quiet and at your own leisure Thank you for a wonderful stay once again 
174972,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location for Covent Garden and theatre land Rooms were clean and comfortable and the staff were friendly and helpful Surprisingly quiet at night given the location 
174973,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, We enjoyed the feel and style of the hotel kind of theatrical Best of all its closeness to the Opera House where we attended a performance could just not be beaten Our room No 5 was warm and very comfortable the bed linen spotlessly clean and pristinely white Loved the steps leading down to a small area complete with small desk and chaise longue acting as an ante room to the excellent shower room The reception staff both daytime and night time were most friendly pleasant and helpful We would recommend The Fielding to anyone wanting to be close to the whole Covent Garden area and certainly would return there when next at the opera 
174974,Fielding Hotel, The en suite shower room was extremely small and issued a dank smell of drains the entire time of our stay The room was very small and cold The hotel exists near to The Royal Opera House and obviously enjoys full occupancy for every opera or ballet but we would not recommend this hotel to any opera fans ,No Positive
174975,Fielding Hotel, There was nothing I saw that made me dislike any aspect of our stay If I had to choose one thing I would say a selection of biscuits would be nice but that would just be nitpicking , Central location perfect for Covent Garden restaurants and theatre land Friendly helpful staff stress free check in and check out A useful luggage room to store bags before check in and on check out 
174976,Fielding Hotel, No facilities catering for breakfast cost is quite high considering similar properties with more services some electrical appliances not working at time of stay , Location to Theatres
174977,Fielding Hotel, The steep narrow stairs , The location is excellent just a few minutes walk from Covent Garden Underground the Opera House and many restaurants The rooms while not huge are spotlessly clean and quite quirky in design The staff are friendly and very helpful Great value for money in such a central location
174978,Fielding Hotel, Would have preferred a slightly larger room with some separate seating , Excellent prime location for access to ROH and other venues Good location re noise as it is in a pedestrian area so a reasonably good nights sleep
174979,Fielding Hotel, The usual price listed per night is high but we got a great deal on Booking , A beautiful historic building with beautiful modern furnishings in room Make sure you let the hotel know if you want a parking space before you arrive and they will reserve you a space Otherwise you risk the lot being full 
174980,Fielding Hotel, Absence of elevator stairs difficult to negotiate with a suitcase There is no shelf in the shower for toiletries The room was rather cold and temperature control was a challenge , Perfect location friendly staff comfortable bed 
174981,Fielding Hotel, Ironing facility was a bit basic This is less important however than the wonderful service we received , The friendliness and help of the staff really counted for something and made THE difference 
174982,Fielding Hotel, Rooms a little dated and was cold with just a blanket in January A duvet would have been better For some the lack of a lift may also be an issue if you are on the 3rd floor , Fantastic location in a quiet street just behind Covent Garden market Staff were really friendly and helpful Rooms nicely decorated and free water and tea coffee in each room Good value for money 
174983,Fielding Hotel, Breakfast would have have put the icing on the cake but a small price to pay to stay at this fantastic place , Hospitality was great these guys went the extra mile to make our stay special We will definitely come back
174984,Fielding Hotel, Rooms could maybe do with a bit of a facelift but no modernising It s got a character if it s own, Staff are fantastic and the location is so central This is a second visit to The Fielsing and I would definitely go again 
174985,Fielding Hotel, The pillows were a bit hard and the room was a little cold during the night, The location was great for where we wanted to be The hotel had a lovely cosy feel to it 
174986,Fielding Hotel, Bit small and not the cleanliest But not bad in those departments by any stretch Just being picky , Staff were absolutely wonderful and the location was incredible Great atmosphere too 
174987,Fielding Hotel, Aggressive manager woman who shouted at me as I complained about my microscopic bedroom window very difficult to open Another member of the staff told me several rooms had problematic windows as the place is very old The bathroom was chilly with cracked window and no drawers at all anywhere neither safe where to store my clothes luggage and belongings One evening I came back to find out one of the towels was all stained in black The woman in question kept saying all the time that it was a Georgian house to answer my complaints concerning the broken windows and the lack of any comfort in this third floor no lift microscopic bedroom I am often in London and this is the worst place I have been so far Never again ,No Positive
174988,Fielding Hotel, Price It may have been good for the area but it was too much for the tiny room and no breakfast Also not good for people who have trouble with stairs No elevator I had a double and there was no room to move around There was also no room for the suitcases In the future I will stay further away and use the underground , Location is right by Covent Garden Easy to walk around downtown to plays shopping restaurants and some tourist sites Comfy beds The staff was friendly and welcoming 
174989,Fielding Hotel, In our opinion the room would benefit from a slight refresh on the paint work carpet just to give it that extra sparkle , Great central location in Covent Garden just up the road an extremely short distance away from the Royal Opera House around the back entrance exit On a quiet cobbled street which was quiet Great rain shower in the bathroom Great helpful staff Room clean and has complimentary water light refreshment tray 
174990,Fielding Hotel, Rooms are a little tired even the room we were upgraded to We are quite fit but there is no lift so would not suit the less mobile A little expensive for what it is , No food is provided but there are several good cafes nearby Location perfect for theatre land and Covent Garden
174991,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, it was the 100 meters to coven t gardens could not have asked for anything better It was the best location that i have ever stayed in I have being going to London for the last 15 years and now i have found my dream hotel 
174992,Fielding Hotel, My bed was a bit lumpy although my partners was ok Shower was a bit weak but nothing to really complain about , Fantastic location Room was very clean and nicely set out Lovely bathroom 
174993,Fielding Hotel, Room cleaned in a rush on second day so bed not properly made crumbs still on sofa etc, Upgraded on arrival so had plenty of space in room So convenient for theatreland No corporate feel
174994,Fielding Hotel, My room was on two levels the bathroom was downstairs which was OK but I d have preferred a room on one level The room was incredibly warm when I arrived the radiator was on full blast and it took ages to cool down , I liked the old fashioned charm of this hotel there s no bar or restaurant just comfortable rooms in an amazing location near the Royal Opera House The lady on the front desk was particularly friendly and helpful 
174995,Fielding Hotel, The stairs are a bit steep and there s no lift so you may want to ask for a ground lower floor if you ve got lots of luggage and or for less mobile people but that s a tiny point Really pleased to have found this hotel, This is the quietest central London hotel I have yet found It s not on a main road they put me on the top floor at the back and it really was as quiet as you can hope for in the middle of London The hotelier was so helpful an overseas visitor was caught by a Gatwick Express strike and the hotelier turned into a travel agent and was sorting coach taxi options for her The benefit of small friendly hotels 
174996,Fielding Hotel, The pillows were waaaay too hard and large We used folded up towels Heater a c blew directly on the beds really appreciated having separate small fan to use at night to move the air , Concierge nearby dry cleaners fabulous nearby French restaurant Could attend Catholic Mass within three minute walk Liked having separate private step down area between bedroom and bath Great location to walk to many sites Very clean 
174997,Fielding Hotel, Room was tiny not as advertised TV was tiny and obscured by the door carpet was dirty Just a typically overpriced hotel based upon location no food facilities no bar or available refreshments Very disappointed, Location and exterior

175000,Fielding Hotel, Hall and stair area very tired Carpet needs replacing Didn t like being on 3rd floor with no lift , Cleanliness of room and en suite very good standard Staff very friendly and helpful Good location for theatres and restaurants 
175001,Fielding Hotel, Contrary to many of the reviews I found the service disappointingly impersonal for such a small hotel The luggage storage facility was great but is not locked I could basically have popped back in walked out with anyone s case when I returned later in the day , Lovely cosy feel Great extras that you would expect from a much more expensive hotel in the way of toiletries slippers etc Quiet location but we did stay on a Monday night Brilliant for getting to many of the theatres 
175002,Fielding Hotel, the hotel is in a closed street thus the taxi is not stopping exactly in front of the hotel but at 30 meters , the hotel is so close to Covent Garden shopes but in particular Restaurant and bar pub
175003,Fielding Hotel, The air con could have been slightly more efficient , I was upgraded to a double room for my one night It is the nicest room I have had in a London hotel quite quirky and theatrical perfect for the theatre district of town 
175004,Fielding Hotel, Furniture and carpet a bit tired though bathroom fine Single glazing so although no traffic noise you can hear people clumping down the street and their conversations Woke me up several times Not the ideal hotel for the business traveller , Very close to Covent Garden and the tube 
175005,Fielding Hotel, D cor a little tired , Excellent location very friendly staff Comfortable bed and good complimentary refreshments tea coffee water etc Very clean and good toiletries and towels

175007,Fielding Hotel, Coffee in the room An immenity that s no longer offered as it has been in recent visits The bed and pillows were terribly uncomfortable , Location and hotel manager Grace is always very helpful and pleasant 
175008,Fielding Hotel, Decor was a little tired but acceptable Most important was the cleanliness In view of its location it was well worth the money , Room was comfortable and for Central London very quiet 
175009,Fielding Hotel, Just a little moan that the hot water wasn t piping hot , The room was fantastic I will never stay anywhere elsewhere in London We had a brilliant time 
175010,Fielding Hotel, We didn t mind not having an elevator in the hotel but some people may find it difficult , Great location helpful and friendly staff Your in the heart of the theater district You are in walking distance to Trafalgar Square London Eye and Big Ben 
175011,Fielding Hotel, Nothing Absolutely perfect , The rooms were very comfortable with a little set of stairs down to the bathroom There was also a TV and sofa down there The complementary drinks were generous as were the shampoo s etc Covent Garden and theatre land were within comfortable walking distance and the main shops two minutes away We will definitely be back 
175012,Fielding Hotel, No comfortable chair in the tiny room very basic sink with no stopper and poor working tap, Location is super quiet but downtown friendly staff small but clean room and good towels
175013,Fielding Hotel, Pricey 168 for a single room but not dissimilar to other hotels in the area, Great location and comfortable room with lovely crisp sheets and lots of brilliant white towels Quality toiletries Wifi dropped out a few times during stay 
175014,Fielding Hotel, I would have liked to see a chain or deadlock on my room As a solo traveller it would have been extra reassurance , Staff so friendly Room was great loved the free slippers Fantastic location 
175015,Fielding Hotel, Improvement points Another guest took our bag by accident when in storage Management should look into a barrier to keep this from happening A further guide should be provided for escape in case of fire as escape routes are limited A full length mirror should be added in rooms , I am a fussy traveler known to have changed 5 hotels in one day even from a Hilton Here I was pleased more than pleased The interiors were very cosy giving harmony The staff were discreet yet warm Except for one gentleman who seemed aloof room for improvement here The simplicity the ease of checking in and out the quick actions with Nicola carrying bags friendliness of management and reception staff bathrooms bed all great Not to mention the excellent location trains theatres sights shopping It seemed that there was good teamwork between staff which provides us guests with good service I am already recommending the hotel to friends and family 
175016,Fielding Hotel, Nothing, The fact that they had provided everything in the room that we could think of including toothbrushes gowns slippers masks Friendliness and helpfulness of Grace and her team 
175017,Fielding Hotel, The hotel needs some TLC which would be well worth the investment due to its great location , The location is the best selling point with this hotel Staff friendly 
175018,Fielding Hotel, No elevator in a hotel in this price range is unacceptable The beds were not the most comfortable that we came across in hotel , Unbeatable location extremely friendly and helpful staff nice touches beyond the usual like the personal toothbrushes nice shower and bath 
175019,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Very handy for the theatres and Covent Garden Bedroom was very small but absolutely lovely so don t be put off by the size Good size shower room Lots of thought has been put in by the owners to make a stay comfortable Would definitely stay here again for our next visit to London 
175020,Fielding Hotel, Hotel decor etc was tired the bed was really uncomfortable the stairs were narrow we had to take our stuff up to the 3rd floor , Great location the shower was good but the tiling was a bit broken the shower head had just been pushed through the ceiling with a jagged hole around the piping

175023,Fielding Hotel, Internet connection is extremely slow My room was on the 3rd floor There is no elevator so it could be a problem if you have heavy luggage , Perfect location very friendly stuff 
175024,Fielding Hotel, The very heavy drapes in the room held the dust , Ideal location and near the tube Pleasant staff Facility to leave luggage for a while after checkout Great tea coffee tray 
175025,Fielding Hotel, There is no elevator elderly people should ask for a room downstairs or on the first floor For breakfast you have to go to one of the many cafes around the corner , The elegant quiet house amidst the lively neighbourhood of restaurants the Royal Opera House and theatres Underground and busses and shops And the friendly helpfull staff the stylish efficient room and bathroom We were at home 
175026,Fielding Hotel, Liked the added extras in the room ie the supply of bottled water and bathroom bits Staff lovely such a good location for my daughter and I visit to the Opera House , Liked the little added exr
175027,Fielding Hotel, The pillows were very firm indeed And the pipes made a water gurgling noise every so often also something else made a loud noise every time it came on not sure what it was , The receptionist was very helpful and chatty The room was quite big for London although on two levels you went a small set of stairs to the bathroom and tea facilities The hotel is in a fantastically central spot right near the Royal Opera House yet it is up a quiet lane so no traffic noise or noise from revellers at night 
175028,Fielding Hotel, My sister said it was a bit noisy out the back but I can t say I noticed All the windows are openable which she did because we visited in August do it was warm There is air con in the room but she said that was noisy Again I can t say I agree , The room was beautifully decorated the staff so friendly and helpful We had a slight leak in the bathroom sink but it was fixed within minutes of us reporting it It s a great location walking distance to Covent Garden and Leicester Square 
175029,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Everything The location was perfect We especially loved the rustic appeal of the hotel the super friendly staff The hotel was spotlessly clean The bedrooms and bathrooms were on separate levels giving you plenty of space 
175030,Fielding Hotel, We had read that the rooms and bathroom facilities were somewhat cramped which we thought we would accept because the hotel location was very convenient to the facilities and attractions of Covent Garden On reflection and over a 3 day stay we should probably have booked a hotel with more spacious accommodation , We found the staff pleasant and helpful 
175031,Fielding Hotel, Our room had no windows but it was a basement room so came with aircon , The goon had everything we needed was comfortable and clean Staff where very helpful and welcoming Cloudy have asked for a better stay
175032,Fielding Hotel, The Fielding does not have a lobby nor do they serve any kind of breakfast although places to eat are nearby We liked breakfast at Wings a short walk away , It is a friendly hotel that is near a tube stop has fast wifi and a marvelous location on a pedestrian street around the corner from Covent Garden 
175033,Fielding Hotel, Room on ground floor a bit of sound intrusion from street talking Room was quite small adequate for one tight for two Having said that I d stay there again , Fantastic location in the heart of the west end Lot s of restaurants Sara Fina just feet away lot s of street life close to several tube stops Staff was gracious and very helpful 
175034,Fielding Hotel, Wish they had breakfast , My room had a huge bathroom with a separate clawfoot tub in the bedroom The decor was lovely and the room was very quiet I felt very safe as a woman traveling alone 
175035,Fielding Hotel, The staff should have more knowledge and recommendations as to restaurants transportation options but they were nevertheless friendly and helpful Having power AC power adapters for guests with digital devices would have been nice , The location in Covent Garden is one of the best areas to stay in London The rooms are comfortable and the bathrooms are nice and very functional The staff is friendly and very helpful 
175036,Fielding Hotel, 2nd floor rooms are a bit too much of a climb for middle age people the reception person was cooperative to provide us with a room on 1st floor Closets space is limited, We enjoyed the location just a short walk from Covent Garden center and the tube station and still located on a quiet alley The personnel was very cooperative and information was gladly provided The facility is clean and pleasant 
175037,Fielding Hotel, It would have been nice to have had some refreshment facilities on site but to be fair they are only a footstep away once you step outside the front door as the hotel is so central , I was enchanted by the lovely homely feel at Fielding Hotel The staff were efficient and very friendly and the bathroom was absolutely spotless The place is charming I would possibly choose it over over a slick 5 star for my next visit 
175038,Fielding Hotel, Lighting in bathroom very dim noisy air conditioner room could use a fresh coat of paint , BOTTLED WATER Air conditioner although noisy cooled nicely hot pot coffee tea creamer shampoo lotion eye mask robe slippers bulb that was out over desk was replaced immediately Staff friendly and helpful 
175039,Fielding Hotel, Nothing , The staff were very helpful and friendly and it was a very short walk to the Royal Opera House where we were seeing the Pet Shop Boys in concert Plenty of eating options in a short walk too 
175040,Fielding Hotel, Nothing , Fantastic location helpfulness and friendliness of staff comfort of bed little touches such as toothbrushes and eye masks plentiful supply each day of bottled water and the makings of hot drinks Air conditioning was particularly welcome during our stay on the hottest days and nights of the year 
175041,Fielding Hotel, Aircon so loud you can t have it on Bedding so old and grubby it is offensive I Cold shower in the morning Attrocious I stay in London often twice a week min and I m used to rough But I even texted home at how bad this place was maybe it s just room 2 don t stay there , The reviews for this place were good But I would never stay here again based on my stay in room 2 Grubby bedding and the loudest aircon I ve ever come across Offended they let room 2 out to people 
175042,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Simple tasteful clean Lovely little touches thoughtful Friendly helpful welcome Internet great I was on top floor 3rd always a plus Surprisingly quiet given the central location 
175043,Fielding Hotel, Bed mattress topper would have been nice as bed a bit too firm, Staff lovely lots of toiletries water coffee tea etc but also tooth care kit and nice room and great power shower great comfy pillow only downside was bed a bit too firm for me
175044,Fielding Hotel, Not enough pillows and ones we did have very uncomfortable Lots of noise from guests moving around upstairs , Location fantastic for Covent Garden and area Room very small but full of everything you need for a great overnight stay 
175045,Fielding Hotel, The check in area and carpet on the stairs are in need updating They give a poor initial impression Also a mistake was made with our booking We had requested a King room both upon booking and directly with the hotel which was confirmed and when we checked in the King room was not available The room bathroom we were given was very small given the price even by London standards , Location was perfect the hotel was very quiet Room was well appointed We would definitly consider staying again if we were to have a King room 
175046,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Great central location Small single room but that was what I had booked for a good price in this location room was clean and well appointed comfy bed and nice shower 
175047,Fielding Hotel, They should ve removed the loo brush or made sure it was clean , Great position only 7 mins easy walk from heart of West End Pleasant front of house staff clean spacious room and good bathroom Excellent value for money Beds were very firm daughter loved it I didn t

175049,Fielding Hotel, Nothing , Excellent location Small but comfortable hotel in the heart of Covent Garden Best feature the staff So helpful Grace the Manager is wonderful 
175050,Fielding Hotel, The hotel does not have a lift and is situated over 4 floors This can be a problem for some people , We only had one night with a theatre trip planned but as this little hotel is situated right in centre of theatre land and almost next door to Covent Garden and a reasonable walk to the National Gallery we were able to pack in a lot of visits 
175051,Fielding Hotel, Bed in the pink room was alittle hard for our tastes So wasn t as comfy as we would have liked Bath was amazing Lotsa towels shower execellent, Location staff excellent
175052,Fielding Hotel, Not visiting London all that often I do find the prices there staggering 192 for a small room without breakfast is pretty steep but then again it is London , The location by Covent Garden was excellent The room was small but nicely furnished with good towels and toiletries 
175053,Fielding Hotel, The wifi kept cutting out Also whilst the room and adjoining ensuite had been thoroughly cleaned The carpet was stained Coffee tea spillage Really needs attention, Staff polite and attentive Travelled with 11 year old grandson Can recommend room 4 Nothing was too much trouble Great location Would stay again 
175054,Fielding Hotel, Do not like that antique sheet and blanket system some establishments in Britan still have Would preferred a duvet Carpet in room did not seem too clean Small room but have booked for five nights later and will be given a larger room when I stay more than one night Staircase narrow when carrying a large suitcase , Bathroom clean 
175055,Fielding Hotel, The only issue had nothing to do with the hotel or its staff I had a ground floor room and people stood outside my window in an alleyway and talked for a couple of hours They had every right to do this but it was hard to get to sleep This happened last time I had this room too Perhaps earplugs could be supplied I certainly wished I had thought to carry some , The warm welcome was just what was needed on a rainy Sunday evening after two international flights and a long taxi ride from Heathrow 
175056,Fielding Hotel, Nothing it was lovely , The hotel is beautiful and the rooms spotless The little extra touches in the room such as the water and slippers were lovely The location is great right next to Covent Garden and all the staff we spoke to were really kind This is our new home in London now

175058,Fielding Hotel, No lift but I was kindly given a room on the ground floor , Perfect location for my purposes quiet for such a central hotel Friendly staff and very helpful 
175059,Fielding Hotel, Nothing to report here , The only thing we didn t like was the cost of car parking but that s hardly the hotel s fault This hotel was a great find superbly located and amazingly quiet We would definitely stay here again 
175060,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, The location was great as we were there for a weekend of shopping and relaxing We didn t want to have to go far for dinner after spending the day shopping and were spoilt for choice on where to eat Our room was very clean and the staff we met were very friendly and It was very useful being able to leave our luggage there even after we had booked out I would definitely stay at The Fielding again 
175061,Fielding Hotel, Can be a little noisy until late at night but that s expected given the location in the heart of the West End , Great location max 5 minute walk to Covent Garden tube station 
175062,Fielding Hotel, Considering what we paid there was nothing negative The reception staff were extremely helpful and friendly , Fantastic location and so quiet considering the hotel is in the centre of theatre land The hotel was quirky and very comfortable it was value for money perfect 
175063,Fielding Hotel, Not much really , Superb location for Theatreland and Covent Garden Grace who made us feel so welcome great room with every facility needed Surprisingly quiet given the location 
175064,Fielding Hotel, 12 noon check out would be better Housekeeping slamming doors, Location is excellent Staff very efficient and friendly Great to have complimentary sparkling and stillwater in the room
175065,Fielding Hotel, No lift which was a problem on my 1st visit when I was placed on top floor with a heavy suitcase but staff carried it for me My street level room on my return visit was noisy during the early hours from outside disturbances , Fantastic location pretty character hotel very friendly staff

175068,Fielding Hotel, Nothing , Staff at reception extremely helpful on both the evening Mum and I arrived and in the morning helped carry a case up the stairs offered us an umbrella for our evening walk to The Savoy Theatre when the weather was bad advice on where to get a good breakfast routes around the area advice on bus route to Victoria better than the tube from Covent Garden 
175069,Fielding Hotel, I travelled alone this time and so had a single instead of twin room this was a bit small even for a single , The location is superb and the place is clean I we regularly stay here when I we travel for work 
175070,Fielding Hotel, Bed was hard you could feel the springs thru the bed , Nice little basic hotel Best part is the location which is superb Looks fine indoors not especially cute but not too bad either interior a bit worn out but not badly 
175071,Fielding Hotel, The cost I know the hotel is in a great location for going to the theatre but I still feel it was rather expensive for what you get , The bathroom was nice and the facilities good the room was cosy and the bed was very comfortable The drinks selection was excellent 
175072,Fielding Hotel, No breakfast though plenty of eateries on doorstep , Quiet ambience of hotel and no street noise despite our stay being a Saturday night Plentiful array of refreshment and toiletry provisions Comfortable beds and pillows Efficient shower Spotlessly clean 
175073,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Absolutely loved everything Was a lovely stay in a beautiful hotel Couldn t fault it The staff were very helpful and friendly Will definitely stay more when in London

175075,Fielding Hotel, Nothing, The hotel is basic but extremely well located in a traffic free street around the corner of the Royal Opera House and Covent Garden market and the staff is extremely friendly and hospitable 
175076,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Less than a minute walk from the tube 2 minutes walk into Vicente garden and 3 minutes from the Lyceum made this lovely little hotel perfect for myself and my partner we will return to this hotel on our next visit to london Even though it doesn t do breakfast they recommend the little cafe around the corner which served a very good and plentiful breakfast for 8 50 each
175077,Fielding Hotel, You have to go down a few steps in our room to get to the bathroom Ok if you are fit and able but may prove a bit difficult for people with mobility issues , This is a conveniently located hotel for central London It is competitively priced with a very good selection of cafes for breakfast within 2mins of the front door Rooms have complementary bottles of water and plenty of tea and coffee 
175078,Fielding Hotel, Beds a little hard and we were on the third floor so a bit of a trek with your luggage but not a show stopper, Great service from the concierge rooms were good value and the location was spot on
175079,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Location great receptionist very friendly and welcoming but room decor and furnishings a bit tired Functional not inspirational and expensive for what it was 
175080,Fielding Hotel, Nothing , The lack of facilities for breakfast is regrettable but there are plenty of places round about the hotel that one can use Apart from that this hotel is a little gem 
175081,Fielding Hotel, Nothing, Abundance of toiletries and a small but delightfully equipped bedroom and bathroom Very comfortable bed and lovely drapes Plenty of storage space 
175082,Fielding Hotel, more milk in bedroom , location was excellent the room was quiet and the welcome on reception excellent when we arrived and at the end of our stay when we were leaving 
175083,Fielding Hotel, There was no hot water in the morning so shower not possible Bedroom was adequate if a little small , All the little extras eg tea coffee toiletries
175084,Fielding Hotel, No negatives for us , Comfy bed excellent shower and plenty of towels Complimentary water in room Quiet location but in easy reach of all Covent Garden shops restaurants Friendly helpful staff

175087,Fielding Hotel, the room was a little small however this is to do with the shape of the building and not any ones fault, Access to the fridge and other facilities like the local gym 
175088,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Very welcoming and mindful staff excellent location and value for money Perfect for short stays probably would require a bit more space if staying for more than a night or two 
175089,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Perfect position very central for all amenities and getting around London Convent Garden is a great place to stay in London with lots to do and see Staff were very helpful 
175090,Fielding Hotel, I was a little disturbed that that there was no external fire exit from the the third floor and neither were there fire instructions in the room I did mean to talk to the staff about this in the morning but forgot to , Very friendly and helpful staff The room was extremely clean I had asked for a quiet cool room and we had both of these The hotel is very well situated for theatre land and Covent Garden with other visitor sites being easily accessible 
175091,Fielding Hotel, It was rather cold during the nights but there is a heater under the window which makes things much better when switched on , Excellent location which makes you feel in the epicenter of London life Complimentary drinking water replenished every day Absolutely quiet room 
175092,Fielding Hotel, It was cold outside and although the heating perfectly worked when I went to bed the radiator got cold in the middle of the night and the temperature in the room fell so that it awakened me Thankfully there were spare blankets , Ideally located at the heart of London within walking distance of Piccadilly Nice decoration 
175093,Fielding Hotel, Rooms 42 and 43 are basement rooms with no view or much natural light so not suited to long stays or if you feel claustrophobic You can also hear the tube trains rumbling underground until around 12 30 1 00am and starting again in the early morning Very nice hotel but would recommend asking for a room on a higher floor if this would bother you , In a quiet side street in the Covent Garden area walking distance to most things with the tube and buses nearby Rooms are nicely decorated and well equipped with most needs catered for Very clean No breakfast or room service in the hotel but you are surrounded by cafes and restaurants Hot drink making facilities and bottled water provided Free WiFi but we didn t try it 
175094,Fielding Hotel, I didn t like being in a basement room and the shower room was a little bit disappointing but overall for the price this is a great place to stay , Lovely people running the hotel Bed very comfy and location really great 
175095,Fielding Hotel, My single room was tiny and felt a bit dated for the price Three flights up a very narrow staircase with no apparent alternative fire emergency egress The bed might be too firm for some and the bedding could do with some fabric softener View of a brick wall opposite , Well located hotel with friendly 24 hour staff Complimentary tea coffee hot chocolate and water still and sparkling a nice touch Some street noise but generally quiet in Broad Court especially for a weekend night in central London 
175096,Fielding Hotel, Unfortunately the restaurant is closed on Sunday evening but there are plenty of good eating places nearby so it didn t matter , Warm welcome and comfy bed valet parking service
175097,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Friendly welcoming staff very close to the Royal Opera House which was the reason for our visit and a really quiet location Room was very clean and also very comfortable We would certainly use this hotel if we were in London again
175098,Fielding Hotel, Room rather small just acceptable for one night stay , Staff pleasant and helpful Great location for theatre land Although no dining facilities ample refreshments in room Would visit again
175099,Fielding Hotel, The one downside was the bed was very squeaky creaky , The hotel was very convenient for my requirements for my visit It was welcoming very clean with good overnight facilities 
175100,Fielding Hotel, Could have done with a bedside table but most things were good , Excellent location in the heart of Covent Garden and 1 min from the Opera House staff are very friendly and helpful 
175101,Fielding Hotel, If I was being really being picky incident like the carpet and a few other things but we spent most of the time out of the room and using the near by facilities , I loved how freindly and informative the staff were and we had a comfortable stay indeed 
175102,Fielding Hotel, Bath very slow to fill but shower excellent , Staff were incredibly welcoming and helpful We had requested ground floor room if possible and we got it Room lovely Very easy two minute walk to New London Theatre 
175103,Fielding Hotel, I would have preferred the toiletries to have had a slightly less floral base , The room had a wonderful large firm bed an excellent bathroom a few thoughtful extras such as toothbrushes superb easy to control heating and was laid out with great thought to practicality The staff were lovely and the secure baggage storage was very welcome 
175104,Fielding Hotel, It did say we could use the gym and spa facilities but there wasn t any mention of it on our arrival or any details, I loved the look and feel of the place it felt very homely very welcoming and a cosy room with everything you could need 
175105,Fielding Hotel, It was all good, Excellent central position very friendly helpful staff room very well looked after could not have wished for better accommodation 
175106,Fielding Hotel, pillows very hard air con on permanent cold no matter what the temp said tv not working on return at 9pm on cold evening met with note back in 5 mins which was 10 , location very convenient
175107,Fielding Hotel, It was very hot in the room air conditioning did not really work well Not comfortable pillow It takes quite a long time until hot water starts running from tap shower , Excellent location Friendly staff Single room is small but convenient 
175108,Fielding Hotel, Would have benefitted from a lift , Excellent location lovely staff who were friendly and helpful Impressed by the extras like the complimentary slippers toothpaste etc
175109,Fielding Hotel, Didn t look anything like the photos on website 2 single beds pushed together isn t my idea of a double bed Extremely expensive for what it was, Location was perfect got theatres etc
175110,Fielding Hotel, No Elevator and I wish they had a quick bite breakfast even for little extra cost, The room was great staff friendly and the location is close by the covent garden and leicester tube stations 
175111,Fielding Hotel, Staff were friendliest when we arrived after that they were busy doing whatever they were doing , Loved the bathtub in the room Lovely decor No breakfast but plenty of places nearby We went to Balthazar which was amazing Royal Ballet is a minutes walk away 
175112,Fielding Hotel, In view of no food the price could be a little more realistic , The hotel is very conveniently placed for theatre visits and Covent garden for shopping and restaurants The staff were most helpful and oblparticulerly when asked about venues for food iging
175113,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Brilliant location central to all the theatres and close to 2 different Tube stations so easy to get to other tourist locations in London Reception was staffed 24 hours a day and really helpful 
175114,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Wonderful location warm welcome friendly and helpful staff throughout and excellent comfortable and clean room Also like the flexibility of going out for breakfast so much choice close at hand 
175115,Fielding Hotel, Price could be somewhat lower especially as there is no breakfast or food available , Staff were impeccably friendly and knowledgable Couldn t do more to help Great rooms very comfortable and clean Location is fantastic a few hundred yards from Covent Garden and a few feet from the Royal Opera House 
175116,Fielding Hotel, Nothing, Perfect for what I needed a comfortable bed for the night Half the price of the chain hotels No on site food but not a problem as surrounded by restaurants 
175117,Fielding Hotel, Extremely discourteous rude and unpleasant lady at the reception desk in the morning half a shaven head with very short hair We had misplaced the room key and despite looking for it everywhere couldn t find it When we informed the lady at the reception desk we were first told off and then told to pay 50 to replace it We mentioned that it was an extortionate penalty and she snarled back saying leave the hotel and you are not welcome here ever again We left 20 at the desk and did find the key very soon after check out We went back to return it but were left very shocked at the sudden rude outburst It is such a shame that one bad egg spoils the pack She is a dis service to otherwise a gorgeous treat of a hotel , Quaint little hotel in the heart of central London Our Room no 43 was lovely Cosy clean and warm Nicely decorated Roomy shower with under floor heating Fabulous value for the 168 we paid to stay for the night 
175118,Fielding Hotel, It was very cold in the room with strong drafts from the window Also there is no breakfast in the hotel which might seem to be inconvenient for some travelers , Location is great The rooms are neat and clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful 
175119,Fielding Hotel, Noise isolation from top floor could be better but generally it was not a big problem , The location is excellent just some steps from the Royal Opera Hous The room was small but clean and with nice extras toiletries slippers tea coffee toothbrush and paste 
175120,Fielding Hotel, Being picky our shower head needed a good descale it was a bit like being squirted with a water pistol but apart from that and the slightly hard mattress everything was great To be fair these things wouldn t prevent me staying again , Mattress was quite hard but the location of this boutique hotel is wonderful walk out the door turn left and your in theatre land turn right your in shopping heaven Very helpful staff lovely decor and feel at this hotel Some morning pastries would be nice instead of a breakfast but quite understandably it is not cost effective to provide a breakfast with so many eateries nearby 
175121,Fielding Hotel, Room oppressively hot in the middle of winter Hate running air con all the time Very narrow stairs to room in basement which were sore on my knees Fridge in wardrobe very noisy, Staff very friendly and helpful Location excellent 
175122,Fielding Hotel, This isn t a negative but the staircases are tight and steep typical of buildings this age so ask for a lower floor room if this is a problem , The location is outstanding walking distance to all the major sites We were made to feel so welcome and were very well looked after Our room was comfortable spotlessly clean and quiet 
175123,Fielding Hotel, The cost It was an expensive option but we saved on transport costs, The location it was perfect for our needs It was also very quiet which was a surprise given its very central location 
175124,Fielding Hotel, A softer pillow but that shows how little there was to fault with this hotel , Centrally situated well appointed with a generous helping of the small extras that make one feel comfortable No hidden extra charges 
175125,Fielding Hotel, Shame the did not do breakfast but that s only a minor detail as they recommended a place anyway and that was good too, Location to the opera house spot on plus all the other attractions of Covent Garden
175126,Fielding Hotel, No lift Beds could be modernised No room safe Bathroom much colder than the bedroom Cold in the early hours heating had been lowered, Location quietness big room very friendly helpful staff Nice tea and coffee facilities to make up for lack of breakfast
175127,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, A lovely boutique hotel with a personal touch Staff could not have been more helpful Cleanliness of room and ensuite excellent Location great for Covent garden Royal Opera House and West End theatres No dining facilities not a problem plenty good restaurants close by including breakfast from 7 00am 
175128,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, A small friendly hotel The rooms are very clean and well supplied with towels toiletries slippers etc The beds are comfortable and the hotel quiet The location is excellent 
175129,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Absolutely good location for opera And it s very convenient for hanging around downtown Also the madam is very elegant and kindly hearted I will definately select this hotel next time too 
175130,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, We loved everything from the lovely welcome lush room with top quality freebies like water toiletries overall homely feel of the hotel Quiet cosy Perfect location Thoroughly recommend this jewel if you need a quality place to stay but want to avoid multinational soulless hotels 
175131,Fielding Hotel, None, It was a cute little hotel good location close to Covent Garden Really enjoyed our stay even though it was only one night Would highly recommend 
175132,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic welcome on arrival When I booked I mentioned that it was my daughter s 21st Birthday and there were flowers chocolate and a chilled bottle of prosecco waiting for her in our room Lovely split level twin room with large bathroom clean and welcoming with lots of personal touches 
175133,Fielding Hotel, Maybe I m completely out of touch with expectations and prices of London hotels but to pay approx 100 Euro for the privilege to stay in an worn out shoebox of a room and the sweet surprise of being told the hotel does not serve breakfast oh the joy , Central location though hard to find 
175134,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, The staff were very pleasant and made you feel welcome offering to take your bag ect The room was very clean nicely furnished and comfortable and its location just off Covent Garden was perfect 
175135,Fielding Hotel, Unfortunately it all went pear shaped when I needed to pick up my luggage after check out and recover my ipad charging cable and power adapter which I d left behind in the room The behaviour of the staff member who had taken over the front desk was very unhelpful and completely out of step with the rest of the experience She was inflexible bordering on hostile with poorly trained and very patronising communication skills The final irony was that after a lengthy and unpleasant discussion my personal property had already been handed in by the cleaning staff and was lying under the reception counter i e right under her nose I still had to insist she looked for it there before I finally got it back , Location and the staff on duty during my 2 night stay 
175136,Fielding Hotel, Room was very small and had quite a lot of noise from people walking past my room outside tv in bathroom did not work Very pricey for what it is and what you get No breakfast and no view only of a frosted window and a brick wall , The staff were very friendly and helpful the room was very clean and the bed was comfortable Location was great 
175137,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Proximity to R O House 1 min walk Excellent cleanliness very friendly staff necessary to request a larger room lots of complimentary items they store luggage after check out 24 hr concierge 
175138,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Never met such friendly staff in a hotel All genuinely interested in how your day was Room was perfect for me as a single person Location in covent garden was brilliant and no noise at night 
175139,Fielding Hotel, No bad points really no food is served but I feel this is reflected in the price Plenty of places to eat within walking distance so really not an issue , The location of this hotel is excellent You are right in the heart of central London but tucked away down a pedestrian only street Ideal if you are going for a short shopping or theatre break The room was very comfortable and clean 25 minute walk from London Euston so no complaints 
175140,Fielding Hotel, No breakfast no lift My wife with two new hips had to climb two flights of steep stairs The room was smaller than a shirt button the curtains were blankets and didn t close properly , The receptionist was very pleasant
175141,Fielding Hotel, The only thing I could possibly think of is that the loo handle in the bathroom sticks down sometimes , Everything about this little hotel was fabulous The customer service pre stay staff onsite amenities location I was in town for a pre Christmas shopping trip and it served me brilliantly for what I needed Somewhere safe clean with great trustworthy staff ideally located What more do you need 
175142,Fielding Hotel, If you had a problem with stairs there isn t a lift and they are steep , The position is excellent have booked to go again already really quiet as well 
175143,Fielding Hotel, there was nothing we didn t like , Nice quiet hotel in a side st but right in the middle of covent garden 5 mins walk to there and 10 to leicester square Great pubs theatres shops markets loved it 
175144,Fielding Hotel, Not a great view but didn t bother us as we didn t stay in long enough, Excellent location lovely atmosphere big bath towels slippers eye mask a big selection of bath products tea coffee chocolate bottled water ALL complimentary
175145,Fielding Hotel, The room was just ok the beds and pillows were not great Definitely not luxurious but if you are on a budget and want a decent place this is a great option, The bathrooms were excellent and the staff great Location was wonderful if you want to be near Picadilly but not right in the circle itself
175146,Fielding Hotel, We were expecting a room with a bath due to the photos but even without a bath the room was lovely , The hotel staff were lovely and asked if we needed any recommendations of things to do places to eat which was great The reception is open 24hrs so going back at 1am wasn t a problem The room was clean and spacious and the shower was amazing The location was perfect only a few minute walk from Covent Garden square but far enough away to be quiet Would recommend 
175147,Fielding Hotel, There is no lift as this is a listed building once the home of author Henry Fielding The stairs are a steep challenge for the unprepared so for those of limited agility it is wise to book early in order to be sure of being on the ground or lower ground floors , The location just by the Royal Opera House and Covent Garden makes it an ideal base or visiting London Many theatres are less than 10 minutes walk away as are numerous caf s and restaurants and pubs Tucked away from the main streets it is quiet and discreet No breakfast is available but there are options just a couple of minutes away 
175148,Fielding Hotel, Bit noisy at first But you get used to it , The room was very comfortable Ground floor with the modern bathroom Wonderful Very tastefully decorated Nice helpful and courteous staff too 
175149,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Great location beautiful rooms value for money and brilliant staff We stayed as part of our honeymoon and they left us a card fresh flowers chocolates and cava when we checked in Really nice touch 
175150,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, We were on a three day break before travelling on to Bruges We chose Covent Garden as it close to all amenities The hotel was great my husband asked for a ground floor room for me as I have leg problems and they were more than happy to oblige The staff were excellent and our stay was very enjoyable 
175151,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, I arrived very early and was allowed to use the bag store so that I didn t have to lug a suitcase around the shops The lovely lady at reception was so friendly and helpful She gave me a free map of the area which was brilliant When we booked in we were given a room on the very top of the hotel which did mean a lot of stairs but also we were away from any road noise Very clean and modern A joy We will use this lovely hotel again
175152,Fielding Hotel, Only one issue returned 3 times to find the door locked with note to say back in five Very inconvenient as needed to change for formal event and needed the toilet having to wait 5 mins not good and sometimes more than this Perhaps should be given code to open the external door , Excellent location accessible yet quiet Good sized room Plenty of large towels Being able to leave luggage
175153,Fielding Hotel, No lift should have checked the details better Room was EXTREMELY small A BIG person would have had difficulty entering leaving the bathroom Room 14 , The location is fantastic Just a short walk to Covent Garden shops and many theatres Staff was very helpful and friendly 
175154,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, The Hotel is perfectly located opposite Royal Opera House in a pedestrianised street so no road noise a short stroll to Covent Garden theatres Excellent reception very welcoming Nothing too much trouble for staff facilities in room wanted for nothing and spacious too 
175155,Fielding Hotel, There is no elevator and the stairs is really tight so was hard for the receptionist to bring my bags to the room There is no access for cars in front of the hotel It was not a really problem but could be in case I had more laggages , The Staff was very kind and helpfull The room was small but cozy and clean The location is perfect and I had a great time 
175156,Fielding Hotel, A little shabby carpets fraying curtains mistreated but wouldn t let it put me off staying again , Location friendliness boutique feel to hotel looks fantastic at night lit up like a grotto 
175157,Fielding Hotel, Only downside were the pillows weren t the greatest and the shower cubicle had no where to put ur bottles but only silly minor details didn t ruin the stay at all, Staff were all lovely and room was spacious perfect location to theatres restaurants and Covent Garden
175158,Fielding Hotel, It is really central with some of the inconveniences that this implies higher levels of street noise than some might like , Lovely rooms if slightly drafty window and staff I ll stay again if i can get a good price
175159,Fielding Hotel, Room was quite stuffy but there was an air con unit available, Great location in Covent Garden Tastefully decorated room with nice firm bed Very pleasant and helpful staff
175160,Fielding Hotel, Nothing There is no food provided by the hotel but the area is brim full of places to eat , Excellent bedroom sitting room and shower room Decorated to a high standard Suite overlooking quiet pedestrian street in the heart of Covent Garden Spotlessly clean with plenty of toiletries coffee making facilities and complimentary mineral water Helpful staff 
175161,Fielding Hotel, The only complaint was that our shower overflowed A man came to fix it but it wasn t totally fixed Otherwise a very enjoyable stay , This was our second stay here as the location is perfect We love the small hotel feel as it s more personal The staff are AMAZING No question goes unanswered Manager Grace is worth more money The Nufield Gym pass is great too 
175162,Fielding Hotel, Not a boutique hotel as it sells itself more like a tired and v expensive B B Room too small and generally needed a face lift Not value for the money , Friendly staff and good location 
175163,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Friendly wonderful staff Location is perfect Even email response prior to arrival was fast and helpful I think most travelers would find this a solid choice for lodging Five minutes from the underground stop which was nice as we were rolling luggage from our connection Piccadilly Line to Heathrow is also easy peasey from there 
175164,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Location great for our needs Very clean throughout the Hotel Comfortable bed friendly staff relatively quiet location Little disappointed with the smallness of the room especially as it was relatively expensive but realise it is an old building that has probably been adapted Everything else about our stay was first class 
175165,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Calm and quiet hotel in the centre of London Rooms are spotless just a little small to be expected when the location is that incredible The service exceptional and the complimentary amenities make for a refreshing change 
175166,Fielding Hotel, Very noisy not so much from outside as I would have expected but lots of noise from the corridor outside the room at 7am, Comfortable room small as expected but well laid out clean and very comfortable
175167,Fielding Hotel, I liked it all, Excellent location I booked a single room expecting a little single bed but it was a 3 4 sized bed More than ample in size and comfort No elevators which is documented in the hotel information but the young guy on the desk offerred to carry my bag up if I needed help All the staff were friendly and helpful 
175168,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Probably the cleanest and friendliest hotel we have stayed in The location was superb the first time we ve stayed in London without having to use the underground 
175169,Fielding Hotel, For the price I do feel there should have been a bar or some breakfast options , The Manager Grace was lovely and most helpful Location excellent It was very quiet on a pedestrianised side street No traffic noise guests were quiet 24 hr desk handy 
175170,Fielding Hotel, Trying to find something there could have been more pillows but that is scraping to find a negative, The staff were very helpful and friendly and the room was well stocked with beverages 
175171,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Easy to find check in smooth room excellent really clean and smart really comfortable beds Despite being in middle of Covent Garden absolutely no noise slept like a log Reception staff were really good The room was lovely really clean well decorated good furnishings bathroom excellent generous tea and coffee making facilities and toiletries provides Really cannot fault anything about the hotel or staff and will definitely stay here again 
175172,Fielding Hotel, There is no lift elevator but you are offered assistance with your luggage if you need help to get to your room , Friendly and terrific staff GREAT LOCATION Clean charming and would definitely stay here again Grace and Charlotte are fantastic 
175173,Fielding Hotel, There is no lift which did not bother us but it could be a problem for the less mobile , Lovely hotel in a great location The staff were really friendly and helpful and the room was clean stylish and comfortable We will be back 
175174,Fielding Hotel, The tv in our room was not working but we didn t want to use it anyway Everything else was perfect , This lovely little hotel is tucked quietly down a pedestrian lane at the very heart of the hustle and bustle of Covent Garden We loved the claw foot tub in the room as well as a complete bathroom with large rain shower Complimentary toothbrushes bottles of water and slippers were a wonderful surprise This marvellous little hotel helped to make our visit to London snd the Lyceum theatre extra special 
175175,Fielding Hotel, Nothing bad at all just maybe would have liked a different view out of the window but that s all , We travelled to London for a last minute weekend away and booked only 7 days before We were pleasantly surprised to find this wonderful hotel right on the door step of the hustle and bustle but just enough distance away from it all so that it wasn t too noisy The hotel staff are absolutely top class very friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble the room was wonderful plenty of space and an amazing shower which I probably did stay in just a little longer than necessary The little extras just made it that more special like plenty of fresh bottled water tea coffee and hot choc and the bathroom toiletries were amazing along with a toothbrush and toothpaste which came in very useful as I forgot mine I would definitely stay here again infact looking at booking again for December to do a bit of xmas shopping Well done Fielding you get a massive thumbs up from us 
175176,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is in a wonderful location near Covent Garden SoHo and theater district It s on a quiet pedestrian street very calming A nice retreat from the lights and activity The hotel itself is beautiful The front desk staff were superb So helpful and pleasant 
175177,Fielding Hotel, I though this establishment was more like a guest house but that in itself is not a bad thing The ironing room was full of luggage so I had to carry the iron iron board up 3 flights of stairs rather than iron in the entrance hall way Sure this hotel will be fine for many but wasn t quite what I was looking for , Decor good and room very clean if very small Location for the South Bank was fine 
175178,Fielding Hotel, No breakfast but there are many choices a short walking distance from the hotel They do offer coffee and tea choices in your room , Great hotel in perfect location for theater in Convent Gardens My second stay and I hope to return soon 
175179,Fielding Hotel, Nothing to do with the hotel itself but there was construction work taking place just across from the hotel and so the noise in the morning was our wake up call , Lovely hotel perfect setting and great location Our room was very cute Clean and airy I loved the windows vintage feel inside and outside A few steps away from the vibrant Covent Garden absolutely delightful We were able to walk to Trafalgar Square Leicester Square Piccadilly Circus Westminister Big Ben British Museum National Gallery Buckingham Palace THE LIST GOES ON The walk was on average 20 30 minutes to each place but enjoyable We were able to see so much more this way Grace Manager was very helpful and friendly The complimentary tea coffee and water was great Next time in London will definitely book this little hidden treasure 
175180,Fielding Hotel, Decor a bit tatty around the edges and bathroom small No tissues , Location and simplicity of hotel No elaborate check in Given a room key and asked to leave it at reception when we went out what a brilliantly simple and unobtrusive way of keeping track of guests in case of fire etc Plenty of complimentary water toiletries no mini bar no extra charges 
175181,Fielding Hotel, Not able to use health club facilities as daughter under 18 which was one of the reasons we booked and this was not explained prior to arriving Decore carpets a little shabby as is some of the exterior d cor although this did not detract from the good level of customer service given by all hotel receptionists , Location pleasant and accommodating staff luggage storage as we were departing at 7pm Across from our favourite Zizzi restaurant 
175182,Fielding Hotel,No Negative, Location staff price and service were all fantastic An oasis in the middle of the city We will certainly book again I am partially sighted and have a brain tumour but wanted to have a few days in London to go to the theatre This hotel was the perfect solution The staff were very helpful and made my stay most enjoyable Thank you to everyone especially Grace Xx

175187,Fielding Hotel, Pricey but that s the central London prime location I guess Would have appreciated a shelf next to the bath , The staff couldn t have been more helpful We particularly appreciated being able to leave our bag after checkout and make use of a bathroom later The decor of the room was lovely and the bathroom facilities great Perfect location and a quiet area 
175188,Fielding Hotel, We booked a double and got 2 singles pushed together which is never the same Also the beds were a bit hard for my taste but I know people like it that way , Location was exceptional and the staff were very friendly and welcoming
