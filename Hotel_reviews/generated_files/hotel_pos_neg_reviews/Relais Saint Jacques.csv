136304,Relais Saint Jacques,No Negative, Loved our gorgeous French character room with French windows which opened over a little balcony of flowers We also enjoyed the guest lounge on ground floor with an honesty bar great to sit and enjoy a drink after a big day of walking 
136305,Relais Saint Jacques, Wish it was slightly closer to the metro station , Lovely decor of this boutique hotel room looks exactly the same as photos with elegant French flair design in details room size is considered big for Paris standard nice bathtub and toiletries the hotel staffs were very friendly and helpful We got it at pretty good deal too 
136306,Relais Saint Jacques, The rooms and bathroom were quite small and we couldn t move much around in them as we were travelling with our children The breakfast was also quite limited and didn t have much choice of food , The hotel is cozy and at an excellent location Quiet area but just within walking distance to the Pantheon Luxembourg garden and even to Notre Dam We walked everywhere Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful when asked for information 
136307,Relais Saint Jacques, We understand that space is very expensive in Paris but the room I was given did not a square inch to store the luggage not even the minuscule briefcase I had not to mention the six pillows that engulf the bed in the daytime , Very good and sightly pricey breakfast Very convenient location Well connected with the airports and wishing walking distance from the University 
136308,Relais Saint Jacques, The breakfast was good but there could have been a little more variety and you did have to wait for tea and coffee, The room view and temperature was perfect the hotel was quiet and relaxing and the staff were very courteous and helpful 
136309,Relais Saint Jacques, The rooms were too small , Placed in a great location in the heart of the Latin Quarter on a quiet and cozy street Many tasty restaurants around Friendly staff and good breakfasts

136312,Relais Saint Jacques, Air wasn t very cold I had to open window to cool room Although this was a small issue I liked hotel and location enough that I would stay there again , Staff was excellent I liked the surrounding area Hotel was clean and breakfast was good 
136313,Relais Saint Jacques, Pricey hotel if not for the booking com rate real iron at the room would be great, Nice hotel in a good area selection at breakfast is good wifi worked well close to the metro or the pantheon If you want to go into the latin quarter as well not far
136314,Relais Saint Jacques,No Negative, Good location Friendly staff According to Paris standards a big room We were at the second floor right next to the lift Fortunately we did not hear any noise not even at night 
136315,Relais Saint Jacques, 1 Waiting for 25 minutes for express breakfast 2 15 euros were blocked on card as a deposit for minibar Without any prior notice Guys it s ok to take deposits but you d better say about it to your guests BEFORE you did it , Good location Very polite and friendly staff Beautiful clean and comfortable room 
136316,Relais Saint Jacques, I can t think of anything , I love the location It is walking distance from the beautiful Luxembourg Garden and one bus trip away from all major attractions The staff is extremely friendly in particular the breakfast lady I love the bathroom It has a bath with jets and a plug that converts to 110 volts 
136317,Relais Saint Jacques,No Negative, Stuff are friendly They helped when we wanted a car to rent And booked train for us to Amsterdam The rooms are very clean and the design is so cute The bathroom is also clean The area surronding the hotel is great with alot of things to do and very nice Parisian botutiqes The twin bed was a bit small but overall the hotel was great with a good value of money
136318,Relais Saint Jacques, Nothing to add, I stayed at Relais St Jacques for the third time and found the room beautifully and tastefully decorated and clean The bed was clean and comfortable the bathroom perfect with snow white towels flannels robe and slippers I thoroughly enjoyed the bath jacuzzi and the fresh smelling toiletries The little hygiene pack is a brilliant idea as one often forgets the little cotton buds The staff is excellent competent and friendly particularly the lovely lady who runs the kitchen and serves breakfast The breakfast is brilliant and caters for all tastes The hotel is ideally situated in a safe area An added bonus for me is its proximity to the Curie Institute where I receive treatment and the Quartier Mouffetard I love Plenty of lovely restaurant within walking distance it is in every possible way
136319,Relais Saint Jacques, Check in area needs some sprucing up Wifi was weak Area around a bit run down , Staff very nice Express breakfast was fast and enough Location on side street quiet and pleasant Room good layout with small sitting area 
136320,Relais Saint Jacques, Room far too small with a strange shape and cluttered furniture therefore not practical for a couple, Really nice accessories in bedroom such as bed linen bath robes towels toiletries etc

136325,Relais Saint Jacques, Nothing we know Paris well , Perfect location and price very pretty little hotel The room was very nice small but not more so than other Paris hotels which cost more 
136326,Relais Saint Jacques, The limited room service for dinner Although there is a good choice of cooked meals on the menu they were unavailable when asked , The very comfortable beds and the jacuzzi bath tub

136330,Relais Saint Jacques, The bathrooom doesn t have a shower only a small one at the bathtube I am not used to take my shower seated and this was very uncomfortable I understand this is common in France but a hotel receives guests from all over the word and should follow international patterns , Spacious and comfortable room Very quiet and silent Close to metro station 
136331,Relais Saint Jacques, This is the first time that I didn t like nothing If you ask what could they have more then I would like to answer as a small garden like with 2 3 tables , Comfort of the bed Good aircondition lively room design Clean toilet Shower close to train good neighbourhood
136332,Relais Saint Jacques, The air conditioner should be more efficient the noise from the street is too disturbing to keep the window open during nights, Nice and helpful staff friendly interior and atmosphere

136335,Relais Saint Jacques, Room size could have been bigger but that s not something we would expect in a Paris boutique hotel so it was perfectly fine , Style staff and location

136337,Relais Saint Jacques, The suite was a bit cramped once the sofa bed was open and a cot set up , The room decor was beautiful and bed was very comfortable Staff were extremely helpful 
136338,Relais Saint Jacques, The room was a bit small But that was because the couch was pulled out to a bed for our kids , We loved the location Easily accessible to many tourist spots Fantastic restaurants in walking distance Our children were amazed 
136339,Relais Saint Jacques, The day I checked in I told the staff I was leaving a day early however when I checked out I was told I had to pay for the night I wasn t going to be there Plus I had to pay for breakfast for two I wasn t going to be there for Also not crazy about restaurant next door Not very friendly and very expensive , The staff was very nice and helpful I don t speak French and everyone who worked at the hotel was understanding about that

136342,Relais Saint Jacques, The internet was very slow and not easy to access , Friendly helpful reception staff Decent sized room overlooking fairly quiet street Comfortable and absolutely fine as a base for sight seeing 
136343,Relais Saint Jacques, Nothing all great , Great boutique type hotel at higher quality and lower price than other Paris hotels Had to stay in the highly rated Marriott Rive Gauche for work a few days later and that was terrible in comparison Would much rather stay at the St Jacques They gave us the room with a French balcony which was lovely Windows very sound proof Quiet room 
136344,Relais Saint Jacques, The room was very small No control of room temperature The hotel was located near the Luxembourg Gardens and the Pantheon but not many shops or restaurants nearby The hotel terms seem to differ from the booking com terms listed , Very nice bathroom facility Very clean Very good breakfast 
136345,Relais Saint Jacques, Bathroom is in need of tender love and care paint is coming off the door part of the wall by the shower is all black and moldy from water penetration, beautiful location lovely room
136346,Relais Saint Jacques, As with previous reviews I encountered and smelled a member of staff who smoked compulsively He was smoking outside when I arrived For the first three days every time I went in the lift from the fourth floor he entered the lift at the second floor in order to smoke outside The lift smelled of stale cigarette smoke he smelled of smoke and I was only glad that the windows in my room did not open above his smoking position To the manager please ask your staff member to smoke further away from the hotel , I was lucky enough to be reserve a room at this hotel through a special offer The location 10 minutes walk from the Jardin du Luxembourg was unbeatable I loved the bath with its water jets the bed was very comfortable and the staff were delightful I recommend the breakfast tray in one s room 
136347,Relais Saint Jacques, Room a bit small though typical of paris, Helpful friendly staff Lovely breakfast room and lounge bar Spacious bathroom and nice bed and linen Handy to Luxembourg Gardens and St Germain shopping Many great cafes and restaurants within 5 minute stroll 
136348,Relais Saint Jacques, While the reception staff were very friendly they were not well acquainted with area restaurants , Very quiet with windows closed Plethora of minimarts pastry shops and eateries nearby Easy walk to RER entrance The lobby honor bar was a first 
136349,Relais Saint Jacques, The internet was very frustrating got disconnected as soon as gadget went idle and had to connect every few minutes and very slow , It is an OK hotel and good breakfast 
136350,Relais Saint Jacques, Our only disappointment was that our toilet blocked in the afternoon and although we reported it at 7pm when we returned just before midnight it hadn t been addressed I asked reception who said it they couldn t sort it and we would have to use the toilet on the lower ground floor we were 3rd floor overnight a solution but not what we would expect at the rate we paid for the room Shame that this left a negative impression on an otherwise lovely stay , Nice hotel lovely room and excellent location for exploring Paris Room warm quite warm but we could open the window as the surrounding area wasn t too noisy Didn t have breakfast so cannot comment 
136351,Relais Saint Jacques, The jacuzzi bath in my bathroom was broken The tables at breakfast were tiny and they expected two people to sit at them The wi fi was APPALLING NOT a business equipped hotel , The toiletries were nice L Occitane and the two people I encountered at reception during my stay were pleasant Lovely location 
136352,Relais Saint Jacques, Only slight complaint was a member of staff had a regular smoke break just below our bedroom window , The staff were very warm and friendly and were keen to help Breakfast food was good plentiful and in nice setting Room was comfortable and we were not disturbed 
136353,Relais Saint Jacques, Room can use a bit of refurbishment All in all a nice place , Staff the location L occitane amenities bathrobes and slippers Great value for money for central Paris 
136354,Relais Saint Jacques, Breakfast was indifferent Dry scrambled eggs overcooked bacon , Ideal location two blocks from Luxembourg Gardens one block from a Metro station entrance next to the Sorbonne less than a mile from the Latin Quarter the Seine and Notre Dame One of the young ladies at the reception desk was particularly helpful too 
136355,Relais Saint Jacques, Could ve being great but there was no working air conditioner in the hotel The bedroom was extremely hot making it unbereable After complaining twice they gave us a fan and said that the temperature was the same in all rooms A shame Also the free wifi was very slow , Great location friendly staff Very good breakfast They were very gentle to offer us one breakfast for free but if charged you could say 17 Euros would be a little too expensive Everything would be excellent if they only had an working air conditioner
