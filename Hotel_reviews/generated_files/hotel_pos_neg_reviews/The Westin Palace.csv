404550,The Westin Palace, Some very small things They forgot twice to refill coffee capsules and put the coffee cups back A pool would be the icing on the cake The roof terrace has been somewhat abandoned The gym is a little sad and could be improved , Fast professional and attentive service The staff were all great from the restaurant to room service and reception to valet Could not be happier The room was lovely and clean We had our 20 month old daughter with us and they really helped to fulfill all our requests 
404551,The Westin Palace, I was sorry to see that the beautiful classical marble fountain that had graced the bar lounge had been removed and replaced with a very unexceptional looking table Moreover I was astounded to learn that it had to be broken up and destroyed in order to remove it Utter vandalism , Very attractive interior with classical features Very comfortable furnishings both in the room and in the public areas Very relaxing and congenial atmosphere All the staff were most helpful and friendly 
404552,The Westin Palace, There isnt a pool the breakfast services are poor and buffet takes a while to be replenished Rooms are not cleaned well and never replenished properly until you call housekeeping ,No Positive
404553,The Westin Palace, The water pressure of shower was a bit low The hair dryer was brocken but soon replaced , very good location easy access to central station and duomo Very nice and helpful stuff They recommend us fatastic restaurants close to hotel 
404554,The Westin Palace, Bar was far too expensive and I stay in a lot of 5 star hotels Air conditioning not great and entire hotel a little dated , Room was a good size and very nicely furnished 
404555,The Westin Palace, For the price of the hotel they should try to renovate a little the carpets are old and look dirty Also they offer one small bottle of water in an expensive suite and for the second one they charge 10 that s insane, The hotel is in a great central area and close to all the main attractions
404556,The Westin Palace, Breakfast for the price was disappointing with staff failing to offer hot drinks When we finally waved one down we received one coffee instead of two The food itself was fine except for stale hash browns , The room and bed were amazing Very comfortable indeed Hotel staff gifted us a bottle of cava and a cake for my partner s birthday which was fantastic and unexpected
404557,The Westin Palace, The staff were patronizing and rude The clothes space was for two and housekeeping kept neglecting to leave toiletries for two even when repeatedly told Breakfast was overpriced with poor selection for a Westin and staff who didn t give a damn , The bed was comfy and there were some good restaurants within walking distance
404558,The Westin Palace, Small Bathrooms Location 20 mins walk to the Doumo Milano No shuttle to the Doumo Breakfast, Spacious room Breakfast served up to 12 during weekends Friendly Staff Close to Milano Central Train Station
404559,The Westin Palace, I did not like the way I booked for a modern contemporary room and was given a classic and had to go to reception to ask them to change it as my room cost 50 pounds more for this specific choice I also did not like fact that once they put me in the room I booked for the internet was not working well They also did not do the turn down service at night so when I returned to my room it was not nice and welcoming , I love the beds and pillows Extremely comfortable 
404560,The Westin Palace, Concierge were a little uppity with their attitude I felt they catered more to the business traveler rather than the tourist , What a grand hotel Very ostentatious feel with beautiful details We stayed in an older suite but it was still very clean well appointed had good heating cooling capacity 
404561,The Westin Palace, Everything was great, It s a 5 minute walk from Central Train Station in Milan to the Westin Palace My room was awesome and staff was very friendly and efficient I will stay there each time I visit Milan Several restaurants are walking distance from hotel 
404562,The Westin Palace, room was with big windows but no view and at the inside of the building so even during day time it was dark in the room Car parking cost 36 50 E for one night Arrived in the hotelrestaurant at 19 25 and was send out in an unfriendly way like a child as the restaurant would open in 5 minutes I eat outside it seems that when you book through booking com the hotels tend to give you the worst rooms ,No Positive
404563,The Westin Palace, Oh man the hotel is old actually i cannot tell if its really really old or they designed it to look old Either way its not for me at least First they gave us 3 joining rooms for our family Rooms very really old and smelly you know the carpet smell So i figured they are renovating the rooms and some room doors are black which indicates renovated rooms i thought and i was right i asked the reception to change our rooms and so they did The new rooms are good really spacious The rooms were clean and had no smell The fitness is quiet small for that large of a hotel Breakfast is mediocre try to get a space early in the morning as there are not enough seats , Its centrally located very close to central station if you want to travel to other cities or to Como Staff is friendly and helpfull they try to go the extra mile 
404564,The Westin Palace, The cleaning staff a litlle to loud aroun 8 9 am The room on the first floor has no view , Good location metro station and city tour bus station just outside property Very nice hotel good facilities staff very nice and helpful 
404565,The Westin Palace, Buffet breakfast was really not good and could be a lot better at not much extra cost or effort to the hotel , All staff was great professional and friendly The concierge team was particularly helpful and effective 
404566,The Westin Palace, Room cleaning did not replace any amenities You needed to call to get them the bathroom smelled moldy or something if you are at all sensitive to these things The minibar was very very expensive We had a Turkish bath in the suite why We did not have a walk in shower only a slippery bathtub not safe or comfortable and this was a suite The location was not good not bad Not too far from the city center via tram no 1 but at the edge of rather basic neighborhoods There are some bars and good restaurants near the hotel , A wonderful large suite one of the best ever nice luxury hotel atmosphere we liked it 
404567,The Westin Palace, nothing at all , everything was perfect we had great full memories there general secure safety box was the best option what we were satisfied with 
404568,The Westin Palace, It looks old from Inside the Room Air Condition was ok Bath shower was terrible Matress is not comfortable Overall my experiecne is not good , Friendly and helpful staff I find italians are very helpful and friendly people 
404569,The Westin Palace, I was not treated like a starwood member as I booked via booking com Neither did I get any rewards points Restaurant and fitness center nothing special , The rooms are beautifully decorated
404570,The Westin Palace, The room and the attitude, I have been in the hotel several times and always stayed in reasonable rooms But this time the first room your staff offered was too small and then they gave us a horable room Old dusty the curtains was from 16 th century The TV was not working The image of your hotel was destroyed and I persuaded my colleagues and my client to stay in this hotel at least 4 times Your reception personal was very unwelcoming and not helpful after so many times we have been in your hotel The money and value was not balanced this time The personnel in the restaurant is also not very kind Best regards
404571,The Westin Palace, The mini bar was bot retocked We arrived into the room with a bottle of white wine opened But still full and also two bottles of beer opened one was nearly empty the other was one gulp down , Bed
404572,The Westin Palace, The room had a terrible moldy smell The breakfast was not great at all and certainly not worth the price Poor choices and quality, Location is very good the front desk staff very friendly 
404573,The Westin Palace, The first room there was a coffee stain on the bedspread An empty can of potato chips from the previous guest The beds are not particularly comfortable , The front of house staff are really great 
404574,The Westin Palace, Room rates expensive as were the hotel restaurant and bar, Very courteous and conscientious staff VERY comfortable beds Nice bathrooms Good breakfast buffet
404575,The Westin Palace, The price of a drink It was cheaper to grab a coffee from the Gucci cafe than it was from the hotel , The bath a room were very relaxing after a cold day in the city 
404576,The Westin Palace, make sure you double check the pictures of your room as half of the hotel is very dated It s a sort of old world grandeur that is likely to divide opinion We moved from a jnr suite to a basic contemporary room which was testament to their excellent customer service but also to a massive disparity in standards of accomodation , The hotel staff were excellent and the beds super comfy Lovely bar and you can t fault the service standards 
404577,The Westin Palace, The cleanless of the hotel the bathroom was nit clean and everyday we found a different type of bug in the bathroom Also everytime some one uses the bathroom we can hear it , I loved the location
404578,The Westin Palace, Not very friendly service at the check out Bad noise isolation between the rooms and the corridor Expensive breakfast Room could be cleaned better , Bed comfort 
404579,The Westin Palace, I a little light on the housekeeping bathroom not really cleaned dishes left indefinately, Luxury and outstanding staff i e Moosie Concierge Serena front desk two GREAT EMPLOYEES treat them well reward them they will represent your company well 
404580,The Westin Palace, Not much could have been better, Bed really comfortable nice pillows Room clean got an upgrade without asking public areas nicely presented pleasant staff
404581,The Westin Palace, The electricity was a bit off would flyctuate sometimes but it is an old building but very well maintained , Staff was very helpful we were a big group and they upgraded our rooms provided us with excellent restaurant recommendations helped us arrange a baby sitter for 2 nights was a bit pricey though always quick to get us a taxi room service was even happy to make us food items not on the menu 
404582,The Westin Palace, Late night room service menu could be a lot better in terms of variety Some standard things found in other hotels for late night such as club sandwhich burger and pizza are not there Room service and restaurants are on the more pricey side but at least the quality is good Breakfast is fine but if your staying there more than two days it s very limited exact same thing everyday and very limited menu the staff at breakfast however were superb, Awesome service from the front desk and duty manager during our stay While there is not much to do for young kids at the hotel there are a lot of places nearby they can spend hours in such as the park museum of natural history aquarium just to name a few Rooms are very spacious compared to similar hotels in the area super clean hotel and very elegant
404583,The Westin Palace, Restaurant staff is slow and not professional and not enough attention is given to clients and they tend to be or absent or busy talking to themselves For a large 5 star hotel plus given the Westin brand and service sincerely you must look into improving the attentiveness of the waiters Hostess are just hanging around without providing and service at all and food buffet almost ignored even when food was empty , Location is excellent Front office staff very helpful and professional both at check in and check out Your consierge personnel is excellent Room service is little slow and house keeping forgot to put the min 2 bottles of water in the room which is important in the summer as its hot but room was well cleaned and on time 
404584,The Westin Palace,No Negative, The entire staff from check in to check out went out of their way to meet our needs Giovanni the concierge was charming knowledgeable and gave us great recommendations but everyone from the parking attendants to the servers in the bar and terrace restaurant were very helpfull We would Come back again just because of the staff 
404585,The Westin Palace, I do not believe I got the best out of the money Suite was overrated , Staff was very welcoming and polite Excellent room service and hotel products smells like haven The hotel is a 15 20 min walk away from all luxury shopping and central city and the staff is more then happy too help you find your way 
404586,The Westin Palace, The hotel is very dated and the restaurant was very empty with a horrible ambiance and energy The first night I arrived I felt like I was in an abandoned palace , Breakfast was one of few places in Italy where I was finally able to have my eggs toast and breakfast sausage Definitely limited compared to other breakfast buffets I ve had but it was a good change to Positano hotel where all I ate was croissants It s also overpriced though Beds are very comfortable and some parts of the hotel are worth staring at for their architecture 
404587,The Westin Palace, the manicure was appalling for such a large hotel two cut nail beds watered down nail polish with polish remover but I was still charged full amount even after notifying the hotel I have heard nothing from them , Bed was comfortable and room was ok
404588,The Westin Palace, Staff at reception and at breakfast on the first day made you feel requests were an inconvenience to them No tea or coffee making facilities , Location excellent for station 
404589,The Westin Palace, The breakfast was nothing to write home about Not much variety unless you are into to variety of breads , The location was great It was very close to the major shopping areas The decor of the rooms were nice too
404590,The Westin Palace, It was a room with 2 single beds but they had only one bath robe and one pair of slippers We were so lazy to call the reception to ask for them was already 11pm when we came back to the hotel so we let it go , Service was very professional Very comfortable room and beds Elegant decoration and atmosphere Convenient location about 8 min walk to Duomo and is situated on a metro station which has a line direct to Duomo 
404591,The Westin Palace, I was expecting a better breakfast everything was nice and fresh of course but I am accustomed to larger buffets , Those members of Staff I dealt with were responsive and polite always happy to assist

404594,The Westin Palace, Far location Aggressive staff one female lady wasn t pleasant at the reception She doesn t have a possotive manner while dealing with customers This is a five star and an international one not a 3 or 4 star hotel Therefore service and staff should be more of professional and up to high level , Bed was comfy But room is too old with old furniture and toilet Must be renovated Very far location though 
404595,The Westin Palace, Room service is terrible Poor menu Busy line all the time They don t know which room you are calling from The poor waiters are old and appeared exhausted all time The concierge is not friendly at all, Smooth check in and out Location is reasonable Nice lobby and housekeeping services

404598,The Westin Palace, We didn t have breakfast due to the fact it was 40 euros per person that seemed expensive compared to other 5 star hotels in other cities , Fantastic room we booked a Junior Suite and had a great view On arrival the hotel had put a bottle of champagne and fruit in the room which was a lovely touch and a fitting end to our honeymoon We also got a free late check out till 3pm
