314939,Melia Vienna, If you are traveling by car be prepared to pay 30 euro daily charge for the parking in the tower Even though the hotel has some reserved parking spots you will still have to pay and there are no other parking next to the hotel , The hotel is located in a nice highrise tower which creates stunning views of the city The 57th floor is a great place to spend your time overlooking the city The room was quite comfortable and spacious LEVEL room Couldn t find much of the English language channels but that is not of a concern The hotel staff is very friendly and prepared everything that I wished for flowers champagne Sacher cake 
314940,Melia Vienna, We waited almost 2 hours for room service after complaining to the staff multiple times When we received our food they still got the order wrong It was also impossible to call in our order as no one would pick up the phone hence we had to go to the reception to order , The rooms were very clean and the facilities are quite nice 
314941,Melia Vienna, No service Very disorganized It took 3 hours 9 phone calls and I had to go down to the reception twice to have a simple Burger to eat in my room Consolation is that I was not the only one but several guests where on line to inquire to the reception about the same very issue Ended up ordering at 20 00 and eating around 23 00, Rooms where clean
314942,Melia Vienna, We made a reservation for a stay in the bar on the top floor the same evening we arrived The lady helping us stated that the reservation was made When we in the evening wanted to go there another employee was present and he told us that there was no reservation no chance to get one while they were for days already fully booked He approached us very unpleasently If we would have known this before we would have made other arrangements Now the evening was just destroyed Back to the room then where the TV would not work I will not use this hotel again , The reception worked well and people where friendly Breakfast was very good

314953,Melia Vienna, The interpersonal skills of the young girl on the reception for the restaurant 57 could have been better tried to book a table as we returned from a very hot day out in Vienna to be told rather judgementally as she looked me up and down that there was a dress code I was wearing shorts at the time On arriving for the meal was told that there was no booking in my name The restaurant staff at this time were very helpful and friendly and found space for us and we enjoyed a delicious meal , The staff were very friendly The room was excellent with wonderful views Clean and tidy at all times A wonderful shower Although we never had breakfast in the hotel the food we had was excellent 
314954,Melia Vienna, The bed was too hard Room was noisy Also one of the curtains could not be closed so it was light in the room at 0530 The curtain was fixed by the technician but malfunctioned again after one day , Nice bathroom nice top to bottom windows and a free minibar

314958,Melia Vienna,No Negative, We arrived after a 22hour flight from Australia and were treated exceptionally well by the staff We booked a Level room which is large super comfortable great views of the city and river and the bathroom is fabulous Rooms are very quiet because of the carpets in the hallways We had access to the club lounge on level 57 with amazing views good food and great service No complaints here
314959,Melia Vienna, Front office upgraded our room to the Level it is a nice room with good view however the ceiling always makes noise all the time and it does bother the sleeping quality , Staff are proficient and effective to the request room service is extremely amazing 
314960,Melia Vienna, The room was not very clean the bathroom especially the towels are not for a 5 star hotel the windows are making a lot of noises in the morning when the sun is rising the bed was not comfortable at all ,No Positive
314961,Melia Vienna, A small problem in that the electrical socket on one side of the bed was not working would have been good to be able to charge my phone overnight as I use it as my alarm , The whole experience was excellent The inclusion of access to Level 57 restaurant bar was the icing on the cake amazing views of the Danube accompanied by good food
314962,Melia Vienna, The 57 Lounge staff could improve in their behavior Not exactly the most polite people going Definitely need a lesson in politeness especially with inhouse guests , Location is good The reception staff is good
314963,Melia Vienna, Poor experience during check in forgot a device and called 3 hours after check out to claim it and they told me they didn t find anything they were too lazy so they just threw it away , the mini bar was for free water and chips and changes daily
314964,Melia Vienna, The quality of instruction material is poor The air conditionar and windows have a lot of noise The water goes out from the bathroom The view is kind of industrial The staff aren t friendly and helpfull, The metro station is near
314965,Melia Vienna, Having to close the curtains to shut out the amazing views at night Because I can t sleep unless it s totally blacked out , Staff are just the best So helpful and amazingly positive The room was exceptional because the positing of the room gave the best view of Vienna at such a height Ate in the 57 lounge restaurant Great food and atmosphere Best hotel in Vienna according to me and I ve stayed in a few 
314966,Melia Vienna, Made an upgrade Lavel as a result at 8 30 P M the sports complex was closed breakfast on the 57th floor was very meager late checkout was not confirmed The administrator refused to accept the claim,No Positive
314967,Melia Vienna, bathrooms are so dark black and with all the glass I kept walking into walls and doors not cozy but modern sleek style with lots of windows, proximity to the Vienna International Center
314968,Melia Vienna, Very expensive parking place both hotel s and near not that easy to find the location by the car, Confortable room with nice view friendly and helpful staff the rooftop bar was great
314969,Melia Vienna, the tidiness of the linens were not fresh and the cladding black color in toilets causes dark atmosphere in the room, location of hotel and view from level 57 was more than amazing and extra ordinary
314970,Melia Vienna, Breakfast was an extortionate extra I went to the bakery close by one opposite another in the metro station for breakfast For the price I paid 330 euros for 2 nights I would have expected the breakfast and gym included but it was not Some issues of poor noise insulation but luckily I was not too disturbed , Very comfortable and clean I enjoyed my stay there Staff polite Very easy from airport 4 minutes walk from the direct airport bus stop on the main road I don t drink coffee but Housekeeping were happy to immediately supply a kettle and nice tea bags for no charge Fruit juices in the free mini bar were very welcome 
314971,Melia Vienna, They told me I could check in early but after waiting for 40 minutes they told me no u can t get in for another hour If they told me the start I could have enjoyed my day I forgot a device in the bathroom And after calling them by 3 hours they told me nothing was in the room Room service was too lazy to report it since it s something u CANT miss, The whole wall was glass but it was cold in the same time
314972,Melia Vienna, I booked two Superior rooms 34sqm A double Superior and two single beds Superior rooms The two single bed room was superior but they then tried to pass a double bedroom 28sqm to me as Superior premium Complained twice before a nice lady at the reception changed it to Superior after taking me round about 4 rooms to choose from In the end two single beds were moved together to make a double in a Superior room ,No Positive
314973,Melia Vienna, The location is bad and nothing is around It is a business area and not suited for tourism However there a metro station nearby and might help a bit , The Hotel is very nice and modern The room had an amazing view over the river from the 13th floor Good value of money 
314974,Melia Vienna, Breakfast far too expensive at 26 per person the selection of different foods is good but not outstanding , The room was spacious clean and nicely decorated and the view was simply amazing The staff was extra friendly and attentive Tasty food at the Flow Bar in the lobby All in all a great place to stay if visiting the Vienna International Centre 
314975,Melia Vienna, We waited 1 hour and 15 minutes for room service the concierge parking it actually costs 30 eur day without being anounced at check in the system was down at check in we waited half an hour just for getting a room facility is nice but they have a lot of flaws restaurant and lounge staff are under qualified for a 5 star hotel , Facility is nice view from the room is unique room itself it is nice free minibar 
314976,Melia Vienna,No Negative, The bed was massive and super comfortable Also the staff was very friendly and professional Food in the 57th floor restaurant was quite expensive but really good 
314977,Melia Vienna, A minor negative point was the following The air conditioning was very noisy Luckily did not need it during the night because it was cool enough without running it non stop , The staff is super professional and very friendly and accommodating Breakfast very good Nice relaxed and quiet atmosphere Very comfortable room with a nice view The concierge was very helpful Room service was very quick This is everything I expect from an establishment who has such ambitious being a real 5 star hotel Actually my expectations were exceeded 
314978,Melia Vienna, We had to move rooms at 2am because of a nauseous smell coming from the bathroom Apparently it is something they are aware of and put it down to the many floors We were exhausted as a result of poor sleep and also sick the next morning When reported to the duty manager she smiled throughout the conversation almost smirking very disappointed with what we hoped would be a good weekend topped off with a nice hotel The beds were also uncomfortable, The shower
314979,Melia Vienna, Best hotel experience for years and highly recommend, Courteous professional and helpful staff Excellent breakfast choice quality and service Modern spacious bedroom and bathroom 
314980,Melia Vienna, Receptionists are weird Insisted on prepayment weren t polite When I was checking in one of the guests was trying to bring a prostitute in the room and calmly discussing it with the other receptionist While in Vienna center it is in isolated area with no free cheap parking nearby hotel parking is 30 eur day but there is Donau City Residence parking nearby for 18 eur day The area around is extremely windy and uncomfortable at winter I think it s all more or less OK for a business hotel but if you are travelling with family it s better to choose something else , Modern design Nice view over Vienna Big and beautiful shower room no bath though Clean 
314981,Melia Vienna, Food wasn t worth the money breakfast room service we found a trash from the previous guests in the bathroom Location is slightly off the city centre, Beautifully decorated room with huge bed and stunning view over Vienna
314982,Melia Vienna, It was a bit overpriced but the reason was the period that we choose I think the best period to enjoy best Vienna is spring or summer It is not in the city centre and you need some kind of transportation , I stayed in Melia Vienna during New Year s eve period Everything was great The view from our room was amazing Danube river was in front of us It is a very relaxing place to stay Hotel staff was perfect ready to solve any problem and always with nice mood The breakfast had almost everything and with The level package you can enjoy your breakfast at 57th floor Mini bar is free of charge with one refill per day and 4 capsules for nespresso machine Hotel is 2 3 minutes away from underground train and you can be in the center of city in less than 10 minutes 
314983,Melia Vienna, Nothing , Staff are nice the lounge bar at the 58th floor is amzaing room service is perfect I like that mini bar are free per day the room view is so nice and the room decorate is elegance the councerge service is what we need thanks a lot melia 
314984,Melia Vienna, The glass panel dividing the bathroom from the bedroom can be weird if you are a family or if you just value privacy The flow restaurant where we had dinner is situated in the lobby right next to the doors every time someone went in or out the freezing cold made us shiver , The staff were all lovely and went out of their way to be helpful Was genuine and kind The room was spacious and with an elegant design The bed was supremely comfortable 
314985,Melia Vienna, The choise for the breakfast could be better I use to eat cottage cheese for eksempel It is not big deal but it could be Nice to have , The room was Nice and comfortable coffee and drinks included makes more pleasent to stay and work Stuff very friendly and helpful
314986,Melia Vienna, Breakfast was very poor in 5 star hotel we were expecting something better Room service was the worst i ve even seen and ate The black personnel was very rude, Very good hotel nice view from restaurant in 57 floor 
314987,Melia Vienna, Breakfast too expensive I think around 26 each thank God for the bakery nearby , Beautiful view Great design Metro just a walk away easy to commute Incredible comfort Loved it 
314988,Melia Vienna, Real bad value Don t even know where to start Their average room rate is 450 eur per night They claim 5 stars but don t even have a real room service after 11 pm they had nothing to eat only toast And no wine They made an exception for us and brought us some wine that they collected from somewhere else We came at Xmas time and there was barely any Christmas ambience The hotel ihas yet to invest in decorations The walls in the hallways and floors are huge and totally empty The floor hallways resemble those of a bankrupt shopping mall There is no furniture and no decoration whatsoever Unbelievable The place is soulless The bathroom designer should be fired on the spot All black and dark Maybe they think it s chique but they have little clue about proper interior design Also Not even an iron or heating element in the room The AC made a terrible noise The separation walls are made of sheetroc not concrete You can hear your neighbors Unbelievable In such an expensive place The lounge restaurant on top is a joke They think they really are something The poshness of the staff is silly Another couple we met had exactly the same opinion And what to offer except for rediculous expensive drinks and waiters begging for a tip approaching your table literally every minute There is zero view of interest either You may be high up there Melia but you yet have to grow a lot And also here please start decorating the place It s totally barren except for tables and chairs there is nothing Not one painting or anything on the walls Zero character zero warmth Forget the top floor all together Been to tons of so much better sky lounges all over the world Without the rediculous pretense and prices and actually with a REAL view Who wants to look down on nothing around This is by far the worst sky lounge ever Sorry but true People come only since they claim to be the highest floor in all of Austria , Rooms are modern and new Front desk staff was very friendly But that s about it 
314989,Melia Vienna, The maids ask to clean your room at circa 9am I have travelled a lot and have never experienced this I understand they want to get the job done and it is a big hotel but it should not be expected that all guests are out of the rooms let awake at such an hour on their vacation We were disturbed again even after I popped the do not disturb sign on and AGAIN on our check out day by the minibar man We did not and do not intend to formally complain however had this happened to the wrong lind of guest I am sure they would have escalated it to mangement Our bathroom door was broken as well as the coffee machine which was eventually replaced and also our heating wouldnt work so it was just blowing cold air , It s a very glamorous hotel so you do feel like a rockstar knowing that you are staying in the tallest building in the city The beds are very comfy and I really like that there was enough space in the room and bath room Outside the room there is ample space to chill out on different floors Wehad the Xmas brunch which was phenomenal and the upstairs bar really makes the best cocktails I have ever tasted The staff are multilingual a lot of them speak atleast 3 different languages which is awesome 
314990,Melia Vienna, We made the booking for two adults and a 6 yo child and when we came at the reception they said we have the reservation for two adults because of the booking com policy We had to pay 65 euro more night The third bed wasn t a good one and we had to wait for it two hours We asked for a room with a city view because ours was with highway view They said we have to upgrade because only the most expensive rooms have city view But we paid 250 euro night for a double First night the heating doesn t work we asked two times at the reception and they said they ll send somebody but nobody came so we slept in 18 19 degrees Very expensive parking 3 EUR hour Far from city center 9 5 km by google maps or waze , Design cleanliness free minibar bathroom
314991,Melia Vienna,No Negative, The rooftop restaurant was private to the rest of the hotel hotel guests were priority only aloud In lifts with a hotel card which you receive when you pay for a room Classy lovely atmosphere clean and left you feeling special 
314992,Melia Vienna, There were no slippers in the room In the last day the Cleaning lady came at 8 30 in the morning at the door to check if we vacated the room and once again after one hour , Everything was excelent 
314993,Melia Vienna, Even google maps wouldn t find the hotel and on the way out there s no clear signsage nor direction to take you nether to the city nor to the airport We received misleading information about the executive lounge and we checked out not knowing whether there is actually a lounge and what would the supplement charge be to gain access to it Not all the members of staff weee friendly Poor breakfast buffet not so much choice neither variety of food and very much overpriced for what it is I usually stay at the intercontinental prices are but much different but the experience is way better let alone the location , The hotel is new and the interior is beautiful some of the staff members are very friendly The car park is easy accessible and very practical to use 
314994,Melia Vienna, 5stars hotel but in the room you dont have slippers that is SHAME because carpet was not the cleanest does not mean dirty But that is all I can say like minus , Best was view from bar restaurant top of tower great rich breakfast pleasant stuff Here you can see that hotel have 5stars Hotel is 2mins from underground station or you can walk across bridge to the city 
314995,Melia Vienna, The waiters were in a rush during breakfast time We ordered coffee and took some croissants we went for more and when we went back they had cleaned our table The entrance area is very dark If you want to read you have to struggle Some more lights would be nice , Luxury room Very comfortable and clean Coffee machine and mini bar included

314997,Melia Vienna, It is 10 minutes in metro to the old city and outside of business hours there are not a lot of places to eat close to the hotel , The staff was very friendly and helpful the breakfast was good the view incredible the room very clean spacious the wifi worked very well and the room installations were great Overall this was a very good place to stay and I really liked there Room service had very good food at reasonable prices 
314998,Melia Vienna, It was hard to find the parking white walls paint in the room were dirty I assume from bag scratches carpet ends were becoming loose stairs leading to the reception were dirty Certainly one is not expecting to notice such things in a 5 hotel Also it was very disturbing that at 9 30 in the morning cleaning lady knocked on the door and while I was heading to open to my surprise she just used her card to open it herself , We liked the view to the city nespresso cofee machine in the room nice restaurant 
314999,Melia Vienna, Unresponsive reception I have tried to call the reception 4 5 times without answer Very noisy heating unit we cant sleep Expensive parking 30 EUR day Expensive breakfast 23EUR , View from the 57th floor Modern interior design 
315000,Melia Vienna, Nothing , The bed was very comfortable It had the most beautiful views It was within walking distance to the conference center and the railway station and bus stops The architecture was fantastic The lifts were fast 
315001,Melia Vienna, The see through toile doors was a bit strange but we managed , Very comfortable and sapcious room Excellent vew The breakfast was a buffee with delicious and a lot of variates that one can have Very welcoming and cooperative staff I high recommend it for business and for family vacation 
315002,Melia Vienna, The attitude of the staff is poor A woman who helps guests make dinner reservation at the hotel restaurant judged our clothes and emphasized that we were not wecomed She said everyone felt uncomfortable when saw us in our outfits She also emphasized that they are five star hotel and required everyone including guests to wear suit and tie We were in our vacation Why should we bring our suit when we have a leisure trip We have been to many five star hotels and none of them told us that they felt uncomfortable about our clothes Also the location of the hotel is bad It is way far away from downtown The cleaning team is also poor They made up the bed by moving guests goods on the bedside table including our clothes They should put our stuff on the bed in case we cannot find it They cleaned our room while made my clothes dirty when they stacked our clothes on the table including underwears , The view from the window is fantastic 
315003,Melia Vienna, Rang room service twice and they didn t respond to our request despite saying they would Very disappointing service Would not recommend ordering any type of salad in the Loft bar as it was warm and limp Despite pointing this out we were still charged 12 euros for a side salad, Bed was fab The room spacious and clean
315004,Melia Vienna, Staff and facilities in the hotel Not enough ironing boards Wrong booking Staff in the bar complaining and not being able to serve because they are on alone Bar in room not well stocked only beer Not really impressed by the food undercooked burgers ll service made a nice hotel average,No Positive

315011,Melia Vienna, Check in was late Poor management and the first impression left on us was terrible Bathroom floor heating was on and could not be turned down It was 29 degrees Celsius View was terrible and not what was promised No slippers or gowns were provided At this price they need to look at their customer service , Bed very comfortable
315012,Melia Vienna, I think the hotel trying to be more than it is Not convenient if you wish to walk anywhere Bathrooms so dark you cannot see anything Walls scuffed in the rooms ,No Positive
315013,Melia Vienna, Location not the best for tourists average room service no pool spa in the hotel , Staff are wonderful great rooms Red Level lounge is a winner 
315014,Melia Vienna, You must take the train to go to the city centre so not the best location for travelers who like to stop by the hotel midday or before dinner to freshen up , Very new modern hotel room nice nespresso machine with free capsules free bottle of champagne brought to our room on arrival I think it was because it was our one year wedding anniversary Great view of Vienna from the windows Bar on 57th floor had live music on Thursday night and had a beautiful view of the city 
315015,Melia Vienna, There are not much place around to have breakfast so you need to take the sub way , The hotel stuff was amazing very nice and helpful First time that our request in the notes got notified and we did get a room on the 15 floor The sub way is close and it s easy to get enywhere in Vienna this way 
315016,Melia Vienna, There was nothing we didn t like , Awesome room with view of Danube Quality materials Beautiful color scheme It was our anniversary and the staff provided a complimentary bottle of champagne and personal note on our upon our arrival While not in the Inner Stadt it was a 5 minute walk to the metro and a 10 ride to there We used the excellent metro to explore the city 
315017,Melia Vienna, A tiny thing just to improve They can be more exact when changing bedsheets we asked for chaning bedsheets they changed ours but not the bedsheet of my daughter s bed , Friendly staff excellent location spacious room clean 
315018,Melia Vienna, Location is kind of far The man who carry the baggage is not decent and not respectable person , The hotel has good interior and good breakfast Good reception 
315019,Melia Vienna, Oh the break fast not that fancy and the buffet presentation limited My room includes the lounge which presented in floor 57 However due to the name of the lounge which inclusive with the room called the level was different than what been explain the lounge in 57 floor both have the same access 57 elevator I been charged over 80 euro because I ve uses the lounge in 57 floor not the level lounge which is presented in 57 level Have no clue but my negotiations with the customer relationship end with nothing and the hotel f off my stay and enjoyment I would not recommend this hotel as they won t agreed that they are mix up the the names with their clients Still they believed that it s my mistake and now I am complaining and writing to the CEO In addition The access is difficult to the hote and very away from the centre car parking cost 30 euro for 24 hours, The hotel very luxurious and clean very secure I been celebrating my anniversary and enjoyed the floor 14th Which is one below last residential 15 floor Not all of staff are friendly The room has very beautiful panoramic view

315021,Melia Vienna, No free car park for a hotel located in the tallest skyscraper in Vienna You have to pay 30 Euro per day if you wish to keep the car in the basement I think the hotel should provide free parking to thier guests , Good hotel with a modern design 2 min walk to public transportation Free refil of minibar once everyday 
315022,Melia Vienna, The corridors need some maintenance i don t think they re the level of a 5 hotel , The bar and restaurant on 57 possibly the best steak i have ever had The rooms are very modern and nicely designed as well 
315023,Melia Vienna, I booked the hotel for view on Vienna and Danube but the floor for the deluxe camera is too low 4th floor , Modern rooms and modern building Wonderful bathroom

315026,Melia Vienna, The parking was expensive in the hotel parking the wifi was weak and interrupted time to time the system of elevator is bad and not practical while it was quick and available for example if family members are stayed in different floors they can not move between floors unless they go to the reception and ask them to give access to the floor , The hotel was very good in terms of modern rooms availability of the accessories good staff good services
315027,Melia Vienna,No Negative, Although rooms do not have a balcony and this is a skyscraper we could open the window and well protected to not fall out Great Also the included free mini bar was a great feature

315031,Melia Vienna, Reception staff rooms etc do not feel like a 5 star more like a mediocre 4 or ambitious 3 star , Bar on top of the building is worth a visit

315035,Melia Vienna, We arrived at the hotel from airport at 3 00PM and to our surprise the room was not ready and the girl at the reception told us that it will be ready in one hour and reacted that it s not a big issue then when I showed my resentment she offered us voucher for drinks in the first floor restaurant If you decide to drive to the hotel then good luck to find your way through the maze of tunnels leading to it , Nice and spacious room Superb location 5 minutes away from Danube where you can cross Ponte Cagrana bridge to Sunken City and enjoy dinner in one of the restaurants or have a drink in a bar while enjoying the view of the river Also Kaiserm hlen VIC Metro station is a walking distance from the hotel 
315036,Melia Vienna, Felt detached from the rest of the city due to the hotels location and had to wait quite a while for taxis , Well designed and modern room shower was great and the view across the river was awesome Loved all the staff they were all warm and friendly 
315037,Melia Vienna, A bit too posh for my taste with a Hollister shop feeling still the same even after 3 days But my wife likes Hollister , Breakfast was indeed excellent both the selection and quality The room minibar refilled daily for free

315040,Melia Vienna, Drinks at the bar were very pricey , Everything on offer is of high quality The Level executive lounge on the 57th floor is worth the extra money Handy for Kaisermuhlen VIC Ubahn station
315041,Melia Vienna, The hotel bathroom I think they are trying to make it look modern but the effect is you basically cant see because there is no natural light only dark weird light The shower is supposed to be a rain shower but its not maintained so its clogged and the water squirts everywhere I had to ask for slippers , nice hotel in perfect location for meetings at VIC
315042,Melia Vienna, Rooms weren t ready until long after check in time which initially was very stressful however the staff dealt with it perfectly and our stay was recovered , Beds were so comfortable view is incredible Really nice bathroom Breakfast was delicious 
315043,Melia Vienna,No Negative, Minibar was free and they did refill that every day There was coffee machine in our room Hotel was beautiful and very luxury and price was great for that 
315044,Melia Vienna, We found the bed too hard and the square continental pillows were floppy and gave no support a bad combination It was 30 degrees when we were there the aircon only went down to 21 degrees much too warm as was the duvet Not many places to eat in the local area although very close to the U bahn , Very stylish property particularly the excellent bathroom with rainfall shower Great views from the 15th floor Good lighting system TV and OK wi fi The Nespresso coffee machine and free mini bar were a real benefit Good food in the restaurant the fixed price lunch was good value Everywhere spotlessly clean and the staff were excellent 
315045,Melia Vienna, I booked a hotel with a nice view so I was very upset to get a room on the lowest floor with a view to the roof of the restaurant Very frustrating This hotel is famous about its view to the city That is why I booked my room here Anyway The staff is not very helpful and unexperienced They made several mistakes during which is annoying after a while , A well equiped nicely designed hotel 
315046,Melia Vienna, No sign with hotel name on it if you drive there even with Navigation system you don t see hotel s name until you arrive at main entrance need to add sign in near intersection also need more light around mirror in bathroom , Rooftop bar on 58th floor access to Metro 
315047,Melia Vienna, First hotel where my phone strangely could not connect to wifi The receptionist told me i am in the cheapest room 131eur night cannot have river view , Free minibar 
315048,Melia Vienna, They still need to workout the flow of things it doesn t come natural some time and unnecessary stiff, Was a test worked out perfectly just s great place awesome views good gym good restaurant very friendly stuff
315049,Melia Vienna, Good breakfast but really expensive , Very beautiful place close to U Bahn so access to Vienna city is very good Hotel room was clean Staffs are nice they also serves upgrade when the upper rooms are not available How can you say this hotel is bad 
315050,Melia Vienna, Staff at bar slow apathetic , Great and stylish room Great view Great bathroom Great mattress Quick check in check out Great location close to the underground station minutes to center Large parking 
315051,Melia Vienna, Housekeeping every day we had to ask for something filling minibar slippers not to disturb even with notice Do not disturb, Very fresh seem to be very new hotel
315052,Melia Vienna, 26 for breakfast is a bit steep 15 would be a better price still higher than in the neighboring VIC cafeteria It would also be great to have access to the swimming pool of the next door s Harris fitness center , One of the best hotels I stayed so far in Vienna It s beautiful modern design amazing views good gym spacious rooms great bathrooms with huge walk in shower they offer a bathrobe free minibar and Nespresso machine what else to wish for Great breakfast too if you come to a meeting at the VIC this is a best option 
315053,Melia Vienna, One of the blinds of the room was not functioning and the early light disturbed my sleep The TV was not working it kept switching off on its own I reported the next day but both the blind and the TV were not fixed I reported the following day and only the blind was repaired the TV was still not functioning on the 3rd day The bath rug was not replaced in the room for two nights nor were all the complimentary bath essentials restocked in the room , The room is very airy and bright and the bed was very comfortable 
315054,Melia Vienna, The prices are a little bit high and for this quality it should be included breakfast The breakfast was so expensive and we had it at the outside There are many places to go nearby the hotel for the breakfast Also there should be slippers in the room And using bathrobe had extra fee it was so weird , The cleaning staff the view of the room and design of the hotel silence everything is well calculated You feel like really comfortable there Especially the staff is really proffesional and warm blood I ve written somewhere else best staff but it was before This was the best staff ever 
315055,Melia Vienna, Indifference I forgot my passport in the room in the safe box After check out while I was having my dinner in the city center I realized this called the hotel immediately and explained the situation by describing the exact place of passport in the room I have been told that they will check and inform me as soon as possible In the next half an hour nobody called me During this period I called them two times more and they replied that they checked the room however they could not find my passport After this answer I left my dinner went to the hotel and checked the room by myself As I described clearly in my first call the passport was in the safe box So I was very surprised about indifference of management of such a 5 star hotel It was not wallet not cell phone or not something else It was my passport which is the most valuable thing abroad They spoiled my last day in Vienne Thanks Melia , The bathroom
315056,Melia Vienna, Pillows too soft choice of restaurants within walking distance of hotel very limited Breakfast was poor hot food was cold no clean tables and insufficient staff to keep up with crowd No pamphlets available re buses trains or tourist spots and activities , Nice room and great views Friendly staff but nobody knew how to direct us to attractions other than we can get a taxi for you 
315057,Melia Vienna, The only complaint is that the hotel is a green hotel and this apparently means that the air conditioning is incapable of being adjusted to below 21oC This was just too warm to be able to get to sleep at night , The extra comfort and services offered in the Levels rooms is well worth the extra cost fabulous views over the Danube and the City 
315058,Melia Vienna, we ve been at this hotel one night between 24 25 of May The hotel blocked 50 euro on my card as a deposit Its staff promised to unblock it next day It has passed more than a week but till now 50 euro didn t return back to my card The hotel doesn t answer my emails about this situation the hotel is not 5 stars Economy everywhere We booked a room for 2 people but all cosmetics was for one We asked for a crib but when we arrived it wasn t in our room , Nothing to like Not 5 stars at all
315059,Melia Vienna, The bar and restaurant staff were very rude The location was far away from main attractions The facilities at the hotel were poor Housekeeping didn t speak English so difficulty explaining your needs The minibar was topped up once we stayed for three nights No I wouldn t stay there again its a 5 star expensive but NOT worth it , The bed was comfortable the bathroom lovely
315060,Melia Vienna, Had to wait for room from 15 am to 15 30 am Phone did not work HORRIBLE FOOD in room service Poorly educated staff was served a Tonic and told the Gin was inside the bottle , The interior decoration of the room the view 
315061,Melia Vienna, Nothing, Location is near train station Take a train about 10 minutes to old town Room is modern clean free minibar and coffee in room view from my room is great can see Danube river and old town wifi is good signal

315064,Melia Vienna, It wasn t particularly child friendly We stayed at the hotel for the start of our honeymoon and we took our little baby with us The hotel restaurant and cafe didn t seem like the type of places you could take a teething baby and there weren t any child friendly restaurants nearby Next time we d stay in a different location Also the staff didn t mention anything about our honeymoon it would have meant so much to me if they d even just said congratulations Also we were put on the 5th floor probably because we had a baby with us so they didn t want him to disturb the important people on the higher levels but we were moved to the exact same room on the 10th floor because a door was broken so at least our view was a bit reasonable I would have liked a kettle to make tea and an iron as standard , Lovely building and interior design Friendly staff 
315065,Melia Vienna, It was the first time in my life life when I was told I should wait till 3 p m to check in I like hotels where you feel like a dear guest and the staff try to do everything you feel like at home Here is the atmosphere more like you are allowed to stay here The hotel is rather expensive and it is rated as 5 stars so they could care about their guests a bit better They don t have swimming pool The parking costs EUR 30 Quite expensive, The hotel is in the highest skyscraper in Austria but the rooms are only by 15th floor so if you want to see the sky from the window the only chance is to go to 57th floor to the lounge good cocktails for 12 15 EUR or to the restaurant but in restaurant you should book a table in advance as it is fancy and has DC Room design is nice veeery comfortable bed mini bar is for free without alcohol Staff on reception is ok but a bit snobby The guys at room service and in the lounge are nice and helpful The hotel is near to metro station and it is U1 the direct line to Stephansplatz Amusement park Praterstern is really close too 2 steps by metro So this is a fancy place comfortable with Donau window view and beautiful terrace with the whole city view 
315066,Melia Vienna,No Negative, The rooms are amazing Please remember if u require a room facing the danube river and main city side u need to book the higher category room The rooms are spacious and the bathroom is mind blowing the showet space is the largest i have seen ever travelling any country till date The hotel is classy and business type U will find less tourist type people Breakfast spread is good 
315067,Melia Vienna, Away from the center so you need a car but the there is no free car park in the hotel The only available car park cost 30 Euros day , The room was comfortable
315068,Melia Vienna,No Negative, Wonderful hotel and brilliant view from the 58th floor Had a room on the 11th floor very spacious and nicely decorated A special thanks goes to Maria the concierge I guess from the E floor I already checked out on Wednesday the 11th of May but my flight back home was in the evening All of a sudden I got a serious migraine and needed to rest She helped me out to arrange a room to rest for 1 5 hours No extra costs involved Therefore a big thank you to Maria and the management of Melia Vienna This is why people come back for business and private purposes to this specific hotel Really much appreciated Best regards Ralph Bos

315070,Melia Vienna, It is a bit far from the downtown You need to take a taxi or the tram to go to the downtown , Everything in the hotel is perfect except the location 
315071,Melia Vienna, There are very few restaurants or much of anything beyond the ACV and UN office buildings within walking distance , The hotel is very convenient to the ACV conference center and the view is excellent 
315072,Melia Vienna, Sounds from the quick lift at early mornings , New hotel with convenient location Convenient control of electricity Specially would like to mention very good bed and pillows Black curtain were very useful during the nights

315074,Melia Vienna, On check out I called the reception many times to get help with the lugagge no one responded I called the room service many times no one responded That was the only negative point , Everything was excellent The tallest skysescaper in Austria The first green building 
315075,Melia Vienna, I wish that there was a better discount to use the John Harris fitness Also the lighting in the room and bathroom although very stylish made it difficult to do makeup hair , The customer services was exceptional and I would absolutely stay at Melia again I can also strongly recommend the rooftop restaurant bar 
315076,Melia Vienna, Chocolate is good but I prefer fruits for the complimentary snack in the room , Interior design and architecture Nice equipment in the room Floor to ceiling windows Free mini bar refill

315079,Melia Vienna, My room 1301 was on the 13th floor below the gym People running on the tapis roulant was making a tumble dryer like noise already at 6 a m It s not what you expect from a 5 star hotel , The beatiful view It is near the Vienna International Center if you work in the area it s very practical
315080,Melia Vienna, When the wind is strong outside you can really hear it as it whistles around the hotel , Lovely hotel easy to get into the centre with the U1 metro very close A quiet comfortable hotel Very relaxing The complimentary mini bar was a great touch nespresso coffee beers juice water and Coca Cola every day nice touch Staff were very helpful from the moment we arrived 
315081,Melia Vienna, Nothing really again except it was too dark for our taste everything basically black and white is generally boring , Nothing not to like really except it was a little far out from the main city but good views of the place we could up to the 58th Floor albeit by a separate lift The breakfast was very good with a huge choice all included in the price
315082,Melia Vienna, bit too far out of town and not much around there a bit style over substance and room service quite expensive advertised as spectacular views over river etc but our room faced the other buildings in the area and had to crane your neck to actually see the water , the room was nice enough didn t explore the hotel too much staff friendly 
315083,Melia Vienna, Advertising on booking shall be more accurate According to the way described breakfast can be taken at 57 floor restaurant That is not accurate yes it is possible but an additional fee needs to be payed at the reception For the regular reservation done on booking the breakfast is at the flow restaurant that is on level 0 We got a room at level 11 the hotel is a part of the DC tower do not expect that you get a room too high if you do not choose the presidential suite , Great view from the room very clean and comfortable interesting concept for the shower good internet coverage garage under the hotel The view at 57 level restaurant is astonishing Breakfast was rich with good food quality Location close to underground train easy to get to city center Donau Park very close Will go there again

315088,Melia Vienna, Bedding duvet cover had a dried up blood stain underneath and obviously wasn t changed for the new occupant Called the attention of housekeeping Window blinds need to be fixed They were stuck somehow and wouldn t come down Didn t mind much because I preferred the lights from outside at night Would be nice to have an ice machine somewhere in the different floor levels , Modern relatively new impressive building and facade loved the warm bathroom wall and floor close to the train station and the supermarket Billa staff was friendly 
315089,Melia Vienna, Nothing top class hotel , Excellent location friendly staff who are really helpful nothing was to much trouble for them Rooms were fantastic with brilliant views all around If I go back to Vienna will be staying there again without a doubt 10 10

315094,Melia Vienna, No option to charge my phone in my case i forgot my charger home and obviously i had no phone, We spent 3 nights and all we can say it was amazing We had a room with panoramic view and bathtub inside the room next to the window
315095,Melia Vienna, Staff treated us like we were some weird people coming from the street I do not expect the staff to know who a certain customer is but it should always think about that the customer might be someone with influence on their business 57 Restaurant receptionist was pretentious and rude Breakfast in the room was completely messed up on valentines day Wrong products and missing products aswell Overall I have to say I am not going to stay at this hotel ever again I can only recommend to stay at the classic 5 star houses in the city Sacher Palais Imperial At least you get treated like a king there for the price you are paying , Rooms are very spacious and nice 
315096,Melia Vienna, Food downstairs wasn t too good bit of a soggy wrap Quite a strange shower set up where you could look into the shower from the room , Really comfy and huge bed Room was lovely and staff at downstairs bar were really helpful 
315097,Melia Vienna, Staff is awful They dont even answer the reception phone I asked many times for coffee capsules they didnt bring They are not helpful in reception For such a good building management should be much better change is needed, Nice new building with good rooms

315103,Melia Vienna, Hotel is not perfect for tourists as it is far away from city center, The hotel fulfilled my special request which was very nice and also checking in went fast super comfy beds and beautiful room and bathroom
315104,Melia Vienna, Booked for two adults and a child but only showed as two adults on the booking system staff treated me like I was trying to get more than I paid for Their attitude meant I did not get full benefit of having a level room and really spoilt what was meant to be a family treat , Impressive building lovely room with great view comfortable bed
315105,Melia Vienna, Ordered omelette for breakfast but never arrived Have to pay a huge 19 to use pool Room cleaners would not stop knocking on doors and did not allow time for you to open the door before they burst in Disturbed by someone when the do not disturb sign was on door Rooms very stuffy air con not powerful enough, Rooms nice good views and facilities Breakfast good buffet Good location near underground rooftop bar Concierge was amazing with lots of tips and booked bus tickets through reception
315106,Melia Vienna, The one thing we didn t like was the general vibe of the bar at the top of the tower We felt very out of place and one of the waiters was incredibly rude to us because we accidentally sat down at an occupied table no one was sitting there and the glasses were empty That immediately ruined the great mood I was in and we decided to leave without having a drink The flow bar on the ground floor was much more welcoming and the lady who served us was fantastic , Our room was absolutely stunning in fact the whole hotel was amazing Very modern clean cool and comfortable The reception and flow bar staff were very friendly and helpful 
315107,Melia Vienna, The staff sometimes is completely incompetent some stupid rules e g you have to give your coat to the cloakroom on the ground floor when you want to go to the 57th floor and outside to smoke which is freezing cold now in January The minibar is for free but just water cola and beer The hallways look sometimes not really clean The matress are not really high standard Its really a pity that this hotel has no SPA small selection of TV channels, The rooms are amazing windows from the ceiling to the floor view is great minibar is for free bathrooms are big everything brand new the Bar on the 57th floor gives you an amazing overview of Vienna

315120,Melia Vienna, Staff is not friendly or helpful at all I tried to reserve a table at the restaurant through e mail and was forwarded 5 five times Calling directly also did not help When moving out I forgot a charger in the room and they told me they did not find it or may be just threw it away , Not a single thing

315135,Melia Vienna,No Negative, The room was great Excellent value considering we got a double deluxe in a deal It was hugely spacious luxury sexy interior and a huge amazingly comfortable bed with floor to ceiling windows that meant you could look out over the city The mini bar was also complementary and all the staff were very helpful not that we needed much help I was a bit wary of how far away from the centre of Vienna it would be but it was absolutely not an issue the trains are so simple to co ordinate and you are a 2 minute walk from the nearest station just a few minutes from town We did visit the bar 57 at the end of our Saturday night which had great cocktails and was quite busy with music and a bar club feel I would undoubtedly recommend this hotel it delivers what it says and is a little bit of luxury for excellent value in a beautiful city 
315136,Melia Vienna, 1 For 200 per night they must offer you free parking You have to pay minimum 30 per day parking and every time you go in and out you have to pay 3 per hour Thats too much and its big minus for this hotel 2 we were a couple and in the bathroom we had only one package of shower gel shampoo and soap And only one toothbrush Like its a room for one person 3 One morning some two guys staff were knocking on our doors as they are looking for burglers or something They scared us and woke up And they have entered our room Very scary morning They just said sory and went out I claim that to the receptionist he only sad he will talk to his staff Ok Also for this price missing wellnes , Beautiful rooms spacious and clean a lot of light Good breakfast late breakfast Bar in the room Coffee machine 
315137,Melia Vienna, The noise barrier btw rooms is not so good You can hear the room next door watching tv , the view of the Danube is aweeesome The bathroom is super fancy Boden heizung floor warming and you get a reasonable filled minibar and nespresso capsels for you to use all 
315138,Melia Vienna, It is located in a business area Parking was not included and rather expensive During a very windy night we could not sleep because of the noise , Design comfort great bathroom shower and last but not least the amazing view Sky bar at the 57th floor 
315139,Melia Vienna, Location is typical in a business area city center only reacheable via metro or taxi , Well designed and comfortable hotel Rooms are spacious and good 
315140,Melia Vienna, no bath no jacuzzi breakfast is too expensive although it is perfect The hotel rooms are localized in the bottom part of the tower don t expect to have a view on Vienna from the last floor , great style comfort bed etc location is perfect close to UNO People are quite OK depending on persons some guys extremely nice some other just do the job skyline at sunrise was great 
315141,Melia Vienna, No adapters for electricity plugs No heating system in rooms breakfast food has no variety and the music at breakfast time is very load and not appropriate , Location in front of metro but business area staff helpful View 
315142,Melia Vienna, I dont like counter of receptionis look not nice they have not atravtive fir a guess, The interior of the room and size is nice and big also nice viewing through the window 
315143,Melia Vienna, bathroom lights too dark breakfast with 26 euro too expensive 20 euro would be maximum , rooms hotel location bar all really great Breakfeast great cocktails in the bar are really special
315144,Melia Vienna, The breakfast had too many minor bugs But the cheif waiter got me all than glass can butter capuccino containing milk, For an event in Donau City this hotel is in a perfect location and the subway is next door for other places in Viena
315145,Melia Vienna, The hotel forms part of an office block in a commercial district so the area is very quiet and lacks atmosphere In the flow bar we asked for an offer that was detailed on their board only to be told it s on Tuesday s only Why is it written there Late check out The booklet says to just ask not subject to anything We ask and are told no point blank we were not quite ready maybe an extra 30 mins required then a member of staff knocks as I m in a towel sees we are not ready and he asks if we would like a later checkout I say 30 mins he says no worries Totally AVOIDABLE situation The few cleaners cannot clean all rooms simultaneously at midday Check in is not until 3 half an hour grace in a 5 hotel is not unreasonable gym and pool are part of the office block and are 19e per person per day session No info on room service or menu Sky garden is part of office building you have to pay to go up there Please make an arrangement with the office owners to grant some concession on the amenities that guests would obviously like to use , The hotel is beautiful overlooking the river the rooms excellently appointed elegant design robes large towels coffee machine complimentary mini bar Great cocktails 3 stops 7mins to Prater big wheel fun fair about 6 stops to central Vienna St Stephens Sq 15 mins on regular train Line1
315146,Melia Vienna, 30 a Night not 24h Parking Fee With multiple entry exits at car park during 2 days of stay 78 parking bill Modern but rather cheap interior, Nice Views Donauinsel around the Corner
315147,Melia Vienna, The location is very financial but the U bahn station is very close few minutes walking distance and then from there you can easily go to the city center , The room was very comfortable it was cold during our trip and it was nice to have the bathroom floor heated The beds are of comfortable size and are very comfortable the pillows are nice as well The minibar is refilled daily with compliments and there is also a coffee machine which is really a plus for those who cant start the day with a nice cup of coffee 
315148,Melia Vienna, There are not many shops or places to eat around the hotel however the city center can be easily reached in 10 mins by underground Breakfast was very expensive , Great design in room and throughout the hotel Nice views of the city through wall to wall windows although the hotel rooms are allocated up to the 16th floor Extremely clean room and toilette Complimentary mini bar and nespresso machine Friendly staff Free wifi with excellent coverage and speed A visit to the roof restaurant is a must

315150,Melia Vienna, Location is not ideal for sight seeing , Room view bathroom quality of the materials The staff made a mistake and gave us the key for a room which was already occupied In order to correct their mistake they just upgraded our room for the same Price of course That was a very nice surprise for us and we enjoyed the upgraded room very much 
315151,Melia Vienna, Unless you have business to conduct in the area the location is not ideal for tourists If you are in Vienna to see the center better to stay in the center and not worry , Great room wonderful views of Vienna 
315152,Melia Vienna, Nothing , Room decoration is very nice The location is little bit far from city center but Metro station Kaisermuhlen VIC station is nearby and only six menutes to reach the center by metro Also there is a very nice park Danube Park and it is only one stop by U1 metro Alte Donau station Also there is a big mall and restaurant you could reach by U1 metro Kagran station Only two stops from Hotel station 
315153,Melia Vienna, It really is in the middle of nowhere It suited me as I was going to a local conference but for tourists it s too far out of town, Brand new hotel Opened a few months ago Great staff great room
315154,Melia Vienna, No parking slot Staff are good however sometimes they dont smile Long waiting due to shortage in staff Conceirage is bad to an extent not behaved in a professional way Location is good however could be excellent if it was in the down town ,No Positive
315155,Melia Vienna, Break fast was not included in our tariff plan and it is breakfast charges of Euro 26 per head per day is steep and not worth Private parking is Euro 30 is high , A very good hotel in the Central business district and just 5 minutes walk to the River Danube View from the Hotel is excellent
315156,Melia Vienna, location is far from city center but it is not a big deal Since next to the hotel a metro station and in fee minutes you are in the middle of the City center, Excellent hotel with nice view and facilities The hotel is modern and the full wall glass gives the view more interesting
315157,Melia Vienna, It s not a matter of the hotel but what happened was I asked the help from the receptionist to tell me how to reach to the meeting point of a tour but she explained very long way and by the end I missed the tour at that day and I lost its fees also , Every thing was very nice more than my expectations
315158,Melia Vienna, Wi fi was very poor and the cleanliness of the room should be improved , We had a great stay at this hotel The hotel is very modern quiet and the view of Danube is excellent The staff was very helpful and friendly 
315159,Melia Vienna, Restaurants were too expensive for breakfast for a family of 5 Wifi a bit hit miss in our room Paying a considerable amount just for swim in the pool when you are a guest at the hotel was not great either nor was the fact that children are not allowed in the pool at all , Staff were brilliant Room was superb 
315160,Melia Vienna, We had some trouble finding our way to the entrance of the hotel we were driving a car and could not see any signs pointing to the hotel just to DC Tower , We stayed at this hotel for the first night of our honeymoon and the staff presented us a bottle of good champagne as a gift

315163,Melia Vienna, We were given a room with no view whatsoever Staff was always busy and not answering our calls More of a 4 star hotel than a 5 star , Room was ok but not great Not bad of a location since the train station is just 2 5 mins walk 
315164,Melia Vienna, The reception staff attitude was really bad check in was really bad They were unfriendly and with attitude , Location Room design Clean and new
315165,Melia Vienna, 57 th floor Roof bar is very nice view and very nice decorated But Roof bar 57 sky bar organization very poor Nothing there only drinks No music Suggest one ore twin play piano and music other times Mp3 possible and sitting diesign must change And put some dark light red lights inside , Rooms are very relax and clean like perfect
315166,Melia Vienna, When you book the hotel you think you will get a nice view In reality the hotel only has rooms up to 15th floor and so you are likely to get a low floor Many rooms are located away from the Donau river Our room was facing a construction site Moreover the restaurant on the top was closed without any mention anywhere The bar on top did not allow children but we were allowed after complaining , This hotel is very new and fancy The room has a nice layout and bathroom although I do not understand why they used poor man s Dornbracht a k a Grohe instead of the real thing
