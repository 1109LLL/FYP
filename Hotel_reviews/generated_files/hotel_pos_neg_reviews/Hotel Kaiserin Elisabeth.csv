502033,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Nothing, Very friendly staff Fantastic inner city location Longer than usual breakfast hours til 11am which allowed us much more flexibility in our schedule 
502034,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Breakfast selections were a bit limited but what they had was good , Location is excellent just a few steps to Saint Stephens Platz and the mall Front desk staff are excellent Rooms are comfortable Beds have light weight down comforters no top sheets which I like 
502035,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Like other hotels in Europe they don t have the bathroom amenities that we prefer Instead of bar soap shampoo and conditioner you get one all purpose liquid mounted on the wall Luckily we brought our own soap etc That liquid stuff is just too generic , Classy old world charm Superb location Our room was very spacious with high ceilings and immaculate linens Big bathroom with double sinks seperate shower and great water pressure Very nice breakfast service Helpful gentlemen who staff the front desk Room was very quiet Excellent maid service We also used their car service to and from the airport which worked very well and took a lot of stress out of the whole process

502037,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Really no complaints could have been more fresh fruit at breakfast , Room was very large especially considering it is in the heart of Vienna The room and bathroom were very clean Air conditioning was excellent The hotel common areas have a nice elegance to it 
502038,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, No bathroom slippers But I brought mine so it wasn t a big deal , The staff was very nice It turned out that I paid extra when I checked out They were so honest they called me when I was on my way to the airport and apologized and returned my money Oh and they arranged all the limousine service for me from and to the airport The location is absolutely perfect for solo travelers I went there alone and having to tour the city proper alone was so convenient And the breakfast was awesome I m stuffed 
502039,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Coffee and tea making facilities should be mandatory in a four star hotel Breakfast were rich but eggs were not properly boiled Should also like to be offered fried eggs or omelet, This hotel has the very best location walking distance to almost everything For those who love shopping location could not be better Our room was big very clean and had a large comfortable bed Very helpful staff and giving us good advise to all questions We also got a late check out for free 
502040,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Pillows were very soft Some building work noise could be heard Double bed was made up of two singles, Location was excellent near underground and all facilities Decor was very attractive Staff were very knowledgable friendly and professional Large room
502041,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, nothing but there is construction across the street double windows kept the room quiet, Very friendly and helpful staff Great central location We had the larger room and were very comfortable Modern hotel but with a traditional Vienna feel 
502042,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, There was construction next door which resulted in very early drilling 6am and loud banging This was no fault of the hotel but was very disruptive in the morning and prevented a sleep in Otherwise no complaints, The staff were lovely and helpful the rooms were spacious and breakfast was very good The location was also fantastic
502043,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, breakfast options were a little disappointing if you are not into the European continental breakfast no toast and eggs and bacon were not up to speed, Big room quiet location away from the main street we were placed at the back of the hotel Comfy beds and doonas helpful staff located close to everything
502044,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, I don t have anything negative to say about my stay at the hotel The only negative thing was there was construction noise next to the hotel that woke me up in the morning That wasn t the fault of the hotel though , The hotel was very elegant beautiful The location was great with so many places in the area to see and do Great restaurants within walking distance I would recommend this hotel to anyone 
502045,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, I had a single bedroom didn t understand why the WC wasnt placed in the bathroom I would recommend replacing the bidet with the WC The bathroom was very spacious yet the toilet had no room to sit on the WC and close the door and I m only tiny , Loved everything The staff were very friendly and helpful Taxi arrive in 3 minutes when called I had a single bedroom which was very spacious TV had almost all language channels even Arabic Hairdryer was powerful They had almost all the relevant tour brochures at the lobby The hotel was on the main shopping street plenty of restaurants Breakfast was standard continental many varieties of bread cheese confitures cereal etc you can also order eggs of your choice at no cost Restaurant staff were lovely and cheerful and quick Bed and pillows were comfortable Room was very quiet although it was facing the street had double windows literally Room was delightful with lots of paintings of Vienna It was a hotel you love to step in at the end of a long day 
502046,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, The breakfast was disappointing for us almost entirely continental with very little remotely resembling English There is no restaurant no bar mini bar in room and no tea and coffee facilitie The hotel could be considered a little dated , The location is very good almost next to the cathedral The staff are also very friendly and have a comprehensive knowledge of restaurants and concerts etc 
502047,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth,No Negative, Loved everything about this place the pretty rooms the tub shower and bathroom soap and lotion the breakfast buffet and coffee the incredibly friendly staff and the perfect location Everything you could want in a hotel in the center of Vienna 
502048,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, there is construction working going on right now march 2017 outside the hotel which start 7am in the morning nothing the hotel can do but if you wanna sleep longer windows gotta be shut , lovel rooms great and friendly service exceptional location
502049,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, It was the second time I went to this hotel No comparison with the first one very small room rather basic fitting of the room window on a claustrophobic inner court If ever back to this hotel I ll be sure I get a proper room that is spacious and with a view , The excellent position central and next to public transport The overall atmosphere of the hotel lobby and common spaces 
502050,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, N A, I had a few requests prior to stay one being gluten free breakfast I was very impressed with the service and how my requests were met Perfect location Clean and good decor very good long weekend getaway
502051,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth,No Negative, At the reception desk I got help directions suggestions for music shows Excellent staff The hotel is well located in walking distance to all the tourist places of interest I got a good size room and a huge bath tub Very nice people clean central quiet good air conditioning A pleasure 
502052,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Room was not as described by Booking com as it was definitely not very spacious 416 No individual shampoo and conditioner just liquid soap Hate hair dryers with no proper on off switch , Helpful staff Bath welcome Eggs to order at breakfast Great central location 
502053,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth,No Negative, Very comfortable hotel ideally situated near most tourist attractions and metro and tram lines Breakfast was very good with good service Front desk friendly efficient and helpful Rooms are large comfortable and clean Serviced well We had a great stay at this top notch hotel 
502054,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Wifi connection wasn t wonderful in my room and little phone reception in the breakfast room but that may be due to my phone , Nice friendly and professional service receptionists were quite formal and old school elegantly dressed but without being stuffy and my room was great 117 Good choice and quality at breakfast and fabulous location in the heart of everything in the city I will definitely return there The lounge area is also elegantly appointed and convenient for business meetings and work sessions 
502055,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, One of the reception clerks was downright unpleasant and unhelpful The Italian and the Chinese gentlemen at the reception on the other hand were nice and polite The breakfast is much worse than is customary in this class of hotel in Vienna They are cutting corners eg no decent breakfast cereals only the cheapest and least healthy ones The breakfast is managed by a woman who thinks she looks like Sissi It is a pity she swears so loudly and that her manners are so inappropriate I would NOT return to this hotel, The room was very nice and comfortable The hotel is kept nice and clean 
502056,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, The room needs a bit of upgrade , The elegant ambience of the hotel lobby and breakfast area very central helpful reception personnel was quite noisy early morning due to some work being done opposite the street but we enjoyed our stay 
502057,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, The slippers were provided at an extra cost of 2 5 through something called comfort package i don t know what else was in it but i think slippers are quite standard for a hotel of this caliber, The hotel s location is excellent Even in the cold winter weather I was able to walk almost everywhere Staff was polite and helpful The room was of good size comfortable and clean The TV had international channels 
502058,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, It is just a pity there is no restaurant or coffee bar as after 10 pm it is not easy to find somewhere just to have a snack, We like the position of the hotel right in the very centre 
502059,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, The staff was unhelpful and kind of unfriendly They didn t help with our luggage and could not or would not offer suggestions about places to visit or where to eat They actually acted put out if we asked them anything I wouldn t stay here again , The location near St Stephens square was perfect 
502060,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Although understandable for the season it was impossible to get requested early check in The room was ready only at 1 15 and when I complained the receptionist answered that he can find me another hotel which sounded more like a threat rather than help I really did not like his attitude on the day of my arrival Although I requested bedding without feather because of allergies my pillows were of course with feather The pillow without feathers I got was extremely hard and uncomfortable but I learned my lesson not to complain , Great location quiet warm room great bath Very elegant hotel secure clean good breakfast nice service during breakfast Easy access to computer room business centre and wi fi available Very kind luggage help I forgot my winter hat and he saw that and called the limousine driver who drove me back to the hotel so I could recover it Great limousine service to the airport for the price of a cab drive black Mercedes with very polite driver 
502061,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, The staff at the reception in the evening handed me a wrong key without asking even for my name That gave me minimum assurance for the security , In the very centre of Vienna Most of the tourist attractions are in a walking distance Staff were friendly 
502062,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, parking space and a bit pricy, location was just perfect but hard to park if you have a car Staff were friendly Hotel gives a feeling youre in middle of history Bed is comfy
502063,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, All good , Beautiful grand old hotel in city center Huge room and bathroom with tub and separate shower All in good condition Very friendly staff A great place to come home to after exploring old Vienna Included breakfast buffet 
502064,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Maybe that s the traditional aspect they are going for but the general atmosphere and all technical appliances seem a little outdated , Polite staff very comfortable great value for money 
502065,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, everything was good for the property of this category, excellent location close to everything nice helpful staff bathrobes and slippers available at a reasonable cost very good value for money 
502066,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, However breakfast should be significantly improved One would wish to have a nice cup of strong nice smelling coffee in the middle of Vienna instead of a smelly brown water But other services were really excellent , Room and location simply excellent couldn t wish better if you want to stay amidst the buzz of the city center 
502067,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Street noise while muffled still gets goi g early in the morning , Staff were superbly helpful Breakfast was great and location can t be beat Lovely fireplace room for relaxing 
502068,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, It is in the very center and very popular so prices not the cheapest BUT they said past customers can get the best rates via their web site tea and coffee making facilities would just be the icing but breakfast is generous and there are plenty of cafes to visit At night can be a bit warm in winter as the thermostat can only go down to 17 degrees You wouldn t want to turn it off and opening the window lets in the outside noise, Outstandingly superb location for this conservatively elegant hotel with clean rooms plus good and generous breakfast choices made this a real delight for our stay Helpful and respectful staff built on that reputation An excellent recommend for seeing Vienna right at your door step if you are a wandering couple out to explore the world
502069,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, We were surprised that there was no opportunity for tea or coffee after 10 00 pm And the room had no in room tea coffee making set Apparently you had to rent a superior room for that Incredible , The room was large bright and comfortable And of course the location could not be better 
502070,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Nothing Really , Had what is so often lacking in hotels individual character The staff were all very friendly location was exceptional walking around the area on a chilly December night was unforgettable A real gem of a place 
502071,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, The room needed airing as had a musty smell which subjected us to a fair bit of street noise given the central location Parking expensive I guess normal for the location Had more comfortable beds couples ensure you re given a double queen not twin The toilet great if you want to perform an indepth examiniation of your waste matter not so great if you don t care this might be an Austrian thing so if this is the case I m sorry hotel and Austria really , Large room helpful and friendly staff beautiful hotel location great access to shopping metro cathedral
502072,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth,No Negative, The staff was very helpful kind professional and went out of their way to assist when a situation arose back home Will re book without hesitation Saw 4 other hotels on a city tour I had considered glad I booked the right one 
502073,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Breakfast could have been more healthy Also I think that croissants are baked on a pan greased with pig fat so have a terrible taste I d definitely recommend sourcing from a proper French bakery or looking into how they are made as it would fit the style of the place to have top French pastry , Staff on the reception was amazing very kind and helpful but not sleazy in a situation where I had a number of things I needed help with Very impressed 
502074,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, My husband and I loved every aspect of our stay in the Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth NO complains , Very clean comfortable palatial great location Felt like royalty absolute lavish breakfast room and exquisite food choice Staff friendly and extremely helpful Highly recommend it to anyone looking for accommodation in Vienna

502080,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth,No Negative, Everything location just a couple of minutes from the State Opera House and Kaisersbrundl sauna riveting hall with bygone glamour nice well appointed room with huge bathroom more than excellent memorable breakfast all male staff old viennese school with charm and nice uniform 
502081,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, from 4 star hotel I have expected much better breakfast the selection of food was quite basic, location was perfect rooms clean and warm very appreciate that after check out they kept our luggages in safe place until we pick them up
502082,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Not much Perhaps only the coffee cans at breakfast could be a little bigger But they just keep them coming Also there was a strange double door to get into the room probably for sound reduction , Bed was absolutely perfect I want one like that at home Still have to call them to ask for the brand Great location huge rooms very clean Kind front desk staff 
502083,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth,No Negative, We had stayed my wife and I at Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth over thirty years ago We liked it very much then The hotel exudes old world charm some find it old fashioned It is centrally located in the Inner City a stone throw away from K rntner Strasse and Stephansdom This stay as with the first we had a comfy room in the back which made it very quiet The furniture is a collection of old fashioned bulky items The bathroom is not modern the sink miniscule It is a high climb to get into the bath tub something to do carefully and slowly if you don t want to hurt your back Overall the ambience remained the same as if stuck in the past old fashioned and rather stuffy Some of the staff is as old fashioned as the furniture A couple of the staff even became rather condescending when we decided not to have breakfast at the hotel One of the staff was nosy and initiated a chat about personal things At booking time the staff will nicely offer to buy you concert tickets it took several emails to make them admit they charge a fee Vienna is not cheap and this fact is well reflected in the high price at Kaiserin Elisabeth 
502084,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth,No Negative, Good location near everything Hotel was beautifully decorated in the lounges and public areas My room was lovely although small and an unusual skinny shape Huge bathroom sparkling clean 
502085,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth,No Negative, The stuff is extremely kind and helpful They organize everything you ask them to transfer tours diners Hotel has great location close to the main city square but away from the city noice Very clean hotel The food is wonderful they even have vegetarian menu They made our stay magical 
502086,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, None, Stayed in a one bed room room was big and bathroom was even bigger very clean and comfortable staff was excellent they can easily set a benchmark location was outstanding in terms of anything you could ask food shopping transportation
502087,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Very loudy noise from street at 7 00 o clock in the mornings and hotel doesn t care about it at all There is no tea coffee facilities Price is so expensive even there are no slippers We had to buy form Vienna , Location
502088,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Nothing, Excellent location very close to many tourist attractions but off the main street so nice and quiet at night Lovely large room and spacious bathroom Excellent breakfast with lots of variety and helpful staff 
502089,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Aircondition was somewhat noisy but effective nonetheless No view to the sky from our room , The hotel is well situated in a quiet side street just a short stroll from the main shopping street and Stephansdom Rooms were spacious with tasteful decor and very clean Staff courteous helpful and professional with fine English skills Am a semi professional photographer 
502090,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, There was no information about the charge for the extra bed neither in the booking Web site nor in the confirmation letter I saw no extra price untill the Hotel charged 100 Euro when checking out It is not very hard to write a small note for the extra bed prices in the Web site of Booking Please do it , The location is perfect You can visit the Cathedral the Opera house Municipality and other famous buildings by walking Shopping is nice in the city center 
502091,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, No bar soap to wash with not enough safety grab bars for the shower loud air conditioner not working makes loud ticking noise at night freezes up, Great location
502092,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, The spare bed was too short for an adult and we were unfortunate to have building works right outside our window the hotel should have given us the option of changing rooms when they must have known it was going to impact on our sleep as well as dust from the giant skips going up into the air we had to keep the windows closed all day There were one or two reception staff that were helpful and others that seemed totally disinterested in us as tourists or whether we were happy with our room or their service , Excellent Location very elegant hotel with lovely decor furnishings
502093,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, The shower was a little was awkward We thought we would get water on the floor Enough soap but no other toiletries only one shower cap etc , We liked the lobby staff at reception desk maid service high ceiling double front doors to our room old fashion setting comfortable bed spacious bathroom nice size room excellent location
502094,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Can t think of any concerns , Very central just off main mall probably 100 m to Stephendom 50 m to underground Staff happy to store my luggage and help out with local information Not a big place nice a quiet staff got to know your room no quickly 
502095,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, It is a bit pricy but overall very good, All was good staff very helpful room comfortable breakfast plentiful and tasty location absolutely perfect

502097,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth,No Negative, Very good location in the inner coty close to the stefen church The staffs here r very helpful and nice Comfortable bed and clean and tidy room I enjoyed my stay here 
502098,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, The toiletries in our room were very basic and the towels were too thin for my taste Otherwise we had a great stay here , Although the location is just off a very busy street we were not bothered by noise at all very central location Loved the old world feeling of the hotel Staff were excellent and took care of my problem when I had to have a new credit card posted to this address Thank you very much 
502099,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, the intial room had a smoky glass window and it wasn t until we opened it that we saw the wall right next to it for a view How ever they changed it for us when we requested it but it was stressful that we had to do it at first place , All the above
502100,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Breakfast left something to be desired for an American , Small charming hotel with historical significance in its name Kaiseren Elisabeth She is tied to Austria in a most interesting way and worth a Google search and a trip to Sisi s Museum Fabulous 
502101,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth,No Negative, I found the hotel to be very well situated The breakfast was very good the staff were most friendly and helpful If I go back to Vienna and I p robably will I will stay at that hotel

502103,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, No tea and coffee making facility in our room Room service not available as specified states available until 10 00pm we asked for drinks at 9 30 but were told room service was no longer available as it was too late , Staff were so friendly and helpful Lovely comfortable beds and pillows Choice and quality of food at breakfast was excellent
502104,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, No restaurant or bar , Great location could not be better Clean spacious rooms friendly staff Parking is available valet only and cash only but the price is reasonable Nice breakfast 
502105,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Perhaps a little more hot food at breakfast Toast machine would also be useful , Fantastic location could not be better Helpful staff particularly pre visit Quiet rooms and lovely old building with character Only there for one day but would definitely use again 
502106,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, I can t really think of any negatives , I liked everything The hotel staff was amazing The breakfast was delicious very European Our room was very nice 
502107,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, I had asked for a quiet room so I had a room giving onto a very narrow courtyard and thus hardly any day light , impeccably clean beautiful parquet floor and rugs big wet room excellent service from all staff concierge breakfast attendants room service good value breakfast 
502108,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Dissatisfied when find out the room was without a daylight window but since I was strolling the whole day around it turned out to be but a minor inconvenience , The location is second to none 
502109,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, We had met both very friendly young staff and very rude mature receptionists reception manager The manager insisted to charge us for another room that was canceled 1 month ago and we had shown them the cancellation number prior to checking in whilst he just claimed that we had rebooked it again after our cancellation We had wasted an hour for checking in The next day we both felt that manager purposely turned his back on us We were so tired after long flight and some of the staff attitude really spoiled our mood for holiday , location size and comfortability of room 
502110,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Not much breakfast was a little expensive and the hotel did book a concert for us which wasn t on the night booked , Hotel is in a fantastic location the rooms are wonderful and the staff are very helpful and friendly 
502111,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, The pillow is too soft for me , Excellent location Very near to St Stephen Church and main pedestrian street Karntner Str And with few mins walk you can go to Hofburg So very convenient People at the front desk are very nice and helpful Nice and comfortable room 
502112,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Bed felt as though the mattress had a plastic protection cover which was rather uncomfortable in the hot weather , Pleasant staff Good selection for breakfast Quiet peaceful atmosphere Central location 
502113,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Nothing for a hotel in this very reasonable price range , Excellent location and value for money Clean nicely decorated very well run Very friendly helpful staff This is not a luxury hotel rather a terrific mid market one for travelers who live by my motto Champaign living on a beer budget I would definitely make this my go to hotel in Vienna 
502114,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Nothing , My room was very spacious clean and comfortable The staff were gracious and helpful While very centrally located the hotel was on a quiet lovely side street I would happily return here for any subsequent visit to Vienna 
502115,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, We had to go away for a day and although no refund was available it wouldn t of hurt them to try and let the room for one night to try and soften the blow Our room wasn t ready at booking time we were hot and no refreshments were offered in the end we had coffee and were then charged for it when checking out ,No Positive
502116,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Need better concierge service Seems like we were disturbing other work when we needed help with dinner tour advice The staff was resistant to make dinner reservations for us When we arrived at the recommended restaurant we needed reservations Also desk folks had minimal knowledge of tours guides They were no help Our room did not come with coffee tea ammenities our pkg didn t include it we were told really dont low end hotels include that , Great location 
502117,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth,No Negative, The hotel is in the very centre of the Inner town and in the same time in the quiet street We loved it s classic interiors elegant and in perfect condition We had found everything one needs in the room air conditioner tea fridge bath robes etc Greatest thanks to the hotel administrators who greeted us very warm and helped with all questions we had Warmest thanks to the cleaning ladies for the ideal cleaning and snow white linen while we never seen or heard them Big big thanks to the restaurant staff for the very pleasant breakfasts Thank you very much for our perfect vacation 
502118,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, It was on the expensve side , We liked the hotel s ambience excellent service and location as well as it s well appointed rooms Compared to the booking com 5 star rated Ruz hotel in Cesky Krumlov we stayed the night before this 4 star hotel was brilliant 
502119,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, The internet was slow at times and or the wifi signal was weak in my room They still have the old fashion keys whereas you have to surrender the key every time you go out and have to ask for it every time you come back to the hotel which is rather inconvenient not to mention the transfer of germs from hand to hand , Very nice and charming hotel with somewhat of classic looks and decor but updated facilities The staff are very helpful and nice The breakfast buffet is good The location is excellent It just couldn t be better location than this for a tourist visitor 
502120,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth,No Negative, Very well located property within meters of the centre of Vienna you cannot get closer Nice bedrooms with seating area The staff were very friendly It is a little pricy but it was well worth it at the end of the day 
502121,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, I wasn t really pleased with the room as it didn t have any natural daylight and the air was very stuffy when I arrived It seemed very noisy from around 7am which woke me up I assume was a nearby staff lift I was also surprised not to find a bathtub , Fabulous location just off Stephansdom made it easy to reach almost any corner of Vienna worth visiting 
502122,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Absolutely nothing The staff couldn t ever do enough for you I would recommend this hotel to anyone , The location is excellent Close enough to the many eateries bars and shops but off the main strip so heavenly peace and quiet at night The historic relevance of this hotel and feel you have as soon as you walk in are very hard to find We were very very lucky 
502123,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, It was all excellent, The staff were all outstanding we had a lot of help with booking excursions etc nothing was too difficult for them The location the intimate feel of the Hotel and the immaculate room We will definelty stay here again if in Vienna 
502124,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, I couldn t find any fault, The croissants were excellent What I especially like isthe real feather down duvet and pillows That s the feel of Vienna And the staff so courteous helpful and charming highly recommended 
502125,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Hotel room on the top floor was too hot changed to one on the ground floor better For a 4 star hotel one would expect coffee and tea making facilities in the room For business travellers single room had no desk and other guests are mainly older couples Personally i would choose a more business like hotel next time i m in Vienna for business travel , Location is perfect in the centre but very quiet Staff is very friendly Breakfast with lots of choices 
502126,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, No herrings for breakfast but I can live with that , Just about everything the superb location quietness and brightness of our room 313 friendliness of staff the general ambience of the hotel Everything worked including the air conditioning 
502127,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, The breakfast was excellent However the dining room was often full and a long wait ensued Room was comfortable but rather small The room rate seemed rather high, Excellent location Helpful and efficient staff Pleasant decor 
502128,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, We liked everything but the choice of Austrian breads at breakfast could have been wider The hotel staff in general were very polite and friendly but one of the breakfast waitresses could have been more hospitable in her approach Overall though a lovely stay , Excellent central location right in the heart of the city but on a quiet side street Perfect for sightseeing underground restaurants and shopping Exceptional reception staff and always helpful and courteous in their email correspondence prior to and after the visit We shall be returning to this hotel 
502129,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Room was small dark and a bit depressing, Can t beat the location lovely lobby area and exterior facade Reception staff very knowledgable and helpful

502133,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, the room was acceptable but tiny and 90 s style but there was a terrible smell in the bathroom I told the staff went out and when coming back they told me someone checked the bathroom it just needed fresh air so he put my trolley into the bathroom door so it will stay open incredible Of course the bad smell filled also the room and I had to open the window for some fresh air in a very cold evening but to reach the window was very hard because of furniture and lamps no help from the staff they just agreed to open the heating for half an hour the bad smell was there for the entire night, very central hotel near metro station breakfast rich enough but no coffee machine I had to drink my cup of capuccino in town

502138,Hotel Kaiserin Elisabeth, Nothing to dislike , I have a pet peeve with European hotels and that is with the showers Most are simply converted tubs with small glass partitions and spray wands that require the use of one hand Shower here was a walk in that would hold 10 to 15 people with an overhead rain forest type nozzle It was Spectacular
