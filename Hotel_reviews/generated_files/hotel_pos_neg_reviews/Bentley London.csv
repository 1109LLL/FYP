126805,Bentley London, After booking in advance for two months through booking com the reception was cold because it was discounted the hotel dont care about the guest i guess I wont be booking through booking com again the reaction is the same in all the hotels booked through booking com the exception was novotel den hague netherlands that allowed me in to my room as soon I arrived even though it was early morning novotel den hague rocks because the hotel showed their human side Everything must not be about money everytime , Did not eat there 
126806,Bentley London, I don t really think there was anything Parking would have been good also just one thing on the massage when they lay you on your back to do the massage they could cover uour eyes with an eye mask or something similar Bit bor relaxing and little less embarrassing Other than that nothing Everything was perfect , Our room was amazing as they upgraded us to a junior suite The food was amazing too Enjoyed using the spa bath 12 checkout was very helpful to We had a massage too Cannit fault the place and would really love to return Donna
126807,Bentley London,No Negative, We stayed for our wedding night as our evening reception was in London and the room was beautiful and so comfortable The Bentley made it extra special by kindly upgrading us to a suite which was a lovely surprise They also arranged for an extra full length mirror so I could get ready 
126808,Bentley London, As London hotels go this must be one of the best However the selection of drinks on offer in the pleasant underground bar are limited apart from that it is difficult to find fault , There is a nearby tube station Gloucester Road with direct lines to Heath Row and to the centre of London The rooms are quite luxurious and this area of London is very attractive The hotel does not have many rooms but this is no drawback We will stay there again no doubt 
126809,Bentley London, The service was a bit lacking I stayed recently at The Mandarin and The Berkeley and the service was much more attentive and felt better Also the suite cost over 800 for one night and that didn t include a breakfast which was another 45 on top which wasn t very customer focused , I liked the room it was furnished with beautiful antiques
126810,Bentley London, cleanness old furniture no smiling from most of its staff very bad TV Flowing of water in chair of bathroom is very weak non lovely smell, nothing as 5 stars hotel
126811,Bentley London, I find the cleaners come tidy the room a little later than i like sometimes by 4pm the room still isn t done I own a hotel and typically guests go out in the mornings and come back in the afternoon before preparing for the evening activities thats the only thing and it only happened twice , the rooms and bathrooms are spacious and beautiful nice big window FANTASTIC service friendly staff VERY close to Gloucester Rd Station and even walking distance from museums plenty of restaurants and harrods shopping areas hyde park i extended my stay here TWICE i booked direct though because i was already here and they gave me the best rate 
126812,Bentley London, Nothing much but the dining room could do with a little refurbishing , The staff were very welcoming helpful We had an upgrade to a junior suite which was luxurious peaceful The location was very quiet but close enough to the tube station access to attractions 
126813,Bentley London, N A, Wonderful service kind and attentive Beautiful room and even more beautiful bathroom The perfect place for a staycation if you re a local Room service breakfast was nothing less than a dream 
126814,Bentley London, Liked everything , The staff were incredibly attentive the suite we were upgraded to was beautifully furnished with a good range of toiletries in the bathroom The jacuzzi was a real treat along with the huge comfortable bed 
126815,Bentley London, Room smelled of cigar on the first day though the smell did disappear on subsequent days , Best hotel I have stayed in London so far Luxurious bathroom with tripple color marble and gold faucet Short walking distance from tube and supermarket
126816,Bentley London, N A, Afternoon Tea was immaculate Hotel room was superberb and from walking in at check in to checking out was excellent Warm welcome for both Will come back later this year that s a promise 
126817,Bentley London, Nothing, Everything was excellent and got a free upgrade all staff were excellent from Omar on receptions to the barman Duhan and all the restaurants staff a credit to the hotel
126818,Bentley London, For me as I can t walk very far it was a little bit too far out It was walking distance to The Royal Albert Hall for my husband but as I couldn t walk that far we had to get a taxi, Breakfast was really good I liked the fact that they made your eggs to order The bedroom was comfortable and we had a bath with a separate shower which was brilliant for me as I am disabled 
126819,Bentley London, I had a spa The massage was lovely I was dis appointed that the mit they gave me to wash with had a hole in it and appeared worn out I could see all the damp along the skirting whilst I was having the massage The TV in the bed room was less then basic The information led me to believe that SKY was included There was not even FREEVIEW The picture quality of the TV was terrible, I had a spa The massage was lovely The staff were very helpful and polite The breakfast was very good and comfortable The bed was comfortable
126820,Bentley London, We were put into a smoking room that smelled strongly of stale cigarette smoke I requested to be moved into a non smoking room Apparently there were no free non smoking rooms and I was offered a can of air freshener instead very professional A quick check on booking com and the hotel website told a different story ample free rooms I then spoke to a different manager who after a few minutes of searching upgraded us to a bigger suite The initial room we stayed in needed a lot of work and was shoddy to say the least Damp patches loose cable fixtures dirty carpets For a junior suite in a supposedly 5 star hotel I would expect more In saying that there were a few good things Location of the hotel is very food Breakfast was good Maybe I just got unlucky but after doing some more research and reading a lot of reviews I am not the first person to have had this massively disappointing experience A few words of advice for the hotel Please inform your potential customers when they are making the booking whether the room they have chosen is smoking permitted or not Do not offer the guest a can of air freshener as a solution to the problem Under no circumstances should you lie to the guest about the availability of rooms or lack thereof in the hotel Kindest regards Patrick, Location Breakfast 
126821,Bentley London, The cooked breakfast served in the room was old cold and unappetising Cold plates and covers The manager s response was to tell me he would have a word with the chef It still cost me 54 for two people The last night in the hotel an annual service check was carried out on the water system No water a bottle of water was left for drinks in the room in the bathroom from 10 30pm to 3am The noise of the water running through the system went on from 10 40pm to 1 30am It prevented sleep reading and was continuous and disturbing for almost 3 hours We were notified of the annual check by a letter left in the room which we saw when we returned at 8pm When I checked out of the hotel the following day and spoke to the manager about it I was told it had to be checked annually and he would put me complaint on my hotel profile I asked why if this was the case guests were not told when booking He did not have an answer Very unsatisfactory , The room was very comfortable and the area excellent for museums 
126822,Bentley London, didn t find out how expensive wi fi was until after making the booking satellite tv listed but didn t even get most freeview channels some channels didn t work could not access any movies or use hdmi cable to connect laptop did not work most electric sockets in the room did not work radio did not work etc , staff were very friendly and helpful bathroom was amazing the spa was even more amazing the rooms and decor were beautiful and a great size housekeeping service twice a day was nice it was a very luxurious experience except for the in room entertainment I would stay here again 
126823,Bentley London, The hotel cancelled our booking the day before Ignored emails The rooms Were not ready for 45 mins The room carpets were disgustingly filthy Fridge didn t work Someone tried to enter our room, Nothing The free glass of champagne perhaps
126824,Bentley London,No Negative, Very beautiful room and the bathroom was incredible This was a special get away trip for us and we loved the hotel the staff in the peridot breakfast room were so polite and helpful and nothing was too much trouble We loved our trip so much that we have booked to come again next year when we attend a show at the royal Albert hall It s only a few minutes walk away from the natural history museum which is my favourite thing to visit in London which was a bonus for me too 
126825,Bentley London, My colleague was attacked by a female staying at the hotel but obviously either very drunk or using drugs The hotel staff did nothing after being told , Full English was great
126826,Bentley London, Everything was old carpets were stained they tried to cover the red stain with a towel in the middle of the room Gaps in the sealing were covered by tissue TV had poor signal , The interior of the building
126827,Bentley London, Bathroom extras shower cap etc missing empty boxes buffet breakfast on first day had no product available to eat and by the time fresh was cooked we missed our first meeting On second day breakfast was served cold which was a shame as it was well cooked Staff told us we were in the car congestion charge area and we wasted 20 minutes trying to pay for the charge to then be told by another staff member we were not in the charge area Staffs accents were hard to understand and some staff spoke no English at all We drank some cocktails they were very poor some of the common areas of the hotel bar and chairs in Resturant are very tired, Room very comfy quiet and great decor and smashing bed
126828,Bentley London, Dressing gown was like concrete and towels very scratchy and hard Could benefit from better TV package as very few channels and no ITV, Upgraded to suite which we liked Room was nice and big loved the bath room service food was good and arrived quickly
126829,Bentley London,No Negative, Mattress has depression There e was virtually no internet connectivity which makes one seriously wonder It may be a reasonable policy to get guests to buy internet time but slow connectivity at least is an expectation every guest has 
126830,Bentley London, Nothing, Everything From the moment we arrived the staff were friendly and welcoming They gave us all the options for parking which was helpful Check inn was easy and quick We were upgraded to a suite which was a lovely surprise Afternoon tea was delicious and so was the breakfast Lots of variety The room was clean We really can not fault them on anything Check out was ok 
126831,Bentley London, The room was a bit dusty and staff play from afar that means there is no one to ask if you need help Compared to other 5 hotels I ve been to The standard was a bit low , It was very nice and quiet way out of the noise Very relaxed Very convenient location easy access and nice eatery around 
126832,Bentley London, Terrible pastries and bread at breakfast croissants were dry and old toast was barely toasted Not a five breakfast at all Eggs cooked well but hash brown clearly from frozen Room felt a little cold and fusty bedding didn t smell crisp and clean although it did look clean That said the bed was very comfy and duvet soft Lack of facilities expected for five star hotel no pool or sauna and you had to pay extra for hammam They had recently painted the bathroom or grouted it and it hadn t been done very well white paint had gotten all over the marble looked rough and rushed The hotel was just a bit tired despite what I m sure would have been very grand furnishings in their day Needs some love and care to really hit the 5 star mark doorman fresher lighter warmer rooms and much much better food , Beautiful lobby friendly staff So sweet of them to upgrade us for our anniversary and they left a cheesecake really kind and special of them Very friendly check in and out service 
126833,Bentley London, Room service menu is somewhat limited and quite costly The excellent bar has a poor selection of beers and Scotch whiskies this should be simple to fix The cost of drinks in the bar is higher than usual for hotels in this range , Rooms are stylish and spacious and the bathrooms are superb The reception area is pleasant and staff are friendly 
126834,Bentley London, Extremely bad service in the last few trips Massive staff turnover poor in room service very poor staff staff training A C not working prop wrong times on clock welcome letter in room addressed to wrong client no service at lobby coffee mini bar never topped up missing coffee cup struggle to get attention of any staff Really disappointed , This place is going downhill and fast Have stayed here 12 times over the past 3 years and besides the room and bathroom size furnishings which are very good but otherwise worse than a 4 star hotel in every other way 
126835,Bentley London, The AC was not working well and the room was very humid I was locked out of my room by the 3rd night by the night shift manager Mohin at 12 AM and he coldly responded by telling me I did not cover the required papers at check in very improfessionally done as it could have been communicated in a message or letter ,No Positive
126836,Bentley London,No Negative, Everything was really good The bathroom really nice Bed very comfortable Room service And afternoon tea were perfect Great location And professional service 10 10
126837,Bentley London, It had a Faulty Towers quality Initially the fridge and kettle didn t work we wanted to make a cup off tea We found the problem to be the power point which had burnt out We had to look under the fridge and there was a whole lot of rubbish swept under there bottle tops etc Very off putting We called reception reported all of that and they responded quickly enough but missed the point each time sending a new kettle new glasses and finally a repair man The cleanliness issue was never addressed Once we experience an issue with cleanliness I m afraid it tarnishes the whole experience of the hotel and we experienced the stay as doing time rather than enjoying the hotel The decor was ornate but again a closer look and the windows were filthy and broken the gold and black marble spa bath was held together by loose panels of board the chair was wobbly and worn through to the stuffing lastly the breakfast was hugely expensive 22 we took the opportunity to enjoy breakfast elsewhere at a fraction of the price All up we couldn t recommend this hotel and I think it is the symptom of a bigger problem which is that London hotels get away with it not OK , The location is excellent
126838,Bentley London, Staff rude room pretty dirty jacuzzi didn t work no tooth brush Breakfast too much expencive Even if we complained about the jacuzzi they didn t give us any discount neather breackfast for free , The position
126839,Bentley London, I can t think of anything i didn t like everything was perfect would love to visit again, The stuff are very friendly welling to help you with eveeything you need spiciouse rooms with classic furniture full marble toilets comfy beds
126840,Bentley London, Just nothing, I asked the staff to do something special for my special occasion and they surprised me All that was for free They didn t ask for any charge 
126841,Bentley London, Nothing was lacking , The room was gorgeous we were upgraded to a suite 4 minute walk to Gloucester Station and all kinds of amenities in the area Staff were exceptionally nice and very helpful Would highly recommend 
126842,Bentley London, No complimentary tea coffee It was charged at 4 50 per single teabag sachet of nescafe in July 2016 No HD television extra charges apply for channels No free Wifi Needs much Maintance Some rooms are heavy smoking rooms , comfortable beds decorated nicely good location
126843,Bentley London, The gym is tiny with very few equipment The breakfast spread is a bit thin for this quality of hotel, This is a gem of a hotel with excellent location Right next to Gloucester road and quick access to South Ken The room was very spacious Especially by London standards 
126844,Bentley London, Pompous staff far too expensive but i just think that the standard of hotels in london just do not come close to ours in australia so i suppose we are very spoilt, Central location comfy bed large room good shower and spa
126845,Bentley London, the check of the first room as housekeeping should have spotted the problem with the water on the carpet , The hotel provided us with an upgrade to a suite as it was my husband s birthday and as the room we were allocated first had wet patches on the floor 
126846,Bentley London, Reception lady called me and said check out time is 12pm When I already asked another staff to have late check out at 1pm A bit mixed up here and annoyed me a bit, Love everything After staying here more than 10times At last I have got the upgraded to Deluxe King room Finally And thank you
126847,Bentley London, They offered us a smoking room as and upgrade being non smokers we obviously declined Our room wasn t ready because we were early which was fair enough However when we returned they said good news we ve given you an upgrade We then went to our room and what do you know there s a smoking sticker on the door They gave us a smoking room apparently that s an upgrade And the room didn t seem any better that what we had booked Paper didn t come that we ordered on arrival on their check in form no explanation of why, The location is great
126848,Bentley London, Couldn t fault the hotel, When we arrived we where giving a room upgrade which was very much appreciated The staff where friendly and attentive and we enjoyed our stay
126849,Bentley London, absolutely nothing, Fantastic hotel great staff and food They upgraded me to a junior suite which was fantastic and well equipped Good breakfast good location 
126850,Bentley London, A 2 3 star hotel charging 5 prices Our room was shabby as was the breakfast area Female receptionist sneering and rude Never again , It s location 
126851,Bentley London, The room was a little stuffy and warm, Hotel upgraded us to a suite as it was our honeymoon very lovely gesture The room was beautifully designed Had an issue with the hot water control in the shower but it was promptly fixed after we notified the staff very efficient of them 
126852,Bentley London, This propert needs a lot of up keep it looks like a luxury hotel BUT if you really look it s A very tired hotel It s NOT worth the money I would not stay there again , the only positive thing about this hotel is there bedding 
126853,Bentley London, Iron left a stain on my shirt and this situation was handled circumstantially and I got some good lecture from receptionist how I iron next time despite the fact the iron was in an inappropriate condition , The classic room is marvellous and spacious They cleaned my shirt
126854,Bentley London, Automatic service charges on absolutely everything , The room was upgraded for free upon our arrival and we had the luxury of a twin junior suite fabulous
126855,Bentley London, Room Temperature fan control comfort was too noisy unable to get proper balance between too hot too cold The TV reception on some channels poor the choice of channels also disappointing , Staff in general very helpful 
126856,Bentley London, Nothing, Bed was very comfortable and staff could not do enough for you Very clean and tidy Just need to remember parking as its only for max 4 hours outside the hotel
126857,Bentley London, Staff is not at the same level of the building s appearance Everything is done for clients from Arab countries not so much European Example no English newspaper but Arabic available in the entrance hall , The location is great Well connected to public transport and perfectly situated for visiting London 
126858,Bentley London, The room was substandard considering how good it looked cleanliness was poor we found a pill on the floor which could have been taken by a child the television would not work in the room Washbasin in the Bathroom had a big crack in it Not Really what we paid for we wanted a relaxed few Days In London and we did not really get what we paid for at all , Location was great the hotel itself superb 
126859,Bentley London, It s expensive but very impressive , The lobby halls and rooms are spectacularly elegant I have stayed in every hotel in the Gloucester Road area over the past 10 years and this is the best 
126860,Bentley London, the hotel needs a bit of a refurbishment as in some details e g furniture you can see that the last one might have been already some years ago, comfortable beds big room clean big bathroom quiet location
126861,Bentley London, The staff was unfriendly my room was dusty the hotel seems run down and the room service selection was terrible at night there is not even any food available Never returning to this hotel , The staff was unfriendly my room was dusty the hotel seems run down and the room service selection was terrible at night there is not even any food available Never returning to this hotel 
126862,Bentley London, I have stayed in many nice hotels although mainly abroad and was disappointed that bottled water was not complimentary Wifi in the room was chargeable I m not sure why with today s technology and in England this is acceptable Had to request extra tea and milk in the room as I am british and enjoy a good cup of tea whilst in my room , The doorman was extremely helpful and friendly on the Saturday and sorry we didn t see him the rest of our stay to know his name The room was lovely and bed comfortable The hotel was beautiful would have liked to stayed longer to sample the restaurant 
126863,Bentley London, There were one or two minor repairs needed in the bathroom wobbly tap and no make up mirror in my daughter s room Considering the price of the roooms it would have been useful to have had some indication as to whether the nibbles provided were complimentary or to be paid for as part of the minibar service It would also be useful to have a price list provided for the minibar This particularly useful as the lovely bar area that we would have liked to have used was not open to hotel residents on the night that we stayed because of a private party We had not been informed of this ahead of our stay and could have chosen a different hotel had we known We were given the option to sit in the foyer area of the hotel and have drinks brought up from the bar however this was a rather cold and draughty area that was brightly lit and whilst lovely in the day time does not give the same ambiance as a cosy bar in the evening The breakfast was expensive but was very good and there was plenty of choice The lady who served the breakfast was the friendliest memeber of staff The others were all most polite but a little bit stiff Maybe that s a reflection of the clientel to whom the hotel usually appeals , The hotel was in a lovely quiet location and the room looked out over gardens so there was absolutely no road noise The staff were able to accommodate our request to have our two rooms close to each other and the spaciousness and standard of furnishings was very good The bed was lovely and comfortable and the room was beautifully clean 
126864,Bentley London, I think it would ve been nice to be given instruction on the wi fi when we arrived It appeared to be simple our devices looked liked it was connected but then service didn t happen As it turns out you need to enter a code that the hotel provides to get the access but there is nothing that tells you that We went for 2 days thinking the system was just overloaded and it made it challenging to make plans for our visit since we weren t connecting to the internet Anyway discovered the answer an hour before we left I think it should have been presented to us on arrival ,No Positive
126865,Bentley London, Breakfast was a lot of money for what it was , Staff were so helpful Gave us a free upgrade and gave us a brilliant reccommendation for dinner The room was large and the bed comfortable 
126866,Bentley London, Only silly little things like no make up mirror and lack of an electric socket near to a mirror for doing my hair Also wonky loo seat , Wonderfully comfortable beds and lovely bathroom Extremely spacious room and very attractively furnished Silk covered chairs gave a sumptious feel Loved it 
126867,Bentley London,No Negative, Great hotel and my preferred choice in London Staff except some long timers need lots and lots of training Nonetheless 10 10 for lobby rooms size furnishings 
126868,Bentley London, The room service 24 hour menu is limited and overpriced Other room service was great , We were upgraded and given complimentary treats because it was our wedding anniversary Their service was excellent 
126869,Bentley London, a little bit shabby around the edges My bill was not broken down and itemised fully on a consolidated bill Card was charged and preauthorised and payments were taken a number of times I therefore had to check after checking out which was a bit embarrassing and still am not sure whether I have been charge properly as I didn t get a receipt for my room only for the extras I had on two different bills Its a small matter but I wish it had been dealt with more efficiently as I felt uncomfortable as if I was distrusting the hotel when actually I only wanted receipts for my accounts , Fab beds very pretty hotel great location opulent surroundings and lovely room amazing marble bathroom staff were great 
126870,Bentley London, Use of the gym must be booked in advance and opening hours are limited, Very comfortabe and spacious room great attention for details like a fruit platter in the room on arrival good breakfast
126871,Bentley London, No toothpaste toiletries were supposed to be included no bath robes and the TV was pay per view 10 per movie Appalling , Lovely Bathroom and Bedroom 
126872,Bentley London, Not much but having to pay for the Internet at these prices is pretty silly A very minor point but could they not provide some biscuits on the tea coffee tray , The ambiance of the Hotel is very good and Breakfast and the room it is served in are particularly pleasant 
126873,Bentley London, Lacked atmosphere in Lobby , Beautiful furnishings and very comfortable bed I loved the toiletaries and whirlpool bath too Very impressed with birthday cake and room upgrade they provided for my fiances birthday 
126874,Bentley London, expected to be greeted at door and offered help with luggage arrived at front door did not instantly know where reception was stood in hallway before someone acknowledged us given directions to room but no offer of help with luggage room looked as if it needed some refurbishment , reception staff polite after we had located where they were breakfast staff very friendly breakfast in lovely setting 
126875,Bentley London, I booked a big room keeping the measurements in view but i didn t get that room I didn t complain about it either they might have changed my room but i had no time for it , The bed was super comfy the bath was good worked well 
126876,Bentley London, cleaning staff speaks zero English and doesn t understand a word either Hot water had too little pressure in the bath Desk chair was very uncomfortable Unable to open the windows for safety reasons resulting in no fresh air Air freshener in the lobby was overpowering Old fashioned taps in the bathroom sink , excellent location walking distance to Waitress supermarket and various museums and other sights Very helpful staff Choice of a bath and shower enough space for toiletries 
126877,Bentley London,No Negative, Great rooms and service Amazing whirlpool and luxurious feel But how can you possibly have such an image yet supply with very outdated TV set with a super slow channel system It doesn t fit For that money it should be modern 
126878,Bentley London,No Negative, Great hotel absolutely gorgeous The room was stunning we were given a free upgrade Jacuzzi bath separate shower Gorgeous bedroom very spacious with a sofa Fantastic staff in every way Can t wait to return 
126879,Bentley London, the fan in the room was very noisy but got fixed when we told the concierge Problem with the phone in the room took a little while to get fixed One day of our stay our room was it done and we were out of tissue and toilet paper , The concierge and dining room staff were very nice and helpful The rooms are charming with lots of space for a London hotel room 
126880,Bentley London, Needs renovation Paint chipping off the walls TV equipment and content is about a decade behind standard Breakfast is that of a 3 stars hotel at most , Very quiet room Good location 
126881,Bentley London, The room was too warm and there was no means by which to reduce the temperature A small jug of milk in the fridge would have been most welcome , Great care has been taken with the decor of both the public areas and the rooms which are tastefully and attractively presented 
126882,Bentley London,No Negative, Beautiful and also large room and one of the more quiet yet still central London locations Ah yes the staff where also very friendly and very helpful I felt right at home there It was an overall wonderful experience for me thank you 
126883,Bentley London, Leaving , The staff were very welcoming to me and helpful Also very cheerful I felt like an old friend The Spa is amazing and totally enjoyed myself all afternoon 
126884,Bentley London, I was caught out by the WiFi cost This should be explained when the password is given In my trip to UK Turkey and Greece the Bentlley was the only hotel to charge let alone charge approx 18 pounds , Location
126885,Bentley London, I have been charged twice by the hotel I paid throw booking com at the first time and it was deducted from my bank account and when I was checking out from the hotel they asked me to pay again though they have received the payment I m not happy with the lady who made my check out arrangements yet I had to leave to the airport,No Positive
126886,Bentley London, bed was hard and the room was dated and faded and the silk wall coverings had ingrained dust and stains as did the carpets and the furnishing were worn So it felt like the whole place needs a good freshening up and refurbish, staff are friendly and helpful and bath was sumptuous earth toned marble in the old italian style Room was spacious tho windows were small Bed linens were lovely
126887,Bentley London, The staff is very slow except Zoltan from the reception I ordered my lunch and I received it 2 hours later I have called them twice with promises to get back to me and never happened Moreover I had to complain many times for the twels not being changed daily The ac and the safety box were not working The spa was my worst experience the spa itself is poor the lady wasn t nice and she never smile It s supposed to be a five star hotel , I like the location the building in general is well decorated and furnished 
126888,Bentley London, Fridge and shower didn t function properly Staff were very distant and seemingly disinterested Not a bad experience but not really a memorable one or one that stood out really , Conveniently close to the Piccadilly line from Gloucester Road Tube station Quiet hotel
