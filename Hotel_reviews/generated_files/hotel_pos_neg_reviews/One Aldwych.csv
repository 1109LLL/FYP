7480,One Aldwych, The spa was very disappointing Just 5 cheap beds round the pool Nowhere else to sit The treatments weee nice but not good value for money, The room was pleasant and the bar area nice
7481,One Aldwych,No Negative, We stayed here on our wedding night and the staff were incredible They treated us with such warmth and really made it feel special The room was wonderful and the breakfast delicious What really made it were the staff who were incredible Recommended 
7482,One Aldwych, The shower cubicle in the bathroom was very small for this rating of hotel don t drop anything The great water pressure made up for the lack of space in shower though , The hotel is very conveniently located to the theatres and covent garden The room was well insulated and the bed was very comfy so much so I slept through a thunder storm 
7483,One Aldwych, Tea and coffee facilities should be in the room although you could phone reception and ask for them I feel they should have been there without asking the room could have been bigger, The staff were so welcoming and the little touches in our room like the rose petals and electric candles by our bath made our stay extra special the pillows were a dream to sleep on 
7484,One Aldwych, Considering the reports and ratings that are celebrating the hotel we were slightly disappointed The furniture of the suite looked a little worn out and old fashioned You can hear the toilet flush from the adjactent floors in the bathroom All in all it doesn t feel very personal and private in the room Breakfast is terribly over priced a usual thing in a lot of hotels to be honest and not worth writing home about Would definetly choose another hotel in London next time , First thing we got an upgrade from a room to a suite which was very nice Staff was helpful Real beautiful bar with terrific looking bar menu cocktails A lot of attractions of London in walking distance 
7485,One Aldwych, The really noisy flushing toilet which was like you get on an airplane and so loud I was woken by the plumbing in adjoining rooms, Wonderful staff So switched on and so genuinely helpful and concerned about pleasing guests
7486,One Aldwych, Although I have commended the breakfast it was possibly a little over the top There really was more food than anyone could sensibly require My niece had to ask for her pillows to be changed as she has an allergy to goose and duck down Replacements were provided immediately and without question but were far too big The staff s anxiety to please is perhaps a little overpowering for people like us who are not wealthy but can manage an occasional special treat , The staff were all very friendly and attentive The food was superb My 9 year old great nephew could barely believe the breakfast enough food to feed an army served by a waitress who deserves special commendation very professional cheerful and obliging The porters were also all very helpful The lobby bar is well worth a visit The hotel is within easy reach of many of the West End theatres and other attractions 
7487,One Aldwych, I understand that room rates are high in this part of London and that One Aldwych is a very high standard hotel with 24hr room service but I felt that it wouldn t be too much to ask for tea and coffee making facilities in the room and that breakfast items were very expensive even compared to the restaurant dinner prices However the pub across the road serves an excellent breakfast at less eye watering prices , High level of service and comfort throughout the hotel
7488,One Aldwych, Having to leave Wish we could of stayed longer , All staff was so helpful to make our stay a memorable one from organising a special birthday treat in the room for my daughter to personally taking us to the taxis every time we needed one The rooms beds were so comfortable with everything you need Hotel is right next to the theatre which with children is great after the evening show being able to walk back 
7489,One Aldwych,No Negative, Great small luxury hotel Good size well equipped rooms Excellent location for central London on the strand near the Thames and close to Covent Garden Spa 
7490,One Aldwych, Nothing, Wonderful hotel in an excellent location Rooms are well furnished and comfortable with tea coffee facilities iron etc supplied on request The hotel also has a great gym and pool area The staff are without doubt some of the best we ve encountered in the hotels we ve stayed at very professional helpful and friendly Cocktails in the lobby bar are fantastic if a little pricy We dined one evening at the Eneko restaurant in the hotel basement which is very highly recommended fab food ambience 
7491,One Aldwych, I think the staff were a little too suggestive in having extras but this was minor we had a fruit side plate for breakfast but didn t really need this so ended up not eating it , The hotel location is perfect for a weekend getaway walking around Covent Garden and getting in an evening show The hotel is very stylish The staff were extremely helpful friendly and professional The bed was very comfortable and the room temperature perfect The breakfast was delicious 
7492,One Aldwych,No Negative, Appreciated the customer service and attention to detail with the service all staff were friendly and professional The bar very smart is a welcoming comfortable place at the end of a long day in London sightseeing celebrating especially for for a late night drink snack
7493,One Aldwych, Noisy kids in pool meant I didn t go in but it was Easter so to be expected I guess , Gorgeous sink in pillows on the bed Door staff always friendly and welcoming Steam room super hot which was wonderful 
7494,One Aldwych, Nothing to dislike the rooms are as you would expect in a 5 hotel beds comfortable bathrooms are fine , The location is fantastic Covent Garden literally around the corner right next door to the Lion King and Mumma Mia so slap bang in theatre land couldn t be better We went with a group of 18 to celebrate our daughter s 18th birthday From the initial booking until we left the hotel the staff could not have been more helpful We received several emails to confirm everything prior to our arrival and the reservations staff were very helpful in arranging all the necessary rooms for a complicated group The bar manager organised a private room for us to have drinks before we left for dinner we went to 100 Wardour Street which I would also recommend for dinner dancing club ideal for parties at no extra charge with a lovely waiter who looked after us perfectly The doormen were super helpful in ensuring we got all our 18 year olds into four taxis making everything run smoothly and stress free All in all One Aldwych is now our favourite London hotel and that is really down to the staff and location They also have a gluten free restaurant which is great for me and very unusual so no problems with gluten free options Thank you SO much for making our daughter s big day so lovely 
7495,One Aldwych,No Negative, The room attendants attention to detail was excellent and we were impressed with the small touches like the fresh fruit the advisory notes left The tea tray with the fresh flowers etc 
7496,One Aldwych, Room very small wardrobe access in particular small Shower access over the bath not easy for one of us being over 70 years young a room with a walk in shower is quite a bit more expensive The lounge facilities for residents is limited , A very warm greeting on arrival and everything very well explained All the staff were lovely and very friendly The room was well equipped and spotlessly clean very comfortable bed and pillows wonderful bathroom toiletries very good fluffy towels and a good size complementary newspaper water and tea making equipment Nice quiet room 
7497,One Aldwych, Outdated room design much nicer in pictures than real life was very disappointed expected it to be nicer for a 5 star hotel Loud plumbing noises in bathroom after use of water , Great location and very friendly staff 
7498,One Aldwych, The bed was too hard Thats all , Staff very polite and helpful Stylish decor Very clean Quiet despite busy roads Not too big Restaurant served lovely food for dinner and breakfast 
7499,One Aldwych,No Negative, The hotel provides outstanding service and is in the heart of the theatre district and just steps from The Savoy Hotel Covent Garden Martket and a bridge to the West Bank with all its food carts Excellent restaurants surround the hotel and the hotel itself houses outstanding restaurants and a bar with novalty drinks served until midnight 
7500,One Aldwych, For what iv paid 575 for 1 night didnt even gt a breakfast we could av been told that thers a safe in room the chair in 403 was disgustig filthy wasnt very impressed with the service,No Positive
7501,One Aldwych, Incredibly noisy Miniscule bedroom Broken toilet Water issue Plumber finally fixed it at 2am Key for adjoining room opened ours at the same time Guided to sit infront of lift when having a drink in the bar Receptionist in the morning a complete robot Knew we d had a terribly night Instead of starting off with an apology she asked if we d had a good night I commented that there were a few issues to which she replied oh yes I heard For 350 night and 18 glass of fizz I don t expect the adjoining room to open my door have a waterfall in the middle of the night nor do I expect to relax sip champagne in front of a lift shambolic faulty towers , Eggs benedict breakfast was awesome Pool amazing 
7502,One Aldwych,No Negative, We loved the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Tea It was the perfect girl s afternoon out during a celebratory weekend The staff was incredibly helpful and made us feel very welcome The Concierge arranged for two fun tours that we thoroughly enjoyed The Lobby Bar was delightful Our room was quiet and very comfortable The location couldn t be beat with a short walk to Covent Garden the theatres the Thames and many restaurants We will definitely be back 
7503,One Aldwych, The breakfast was not up to the level of the rest of the experience at this hotel Expensive and not tasty Slow service, Location perfect Bed a dream Staff outstanding Loved the fruit cookies small cakes left in our room each night The box at the front door of the room for the papers each morning was a nice touch 
7504,One Aldwych,No Negative, There was special attention regards to the celebration of my husbands 35th birthday with a bottle of champagne and amazing chocolate cake in our room 
7505,One Aldwych, I booked five nights and each night I was charged a different rate I booked my stay through booking com Although the booking site mentioned a daily rate I was very disappointed that at the time of check out the front desk charged me 5 different rates I wonder who s responsible for this lapse Hotel or the booking engine OTA , Very friendly and carering staff They make you feel like you want to come back over and over again 
7506,One Aldwych, The walk in shower was pretty tiny , The location is perfect the staff warm friendly and accommodating The rooms are lovely with little surprises delivered daily by the staff High tea is a treat and the lobby bar is upscale and lively This is definitely my favorite UK property 
7507,One Aldwych, Leaving, Probably one of the best hotels we have stayed in Staff were excellent and very helpful from the doormen to the front of house staff The champagne and cake for a birthday treat was a very pleasant surprise 
7508,One Aldwych, Breakfast to order not ideal for young children even part buffet would help Film projection in pool great idea but unfortunately you can t really see it , Bar area and cocktails and swimming pool for our toddler 
7509,One Aldwych, Toilet blocked and drains noisy Would have preferred a walk in shower as rim of bath far too high for short person to step into , Absolute perfection The staff were all attentive and well trained They could not have been better 
7510,One Aldwych, The staff were a little over attentive although very polite At lunch I felt uncomfortable as the staff were coming over what seemed like every 15mins , The spa and pool were lovely especially being in central London Afternoon tea Charlie and the Chocolate factory selection was delightful Size of room and bathroom were very spacious I would definitely stay again 
7511,One Aldwych, Pillows were terrible a five star hotel should have a selection of pillows to choose from Our hotel room door lock was missing so it didn t feel very secure The bathroom was quite tired and old fashioned plus the pump was noisy Cocktails were expensive and although tasty lacked much alcohol The hotel bar and restaurant were not that of a five star hotel and lacked ambience The pool was average again a little tired and the health club did not feel like that of w five star hotel , Staff were very friendly prompt check in good turn down service etc Good location close to river and Covent Garden Our room was spacious clean and very quiet Nice touches in the room like free champagne for our anniversary Reception responded promptly to all my emails prior to arrival
7512,One Aldwych, We arrived to a king bed when my girlfriend and I specifically wanted and booked twin beds The lag time in getting this handled was a bit annoying because the desk clerk did not take this seriously enough Evidently he does not travel because he was very disrespectful of our request and a bit argumentative Car to airport did not arrive Agostinho was not on duty and we waited at least 20 minutes prior to getting into a cab I personally checked on the car about 10 minutes prior to departing and he had not arrived which I found unusual for Great Britain but then at the specific time and he still was not there I felt that a call should have been made promptly rather than waiting for us to have to ask 10 minutes later Hopefully these comments can be taken in a positive way to help improve customer service for this very nice facility , We had the specific pleasure of having a wonderful concierge Agostinho He went out of his way to do anything he could for us He helped book and hand pick theater seats for us for 4 plays arrange a trip to the Cotswolds and just in general gave us tips on places to eat and where to go with very specific directions 
7513,One Aldwych, No wow factor and there was one waiter that did all the things you shouldn t do as a waiter at breakfast leaning across you etc, Loved afternoon tea the location
7514,One Aldwych, It did take 3 attemps to get firm pillowes for are beds They need to be a bit more clearer some were be it on the web sight or checking Iin about the extra surcharge put on hold on the credit card I did get confused , The after noon high tea and having the beds turned down at night after a busy day Great room service of food which was beautifully presented fresh flowers in room and real orchid plants every were 
7515,One Aldwych, Room was quite small for a luxury double and the bathroom was quite basic with small single wash basin and basic small glass enclosed shower , Very comfortable bed Quiet room Very pleasant open bar area
7516,One Aldwych, The water saving toilet flush is very loud in the middle of the night But better for the environment , Extremely polite warm staff We have stayed before but they made us feel like regulars 
7517,One Aldwych, Actual bedroom was a little small but to be fair it had all the necessary resources , Staff excellent Location really good They went the extra mile to provide child friendly equipment 
7518,One Aldwych, To have been offered the 3 for 2 nights offer by the hotel which we were unaware of as we would loved to have stayed another night , Staff couldn t be freindlier and do enough for you but remained professional at all times Booked a private function for 25 of us ages ranged from 19 79 the catering and events dept were faultless Perfect location for soho Covent garden and Theatre land 
7519,One Aldwych,No Negative, The staff kindly let me and my family have a 3 00 departure which was appreciated The hotel bedroom was very quiet which was wonderful The night porter Mark was charming 
7520,One Aldwych,No Negative, The staff we re amazing and went beyond the call of duty My daughter and I were made to feel welcome and taken care of The room was clean and well laid out Attention to detail was superb 
7521,One Aldwych,No Negative, Best location for Covent Garden theatres restaurants and the south Bank and its attractions are a short walk away I ve never slept so well the beds are great willy wonka afternoon tea a must all the staff are helpful and friendly will defiantly be back 
7522,One Aldwych, A possible inconvenience for business travellers is that the in room safe is not large enough for a laptop, The is a lot to like at One Aldwych The room was large comfortable and well appointed The staff are corteous helpful efficient and cheerful The private lounge available to guests for use after check out is a nice touch that in our case made a late evening flight much more relaxing There were many small touches too many to mention here that added to an aleady excellent atmoshpere And the location is excellent 
7523,One Aldwych,No Negative, This was the perfect hotel for a night away in the city Room was well designed staff were fantastic attentive friendly and helpful but not over the top and remembered our names each time they spoke to us Great location and lovely residents lounge The cocktails were delicious and we felt we were in the buzz of things without the hassle Fantastic 
7524,One Aldwych, The Foyer bar was lovely but gets very busy no where else as a guest to go and chill out if full, Fantastic location comfortable and good size room quiet despite being in the centre of London
7525,One Aldwych, Small grumble We had the afternoon tea However there was a special reception in the lobby bar in connection with the BAFTAs so we had to eat in the general dining area I think we should have been told that when we booked Then we asked if we could chose where we sat and were told no as certain tables were reserved for regular diners No one sat at any of those tables the entire time we were there , For a special occasion this will always be my first choice in London Ideally placed for shows or covent garden excellent service lovely lobby bar for drinks 
7526,One Aldwych, My wife had a poor cut of meat when in the restaurant but when we advised the staff the whole issue was handled very well , Everything about stay was excellent Staff accommodation location and overall facilities first class We ve now found a base for our visits to London 
7527,One Aldwych, Nothing 1 Aldwych in my opinion is perfect, The room was lovely with a view looking on to the Lyceum Theatre Lobby Bar made fabulous cocktails Lavender Cloud in particular Staff were lovely Love this hotel and cant wait to go back again
7528,One Aldwych,No Negative, Can t recommend this place enough and I visit London every month Fantastic friendly professional staff impeccable service Nice quiet rooms comfortable beds Room service was quick and good Bar is perfect for a work coffee or an evening cocktail There were lots of nice touches from the call just after arrival to ask if there was anything else the hotel could do or provide to water at turndown to the ziplock bag which appeared in the bathroom the night before checkout The pool is lovely no chlorine and just the right temperature But above all it s the staff one of the best run hotels I ve ever seen 
7529,One Aldwych, From the moment you arrive reception staff are rude unfriendly and in the bar area the staff ignored us for 30 mins then when we sat at a empty reserved table as we only wanted one drink before we went to dinner we were kicked off the table in an abrupt manner we went to the bar area couldn t get served left after 20 mins table still sitting empty Will never return, Location great for the theatre
7530,One Aldwych,No Negative, From the minute we stepped into the hotel we were transported into another world The ambiance the staff the whole atmosphere was excellent and nothing was too much trouble We were treated like royalty and did not want to leave Thank you everyone
