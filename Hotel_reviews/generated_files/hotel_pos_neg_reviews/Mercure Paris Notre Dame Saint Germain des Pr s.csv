99525,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, Rooms are small but fine for a few days visit as we were out and about most of the time Odd system when we booked as they sent a form to fill in for Credit Card details without which they couldn t guarantee the room Not sure if this was a one off due to an issue or if it was standard for the hotel or booking com Seemed a bit odd but confirmed directly with the hotel that it was all above board Just caused a bit of panic a day or two before we travelled , Very clean and rooms in good condition Looked like it had been recently refurbished Location is great in Latin quarter near to restaurants and bars and felt safe at night we had children Handy Metro station round the corner easy walk to Notre Dame but would use the metro for other main attractions Staff friendly and helpful Would happily stay again 
99526,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, Nothing , Location was easy to reach and walking distance to all places of interest in Latin Quarter Also close to jump on jump off tour buses to easily reach all other sites of the city 
99527,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, The only downside we found is the bathroom for the double room It s pretty small and it s got a bathtub which makes taking a shower very uncomfortable and also sprays water everywhere , Very good hotel in a very nice location Very close to Notre Dame Saint Michel has a buzz at night time which is quite cool 
99528,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, The room at night was absolutely roasting and our air con didn t work Also 3 members of staff came into our room during the day while we were there trying to get changed , The staff found me a room to warm up in as i had an audition that day 
99529,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, Payment procedure payment for the room was hold on the credit card while the hotel charged the card once more when money were not back on the card It was necessary to pay with another card and have the amount available again in 1 week Very inconvenient , Location
99530,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, Customer service was outstanding We were always greeted when we were leaving or entering the hotel Everyone was more than happy to assist us in helping with directions or any questions we had Even allowed us to print some documents
99531,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, Tiny room but normal for Europe Very hard to set suitcases etc out , Location excellent Best part of Paris by far Room tiny but clean TV had a couple of English language stations Staff were helpful Very close to St Michel Notre Dame station 2 stops from Gare du Nord Good price for a room in this area 
99532,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, Staff were lovely they couldn t be more helpful Had the privilege room was worth every penny Also booked the return transfer through them was excellent too 
99533,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, Breakfast service a little slow at busy times but this is a very minor point for what was a truly excellent hotel, The staff were extremely helpful Great location 
99534,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, Didn t like the paper and plastic cups in the rooms for drinking , Bed was very comfortable Wi fi speed was exceptional Convenient to trains buses and restaurants and cafes
99535,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, Room was too small the resteraunt was too small and the food was poor the guy in reception that looked of Indian decent was not very helpful Would not stay here again , Location
99536,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, Veeeery small rooms and slow wifi But I d chose the hotel again because of the location After all you don t go to Paris to spend the days in your room , Location is superb 
99537,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, Rooms are not only very small but the facilities are not 4 star There is a hot water jug but it is on a small plastic shelf which drips water on the desk below which is the only clear space to leave electrical things Very small amounts of teabags and only plastic glasses and paper cups, Location is wonderful and staff were lovely
99538,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, Sound insulation between rooms could be better Airconditioning was not operating because it is locked out during heating system could not control room temperature well without opening the window which let in street noise , Comfortable clean Superb location Extremely friendly helpful staff 
99539,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, Staff helpful and great location very convenient for buses and subway Quiet street and at the same time closeby to some nice little restautants , Internet is an issue when you are traveling for business need to re connect quite often so waste of time Refill of mini bar was not regular 
99540,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, The rooms are small with a small double bed but for the price it was very good for Paris , The front desk guys were great Vincent was fantastic and went out of his way to assist and make our stay wonderful the 3 front desk managers we meet all spoke very good English which was such a relief The hotel was in a great location and I would highly recommend this hotel 
99541,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, Our room was an upgrade and was small but great for Paris The rooms are close to others and you can hear others Bring earplugs , Location Helpful Clean good bed
99542,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, The room was rather small and would not be suitable for a stay of longer than one night , The bed was very comfy and I had an excellent night s sleep 
99543,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, First week of February and we were eaten alive by Mosquitoes They must have come from the heating duct as it was freezing outdoors and the room was boiling They were killed and left all over the walls and ceiling of room 32 Still itching now after three days back home, Location
99544,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, Breakfast if not included in your room rate is 17 euro a day You can grab a coffee and toast croissant down the road for 3euro The small rooms wouldn t suit if you were staying longer than a weekend They have a privilege suite however that looked to be bigger The corridors are VERY narrow and I imagine a claustrophobe s nightmare , While the rooms are small they are totally functional and everything you need is there They make excellent use of the small space and we wanted for nothing We booked a twin room on the 5th floor the windows let in very little noise we had a safe mini fridge bath and shower and enough wardrobe space Hotel staff were very pleasant and friendly The option of express check in out was handy for avoiding delays although we did still need to pick up our key at reception and also pay the room tax on check out which wasn t included in the overall price we paid when booking This is around 2 euro per day per guest so watch out for that The location is a couple of minutes from the nearest metro and a 10 minute walk maximum to the St Michel metro and RER stop which brings you straight to Charles de Gaulle Loads of brasseries in the vicinity and you are just 5 10 minutes from the bustle of St Michel The area is clean and safe and we felt really at ease there 
99545,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, The room has a low ceiling and the bathroom has very low ceiling I have 1 85m and when I used the shower every time I was with my head down It s crazy , Staff localization

99547,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, The room was quite small and a little expensive for what we got but this isn t unusual for Paris , Great location near Notre Dame and the latin quarter easy to find and nearby metro stations Staff gave us a room to stay in after we had checked out free of charge as one of our party were not feeling well very kind Wifi was fast and a good connection could be had throughout the building 
99548,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, None Room small but then all hotel rooms in central Paris are small , Ideal location very near to RER B line station with direct link to Gare du Nord Eurostar CDG airport Very good metro bus links Staff v friendly professional Room always clean

99550,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, The elevator was broken for 2 days and they did move us down 2 floors but that was more of an inconvenience than anything The rooms are small and awkward , Very nice hotel great staff clean comfortable and you can t ask for a better location It s a 3 minute walk to Notre Dame and there are plenty of places to eat and shop right in the neighborhood Try the Tunisian restaurant right down stairs excellent

99554,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, Drain in shower totally blocked first morning rectified that day Lift broken on the Sunday but we were only made aware by fellow residents no notices posted to advise Lift out all day fine for us as we are fit but could have been problem, Modern clean spacious room in an excellent location close to cafes and restaurants as well as the Metro and RER trains

99557,Mercure Paris Notre Dame Saint Germain des Pr s, Room was spotless but really could have done with chest drawers in the bedroom We found we had to live out of our suitcases because of this and we were there for four nights Loads of mirrors in bathroom but none in bedroom which would have been a good idea because if bathroom was occupied you could not continue getting ready , Location was perfect close to Latin quarter so really good for a set price menu meal Food was excellent and plentiful Metro close by so easy to get to all the main attractions
