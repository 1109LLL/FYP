492528,Park Hyatt Milano, Might need a tiny brush up on it s toilettry hardwares Matte blacks are getting scratched everywhere Housekeeping comes everyday but for some reason there are lints on the surfaces not sure why But I had a really good stay there Park Hyatt does it best , The decor of the hotel and their spacious rooms A beautifully decorated hotel centrally located near major attractions and shopping area 
492529,Park Hyatt Milano,No Negative, Simply said when you come to a Hyatt hotel you exepect a quality stay our trip met and exceeded all our expectations The staff is simply amazing quiet polite helpful for anything you need We came up a litlle earlier than expected and they found a room immediately for us to stay a better one than the one we booked at that Last the rooms are very large the bed was firm and cosy and last but not least bathrooms are fantastics

492532,Park Hyatt Milano, Service Everyone was so rude Despite putting a do not disturb sign in my door and after leaving for a quick errand I saw the housekeeping in the room with my bag open The maximum they did was ask the manager to speak to me , Location
492533,Park Hyatt Milano, The staff during breakfast were more worried about ensuring the buffe line was stock then welcoming and taking care of the guest the a la cart took to long, The location was excellent to bring in the new year
492534,Park Hyatt Milano,No Negative, The price compare with other 5 stars hotel in Milano is not expensive The quality of the hotel is real five stars Shopping very convenient safety and sound insulation are pretty good The most important thing is they have hot water kettle It will be my first choice when I visit Milano

492537,Park Hyatt Milano, There was a misrepresentation of the room One of the pictures of the Park Delux King room shows a balcony Which is only available in one room in the property Wouldn t have spent the extra if that was clear The standard King would have been the same , The location is brilliant Walking distance from The Duomo and all the fabulous shops The highlight was coming back to the room every night to find a little box of the most exquisite chocolate on the pillow The staff were hospitable and all amenities you can expect from a Park Hyatt where available in good quality
