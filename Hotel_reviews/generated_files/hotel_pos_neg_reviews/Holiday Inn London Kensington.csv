512690,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Our recently refurbished room had a bed which was far too big for the size of the room it was virtually impossible to walk around the bed the gap between the bed and the bathroom door was approx 3 inches And we are normal sized people Not enough staff in the hotel bar it took ages to get a drink , Restaurant staff friendly and breakfast good Bed very comfortable but unnecessarily large 
512691,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I was disappointed because I thought breakfast was included on booking com and the told it wasn t when we got to hotel the rooms was very small not told anything of where the facility s was , Not much it was a poor location for us
512692,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Poor service v late check in which ruined our first day building works on our floor and you had to get to the room via the service lift Most of all we could have lived with this if the staff on reception were a little more understanding and helpful , Location was excellent rooms comfy but small

512697,Holiday Inn London Kensington, some parts of the hotel were under renovation the elevator to our floor was dirty and not working the hotel did not even think to compensate with breakfast or drinks or smth else ,No Positive
512698,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The building work that was going on that we weren t notified of having to walk through very dusty corridors that had danger no entry written on them to get to our room it seemed we were the only ones in that part of the hotel and it was really dirty as around twenty rooms were being referbished and when I say refurbished I mean it was back to the brick walls hence the dust this was not up to standard when we were clean and ready for a night day out , The hotel itself was lovely and in a fab location staff were friendly and rooms were clean 
512699,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Nothing , Brilliant location just 100 yds or so off Kensington High St Ideal for shopping socialising and local to the tube Room was small as I would expect in central London but perfectly put together 
512700,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Everything you needed in a bathroom but too small No counter space to put any toiletries on while using , Friendly and helpful staff Issue with the bathroom fixed within 10 minutes of reporting it to reception Excellent value for money

512703,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Room was small but that s London It was perfect for my wife and I There was nothing that we didn t like This property exceeded our expectations for the price of our stay , We loved the hotel It was outstanding for the price After all the only need for the room was to cleanse and sleep We did not spend a great deal of time there It was very clean and the service was top shelf 
512704,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room was so small it was impossible for two grown adults to move around in comfortably It was more suited to a single room and bed Very uncomfortable and almost claustrophobic We were with friends and almost impossible to all squeeze in to share a drink following our night out We managed in the morning with one staying in bed until the other had finished washing and dressing we felt that it was very overcharged for the size of room On checking out I told the Receptionist how we felt and was horrified to see she was laughing I told her that I did not find it funny and if the guest was making a complaint the least she could do was acknowledge it Disgusted I said I would not recommend or stay here again , Air conditioning very efficient and the bed was comfortable so a good nights sleep the room was very clean 
512705,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Need ice machines in the halls as in the US and need little bottles of hair conditioner instead of repeat bottles of hand lotion , Bathroom was very cramped in 1 of the 2 rooms I stayed in Almost dangerously small 
512706,Holiday Inn London Kensington, You must know that there are two hotels with the same name Holiday Inn Kensington only blocks away from each other The cab drivers booking agents local people none of them will know which one you are going to You will have to get an EXACT address and keep it with you when you travel In addition the staff is large but this means some of them are less well trained than others We encountered rude staff at the pool and at breakfast , The location is wonderful You are one block from the tube and the neighborhood is posh and lovely There are shops and restaurants very close by but at the same time there is a quiet relaxed atmosphere to this part of London If you are athletic beautiful Hyde Park is nice walk away In addition this hotel has quite a large staff someone is always there to quickly respond to your issue The concierge desk in particular was excellent 
512707,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room was quite small but it met all the needs Sadly space can t be changed , The motel was very modern and the restaurant was exquisite The breakfast buffet was fabulous but the lunch and dinner menu had great choices and the food was full of flavor The bed was comfortable and the ensuite was really modern It was a beautiful place and I thought the world of them because they helped those impacted from the fire and gave accommodation to those that needed a place 
512708,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Cant say there was anything negative to write , The staff were very welcoming at the Holiday Inn Kensington and the location was fabulous for getting to the show we had booked to see The d cor of the room and Hotel in general were excellent we would definitely stay here again 
512709,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Very small room with no surface to put things on but I expected this , The staff bent over backward to meet requests and seemed to be looking out for things they could do to make everything more pleasant

512711,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Bath shower , Great location and tube station around corner Starbucks onsite in hotel so a nice bonus Good gym also Standard rooms are small but perfect for the purpose of stay 
512712,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Housekeeping did not make up our room until we put up our please make up room sign on our door This happened our first full day after we had spent most of day walking around London and needed a nap Lesson learned put the notice on the door when leaving in the a m , Great location one block from Kensington High Street station 
512713,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The worst room service food I ve ever had I haven t been to prison but I imagine it s similar to that Construction going on all day long the staff was unapologetic and not willing to move my room Tiny room Remote not functional Bedding that had been washed so many times it was pilling and felt like sandpaper , Near high street kensignton and the tube station 
512714,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Through error on booking was charged for two rooms Not refunded but given credit note then advised room rate might change when using credit note Poor quality of breakfast food Please assist Thank you Roger kyme, The size and quality
512715,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The hotel has an ongoing program of renovations underway During daylight hours there is an ongoing litany of construction sounds that otherwise interrupts one s peace which is why the facilities rating is low Without the construction noise this hotel would be highly rated The hotel overall is well appointed and once construction is finished should be highly popular , Friendly and helpful staff The hotel is very well located just off Kensington Hight Street with easy access to the Tube buses and taxis There are lots of good restaurants and shopping in the area 
512716,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The housekeeping people came into the room and threw away the bar of soap on my first day and it is such a waste No water was provided in the room , The location is quite good near High Street Kensington although it is not a major station and service can be erractic Last weekend the trains were not available on both sat and sunday Staff is friendly and helpful
512717,Holiday Inn London Kensington, No fridge in rooms sister needed to use eye drops which should be kept in fridge Tea and biscuits not refreshed each day Shame had to pay for pool , We loved comfort of beds especially the linen and pillows Staff in restaurant very nice and helpful Tube was sort walk Thankful of the air con in the hottest weekend Comfortable seating in reception very good although sofa in room could have been more comfy

512720,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room was quite compact small Difficult to move around I was asked to pay for an extra day as I booked and canceled another booking with booking com I felt ripped off , The location was nearby Public Transport They were keen in keeping the room tidy
512721,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Stayed in room 4088 over the weekend just gone and had to pass through a building site Saturday and Sunday as was not told or showed a safe route to my room Monday morning came around while leaving my room to go and check out a builder started to give out saying this was not the way go I told him I did not know another way and was pushed for time my flight home he then said something else of which I did not understand as it was not in English, The location
512722,Holiday Inn London Kensington, There was no view from our room which was possibly because we were on a two night break I was also disappointed to see a 12 5 per cent service charge for breakfast which was excellent but not exactly cheap at 17 50pp Thankfully the staff were happy to remove the extra charge , The Holiday Inn is perfectly located for a weekend in the capital We visited Kensington Palace and the Royal Albert Hall both of which are within comfortable walking distance The hotel was airy and well equipped and the bed was as comfortable as we have experienced away from home 
512723,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Prices in the bar were ridiculous Double nearby London prices There was also a booming disco beat which vibrated through the room for hours late at night Don t know where it came from ,No Positive
512724,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The double room was very small also very little storage space for clothes, Very clean and easy to travel from around London Staff were helpful and friendly
512725,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room was tiny There was no space to move around as the bed took up the whole room , Room had good air con and you could tell it had clearly been refurbished within the last year or so 
512726,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The staff are rude the rooms are too small you can t lettrly wake in the room you have to jump over the bed to get to the other side the bathroom is scary I had my niece 12 years old with me and could not leave her take a shower alone also there was a mintanince on our floor 3rd and was scary to walk through with a child with me to reach my room or to go up 2 floors then come down on the staris omg that was a nightmare but I could not change because I had harry potter tour already booked and I have limited time also when I asked the consirge about under to help me get a ride to airport he is like I am sorry this is a personal use what the He means because I am not paying 60 ponds for his driver my god he should know about the common things I can t believe it and I don t recommend it at all very very very bad , I did not like anything about it the location you can have other hotels next door much better
512727,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We were not made aware there was a 50 deposit for each night we were staying Completely unnecessary as the room was paid in advance by card and they had the details should any additional payment was required so no shopping money Had to ask at checkout when deposit is refunded not for 5 10 working days Cleaner knocking at door 8 30 every morning Lights in room were wired to all turn on with each switch so no bedside lamp for reading as all lights came on Repairs being done on 4th floor meant we were expected to go down a flight of stairs and cross the hall back up the stairs to get to our room ridiculous, Daily room clean doormen were lovely
512728,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Small rooms although that s standard in London Sink clogged No personality Fine for a business traveller Wouldn t recommend for holiday makers 30mins by tube to most major attractions,No Positive
512729,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The location of the window overlooked other windows of the hotel I could look into other rooms and other people could do the same to me, Lovely to travel and have some decent pillows for a change 
512730,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room was tiny you could only just get arround the bed There was sweet papers left in draw Only 1 tea bag each and to top it of the bath would not empty we complained to reception but it wasn t sorted out till the following day ,No Positive
512731,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I m not one to complain about Hotel Rooms I ve been in and out of them for over 3 decades but sorry I could not let this one go For a start the constant liaison with a booking I made did not stop until literally a day before my arrival Flaws in the booking system in the end booking com or Holiday Inn please advise Upon arrival room was not ready and they had the original booking on the initial standard room I had booked where I had upgraded to an executive room prior to my arrival the day before Afternoon plans were thrown out the window we waited at least 90mins until the room was ready Arrive to the room and well here we go it was a standard room with a 3rd bed squeezed in with basically no room to move Note I had paid an upgrade from a standard room 274 for 2 nights to an executive room 394 for 2 nights Already flustered about the situation i chose to take it up the next day as i was already 3 hrs behind my initial plans in London The next day I politely went down and asked for a bigger sized room as this was unacceptable They were agreeing to it and asked us to wait 5 mins We were told again will be a 1 hr wait so could we drop bags off and come back drink vouchers yet again We left and chose to come back 4hrs later Upon return yep you guessed it the room was still not ready more drink vouchers another 60mins Fast Forward That evening I invited guests whom were not staying in the Hotel Within 2 hrs we had a bill of over 150 sterling My friend covered part of the bill whilst i put the rest on my room number Apparently the room number is not accepted at the hotel and one had to have another number on the initial card i d received Fine no problem i told the barman i ll go up and get it At the same time I showed my guests out of the Hotel and I was approached abrubtly by the bar manager who basically scolded me for why i was doing a runner and why haden t i told him , Location perfectly situated
512732,Holiday Inn London Kensington, when I arrived the room this was darty the toilet garbige can was full of garbagethe previous guest that was awful because I did not trust the room would be clean , Amanda who works in housekeeping service was very kind to resolve my problem She did more than the instructions she received from the customer services desk 
512733,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Was not advised of holding fee used a debit card so I ve currently paid twice while I was for the holding fee to be released The fee should have been 50 per room but I was charged the full room rate I wasent advised of this until checkout And then had to pay again My card rejected because they were holding the money So therefore I had to pay again and so currently have paid twice until they release the money , Location very near tube Modern rooms 
512734,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Could have been informed about refurbishments, Staff friendly efficient and well trained Hotel ideal for what we wanted We should have been informed about refurbishment on 4th floor It did cause a bit of confusion at first On the whole a very pleasant stay 
512735,Holiday Inn London Kensington,No Negative, Initially checked in to a room that the housekeeping had not finished servicing and the noise from internal building renovation was not acceptable However a visit to reception solved these issues with a new room allocation

512738,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Rooms are absolute rubbish much like prison cells Small with one tiny window that doesnt really open ceiling is just over 2 meters extremely claustrophobic, Location is superb Staff is friendly and in most cases egar to help 
512739,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Small rooms breakfast too simple for the price Pricy cocktails at the hotel bad however quality is not worth the high price , Clean big hotel with many facilities and good location

512742,Holiday Inn London Kensington,No Negative, Location of the hotel is great 150m from station Starbucks inside the hotel A great place for breakfast around the corner called Muffin something however they only accepted cash at this breakfast place Great dinning restaurant Brasseriet about 400m from hotell Good area for shopping and eating 
512743,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The fridge motor was noisy so as I could not reach the plug I had to turn the thermostat down to stop the motor , The bed was very comfortable The room was clean There were lots of things to do at the hotel but we did not have time to indulge 
512744,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room size terrible no little perks you got nothing for the price no snacks included confusing to find facilities got lost walking around nothing sign posted shallow end pool far to deep wouldn t recommend to a friend , Bed was very comfortable the jacuzzi was fun
512745,Holiday Inn London Kensington,No Negative, The hotel is a modern business hotel with good facilities and well trained staff Noteabley this Holiday Inn is much better than the Kennsington Forum Holiday Inn on Cromwell Rd which in my opinion has worsened over last three years due to poor staff and I now use the Wrights Lane Holiday Inn in preference 
512746,Holiday Inn London Kensington, There was no family room when I booked online The staff said I had to upgrade the room for 50 pounds per night however the extra bed is just a folding bed small and simple Personally the room is not well worth the money , The double bed is comfortable and big Good location Near the underground bus station and supermarkets 
512747,Holiday Inn London Kensington, bed wad too hard lifts a little too small for wheelchair and companion evening meal too rich and spicy no plain food, good location for Buckingham Palace disabled room good staff very helpful breakfast good choice
512748,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Rooms at front are noisy with taxi doors slamming so ask for quiet room at back or top No fridge in the room and th wash basin sink very small and close to cupboard above the sink good luck washing your face without banging your head Ok if you are about 3 6 , Recently taken over by Holiday Inn so all new furnishings Bedroom furnishings basic but clean and neat Check in could be quicker bad luck if you hit an air crew arriving same time 
512749,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Staff looked down on us All facilities were extra charge after paying 150 for a basic room i expected to be able to swim for that price Not even enough milk in room for 2 cups of tea And i was charged extra which i had to contest Never staying with holiday inn again Very bad hotel, Bed was comfy
512750,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The price on the breakfast was way over the top as was the drinks wouldn t recommend having food there it would be cheaper to go outside, The location was good the hotel was clean and the staff were friendly 
512751,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The layout of the room we were allocated, Room was not good no space to get round the bed which caused me to have a fall and ending up with an injury to my eye

512754,Holiday Inn London Kensington, As above, I liked the location I stayed twice in the space of a couple of weeks My second room was a better size but disappointing not to have a fridge The first room was small but had a fridge

512763,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room 7044 was small you could barely get to the window for the beds The bathroom was almost useless for a woman There were two tiny little lights right above the DOOR but no light at all above the mirror which was crammed in the corner Nowhere to put your products So putting on makeup in that bathroom was impossible I also don t know if a toilet brush is standard in English bathrooms or not but there was no brush which could make it pretty tricky at times for obvious reasons if you re travelling with a companion The little fridge in the closet smelled of mold But apart from that no complaints everything else was great , Fantastic staff Comfortable beds great breakfast buffet that had absolutely EVERYTHING even vegetarian sausages for vegetarians a Starbucks cafe in the building that was open no matter how early or late we got there Plenty of power outlets everywhere in the room even separate USB outlets in the wall loved that detail Also loved that we could open the window to get some fresh air not always the case in some hotels Food in the restaurant was just perfect and at reasonable prices Working space and a nice modern environment down at the Starbucks corner on the first floor Loved everything about this hotel mostly the staff that was always extremely polite and always smiling 
512764,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room was slightly small but it was nicely decorated and done the job for what we wanted it for There was obviously work being done on the floor above us so there were very noisy builders banging very early in the morning , The bed was very comfortable and spacious Lots of room in the bed in the warm weather The room was very clean and nicely decorated and in a perfect location for the tube and the Kensington area I would definitely stay again

512766,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Struggling to find anything we didn t like More pots of milk in our room would have been nice but these were quickly provided when requested so not a problem We didn t dine in the restaurant or use room service so can t comment on that We requested and got a quiet room so hadn t expected a good view anyway , Staff made every effort to be helpful welcoming The service we received was on a par with more expensive hotels which added to our overall enjoyment of our stay 
512767,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Only issue small lifts for a Hotel of this size , Good quality Hotel in a convenient but quiet location in South Kensington Attentive Staff good facilities

512776,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Personel was not so frendly Not everyone but some of them yes I think many of the staff were new hires and they do not know too much Food taste was neutral It has a variety of food But for me low quality This is based in my own experience and comparing with other simiar hotels Sometimes I felt a kind ofr oughthnes in personel answers What I want to point here is even though the client may not be right it is still a client So there may not be place for discussion or make him feel unconfortable Some personel were very friendly but maybe inexperienced in client treating Thanks, Location
512777,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The customer service was really bad On arrival I was told I needed to pay an extra 100 on top of my bill I had enough money for the stay and I was not aware of this extra costing This left me with 40 for 2 days in London which doesn t get you very far I also had travelled from Ireland so I was left with very limited funds as a result I was then asked to pay again in on check out nearly a total of 800 which would have been the equivalent of 1 000 I refused to pay this as the money had already left my bank account and was charged to the hotel I was told that the first payment was in fact a pre authorization and I needed to pay the full amount again and the pre authorization would be released which can take 3 30 days to come back into your bank account I refused to pay as I would have been left with no money to get back to the airport or pay bills Rooms were small I booked a double bed and I was given 2 single beds Beds so small I fell out of bed 3 times Last night of stay I could hear everything in the room above me from going to the toilets and baths Construction nearby and I was woken up before 7a m I posted a review on Tripadvisor and I was told that the double payment was protocol for debit cards untrue as I have booked hotels before in UK and I never had this experience I was told I should have been grateful that so much thought and security was put into my booking I was also told it was booking com s fault for the room I got and if I had booked directly and not through booking com the experience I went through would have been avoided I was also told I was always welcome at anytime back to the hotel I will never step foot in that hotel again and I would not recommend it I also felt the way in which I was dealt with was highly unprofessional and to blame booking com and to also have stated that if I booked with the hotel directly would have averted all this is untrue Horrible experience and horrible customer service AVOID , Nothing 
512778,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The service charge upon check in is unecessary and I have never had this in any other hotel I have stayed at In terms of the room I only have minor complaints no soap in the bathroom and no where to hang coats , Great location to the royal albert hall and hyde park 
512779,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Room was very small with no room to move around Also upon Check Out staff tried to charge us 60 more even though the accommodation was fully paid for before Check In , Location good for our visit to Kensington Palace Dining very acceptable 
512780,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I booked this hotel for 3 nights in a standard room upon arrival the room was very small for the price I asked if I could have an upgrade but the hotel advised they could only do this for 40 00 a night I then tried to sleep after a 21 hour flight and was constantly woken by the fire alarm then the following morning I was woken up by works being performed on the level above drilling hammering grinding heavy foot traffic etc I called reception they could barely hear me due to the noise they didn t apologise but said they could change the room I then changed rooms and there was still noise I called reception back and they said they would be up shortly and find another room I then called back 10 minutes later I was advised that the person was on their way I then called back 10 minutes later this time I was told there was no other rooms available So I had to endure more noise and didn t hear back from anyone Then the same afternoon the fire alarm went off again On my last night the TV didn t work a maintenance person came to fix it unfortunately it couldn t be fixed I was advised a duty manager would call me and no one called In summary I didn t have a good nights sleep here I was unable to relax and there was no customer service I m extremely disappointed for a four star hour I would expect a lot more , Pool but it was a seperate cost 
512781,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Security deposit was excessive considering I paid for the stay 100 in advance, Location and facilities cant be beaten starbucks in reception and Marks and Spencers next door for those on a room only rate
512782,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Check in took 45min at 3pm no customer service had to ask 4 times if my room is ready Very disappointed in that area of service, Pillow menu was great and lots of choices to choose the perfect pillow

512784,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Having no earl grey tea bags and when I asked for some In the bar they wanted to charge me 4 for just one teabag Prices are ridiculous since it became a Holiday inn Needless to say I didn t pay 4 for a singular teabag , Very close to the show I was attending Your main front doorman wearing the long black coat and top hat is a very considerate and helpful gentleman A credit to your hotel He seems to take pride in his appearance This is appreciated 
512785,Holiday Inn London Kensington, No toilet brush in the bathroom WHY 1 00 from Poundland Get out and buy some , Beds excellent Room small but adequate Staff friendly and helpful Concierge VERY helpful and knowledgeable 
512786,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Our double room was unacceptably small We could hardly move Reparations were taking place on the floor we were living which limited the number of lifts in use which in themselves were slow Breakfast was adequate but at 15 gbp per head Per day too expensive , Near the underground
512787,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The breakfast was very poor indeed Cold and the toasters took for ever and a day to toast the bread I certainly would not recommend the breakfast to anyone and at 15 was an absolute disgrace , The room was extremely small but adequate 
512788,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We had a problem with the booking when we checked in as it was under two separate bookings for 3 nights After the second night stay they had checked us out without us knowing and our key no longer worked to get back to the room from being out all day on our last night We had to argue with reception who charged us again for 1 nights stay even though we had already preauthorised 3 nights which means my partner needs to wait upto 14 days to get nearly 300 back The staff weren t helpful on reception , We liked the layout of the hotel or bar area was lovely and relaxing and bar staff were nice We were approached and welcomed by the concierge and I liked that 
512789,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Honestly the staff were not very nice and accommodating My husband is a platinum member of Holiday Inn and not that you should treat anyone different but you would have thought this was our first time every staying with Holiday Inn Not once did they say thank you for choosing Holiday Inn all the time I have traveled with my husband many times and we stay at Holiday Inns because they treat us so well and are very accommodating Not here by any means When we checked in the lady at the desk said we have you in a snug double and I said no we have a superior room and she then proceeded to argue with me for about 5 minutes I asked her if she wanted to see my reservation and she agreed once I showed her my confirmation she then and ONLY then happen to just FIND our reservation We then needed to check out a day early and told them at check in oh boy what a nightmare They were very rude to us since we booked with booking com they would not even look into the reservation Overall I was not impressed with the hotel staff and it is a shame because the hotel was a beautiful hotel and perfect location , We really enjoyed the location of the hotel The hotel itself was very nice and had Starbucks inside of the hotel Rooms were great and if you stay with a room facing the road the views are not too bad We enjoyed lunch one day and it was very good and staff was great in the dining room Door man was very generous and helpful 
512790,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The bathroom door was broke Two out of 3 were broke In the bathroom No condictioner in bathroom All of the staff we met could not understand us they were from foreign country s so this made it very difficult to explain the room problems Nobody came to us after we complained about the room Will not stay again ,No Positive

512793,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Bathroom was dangerous You couldn t get out of the bath shower safely as the screen door was blocking the way so you had to contort yourself to get out causing slips etc Terrible bathroom Also the man who did my check out was not pleasant at all and left me with a sour feeling a bit like his manner , The outside Bellboy was lovely on arrival Car parking avail albeit 35 a day Room clean and kept that way 
512794,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I didn t like the fact that breakfast wasn t included in the price and although I was asked if I wanted to book it for 15 but if decided to turn up at breakfast the following morning I would have to pay 20 , Very comfortable friendly helpful and polite staff the porters couldn t do enough for me 
512795,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Felt the price we paid even allowing for the fact it was London the room was VERY small have stayed here before when room size was much more acceptable then Hotel was Kensington Close xx, Very good generally food excellent and very courteous and helpful staff
512796,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The concierge who denied having been given my dropped wallet and when I asked at the bar the manager said he gave it to the concierge who suddenly and miricaluosly found it It was not a good feeling as it cost me to replace at least my Oyster Card for no reason other that this guy was going to see if I persued the loss, Enjoyed the breakfast the bar and the food at the bar The room was as expected with the Holiday Express logo
512797,Holiday Inn London Kensington, See above I wondered whether it was because I had booked this through yourselves that I was allocated such an unsatisfactory room in the first instance I had to book for one more night and did this through the Holiday Inn sight before I arrived on the first night , Unfortunately the room I was allocated on arrival was not particularly well appointed without adequate worktop in shower room It also had a plumbing problem and when I returned in the evening there was a bad smell in the room and some backflow in the toilet Maintenance was called and there was improvement that evening but I complained to the manager in the morning and was allocated a superior room on the first floor for the rest of the stay The staff were very helpful and what you would expect from the Holiday Inn 
512798,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Restaurant food Very poor selection and poor preparation of a selected choice And the fact that 12 5 was added to everything including bar items The 90 00 deposit we had to pay just in case we used room service or other extras was also a surprise I m still waiting for it to be repaid which could have been done on the day of departure Sorry and sad to see such money making scams It cannot be justified , Staff and cleanliness
512799,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Although we received an upgrade the room had a double bed as opposed to twin beds, Received an upgrade when booking in for no extra charge Very large room Hotel easily accessible by tube from London City airport

512804,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The restaurant room service was not up to the standard for me on that night I was very disappointed that the lettus was old leaves They forgot to include the piece of bread The business center was great Staff were overall friendly Price variation for the room was also annoying , tI had a great experience My room could fly for a single room and not double to give more space Great location clean diverse facilities and of course excellent location I will recommend 
512805,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Renovations are happening at this hotel The noise was appalling had to request to be moved And they try to pass it off as routine maintenance Rooms serviced at 4pm Every day Reception staff rude and extremely unhelpful Key cards need to be changed constantly as they stopped working for no apparent reason Server in coffee shop rude All in all the most appalling hotel we have stayed in , Absolutely nothing appalling hotel
512806,Holiday Inn London Kensington, They take 100 out of your account on arrival and pay back 7 days later but there is nothing on the booking to state this, Everything was lovely and worth it very close to tube station and easy to get about
512807,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room was very small and not a lot of space between the bed and the bathroom , The bed was very comfy and it was in a very convenient place and the Staff was very helpful and we were very grateful that when checking out they were able to look after our baggage whilst still continuing our visit around London

512811,Holiday Inn London Kensington, When I arrived I was asked for a 50 deposit per night 2 nights to be deducted for my card in case of damages to room etc No problem gave my card told I would like to pay full rate when checking out in cash Discovered later the entire enough plus deposit do 451 had been taken from my bank account This hadn t been explained to me I was told it was just the 50 per night Fine for me as I had travelled with cash but be aware if you haven t cash and wish to spend from bank account or have outgoing standing orders due that this money is not released back until after you check out and can take a few days Only downside that didn t affect me really as I had cash but as I said be aware of it Would have liked if this had been explained clearer , Beautiful modern hotel with excellent location and facilities Staff very helpful Allowed us to check in 3 hours early when we went to drop our bags so we could go sightseeing 
512812,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The only complaint is the extremely dim lighting in the sauna and steam bath and the hot tub is both in need of replacing and the time it spends with jets and bubbles activated needs to be increased as it feels like it s only on for 30 seconds , Comfy bed lovely staff and a great spa which was ideal as I was in London to run the marathon The staff were helpful and attentive and the standard of cleanliness and upkeep was generally very high The room key activated lifts also made me feel very secure

512819,Holiday Inn London Kensington, There was nothing I didn t like the staff were friendly and very helpful answering all of our queries about where to visit transport and shopping etc , When we booked in they didn t have any twin rooms left so to my surprise they sent up the hotel staff to separate the king size bed and remake them into two singles for our comfort at absolutely no extra charge Again we ordered room service after having had a long journey and it was delivered in less than a half hour hot and delicious The bed was ultra clean and comfortable and after our previous experience this was absolute heaven 
512820,Holiday Inn London Kensington, 50 refundable deposit per night Didn t think this was necessary as any extras can easily be paid for at departure No toiletries in ensuite bathrooms so make sure to bring the basics of shower gel soap shampoo etc Although bar area very inviting was very very expensive , The staff were very attentive beautiful relaxing bar and seating area Room was fine for our stay we were not in it very long Excellent pillows a combination of hard or soft to cater for all needs mounted flat screen tv and chaise lounge so ample room to relax

512835,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The space between the end of the bed and the TV wall was a tad narrow you had to move sideways and duck under the TV slightly to get past , Check in check out was straightforward enough the trainee who dealt with us was being monitored which was reassuring The massive king size bed wow so much space The room and its facilities have been refurbished and updated Everything was spotless clean tidy and working 
512836,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room was shockingly small for a twin bedded room I was meeting my friend there for a three day stay and I have more bruises on my legs because there was no room to get around the bottom of the bed to use facilities This is a single room with twin beds pushed in The bathroom was appauling You could not stretch over to turn on the water to fill the bath because it was such a tight squeeze Pathetic toiletries on offer and the TV was crap no sky no decent programmes I use to stay here regular when it was the Kensington Close Hotel with no complaints at all I will not be staying again , Nothing
512837,Holiday Inn London Kensington, It was my girlfriends birthday and we was treated very bad first thing in reception the cetain staff was very disrespectful and sarcastic Alot of trouble getting into the room because key wouldnt work Then also had a problem with toilet door as it was not closing as it should ,No Positive

512840,Holiday Inn London Kensington, There was some loud building noise above my room where I thought they must be carrying out repairs refurbishments This was only on Friday the day I arrived and stopped around 6ish I had no view as it was back of hotel but that was ok I thought the price was high for just a bed with breakfast as extra But I accepted that it was a late booking and didn t have much choice However everything was good , My room was like brand new and very comfortable bed Had everything I needed Loved it 
512841,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room was rediclusly small and the wifi even thought its free its so slow that you will end up buying wofo from the hotel, Very convenient close to the station
512842,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Bad hotel bad service They gave me a smaller room different than what I had reserved from booking I came twice to the room at night where there was no electricity no slippers or anything like that in the room And as I was sleeping in the room the housekeeping had entered the room without saying sorry she wanted to take the towels and the garbage even though I told her that I was sleeping she still asked when can I come I told her I don t know She even forgot the cleaning supplies in the room Eventually they changed our room But overall it wasn t a pleasant experience , Nothing

512844,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The staff are terribly trained We had a head of staff walk into our room without announcing housekeeping just to check if our room was made which was odd Wifi is weak Management is poorly trained or have little to no hospitality experience Shame really Kensington Close was far better Room rates too high for rooms without breakfast Paying so much should grant complimentary breakfast One member of staff tried to stop my mother from having her coffee outside the hotel entrance because she wasn t using the hotel mug plain and unbranded but her own personal unbranded mug , The beds are super comfortable The breakfast is great but has a lot less options than when it was still called Kensington Close Some of the helpers are very kind and jump at any opportunity to help with anything We appreciated that and we appreciated witnessing this happen for other guests too

512853,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Having to pay for the swimming pool this should be free to hotel guests especially as the pool is also used for children s swimming lessons which restricts the amount of space in the pool The pictures of the pool and jacuzzi on the website are very deceiving and make them look a lot bigger than they are Also the jacuzzi is not very warm , Staff are very friendly and helpful particularly the concierge men at the door who helped with bags and taxi s The hotel is very clean and the beds are a good size and very comfortable 
512854,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Renovations in the room next door were noisy and we weren t pre warned As a result we got free breakfast and there was a lot of choice but some elements were of a very poor standard Had we paid 15pp I would ve asked for a refund Watered down tea coffee hot buffet items poor quality and or not cooked properly The tea in the hotel cafe Starbucks was atrocious I ve never had such weak watered down tea in my life this was with teabags left in for a good 5 mins , Staff were courteous and friendly Great location with easy access to the tube Room was well maintained and comfortable 
512855,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Our door was knocked at 8am on the day of our departure which i was not happy about as we wanted to sleep longer 30 minutes later after we had fallen asleep again the door was knocked again by the cleaners I phoned to reception to check what time check out was and was told 11am The bar was a good size but way to expensive even for London 2 classes of wine was 25 and they had the cheek to charge a further 12 service charge even though I bought it at the bar myself , The location was good just a 2 minute walk from the train station The guy on the front door helping with luggage was great and gave us some good advise The beds where comfortable and the rooms where a good size with coffee and biscuits

512864,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The property is served by two elevators However throughout our stay one of the elevators was out of order causing difficulties to those carrying luggages or with walking difficulties In my opinion such facilities should be seen to without delay , The hotel is very well served by an excellent restaurant and bar Both are well run The restaurant has a very decent menu and the prices are very reasonable 
512865,Holiday Inn London Kensington, the customer service of the staff their timely fashion management was really poor and no communication between staff and management they took 2 and a half hours to move us from the first room as we didn t have a bath but i have made a request as my friend i was travelling has to have a bath due to an accident when younger They then said for the inconvenience they will give us some amenities and these never turned up for 3 hours they then gave us a plate of fruit and i miniature bottle of red wine by this point my friend and i were so tired and couldn t be bothered to argue anymore and went to sleep we then got woken up in the morning due the 5th floor where we were staying had not be finished and the builders were shouting at each other and making lots of noise at this point we were ready to leave No member of staff seemed willing to help us so we just left , the breakfast and the spa area

512872,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Reception seemed grumpy and stressed on arrival It was not made at all clear prior to booking that there was a 10 charge for the swimming pool per person For a four star hotel two teabags and two coffees in the room is poor and more tea selection would be expected Breakfast staff were awful My partner fell ill with flu on the night of arrival and when I asked the restaurant staff if I could take him up a glass of juice and pastry she said I was not allowed and if he wanted to eat I would have to pay for room service My partner has recently had a liver transplant and this illness was stressful her attitude and lack of sympathy only added to my stress We ended up checking out early to rush my partner back to the home All in all not a great stay and I left feeling the hotel just wanted to make a extra profit wherever they could, The room was very clean and tidy 
512873,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The fire alarm at 0600 Not sure we believed the hotel that it was caused by a guest smoking because people might have wanted a refund if the hotel had to admit blame , Fantastic service from smiley staff from all around Europe and the world We must keep this valuable workforce

512876,Holiday Inn London Kensington, 15 minute queue at reception due to computer systems dying so I couldn t check in for a while Room was absolutely tiny Had to shuffle around the bed It was a good job my friend didn t come in the end Also I didn t like the mandatory 50 payment they took at reception from my card for incidental expenses I wasn t planning to spend ANY extra money during the one night s stay which if I did anyway I could have settled upon check out This wasn t any ordinary holding or just card authorisation because I was advised it would be REFUNDED in 7 14 days time I challenged it and was told if I didn t like it I could fill in a comments card Booked this hotel because I wanted to use the pool But when I found out it was an extra 10 I didn t use it Really it should be included in the cost free for guests These issues have put me off staying here or with this hotel group again , Reasonably positioned for central London 12 pm check out

512927,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I made a special request for a room on a low floor for medical reasons and asked the person on reservations if this could be guaranteed to let me know in advance When I arrived the room was on the 3rd floor and after about an hour wait I eventually got one on the 2nd floor I asked to speak to the duty manager and he said I could move to first floor the next day but no apology for the inconvenience and made a few useless comments like when I said I met the housekeeper and asked if there was free rooms on the first floor and she yes This manager told me SHE would have no idea what rooms were available on any floor make sense NO Another point is the food the same menu is now used in restaurant bar and room service and it is a very limited menu and as a vegetarian I found it not cater at all and for the quality of the food it is not cheap I stayed there several times when it was just Kensington Close Hotel and never had any complaints but now that it s owned by the group Holiday Inn I would have my doubts about booking there again which for me is a pity as I like the area very much and find it easy to see the sights etc from there A small point the tissue box had about 2 tissues when we checked in which we used straight away the empty box was not replaced even though I took the box out of the silver container so housekeeping would know to replace but no stayed 3 nights and this not replaced The standard rooms are quiet small and the bathrooms even smaller but having stayed previously we knew this and not a problem To finish Holiday Inn please note clients special requests and even though these cannot be quaranteed it would be good if they were at least read by reservations and make contact if needs be For me the fact this important request was overlooked ruined the leisure break I was looking for, Location
512928,Holiday Inn London Kensington,No Negative, We couldn t figure out how the air conditioner worked so we frozed 2 days and night then we figured it out Otherwise nice hotel Good restaurant Nice people at concierge desk 
512929,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The extras were expensive I personally took my friend to the bar for a drink and paid 20 for two drinks put me off having anymore We went out to find a pub later that evening, The rooms were really comfortable and quiet The staff are really friendly and helpful The breakfast has a really good selection to choose from 
512930,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Thought the room was small No bath It was cold also We went out for the day came back to a very cold room, Location was good hotel was clean staff friendly
512931,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Tiny room considering we paid 125 for one night Staff didn t ask how our stay was Staff were unfriendly and when there was a broken lampshade in the room asked why we didn t mention it before We had only been there for one night Bed mattress was uncomfortable and had no sleep Terrible value for money even in London, Foyer looked nice Starbucks 24 hours on premises
512932,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The cleaners don t stop knocking on your door and waking you up and isn t nice when you have busy day ahead of you in London , Such a beautiful lay out for holiday inn
512933,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room was extremely small as was the bathroom and there was lots of building work going on outside and inside the building We were there for a conference and had breakfast which was buffet style and felt it had been out a fair while and overpriced We also had lunch which was not great either The food was very average , The hotel staff were extremely helpful
512934,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Wish i could of had a discount for parking 35 pounds daily is to expensive Pool had a seperate charge should have been included , Excellent location off high street in kensington staff very helpful stayed one night 
512935,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Room was very small with an awkward layout Couldn t manage to heat the room up and was pretty cold but these were minor issues , Very friendly attentive and helpful staff in every area of the hotel The room decor was lovely and beds very comfortable Gym was fantastic with great equipment Loved the Starbucks concession within the hotel lobby Fantastic location 2 minute walk to Kensington High Street for shopping and the tube station buses etc I arrived much earlier than the check in time but the hotel were able to allocate me a room earlier and I was offered a late check out 
512936,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The loud drilling noise , Bedroom too small Drilling noise for most off the night Staff were stuck up and looked at each other like dirt As standing at the reception desk one of the heaters blew up Location ok but as there are three holiday inns within the area maybe be a little clearer on which is which 
512937,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Wasn t told that the use of the pool wouldn t be included in our stay and 20 for a day for two people whom are residnents at the hotel is rather expensive staff weren t very informative of that either and the man I spoke to was rather rude also the room stated it would have a bath which it didn t and that was rather disappointing I guess my stay was average I ve certainly recieved better service and no complimentary gift alocohol was given on my birthday,No Positive
512938,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The elevator broke down more often than not empty fridge in room but requested to pay 100 00 just in case we used the minibar which of course was empty only to later on discover only the executive rooms do have minibars Room s key failed to work Wifi worked only in reception area lack of communication in between room service and restaurant , Breakfast buffet display fresh and tasty very good 
512939,Holiday Inn London Kensington, First the hotel tried to take payment almost a week prior to the check in date Not an issue but a prior notice would have been nice Then there is a security deposit of 50 per room per night So almost 500 were reserved on my account for no good reason some other hotels would reserve a small security deposit but never as much as 50 per night The first rooms we got were still decorated in the Kensington Close Hotel style and there was refurbishment going on literally in the rooms on the opposite side of the corridor The bathroom was tiny I m not the thinnest person around but certainly not the largest and I found it difficult to use the facilities In one of the two rooms the safe was not working Half way though the stay we were asked to vacate the rooms and move to different ones on a different floor The new rooms were a bit better and decorated in the Holiday Inn style Neither of the two new rooms had a DND The shower was better but the shower door was poorly designed a piece of glass roughly half the size of the shower and as a result when taking the shower a lot of the water went on the floor combined with a poor ventilation the air in the room was pretty wet The beds in the new rooms were worse than the beds in the old rooms not terrible just worse Finally the TV is located on the wall to the side of the bed making it difficult to watch comfortably Overall it s not a terrible hotel but as much as I wanted to like it I just could not , The location is great friendly staff a working air con heater unit 
512940,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Room really too small We had business at Olympia and an awards dinner in the evening ironing dressing up was constricted difficult Maintenance work in room above with loud drilling and banging in the late afternoon early evening didn t help either , Location ideal for our requirements Front desk staff very helpful and sympathetic to our complaint about smallness of room and maintenance work in room above with loud drilling and banging in the late afternoon early evening 
512941,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We didn t appreciate the fact that there was a little work going on at the hotel during our stay resulting in knocking and banging every morning, Lovely staff and hotel and very central which was excellent for getting around London very reasonable price too 
512942,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Noises caused by re modelling work during the day and even on Saturday Long waiting after 4 pm to get room Small room Need extra payment to use the swimming pool Could have chosen other hotels without a pool , Newly refurbished rooms Clean Friendly staff 
512943,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We only stayed 1 night so didn t find anything I didn t like, The location was perfect and the staff at the hotel very welcoming and accommodating 
512944,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We were left without toilet paper for the last night after 2ce asking for the room to be cleaned Day before that that maid took our key card I have rynards so can t deal with cold so left the card in so the heating was on came back to a cold room and no key card Staff were rude an unhelpful especially the bar staff we stay at hotels a lot and this was by far the worse Never will stay there again , I loved the massage we had and the location 
512945,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Having to pay for the pool when it is already part of the hotel that your staying in is ridiculous not that I mind paying but 10 per person every time you would like to use it is a bit much And then you can only use half the pool because there is swimming lessons going on and then they decide to close the jacuzzi after we waited for 2 hours to use it Food is way overpriced as is the alcohol 8 for a small glass of wine restaurants we had been in in London didn t even charge that Asked hotel could we borrow an umbrella as the rain was heavy on that day and there was also a charge for that of 6 , The location was great 2 minutes walk to the station Staff were helpful if you need anything room was cleaned everyday and clean towels couldn t ask for better 
512946,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Two small pot of milk to share for two people to have tea coffee breakfast increased from 12 now holiday inns price 20 that s holiday inn for you , Location is ideal Outstanding breakfast at Bills near the tube 
512947,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We chose this hotel due to the spa what we were not told was that it s a gym open to the public including children and on the day we hoped to use the pool it was being used for children s swimming lessons This meant that it was very noisy so couldn t use the facilities to relax but even if we could have both the steam room and jacuzzi were not in service There were also no appointment spaces for any treatments so essentially our plan for a spa day and the very reason for choosing his hotel was a complete waste of time , Good selection for breakfast and very fresh The bed was also comfortable however the room was very small 
512948,Holiday Inn London Kensington, charged 10 to go in the spa even though they had swimming lessons in the pool I ve never been charged to use the pool at a hotel in my life it wasn t as if it was anything other than a basic pool sauna and steam room shower had mold in it and ceiling paint was very badly peeling and flaking off not a proper door on the bathroom plumbing was very noisy you could really hear toilets being flushed and water going down the drain was very strange, nice pillows nice bar communal areas nice close to station 
512949,Holiday Inn London Kensington, same breakfast all 7 days should be some change daily and variety also meat only in the form of pork can switch between pork and beef chicken between days ,No Positive
512950,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Check in is 3pm but rooms weren t ready After long flight that s not what you need Check in area was a bit chaotic as you had to first queue to check in then re join the queue to get your key eventually at 3 30pm Rather pricey breakfast 13 50 for continental breakfast and 17 50 for full English Maid came in at 8 30 am after knocking on door and saying something couldn t speak English well didn t know what she wanted and was still in bed She then let herself in Apologised quickly enough Must have learned the word sorry from previous experiences I d gone out and my wife hadn t re chained the door which would have resolved the issue Room had a little window they d pinched some of the space to create an en suite for the next bedroom methinks Stuffy and gloomy not much natural light Hairdryer poor quality , Handy for the underground and looks very clean 
512951,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Square toilet seats Who on earth thinks a square toilet seat is good design or comfortable The heating not working in the room on the first night and being given 2 oil heaters Broken ironing board Also the place it quite bland lack of decoration on the walls could be confused with an institution ,No Positive
512952,Holiday Inn London Kensington,No Negative, Staff were so helpful Tried to upgrade us but unfortunately could not but was very helpful in organising complimentary breakfast for us and sending up complimentary fruit for us to the room as well as complimentary drinks and spa access So helpful and polite Great staff and service Would defo come back
512953,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Room given was horrid and cold was moved to another room which was better but the tv did not work I was told maintenance would come up but noone came , Room was clean location was good
512954,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Bathroom was chilly and no bottom to shower screen so water flooded floor had to use our towels to mop it up Room was on the small side my husband had to climb over me to get in and out of bed as bed wedged against window , Really comfy beds and pillows slept so well Nice quiet spot 
512955,Holiday Inn London Kensington, was looking forward to using the pool but reception told me it was 10pounds a day to use i was shocked and thought this was excessive amount to pay on top heating in the room not the best issues with it fire alarm went off near midnight alarm constant but no staff checking to see if we all evacuated only looking out window to see crowds congregating did we make it down and no official word just when everyone else starting going back in we did no explanation and no apology wifi codes change every few days but they didn t tell us this very frustrating, staff greeting and assistance to get suitcases up 4 stairs to get to reception
512956,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We wanted to use the swimming pool but we were put off by the extra charge The entry fee mentioned on booking com was different than the one at the hotel , The beds were very confortable Not much noise coming from outside so we had a very good night sleep 
512957,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Chose hotel due to its swimming pool Disappointed that its use wasnt included in price of stay and that this wasnt highlighted in the hotel details before booking , Very close to tube and lovely part of town Good quality facilities and friendly staff 
512958,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I did find a hair in the bathroom on day one and two but I was OK However if I was with my wife it might have been another story Also the already mentioned narrow entrance prohibited use of full mirror , Had everything needed for comfortable stay However getting in the room was narrow as a fridge was in the way and there was little room for the desk chair 
512959,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Breakfast was good there was a good selection of food but was way overpriced Part of the reason we booked here was for the pool and spa we didn t realise it would cost 10 per person per day to use it Safe to say we didn t use it , Bed was comfortable and staff helpful Great location not far from Kensington gardens and Portobello Rd Only short walk to tube station as well 
512960,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I have stayed at this hotel a few times when it was the Kensington Hotel and spa and I loved it that s why I returned The Holiday Inn has taken it over and it has gone down hill dramatically in the Service and staff area We were greeted at the front door on arrival by a very grumpy man instead of the Jolly Londoner that was there previously The staff were cold and quite difficult to speak to at times except the gentleman who processed our check out he was friendly On the whole the staff were miserable and very cold not like the welcoming smiling faces you expect in a hotel There were at least 3 different people having problems that we saw during our stay and the manager was VERY rude to one lady I was shocked in the decline of staff and service I will not return here but spend my hard earned money elsewhere , The location of the hotel is excellent 
512961,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Taken by taxi to wrong holiday inn in Kensington and told by reception that this is a regular mistake needs a clearer name distinction between the two hotels photo was of the wrong Hilton so I did not hesitate to get out and let the taxi leave us there,No Positive

512963,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Tiny room 10 charge each time to use swimming pool or gym dirty bathroom tea not replenished in room poor service when ordering dinner fire alarm going off late at night and having to stand in the lobby, Convenience to town 
512964,Holiday Inn London Kensington, It was honestly the smallest room I have ever stayed in at a branded hotel unfortunately Also I was slightly uncomfortable about the 50 00 room deposit system understandably they have to take precautions to avoid costs but I was made to feel untrustworthy the minute I checked in I suppose this is the result of some messy past guests , Location was a stone s throw from Kensington high street the reception and lounge areas were well designed and the spa was pleasant with cheerful staff 
512965,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I didn t like the breakfast Should have more variety for people who don t eat Pork Spa should ve been free I have never paid for spa facilities before only treatments , I liked the room and the facilities of the spa Wifi was good and the room was clean and warm 
512966,Holiday Inn London Kensington, There was a fire alarm that went off late one evening It would have been nice if they explained what happened even just at checkout the next morning , The location is almost directly behind high street Kensington tube station Amazing Room service food was delicious and all the amenities in the room were very nice 
512967,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Staff were great however you always felt is if you had to leave a tip example Taking bags up to the room Getting you a seat for breakfast opening the door for you to leave We gave tips a thought we might have to but most people are after a tip for doing there job Great staff though , The 5 quality of the hotel facilities and the staff Fantastic staff and the leisure facilities on offer were second to non Wish we stayed longer Amazing location in a quite up market area in Kensington Great bus a tube links Lots of restaurant and pubs near by and a big high street with plenty of shops You don t even have to go into oxford street Harrods is also a 5 minute bus ride away Will stay again 
512968,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room really was too small even for London It was well put together but like being on a tiny boat Ok for one person one night but frankly very cheeky to call it a room ,No Positive
512969,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We were given a room that had the air conditioning unit for the hotel outside the window All you could from the window was the unit The noise was horrendous all night It sounded like there was a plane outside the window ,No Positive
512970,Holiday Inn London Kensington, unfortunality on christmastime there was a Irland group clients very bad behavier and very disturbing impossible to be in the bar aerea, I really like the hotel easy to reach confortable and helpfull staff
512971,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Everything very much acceptable However annoying that they only accept cash as a deposit for adaptors and such stuff down in the concierge they already have a hold on your credit card and who carries cash anyway today ,No Positive
512972,Holiday Inn London Kensington, There were many construction work going on during my stay which made some kind of dis comfort In addition I was given deluxe suite but it was located near to the elevator which made load noise Also the quality of the provided food serves was away below the expectations In addition a wrong dishes was provided to me , Location was perfect 
512973,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The only thing I didn t like was being woken up by a cleaner knocking g on our room door twice on the morning of departure and it was early and you had u til 12 to depart I didn t think that was very good We were out by 11 30 anyway , I came with my 18 year old son for a shopping a bit of sightseeing we loved everything hotel was amazing best we have ever stayed in and will be returning hopefully soon 
512974,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Requested a refund for the 21 50 pounds paid for dinner menu very poor but the manager was very reluctant for this to happen so phoned Bookings com then she gave me the refund on you answering We then had to go out of the hotel to find dinner Asked concierge 3 times for green tea 3 times normal tea arrived in the room On the 3rd time concierge person who spoke good English said oh we don t do green tea I can not believe this to be the case in a 4 star hotel We were awoken at 8am with room service knock even though we did not request it We were asked to pay an additional 10 pounds to use the pool This was not asked in the initial booking We did not go in as there were children s swimming lessons taking place and therefore not a relaxing place to sit ,No Positive
512975,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I ve not had a hot breakfast any of the 5 times I ve been with you there is a sign warning of hot plates but they are always far from hot and the sausages Bacon are never more than warm ,No Positive
512976,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I was not able to setup the proper temperature of heater air conditioner So it was too hot or too cool nothing in the middle , Very helpfull and polite staff Comfortable bed
512977,Holiday Inn London Kensington,No Negative, Room was very small but bed was comfortable Bathroom was tiny and awkward Staff were wonderful We stayed there over Christmas and they had an issue with some guests This resulted in the bar being closed and service being very slow Took 45 minutes to get a drink at one stage They were however apologetic and gave us the drinks for free 
512978,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The in room wifi on floor 6 was very unreliable We had to go to lower floors or the lobby to obtain a good signal Also very small bathroom would have been much nicer if just a bit bigger , Light spacious open plan interior seamless access lobby to restaurant The pool Comfortable sleep gorgeous soft bed Good size room more like a mini suite Faultless absolutely knockout service I rarely complete these type of surveys but the experience in this case was exceptional
512979,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The pool was small and we very surprised to hear that we had to pay extra 10 pounds per person to get in It was not included , The location was very good only a 3 min walk from the underground station and the hotel easy to spot Short underground ride from the center of London Good shops and restaurants within a walking distance Best of all was the bed in the room it was VERY comfortable and the whole family slept very well 
512980,Holiday Inn London Kensington, larger bed would be better showering in a bath is not that comfortable girl at breakfast check in did not understand English very well she failed to help me, Close to the underground station
512981,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Paid for an exclusive club room Shocking Room was an hour late pubic hair in the bath and on the towels room was tiny compared to the pictures A lot of false advertisement oh and I booked quite a few months in advance but when we got there we only then found out it had been taken over by a holiday inn Would not stay there again Not worth the price I paid Could have stayed in a 5 hotel down the road for that price , The location was great only a few mins walk from Kensington high street station
512982,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Having booked for 2 nights on arrival was hit with 10 charge each day for use of pool sauna When I questioned this the staff were not very helpful Take it Or leave it attitude Very good hotel except for this which put a dampener on the stay When I booked it appeared all facility s were included Very misleading advertising , Location cleanliness was good 
512983,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We booked a twin bed room online weeks before and agreed this with the receptionist Our room keys didn t unlock the door so we had to go for help When we eventually got into the room it was a double bed We had to use a mobile phone to call the reception to query the bed as the phone in the room did not work No one called us back although we gave the mobile number so we had to call again to be told someone was on their way After 30 minutes of waiting someone came to give us keys for another room which did have twin beds but was not as nicely appointed or as clean as the double room A poor start to our otherwise good stay in the hotel , Decent hotel in an excellent location very friendly staff Comfortable bed with nice linen Good recently refurbished bathroom 
512984,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Just under new management and staff were a little lost when it came to checking in out We were allocated the wrong room initially but it was resolved fairly swiftly , Great location easy access to central London Plus it offers parking underneath the hotel 
512985,Holiday Inn London Kensington, It was further than we had ever stayed out of greater London but it s right near kensington high street tube station so if you can juggle the logistics of commuting cross tube then it s fine But do your planning of how to get from a to b before you go if your staying around here , Beautiful hotel a complete barging for what we paid 100per person per night 
512986,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Additional charges to use the spa facilities Rebranded as holiday Inn between booking and stay No notification of this made it a little confusing on arrival This also made it look like I had booked a cheap deal for my husbands surprise 30th birthday weekend away it was quite upsetting when I had intentionally not booked a holiday inn travel lodge ibis etc , The Super kingsize bed was very comfortable Also the staff we encountered were all very friendly and helpful The hotel is very close to High Street Kensington tube station 
512987,Holiday Inn London Kensington, First of all the hotel charges us TWO times for the hotel Currently trying to get our money back the bed was really uncomfortable and felt really old and the lighting in the bathroom was really poor Will probably not visit this hotel again , The staff was nice and helpful during our stay it was fairly close to the underground and it was easy to get a taxi from outside the hotel The food in the hotel s restaurant was good The breakfast was decent The restaurant and the lounge area was modern and up to date 
512988,Holiday Inn London Kensington, NOTHING this was my second stay at the hotel and i will be coming back , The breakfast is amazing and the wifi was super fast the staff is amazing and the room were so clean 
512989,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Bathroom seemed a little small considering the fact it was an executive room A bath would ave been nice A few of the lifts seemed to be either to of service or took a very longtime to reach us however we were on the eighth floor , Comfortable bed Very good location Room service was good and delivered quickly We left our luggage with the concierge both ends of our stay and our belongings were felt with well many facilities to take advantage of 
512990,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The cleanliness in the rooms The cups for coffee stayed unchanged and dirty after they have been used for 3 days , The location was very attractive and convenient 
512991,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Nothing everything was perfect , Great value for money great Location clean friendly helpful staff The hotel got my booking wrong gave me a room with a double bed when i asked for a twin room when downstairs and the receptionist was most helpful swapped my room in no time or problem even asked me if i wanted my bags taking as they was still in the room can t fault anything 
512992,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Toilet location bit cramped in bathroom very narrow Shoulders were practically on the walls either side when sat on the loo , Close to tube friendly staff and very comfy bed 
512993,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The bedroom doors shut with a large bang they could do with soft closing signs around every floor would be good to keep people from chatting heading to the lifts late on some people just have no thought for other quests , The executive club room was a treat we normally book the standard and this time the offer was good so we booked 8th time to stay at hotel cant wait to return 
512994,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Room service knocked us up early to clean our rooms which given it was New Years Day was not well thought out , We were given an upgrade room was excellent Clean and bed was pardon the pun a dream 
512995,Holiday Inn London Kensington, My shower stopped working twice When I got there it was dirty I got woke up three times but people knocking on my door had a phone call at 6 o clock in the morning Them for them to turn round and say sorry wrong room, The location Was good And the w welcoming stuff
512996,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Booked an Executive Club Superior Double room which was a little smaller than expected and had no water biscuits as advertised, Location Excellent staff who are very helpful
512997,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Someone was able to let themselves into my room thankfully the catch was on TV kept resetting so I couldn t watch it Key card didn t work in the morning after breakfast Also staff didn t seem to understand me when I reported problems , Good breakfast
512998,Holiday Inn London Kensington, On about 3 different occasions given incorrect information in regards to are stay also staff were not welcoming only pleasent greeting was from the door man Also got locked in the bathroom because the lock in our room was broken , Spa was clean
512999,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Not cleaning properly sheet not changed for 5days during my 10days stay I have to tell them to do it Also the room wasn t service almost all day I called then despite that they clean 8pm at night till my returning and towels not placed not Hoovered not topped up tissues and not placed toilet paper Trolley with dirty towels was sitting not he coroner all day and night and some broken fridge not been removed whole weekend , Location
513000,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Sent email twice before my arrival asking to arrange rooms as close to each other as possible Rooms were accommodated miles away on the same floor though Repair works every morning starting at 8am above our Standard twin room level with unbearable noise But since we were out whole day from 9 to 7 I did not ask to change it Overall quality of Standard Twin was way below 4 it felt like you were in different hotel Paying extra for health facilities was inconvenient , Stayed at Executive Double and Standard Twin rooms with family Executive one was newly refurbished and great I would recommend it to anyone without reservation Great location nice breakfast and lobby comfortable beds cleanliness and a good value for money overall Reception staff was nice and helpful 
513001,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Changed over to holiday inn whilst we stayed there meaning lorry deliveries and a busy stressful atmosphere Our room was also very cold particularly the bathroom and we also couldn t not keep our clothes in the wardrobe as this was FREEZING ,No Positive
513002,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Furniture in room a little tatty Door man was a snob verging on rude I had phoned ahead and booked a parking place in the hotels car park on arrival I approached the doorman as instructed he took one look our car it was clearly not up to his usual standard and said in a very condescending manner you do realise that you have to pay for parking Then told me to wait we needed him to show us where to go to park whilst he dealt with someone else who arrived after us We were ignored by him for a good few minutes I m sure if we looked wealthier we would not have been treated in this way , Great location Gluten and dairy free options for breakfast 
513003,Holiday Inn London Kensington, There were renovations going on within the hotel which could be heard in our room We were advised our cases would be moved to another room whilst we were out during the day This didn t happen and had to wait for our cases to be moved and for the room to be changed from a double to a twin when we got back in the evening The standard double room is small , Liked that the hotel is close to the underground station 
513004,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I never thought I de be saying this because I had very high expectations about this hotel it is just 150 metres away from the underground station the neighborhood is quiet and lovely and the hotel looks really AMAZING on the inside yet the service is terrible It seems more one of a cheap hostel rather than one of a four stars hotel Here s why One day I asked the receptionist if it was possible to heat a pizza in the microwave of the kitchen He said it was not a problem and so I went out got a pizza and came back at the hotel There one of his colleagues they do not provide that kind of service and so I had to literally throw the pizza in the rubbish and it was 11 00 pm back then so it was all closed and I was STARVING so I had to wait for the very next day to eat something The air conditioning in my room made a terrible noise I don t know if it was broken or something and it was impossible to sleep Every night I had to turn on the tv to cover that annoying noise and fall asleep The next day I was in a rush and I needed one more toilet paper and a toothbrush so I went down at the reception asked for it and it took them 40 minutes to bring me wait for it only the toilet paper I had to wait 15 minutes more for a simple toothbrush How crazy Moving the bed for picking up an earring that accidentally fell on the floor I found two hair pins which where obviously not mine The room wasn t clean enough Last but not least on the day of my check out at about 10 00 am more or less I was making my luggages and the waitress roughly got into my room using her pass WITHOUT EVEN KNOCKING ON THE DOOR FIRST What I mean W H A T What if I was getting dressed or just anything else I was with my mom that morning and she was furious UNACCEPTABLE ,No Positive
513005,Holiday Inn London Kensington, If you want to have a very bad hotel experience in London stay at this one They asked us to stay at danger zone at first night There was construction on our floor It was not even easy to find the room Then on the second day they promised to change our room which was kind But the staff was not wise enough to find a room with two single beds After all problems at first night we were again asked to wait another 20 mins for the staff to find another room So if you want to have problems at your stay here you go , The location was good 
513006,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Staff are not well trained at least to realise that is their hote is 4 They have put me in a room and next day at 7 morning there was a work and noise of drilling next to my room I could not sleep went to the receptionist and told them they did not even say sorry and told me we will change you to different room them they change me to another room which was so small compared to what I pay for superior room I got upset and went to the receptionist again and told them and again no any sorry just simply told me we will change you room I spent the whole day from room to room very bad, I like the hotel facilities
513007,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Room and bathroom was very small and cramped even the bed was small very disappointing as it was a mother and daughter pre xmas treat , The foyer was very inviting staff friendly and breakfast adequate
513008,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Bar area exceptional cold would have liked to have stayed longer having a drink but couldn t booked a double room got two single beds But staff moved us to another room which was good of them we froze in this room we normally never complain but had to on this occasion this was a special trip for us we eventually got moved to a beautiful comfortable warm room late the following evening , Breakfast was very good kept us going on our busy day reception staff very nice bar staff a little on the cold side 
513009,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I had to leave the first room at midnight as the bath was filling up with filthy water coming up the plug hole I was moved to another room which was next to the cleaners cupboard so was woken by them at 7 30 after a very unsettled night I asked to be moved to a less noisy rm which they did but in the process of moving an expensive top of mine was lost They are suppose to be replacing it but guess what I have heard nothing from them The hotels has recently changed hands and there are builders everywhere My advice would be stay somewhere else ,No Positive
513010,Holiday Inn London Kensington, very noisy rooms poor layout of the room tv located in the wrong place 2 seater setee and coffee table unnecessary cluttered up the room access to toilet restricted a large person would have struggled to use it open plan shower unit meant taking a shower was not pleasant cold in the shower enclosure as the door to the toilet shower room opened directly in front of the shower enclosure , the location was good
513011,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Breakfast room service was inedible Absolutely disgusting and 30 for 2 people Reported it and I was offered a free breakfast in return Shame I can t just nip up from South Wales for it asked for a refund and got no further reply Horrible customer service , Location Bed and room layout Distance to tube station
513012,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The bathroom was awkward small and very narrow I cannot imagine a tall person never mind a wide one being able to stay in this room 5005 Comfort was really sacrificed to save space and it was difficult to brush my teeth as the tiny sink yes tiny was directly under a cabinet and it was nigh impossible to get to the sink at all without cracking forehead or head Friends in another room had to change rooms because it was too small for two people but their bathroom sink was all right The rooms are quite different from each other as the hotel is growing and several buildings are involved in the refurbishment , Bed was delicious to crawl into after a full day and night out with good linens and mattress Location perfect to all points in London via Tube or bus or on foot Super staff especially the concierges porters and doormen They went beyond their job descriptions to help 
513013,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Waited over 20 minutes to check in not because there were lots of people checking in at the time but because there appeared to be only one member of staff on reception , Great location very comfortable and clean Well equipped gym 
513014,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Very small room small bathroom water in the sink and bathtub didn t drain once we only received one towel only one shower gel Upon arrival our room was very cold Breakfast was really disappointing good selection but really not tasty Go for the Muffin Man 100 m away , Location is good hotel is clean and nicely furbished

513016,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The service after the visit was shocking money was taken out of my account without my permission after checkout I do not expect a hotel to keep my details after checkout they continued to take money out resulting in me having to contact the bank to get my money refunded Staff were rude and incompetent they did not understand the problem They passed me to many different people and none of them knew what to do I rang to make a formal complaint and was told I d get a call back but didn t I sent a formal complaint by email 3 times and did not even receive an acknowledgement of my email Very disappointing it ruined a good stay there and for that reason I would not recommend or return ,No Positive

513021,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We were given the wrong type of room when we checked in I don t think it was a deliberate action but more a case of new staff getting use to the system Hopefully they iron this out , Staff worked hard to resolve a minor issue Parking although not cheap was very convienent under the hotel High St Ken Tube stop is only minutes 
513022,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room above me was a building site we woke up every morning to loud banging and drilling Both times we went to complain no managers are available at the moment I can offer you some free drinks The trip to London was great but let down by the hotel experience We were not notified the hotel would be changing hands to the Holiday Inn and we re not expecting to have to put up with the noise on a relaxing long weekend away , Clean rooms and friendly staff 
513023,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The check in was chaos as was the check out we had to wait in the bar for over an hour to wait for our room to be ready and had to queue for 45 minutes to check out to make things worse the hotel as tried to take the payment twice from my bank account I have been staying at this Hotel for over 30 year s but I think after the changeover to Holiday Inn I ll be making other arrangements for my next stay in London ,No Positive
513024,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room size and cleaning poor also on our last night being woken up at 8am by a cleaner asking me what time was I leaving the room, The room was very very small not as advertised As a long term customer of holiday inn which now own this hotel I hope you get it sorted quickly to your standard which has always been good in my option
513025,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We booked an executive club room and was given a standard they said nothing we could do as no other rooms available My sister went back up to her correct executive room and someone else had checked into it although she had already done so and her belongings were in the room The couple said they thought this was odd as a porter took the stuff to lost property The duty manager just said sorry but he couldn t do anything Cannot believe we paid executive prices when we stayed in a room so small you would struggle to get around with your belongings out , I loved the location of the property that was as far as it went for me 
513026,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Room was extra small the bed tiny it was passed as a double but it really is a small single no room to swing a cat in there Room was extremely cold Heating didn t work asked for someone to look at it and they brought a very small oil heater that was hardly warm Mad my birthday miserable Nothing worked really Will not re book , The breakfast was amazing
513027,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Queued for a long time to check in and then we were checked into a tiny room with a single bed when we had booked a double It then took quite a while to get a double room Really small and odd shaped room and bathroom my boyfriend was almost too broard to fit into the tiny space the toilet was in There was also loud drilling straight above us would have been nice to let us know that some work was going on , Lobby and restaurant area were lovely Didn t have chance to see the spa or use the restaurant 
513028,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The rooms and bathroom are smaller then they look on the pics but they are clean and littery is very good The check in out staff was a bit lost in their new system the hotel became a Holiday Inn the week before our arrival Couldn t find the reservation They asked for my credit card upon arrival but promised me they wouldn t charge it but when I came to check out and pay they had already charged my credit card not very happy , Overall the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful in particular the concierge service fantastic 
513029,Holiday Inn London Kensington, EVERYTHING I WILL BE MAKING A HUGE COMPLAINT TO HOLIDAY INN THE DAY WE CHECKED IN WAS THE DAY THE KENSINGTON CLOSE HOTEL WAS CHANGING HANDS TO THE HOLIDAY INN THE COMPUTER SYSTEM WAS FLAWED NO ONES KEY CARDS WORKED THE QUEUES WERE HORRENDOUS THE ROOMS WERENT READY THE ROOMS WERE NOT ALLOCATED AS PER BOOKING THE BED SIZE WAS WRONG IT COMPLETELY SPOILT MY ONE AND ONLY WEEKEND AWAY THIS YEAR AND I PAID OVER A HUNDRED POUNDS A NIGHT FOR A POXY HOLIDAY INN IF I WANTED A HOLIDAY INN I WOULD HAVE BOOKED A HOLIDAY INN shame on you booking com for not informing people of a really important event this really was a case of robbing people LOTS OF SHOUTING AND LOTS OF DISGRUNTLED PEOPLE ALL WEEKEND the poor staff were so fed up but tried their best, staff helpfulness
513030,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Did to the change to a holiday inn there were a few teething problems The numerbering directing to the room was wrong Guests should know that there is a charge for using the pool, The bed was really comfy
513031,Holiday Inn London Kensington,No Negative, I suppose as a chef myself and working in the hospitality industry for nearly 20 years I am a bit more critical than most in some aspects my first disappointment was on arrival not being notified of the changeover in hotel names so arriving and finding holiday inn instead of kengsington close I first taught I was at the wrong hotel reception was caotic my reservation wasn t on the system and found staff unapologetic in such case my first impression was not great to say the least however as I do suffer from allergies and when requesting certain items from the hotel the staff was very diligent and accommodating I did feel the single room was extremely overpriced for the basic it contained but I will allow for the location which was fantastic would have loved to have been greated in some aspect of my stay by an English accent as I felt I at times was staying in an easten European city instead of the centre of London at times by the accents however most were very kind but when you hear staff speaking among themselves in there own languages can be very unnerving and intimidating to say the least overall as much a I had a lovely stay location being the most advantage to be honest I would doubt a return to this hotel again from working in this industry I am probably more Critical than your adverage customer to me it was in many ways of 4 star standard but as I m sure as it s a new venture for a new company best of luck in the future Ann Marie
513032,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Checking in was extremely difficult due to problems with the Hotels IT system The Executive Room was disappointing Nothing special with the room facilities and lighting level was very low, Convenience to public transport is good

513034,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Noisy noisy through the night loud generator noise through the night and plumbing noise through the night Entry door is not sound proof so you can hear everything on the corridor, Location and staff
513035,Holiday Inn London Kensington, very small room with 2 beds wifi on room was overloaded or out of range and we had to use free 24h coupons that were provided by the reception wifi on lobby area was free but overloaded or out of range strange incident there was an early morning false fire alarm and while evacuating the hotel personnel said it was a false alarm but the fire alarm kept ringing and many of the people were confused on what to do which could be very dangerous, very clean and cozy stay friendly and helpful personnel safe and convenient location I d certainly stay again
513036,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The staff were rude I wasn t informed of the change of name of hotel so walked about looking for this I never got the room I asked for and never got into my room until after waiting over 3 hours after midnight which meant I lost out on my Friday Night There was no handover with the staff and time wasted again in the morn Eventually I was offered 30 off the Sat night room rate I don t think this was acceptable I wasn t prepared to waste anymore time and advised a complaint would be going into both Booking com and Holiday Inn It s a shame as I have always praised Holiday Inn and staff The location was great The staff especially the senior or Duty Managers were not interested helpful or understanding Would not recommend this hotel , Clean and comfortable

513039,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Room size I am appalled at the room size It was not a double room but a single room with a double bed The fact the hotel had changed to a Holiday Inn and was not informed and I am still waiting on a call from the manager This was promised on Saturday when we arrived, The door men were exceptional

513041,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Room was very small Being on the 6th floor I was on the same floor that was halfway renovated so always had to use the furthest away elevator and the corridor was somewhat dusty Furniture and fittings in room in poor condition door on cupboard on single hinge and work desk in need of renovation or replacement WiFi in room didn t work although apparently you could get a voucher instead of logging in online Bed jammed up against far wall from door so if you were a couple in the bed one would have to climb over the other to get to the bathroom However may be Holiday Inn has taken over this place to bring it up to standard so I m not condemning this hotel they may just need time to get everything sorted , Arrived on a bad day I think as hotel was literally just changing over from Kensington House Hotel to Holiday Inn There were massive queues to check in and a few room mix ups and other problems as systems were changed however the staff were polite and as helpful as they could be under the circumstances Plenty of room in the lobby and some nice seating areas 
513042,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The hotel was being taken over that day by Holiday Inn There was chaos at Check in we had to que for 3 4 of an hour and then wait another hour for our rooms The rooms varied greatly in size and quality Some were very poor Poor show by holiday Inn not to have lots more staff on hand whose idea was it to change some bedrooms numbrers at the same time Not good customer service consdiering we booked seven rooms they wouldn t even wave the fee to use the pool poor poor poor Please provide more breakfast options for those with dietary needs like Glutten wheat free , Very little

513045,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I did Not like it because the rooms do not have the standards of 4 stars hotels I was not happy to pay 50 extra for each night I have stayed in The staff had informed me that I have to pay 50 like deposit in case I destroy any object in that room Then what for is the insurance I could spent this money to enjoy my trip The room I have seen online is totally different from the one I had Internet extremely slow and no TV programs Only the publicity ones Old and broken furniture I really wanted to show my daughter Christmas lights in London and I have made an effort for this trip but unfortunately the hotel I had booked was really really bad and did affect my mini holidays I have been before in other 4 stars hotels and there is no point of comparison how lovely they were We actually thought Kingston will be a lot better as the pictures online look great but is a all false Hope this feedback will help to improve services And being honest to people will bring you a lot more clients ,No Positive

513208,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room was very small not much space at all we didn t have clean towels the whole two days we stayed not much selection in the restaurant for dinner and the fact that they charge you for literally everything is very off putting considering the price that you pay to stay there you get charged just for the staff to pour you a drink , Hotel was lovely inside and the spa area was good Breakfast was good with lots of selection but the bacon and sausage didn t taste right

513275,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Room not ready when we checked in at 3 no apology just told it would be 10 minutes Room was tiny even though we paid extra for a deluxe club No tissues in bathroom and rubbish left in there from previous occupants Could no sleep as there was so much noise banging doors all night long , Breakfast was good 
513276,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Rooms very small and pictured on the website to convey the contrary I am not a tall person but this resulted in feet hanging off the end of the bed Also not enough room for two people in the double bed The rooms by the elevators are quite noisy especially with doors slamming all through the night , Excellent location
513277,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Bed was hard and pillows were hard for my liking The room was quite small The spa was not worth 8 PP and they did not offer us robes when we told them they were not in the room People were jumping in the pool with clothes on such as shorts and t shirt when they should have been wearing swimming costumes They were leaving the steam room door open which set off the alarms yet nothing was said to them by the pool attendants No room in the small spa only 4 allowed at one time so had to wait for a turn Only 4 beds which were occupied most of the time Very disappointing that the hotel is named after the Spa so was expecting good things , I liked the big mirror on the bathroom door which helped us to get ready The space was limiting to move around the bed There was no robe in the bedroom which we were told was there for use at the spa 
513278,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The staff are rude We were given a room with a blocked sink broken toilet door and lights that didn t work I raised this with staff but it wasn t fixed and they still expected us to pay full price Our room had a tiny window behind a wall that looked out to a loading bay , It s in a good location 
513279,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Reception they don t really respect the clients They let me waiting 8 hours for check in saying that there is no room available I arrived to check in 7 AM with knowing that could be some waiting but not 8 hours , Location

513281,Holiday Inn London Kensington, When we arrived at 4 pm our room was not ready We had booked a Superior room We had to wait until 5 30 pm and they was no more Superior room The manager on duty came to apologise and she offered us to choose between two rooms a standard room and a executive room We took the second option but the first floor is under renovation with a lots of noise and we were told that the workers would not start before 10 am but in reality they started at 8 am On Thursday our room was not cleaned and when we told the reception it was 6 pm in the evening and nothing happened , The location of the hotel is great the concierge does an excellent job if we have questions and I still want to thank Lourdes the manager on duty who tried to find a solution with our room and she was very nice 
513282,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Breakfast would benefit from good coffee machines rather than the current English coffee served by staff Croissants are substandard , Good hotel at an excellent location Rooms are in the process of a due renovation 
513283,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We were told that we used the spa which we did NOT The staff told us afterwards that only your room number is needed to use the facilities at the spa That means that anyone can give any room number to use the spa I honestly think that the hotel should find a better way for example using the room card to enter the spa We were put in an uncomfortable situation to justify something that we were NOT to blame for , The rooms were extremely clean and the beds and pillows very comfortable which made for a pleasant stay 
513284,Holiday Inn London Kensington, none of the facilitys were available apart from the pool on the sunday and they were the main reason i booked this hotel as i wanted to make my daughters hen do and birthday special,No Positive
513285,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Disappointed that Wi Fi was not included in my room price I feel this should have been included as standard When I went to collect my suitcase from the holding area the staff member just left the case unattended for anyone to pick up I followed the staff member when he went to collect my case but decided to leave it in a place I wasn t waiting , Good control of the air conditioning unit allowed for a good night sleep 
513286,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Was my 4th year in a row staying here and was asked at reception was this first visit Rooms are not 4 star too small even for London standard with toilet area particularly compact Paying for wi fi is a rip off Miserable with tea coffee facilities 2 teabags per room , Reception bar etc look 4 star Good location close to tube station and Hyde Park close by 
513287,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Made to wait until 3 o clock on the dot to check in even though room was ready would not even acknowlage us at 2 55 Staff had no sympathy to coming off a 18 hour flight Found the majority of staff to be French and quite arrogant Didn t receive a single smile or any customer service the whole time we stayed Room was tiny and outdated , Good location in Kensington
513288,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Rooms are not big but it s OK for London Bed is way too small for too After 3 days I end up for back pains due to bad position in bad as we were two sleeping in the bed Metro be careful that you need to take a yellow line to South Kensington There are roughly one metro every 10 , Breakfast is great Hotel lobby is really nice and staff is general is friendly and willing to help There are just too many people at breakfast that are willing to take your plate before you finish it We have been there for a honeymoon and we got some chocolates and an nice letter from hotel manager to welcome us That a great attention 
513289,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room was fine for me but to sell it as a double was very very optimistic Being charged 10 35 for a small glass of wine in the bar this included a 1 22 service charge even though I walked up to the bar ordered and carried it to a table myself Outrageous , The hotel had been refurbished since my last stay and the facilities in the room were much improved Although very small the bathroom and bedroom were crisp fresh and sparkling clean The receptionist was lovely 
513290,Holiday Inn London Kensington, It was disappointing that we had to pay extra to use the swimming pool and gym facilities because this was one of the main reasons we booked the hotel As a Genius on Booking com we got our WiFi free for the stay but if we hadn t paying 9 95 a day seems very overpriced , The hotel was lovely and the staff were very helpful and friendly We stayed in a deluxe double room which was spacious and clean The location of the hotel was perfect for us to walk around but was also very close to a tube station We look forward to staying again 
513291,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We were disappointed that there is an extra charge for using wifi at this hotel Many hotels we use no longer charge guests for this service or give a certain period of time for free , Reception staff were helpful
513292,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The size of the room to small The shower mixer taps kept blasting water out of the bath onto the floor The shower door would not work water coming under it , The openness of downstairs
513293,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Our laundry was late coming back and there was confusion as to payment of laundry at front desk which was resolved without a problem , The indoor pool was warm enough for comfortable swimming often not the case with other indoor pools and was great for the kids on rainy damp London days Breakfast buffet had a good variety of healthy options 
513294,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The view could have been better and the sliding bathroom door was hard to push open, Clean room up to date bathroom good use of mirrors to make a bijou room appear bigger

513296,Holiday Inn London Kensington, One 4 slice toaster at breakfast for at least a room accommodating 200 guests at any one time I waited up to 8 minutes to get a chance to use it The complaints in the area were all the same although conversation was light hearted , It is a functional hotel catering for the 1 to 3 night stays

513301,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Shower water pressure was very low the hairdryer was rubbish Would definitely advise people to take their own 12 5 service charge on everything The spa pool area could do with a bit of TLC sadly the jacuzzi was not working which is a shame especially when you pay extra to use the facilities The sauna had a very sharp and dangerous brake on the bench so I did not use this either , The hotel location is great The staff were great very friendly and helpful I stayed in a single room it was a good size and had a lovely bathroom The bed was comfy and it was very clean I paid extra to use the spa facilities and joined in with a Pilates class which was great as was the late check out at 12 00 I was looking for somewhere to relax for a night after a busy 2 weeks of work and that s exactly what I got 
513302,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The queen size bed in my room sagged on the right side The left side was firmer The mattress should be turned or replaced , The buffet breakfast included in my room was good The Kensington Close Hotel and Spa is large 500 rooms with friendly and helpful staff Also the location is good in a quiet residential and businesses neighborhood that s 2 blocks from Underground restaurants and stores

513305,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I was surprised that there was a charge of 8 each day to use the swimming facilities even if you were staying at the hotel and there was a charge to use their wifi It s quite an old fashioned way of doing things and quite surprising for a 4 star hotel I d rather them include the costs in the accommodation charges , Although the room was small it had all the facilities we needed and even had a bath tub and a mini fridge which both came in handy when staying away with a little child 
513306,Holiday Inn London Kensington, There wasn t really anything that we didn t like , The Hotel is at a very good location Off the main road and around the corner from the London Underground There are lots of shops and restaurants to visit locally Very close to Harrods Museums Hyde Park and many other great attractions It was nice to have experienced the hotel as now we know we d use it again in the future 
513307,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The bed linen was dirty with fresh marks and blood stains A dirty microfibre cleaning towel was left in the bath It was obvious that the room had a very cursory clean and the bed clothes weren t even changed from one guest to the next Very disappointed considering the price of accommodation However I have stayed here a few times before and this is the first negative impression I have had of the place , Staff are always very friendly and hotel is very conveniently located for High Street Kensington

513310,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I did not like the superior room that I was located The room itself was fine The toilet was small and there was no rooms for moving around The sink was the smallest I have seen in my life and wrongly orientated It was very inconvenient to use the sink for washing and shaving and with the size of the toilet it was dangerous to get in and use the bath I had to change the room and select a better room so I can enjoy my stay at the hotel After I changed the room to an executive room paying the different in price everything was fine afterwards , I liked the hotel reception facility and overall entrance area 
513311,Holiday Inn London Kensington, They held an extra 50 per night on your card which took days to refund the bar staff automatically put a service charge on all your drinks even though you are sat at the bar when challenged they did actually remove it , The hotel was in an ideal location close to Hyde park and tube station which enabled us easy and quick access across London
513312,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We did not realise the spa and pool was an additional cost of 8 per person per day Concierge told us if we purchased tickets for Madame Tussauds from the hotel we would not have to queue for the attraction this is just not true and we confirmed this by asking the staff at Madame Tussauds Tea and coffee facilities are supplied in room but only enough satchets of milk for 1 cup per day between 2 , The Hotel was well situated for us and reasonably priced with a good breakfast buffet Rooms were comfortable and airconditioned

513315,Holiday Inn London Kensington, It always seems to be a building site Some rooms have very little room from the corner of the bed to the bathroom wall less than 10cm in one room so upgrade your room if you plan to be in it for any period of time , Location is great with simple access to the underground and then all parts of London

513326,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Tiny room despite apparently being an Executive Double only enough room to walk around the double bed Queried with management confirmed it definitely was an executive double offered change of room but not until following day unable to take up this offer because of complexities of our plans for the following day I have taken photos It was a special weekend and this poky room spoilt it, Location taxis always readily available outside on rank very close to an exceptionally good Thai restaurant

513329,Holiday Inn London Kensington, A bit surprised that there was a charge for the Wifi No salt and pepper on tables at breakfast They did run out of fried eggs It would have been sensible to put more tea bags in the room also more milk as this necessitated calling the room service late in the night to bring extras to the room , Breakfast was nice Bedroom nice and clean
513330,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The double bed was two single beds pushed together which is a little disappointing Long queue to check in and out but it was exceptionally busy because of an event at Hyde park , The staff were very friendly and wished my wife a happy birthday on arrival I asked the staff if somebody could put a gift on the bed for my wife which I brought along with me They did this with no issue at all 
513331,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Pillows were lumpy and we had to ring for toilet roll , The room was small but very clean However the pillows were not 4 star The room was a little dated but for the price we paid for room only it was excellent value in a great location for access to transport especially buses and underground direct into the city centre The location was peaceful and very safe for two female travellers to stay in with lots of cafes nearby and very close to Kensington High Street Please look after the homeless man who lives down from the Cafe Nero 
513332,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Croissants actually very stale Breakfast overpriced for what it was The internet photo of the front of the hotel hides the gahstly exterior of the building though its actually quite nice inside , Staff relaxed and friendly Swimming pool in the basement Gave me and my pregnant partner complementary coffee and sandwhich after deliverring the wrong coffee and then the wrong sandwhich
513333,Holiday Inn London Kensington, On arriving I was given a swipe card that didn t work so had to trail back down to reception with all my luggage so they could amend this My partner had arrived really early after travelling by night bus despite phoning to notify them of this the previous night she had to wait a couple of hours then ask to get a room Despite these inconveniences they still wanted an extra 10 per hour if we wanted to check out late There was no iron board in the room which we had to ask for which I thought odd considering it s hardly a luxury something that most places provide The walls are paper thin so you can hear more than you would like And we had housekeeping chap on our door at 8 40am to ask if we needed our room serviced Luckily we were up but I don t imagine many people would be at that time Just lots of stupid little things that if hadn t have happened would have gave me a lot better impression of the hotel s overall service Was otherwise fine for the short time we were there , Very close to the train station which is great Looks nice enough inside Comfortable

513336,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Lovely hotel but has some flaws When paying 140 a night 253 for two I really don t think it s acceptable to charge 8 to use the gym per day That s ridiculous I stay here once or twice a week price ranges from 111 145 or two at 240 346 If I were to use gym eat breakfast and pay for wifi I d have to add another 29 95 PER DAY to my bill This is a real shame as I actually like this hotel and staff are absolutely lovely never in the 6 months that I ve used this hotel have they been anything but polite and professional lovely in fact Now I m not asking for free food of course but I should be able to pay for a 2 day gym pass asking 16 is a ripoff sorry And 19 90 for wifi for two days Come off it Saying this the last two visits I ve been given free wifi Happy Emma Maybe you ve realised that s unacceptable Who knows , Small rooms but very nice as long as you get a refurbished one if not then boy o boy are you in for a 90 s throw back treat Hotel is going through some renovation which is great Lovely staff and very pleasant bar Breakfast is pricey but actually really quite nice Situated in the perfect part of London for me everything I need for work and pleasure

513413,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Very expensive breakfast not included in price 10 per day for wifi was ridiculous 8 per visit to the gym was also ridiculous You could not swing a cat in the room it felt like we were charged surpluses the whole duration of the stay which was unnecessary I travel a lot and I have never been asked to pay for wifi and entry to a gym Even the girl on reception was embarrassed to tell us the price , The location was ideal
513414,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Expensive for a tiny room No bath poor view Had to pay extra for wifi leisure facilities very very diappointing , It was a good location but hotel was expensive for a very basic small room You have to pay extra to use any facilities and I didn t feel we have value for money at all Very poor
513415,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The cost of breakfast and drinks at the bar were too expensive Fortunately there were cafes and bars close by which were reasonably priced The room was very small , Staff were very friendly and it was a relaxing place to stay It was very clean A great location 
513416,Holiday Inn London Kensington, My room smelt very smoky The 10 pounds a day for wifi is ridiculous Luckily as a Booking com genius you get free wifi just as well because the quality is anyway not great The staff policy is a bit odd they can be overly helpful but you get the feeling it is all for a tip and if you don t give one immediately you are ignored , The location is perfect and the rate via booking com usually reasonable more expensive on this occasion 
513417,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The wash basin in the en suite was too small with a large fixed tap making it very difficult to use , Food was very good quality The service overall was excellent Comfy bed and quiet room even with windows open

513419,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Room poor and basic the bed was dreadful when sat on it knew immediately that we wouldn t get good night sleep especially after travelling all day and tea facilities had no biscuits i was starving on arrival and needed refreshment after our journey might seem petty but is this a cut back or staff nicking the biscuits We arrived late in the day and the reason we chose hotel was to use pool and gym too but that was extra charge which wasnt case few yrs ago when came there Spoke to reception with language difficulty and then they spoke to manager eventually got another regular standard room which they tried to get me to pay extra for It just goes to show its not what it seems on glam advertising and photos beware and if you havent stayed there before then you have lost your money no refund I ve stayed in many hotels and know what to expect a good bed no cigarette smoke smelling room decent kettle and biscuits decent bathroom decent size tv clean fresh smelling room These are the standards expected in a hotel stay yes pay extra if you want all the frills but this should not have been the case to waste our time trying to explain to reception staff then waiting for call back from the manager then being shown another room which was further away then eventually went out to eat but restaurants were shut by then managed to get one drink before pub shut Really know your hotel before you stay there and dont be fobbed off for basic room with poor standards and be expected to may more for a standard room I would love to be a hotel inspector First impression on outside nice with a doorman but once inside room Uh Dont be fooled , Location

513422,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The bathroom had a ridiculous layout with the toilet squashed into a small narrow corridor like space The washbasin was tiny so any attempt to wash resulted in wet feet and floor Cleaning teeth was made very difficult because of the combination of the small basin and the cabinet which was just above it Whoever designed the layout seem to have thought more about how it would look than the practicalities of using it The bathroom would put me off staying for more than one night in the hotel , Very clean room Location excellent as very close to tube station Staff polite 
513423,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I know it is London but what characterizes this hotel more than anything is it s greed The rooms are very small for what you pay but more alarming is the long list of extra charges 12 day for breakfast 32 day parking 8 day if you wish to use the leisure facilities But the real joke is that is this digital age we live London hotels still expect to charge to use the internet 8 day I travel regularly for work can not remember the last time I had to pay for internet access in the room, Friendly staff and great location
513424,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The pricing was exhorbitant I wanted to leave a small bag about half the size of one allowed as a carry on in storage for 2 weeks when I m returning for a night and they wanted 40 for the privilege which is the price for one pieces of luggage regardless of size Ridiculous ,No Positive

513473,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Some superior rooms can t be called superior Some relaxing area and joint sauna for families will be good , Manager Ali was spot on after explaining my problem with room it was solved quicker than I expected Executive room s are specious and that s how hotel rooms supposed to look like Good gym and swimming pool about 2 2 metres deep Room service OK maybe little bigger portions Should have booked it for few days more

513476,Holiday Inn London Kensington, This hotel reminded me of being on a cruise ship you pay for the smallest room and everything else is extra It took about 30 minutes to check in including a long queue Then they said they had upgraded us from a double to an executive double what a joke if you saw the room It was so small Couldn t even open a suitcase They charged 10 a day for Internet per device What an absolute joke we were lucky to get it free from booking com The Spa facilities pool jacuzzi are also not included an additional 8 per person a day for that Then breakfast was an additional 12 16 per day per person they didn t even include lattes or omelettes that s extra Basically you pay an okay price for the room end up leaving with a few hundred pounds in expenses , The room was nice and clean the hotel was right next to the tube 
513477,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Hidden service charges which I hadn t noticed until after I had tipped being charged for nuts in the bar that we hadn t asked for , Hotel was very clean staff were friendly cost was good for the area

513481,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The first room standard double I was shown to was like a poor 3 Star hotel miserable decor horrible short curtain and a desk that was stained size of the room bed was tine The mattress was exceptionally bad and the bed shoved under the window so I moved and got an upgrade which I had to pay for They changed the mattress on the bed which was a nice room and the bed comfortable Again its poor 4 star quality lobby is all bling but the rooms are poor I borrowed an umbrella and had to pay 5 as a deposit No phone charges in the rooms you had to leave your phone at the desk downstairs which meant you couldn t work while it charged I didn t eat in the hotel restaurants nearby Would I return not unless it was a very good deal Location is great and its quiet but the small of the swimming pool on some of the floors is overpowering Didn t find the staff that friendly ,No Positive
513482,Holiday Inn London Kensington, 8 charged to use swimming pool , Quiet location just 5 minute walk to Tube and then 15 minutes travel to Central London Good room rate which also included Breakfast Well appointed Hotel with good facilities Only gripe was 8 charged if wanting to use swimming pool Kensington is a nice location in itself to be based 
513483,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Where a discretionary service charge of 12 5 is added to bills with no total without giving the impression that this is the total A bit of a scam I think Service charge added even when I went to the bar myself Not acceptable Rooms very small , Great reception staff and dining room staff 
513484,Holiday Inn London Kensington, No bath in the room which was an issue when there doing the marathon and would have liked to have had a bath when I got back You have to pay to use the wifi which I think is bad when you have payed so much to stay in a 4 hotel Have to pay extra to use the leisure facilities which I think is disgusting again when you have premium prices for a 4 hotel These points would stop us using this hotel again , Beautiful reception area and down stairs area Rooms very small but clean 
513485,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Had to pay for wifi nearly 10 for just 24 hours Crazy when you think you get free wifi everywhere else Room was very small Staff around reception were not very friendly helpful spa staff were good Spa was expensive as you had to pay for the day rather than just a visit , Good location
513486,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Staff were not very helpful the reception and lobby are nice and new and then you get to the bedroom which is the size of a shoe box and not maintained Breakfast and drinks in the bar are way over priced Lovely Cafes just up the street serving great breakfast for half the price The bar also put on your bill a discretionary charge of 12 5 for poor service Only reason we stayed was for a wedding near by would be very disappointed if I had been here for a weekend away to relax , Location was pretty much it
513487,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Standard Room too small for 2 people Internet too expensive 10 pounds 24hrs should be free Fitness pool too expensive 8 pounds entrance Bar staff pushed me away sitting there at night because i did not drink anything even i was a guest for 2 nights Sometimes it was too cold Air Condition, Breakfast very nice large buffet 
513488,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The lovely reception and welcoming porters is where it ends Boulevard Restuarant evening dining decided to eat here because the menu looked lovely and the menus in the lifts had two courses for 18 However The menu they gave us when we arrived wasn t the one advertised We were told that one had finished the week before how convenient Instead of apologising and offering to honour the advertised menu or at least offer a bottle of wine or some other compromise we were asked which lifts we d seen the menus in and told that they had been removed the week before In the meantime someone went and removed them and replaced them with the new ones They then messed up the wine order and charged 26 instead of 23 because they brought a different wine to the one ordered and then stuck 6 service charge on each of our bills The food was average not worth the price If they had apologised and admitted a mistake and offered some sort of compromise it would have gone a long way I will also add that when we got in the lift today and lifted the menu up to see if the other one was still underneath two other ladies in the lift laughed and said they had just done the same thing because they had the same experience as us Rooms in need of a serious refurb Boring tired decor shower not working and replaced with pathetic hose stuck half way up the wall which you had to take off to wash your hair and I am only 5ft 2 inches tall Nothing like the pictures , Hotel reception very impressive Concierge very helpful Breakfast lovely

513500,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Bedroom was very small bathroom door couldn t open fully as it hit the bath and our bed was up against every wall which meant climbing over the bed to each side For the cost it fell way below expectations Having stayed in London several times this was not what I was expecting for the price Possibly the worst value for money out of any hotel I ve ever stayed in , Helpful staff and good location

513511,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Weird that a hotel of this standard doesn t have free wi fi in all rooms Booking com leads you to believe that the use of swimming pool is including in the hotel price This is not the case , Comfy beds Modern and clean Great bath and shower Plentiful yummy breakfast buff Many eating options in area Buses 9 10 or tube close by take you to major tourist experiences

513533,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Rooms are tiny so only leg s width between bed corner to bathroom door But wouldn t be too bad if the bathroom sink was normal size could have been accommodated but for some reason designer put in half sink and then half covered by chunky protruding oversink cabinet do the designers ever use their own design AND if the bathroom sliding door actually slid Also cleaners don t seem to wait for actual check out so start banging on doors EARLY , If you are able to get one of the discounted deals then this is an excellent location to walk to the Royal Albert Hall Much further but do able walk to the V A museum area Excellent helpful staff work at full breakfast buffet extra price of 12 pp Excellent followup by duty manager speaks volumes in terms of staff score 
513534,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The bedroom was very cold and didn t warm up when we put the heating on which I suspect wasn t working It was quite late by this time and my daughter and I were in our night clothes so didn t ring reception We reported this in the morning and they said we should have told them the night before but as I said we were ready for bed and didn t want anyone co i g to our room We had to sleep in our fleece jackets , Everything was generally good and comfortable Breakfast was good Staff were friendly Love the swimming pool 
513535,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room which was a Premium concierge room size and finishes were poor No radiator for the towel to dry , Staff at the bar particularly welcoming and efficient
513536,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The rooms were quite small I initially booked the larger Executive room and was surprised to find that I had just enough room to walk around the bed but barely space to leave my suitcase When I moved to a normal room for the last night this room may have been slightly less luxurious but possibly even bigger than the executive room , Fantastic staff I had the pleasure of speaking to the doormen as well as the people at the reception a few times and they were continuously friendly and wonderful Compliments for the doormen especially who were too kind and helpful whenever I needed anything Nice location good gym though extra charge but convenient and they have classes nice facilities and clean

513541,Holiday Inn London Kensington, You have to pay 9 pounds extra for 24 hours of Wifi And that is just for One mobile So we had to pay 18 pounds per day for the wifi, The pool was very nice It cost extra though 
513542,Holiday Inn London Kensington, In this day and age all large hotels should provide free wifi and certainly not charge 10 per day per device Shower was a little underpowered , Nice lounge and lobby area Checking in and out was efficient Superior room was just about adequate bed was comfortable free bottled water everyday was welcome 
513543,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I didn t like having to pay 10 for Wi fi for 24 hours and felt it was really mean that the Wi fi ticket only worked for one device so if I used it on my laptop I d have to buy another to use on my tablet , The location was really good with easy access to good restaurants and High Street Kensington Walking distance to Imperial College which suited me The staff were very friendly and helpful 
513544,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Disappointed that the bedding was not changed each day and only made to look fresh , Room was lovely just what we wanted Little extras were very cute and staff were lovely

513552,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The toilet boil had a pee stain up until the third day of our stay , The bed was so comfortable and the amenities in the room were delightful Of course the location was a plus 
513553,Holiday Inn London Kensington, bathroom was too small very difficult to get in and out of would be better to just have a shower loo and sink ditch the bath , location and facilities were excellent staff were all really friendly breakfast was really good parking was very convenient
513554,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room was to small for comfort for 2 people No space between TWIN beds Would have liked freshly brewed coffee and newly made tea The concept of a waiter going around with a tray of pots of tea and coffee does not work and lets down a 4 star hotel , Helpful concierge staff 
513555,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Rooms are small but we did know that before we booked Free Wi Fi would also be good considering the price but it seems that in London most hotels charge extra for Wi Fi unless you book a high end room Temperature in the room was too warm for us so we always had the windows open but we found that was the case everywhere we went in the UK and Europe Our local friends all found the temperature comfortable , The location was fantastic perhaps a two minute walk to a good tube station on two lines There are a couple of other tube stations within walking distance in case of track maintenance etc We found it easy to get a taxi outside the hotel at most times of day Also within walking distance are good restaurants takeaway shopping and facilities such as laundromat etc Good facilities in the spa and gym Staff were friendly and helpful and the room service was fast and reasonably priced for London 
513556,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The price was over charged considering it was further away from what I call centre Also thought spa facilities were free to then find out its 8 pp a day and not even for 24 hours Wasn t happy,No Positive

513559,Holiday Inn London Kensington, What didn t I like The extra cost of wifi and the obscene car parking charges In most hotels I visit wifi is free to access I was surprised when it wasn t in such a modern setting Our room was clean but it had an overwhelming damp foisty smell The cleaners clearly tried to get rid of it because each day they left our room window wide open so when we returned it was freezing Thus our room was cold and smelly , What I liked I loved the location and facilities I very much enjoyed using the pool and didn t mind paying the extra cost to do so Staff were very helpful 
513560,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We were allocated room 227 which we found a little cramped particularly the bathroom , The location is most important to us the buses are nearby as is the Tube
513561,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room was a little small for the price of the booking but I suppose that is to be expected in London I was unable to borrow or rent a phone charger from the concierge which I found very surprising as I ve never experienced this before in any hotel , The bed was lovely and comfortable and I enjoyed the spa access which came as part of my booking Breakfast was enjoyable The hotel is near a tube station and very easy to find

513563,Holiday Inn London Kensington, It was too hot in all the rooms especially the communal rooms e g breakfast and bar areas so that it was uncomfortable The bedrooms had air conditioning but this was March and it was cold outside e g normal weather and just far too hot inside Made the holiday unbearable , Staff were very courteous and helpful Location was excellent Facilities were excellent 
513564,Holiday Inn London Kensington, the rooms are small and very basic bathroom barely enough room to move You get a better room at a Premier Inn, good location Lobby area is smart and has the look of a good hotel
513565,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I didn t like the size of the rooms for the price I felt like for the money I had paid I did not get what I expected for that price , The beds were comfy breakfast was nice
513566,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The furniture in our room was very old the door was broken the mattress was a little uncomfortable , Location the underground and buses are 2 minutes away walking and in the area there are many stores and restaurants The staff are very friendly and very willing to help The food in the restaurant was very good and for a very fare price 
513567,Holiday Inn London Kensington, the rooms a bit small but that is what you get for the rates , I have been in many London Hotel first time in Kensington Close Hotel and was surprised at the level of services cleanliness very helpful staff and over all extremely well managed by far I would give them 5 stars

513569,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The internet WiFi was really expensive and excluded from the prise of the room , The room was very clean and nice The breakfast was rich and tasty All the personal was really kind and helpful Furthermore there is a business centre totally free of charge it is really useful also to print documents 
513570,Holiday Inn London Kensington, That you had to pay extra for Internet the pool leisure facilities The breakfast was rather expensive for what it was, We had a so called superior room not quite sure what was superior about it seamed like a standard hotel room The bathroom was nice though
513571,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The 8 fee per person for the swimming pool, Underground station very close Kensington High Street Room very reasonable size for central London The bed was very comfortable staff very pleasant location of this hotel ideal for the Royal Albert Hall about 15 minutes walk Breakfast very good
513572,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Standard double room was compact I d advise premium or delux for a stay of and more than a night or two , Great staff superb location and reasonably priced for its location 
513573,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I ordered room service and my food was cold The spa has an additional charge of 8 per resident which was not clear on booking , The hotel was comfortably and in a great location 
513574,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Just when I paid for breakfast twice but the staff sorted it out super quick and wasn t a problem at all They were fab , The friendliness of the staff they couldn t do enough for you They made me feel very welcome The spa was also amazing the massage was one of the best and I m in that industry so that is difficult to find 
513575,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Dining room smelt strongly or chlorine and the bed was possibly the worst I ve ever slept on could hear each spring pop when I moved and the mattress had a distinct hole where the springs have gone Money would have been better saved and had a better nights sleep under a bridge And at check out they were in such a hurry to get rid of us that I didn t get a chance to let them know about the problems , Good location looks nice from the outside
513576,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Unfortunately cleanliness was disappointing especially the carpet cups and toilet were not clean enough The heating did not work properly on the first night There wasn t a big choice at breakfast The room the furniture and the bathroom were not the quality I expected it looked old not like on the pictures , The location of the hotel and the price were good Staff was helpful As a genius member we got free wi fi

513578,Holiday Inn London Kensington, wi fi in the room was poor and while I in the end did not have to pay for it wifi at the hotel was originally advertised at nearly 10 for usage per day Only one bar which is very expensive and has no draught beer , Very accommodating with both an early check in and late checkout Good pricing Good standard throughout Very good location round the corner from High Street Kensington and tube station
513579,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Service for wine and sandwiches at the bar was slow and yet only about six customers Also it took a long time to attract attention to pay staff walked through without looking towards customers at the tables for ages Very friendly however , The location Cleanliness of hotel Breakfast was excellent 
513580,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The standard double room is quite small when I stayed it was good value for money but wouldn t pay more than 90 for it, Staff is very nice and upgraded me for free breakfast free wifi and late checkout
513581,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Cost of wifi was astronomical 10 per day per device Also cost of breakfast we did not have breakfast included but 16 for adult 8 for child is ridiculous so we didn t eat there at all ,No Positive
513582,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Initially they gave us a standard double room Its was not that big but it has sufficient space But on the first night the lock our door malfunction some problems with electronics So they then gave us another room with the same price but the way it was arranged made it smaller which has less space Was really dissapointed in that But that was the only downside on our stay , A very convenient location cleanliness fantastic interior design and great ambience Humble and friendly vibe from the staff and other guest When we had trouble with our room the staff was very helpful and accomodating 
513583,Holiday Inn London Kensington, First room key didn t work had to come back down to reception to change no apology Restaurant supervisor woman frosty to the point of practically hostile but rest of staff pleasant Breakfast selection could be better not much fruit, Unpretentious just worked for what I wanted Would return 
513584,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Some of the rooms are a little on the small side, A beautiful hotel with comfortable rooms an excellent spa and delicious food and drinks but the staff are what makes this hotel for me They could not have tried any harder to ensure our comfort and happiness throughout our stay and we will definitely be back
513585,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Although clean the room was a bit small and tired Could do with updating especially as it was classed as a Superior room The prices in the bar seemed very high 7 50 was the cheapest price for a 175ml glass of red wine and the cheapest bottle was about 32 but maybe I m out of touch , The public areas of the hotel were excellent and the staff were friendly and helpful Good breakfast Comfortable beds 
513586,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Single room but very bijoux Having to pay 15 95 for breakfast after first evening which was 12 initially have a confirmation email stating breakfast 12 each night Refused to pay 15 95 breakfast on the last night Room cold Wifi not free recently stayed in a third world country for two months wi fi free all over rooms resorts cafes and restaurants Curtains did not fit length of window therefore light keeping me awake View of other rooms outside window Frayed carpet edge potential hazard, Location near Kensington High Street and Olympia which was the purpose of my visit 
513587,Holiday Inn London Kensington, PLACED AT THE FRONT OF THE HOTEL ABOVE THE MAIN DOOR VERY NOISY UNABLE TO SLEEP BREAKFAST VERY DISAPPOINTING DID ASK TO CANCEL SECOND DAY BREAKFAST AND WAS REFUSED A REFUND, LOCATION
513588,Holiday Inn London Kensington, My roomwas very noisy and I was unable to sleep because of it I don t know what the noise was or where it was coming from but it sounded like some kind of fan Could have been the room upstairs Also the walls were so thin I could here the people in the next room flushing the toilet and I could hear them talking ,No Positive
513589,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We booked an executive double room but it wasn t very executive at all Had to pay 8 to use the spa facilities this isn t clearly stated on the website so seems like false advertisement we had a shock , Pillows were very comfy and good location Yummy breakfast too 
513590,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Doors slammed shut so had a terrible nights sleep Our room would close quietly but you had to push the door to shut properly which is particularly safe plus was very noisy , Bar staff were fantastic Hotel within walking distance to high street
513591,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The Charge for the wellness suite could be more obvious on the website I thought it was included but was charged an additional 8 per day , Lovely welcoming reception area Ok sized room for london Helpful Concierge Good location and value
513592,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The price of the internet was way too high , The room was tidy and comfortable It was small but not too small for us to complain about it Downstairs there was a small business center with two computers which we could use free of charge The hotel lobby was very pretty tidy and classy looking And they also let us leave our baggage there before the hotel room was ready and after we had checked out for as long as we needed 
513593,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The restaurant food was rushed there was no space between courses and the food was of poor quality it came out cold and myself and my friend were ill the next day ,No Positive
513594,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Well room service forgot our order dinner and we had to call again when it arrived the bill had the automatic service charge They did offer to rectify but by then 45 minutes later we simply wanted to eat Terrible breakfast 24 for two toasts patisserie cereal etc fine but actual cooked breakfast strange leathery bacon flavourless tomatoes and mushrooms like slugs I have no idea whats wrong with the scrambled eggs but very odd Bathroom looked nice but shower head below head height , Very close to the station so easy to travel to and from station and look around London 
513595,Holiday Inn London Kensington, last stay we had a great room large and roomy Now this time with Bookings com the room was very small and pokey and difficult to get around past a bathroom door with a large handle and the beds jammed into a small space Bathroom shower bath not really suitable for older people with arthritis no handles and very dangerous , The breakfast was great 
513596,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The service charge being automatically added to our bill I prefer to decide whether or not this has been earned , The service and attention of all the staff
513597,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Heating system variable and unresponsive duvet also thin so nights v chilly , Excellent friendly staff who seemed happy to work there Single rm well designed clean and comfortable
513598,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room was really small cramped Hotel car park was really expensive I booked two nights well in advance and the Hotel had an offer for third night free which wasn t avaiable through booking com When I realised they said they couldn t do anything , The location of the hotel was perfect
513599,Holiday Inn London Kensington, You have to pay 8pp for spa You have to pay for WiFi TV channels Rooms really small for the value view for the bins which didn t really enjoy Window doesn t fully opens No robes provided for spa just towels , The staff were very helpful Location was great as just a minute away from the tube station and shops Nearby loads of restaurants Wake up call Even though the breakfast was expensive it was worth it Enjoyed the stay but wouldn t return 
513600,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Even though we didn t pay to much for our stay the room was really small You couldn t actually have two people in the bathroom at the same time That being said as we were only there for one night and out and about all day it really didn t bother us , The staff were so friendly I left my coach tickets in my room after check out and didn t realise until a few hours later I rang the hotel who found them and left them with the concierge for me to collect later I was quite impressed Location was great plenty of places to eat and the tube is right at the top of the street 
513601,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Central location and the large size of room numbers tempts guests enjoying night out which tends to be loud at early hours of night Thin wall also not helps the situation , Close to station 
513602,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The twin room was so small that the beds actually touched and could not be moved apart I booked a twin so my daughter and I could stay together but no that close Also I paid 8GBP to use the gym and pool which were average You must pay a high price for internet and parking but I knew this prior to arriving so it was not unexpected , The staff on reception were very helpful and polite 
513603,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Restroom space is just reminded me of grave if it happen you forget something on the room forget it it s not yours any more even hotel owner can t get it back all you can have is false smile I had lost sunglasses but thanks god they were not that expensive, Location
513604,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Room very dirty bed very hard on complaining moved to another room upgraded and found this was good although would have paid original price for the upgraded suite nothing more , The location was good 
513605,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I initially checked into a single room which felt like a prison cell it was so small Paying extra for a double room was worth it I was not impressed to be charged extra to use the pool and gym in the hotel It should be included as it would be in any other hotel When I complained to the gentleman on reception at check out he was unable to give me any explanation or apology just shrugged his shoulders Not very helpful I also couldn t see anywhere on the website where it notifies the client that they will have to pay an extra charge to use hotel facilities, The location for High Street Ken was excellent The double room was lovely The pool and gym were an added bonus but you have to pay to use them 
513606,Holiday Inn London Kensington,No Negative, Beds were so comfortable Spa was lovely except need to have shampoo and conditioner avalible for guests Food was amazing and cocktails were great Need to update sound system in the bar sounded terrible so went to bed early as could not listen anymore Shame as great atmosphere in the bar area Overall staff and hotel was great Just minor issues that have been rectified
513607,Holiday Inn London Kensington, No space for toilet bags in the bathroom, What not to like Clean comfortable spacious Excellent leisure facilities All the staff were very helpful nothing was too much trouble

513611,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Person steam cleaning tiles near the bar area on Thursday evening at about 10 30pm Very noisy and not at all relaxing When I complained to the bar man he just said Sorry madam Also changing rooms of pool are poor standard and basic , Fantasic bedroom and bathroom 
513612,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Bar prices Ouch 18 for glass of wine and small bottle of beer So did not use bar other nights Plenty of eating places minutes from the hotel and some pubs , Location was good Bedrooms were small but nice Bathroom lovely Reception was nice Quite big with lots of comfy seating Highly recommend this hotel

513614,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Room was disappointing Not The double executive room I had booked and paid for Two twin beds were joint together and this was very uncomfortable , Excellent location and friendly staff 
513615,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Dinner in the restaurant was a nightmare with regard to the wait The restaurant was not at full capacity yet it took 3 4 of an hour to get my first course having sat down at 7 30pm and finally as I wanted to be out of the restaurant by 8 45pm I had to have my main course brought to my room Apologies from the maitre d but not good enough Food itself was good , Good sized room for single person although I was told the room I was in was bigger than the average single Would have been nice to have a larger bed 
513616,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I did not like that you had to pay 9pounds per device per night for wifi You could walk around London and get free wifi so why pay in a four star hotel, The location was superb and the price
513617,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Staff weren t overly friendly when I checked in Wifi and leisure facilities were only available at an extra cost the room was very small and the food both bar menu and breakfast was very poor For breakfast I d recommend bills just around the corner at the tube station fantastic breakfast and coffee for only 10, Great location clean room
513618,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Standard room is far too small and very very uncomfortable Door to bathroom was broken Cannot wash face as sink is too small Toilet area is far to small and your shoulders touch both walls when you attempt to sit down Extractor fan is the loudest I have ever heard and takes an age to turn off Should not have to pay for wifi No water in rooms and 4 for a very small bottle in the bar is scandalous , Good reception area Very good breakfast Good location 
513619,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Room was very small Which is OK but a few problems made it not a very good experience The power shower was great but it basically spreads water all over the bathroom since it doesn t have proper protection The bed is a double and the mattress was awful we could feel the springs Also a lot of noise came from the AC vents even when the AC was off it seemed like some plumbing noises , The location was amazing Close to museums and shops Also the tube station was just a short walk away 
513620,Holiday Inn London Kensington, No mineral water in the room , Good value for money great location Staff very helpful and nice Free internet and nice breakfast I definitely will be back 
513621,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Although we enjoyed the spa and sauna we did think that 8 for each day was quite expensive and as we were there for 2 nights we would have rather paid for 2 days worth of use Although the staff were extremely helpful when it came to giving us milk and sugar as late as it was we did think they should have given us slightly more rather than 3 milks and 4 sugars Other than that it was excellent , The room was a very decent size we booked a twin superior room to get the extra space Beds were very comfy and the staff were excellent when we rang at 12pm to ask for more milk and sugar as we had ran out Check in out staff were very friendly and helpful also 
513622,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Thete seemed to be a smell of stale cigarette smoke every time we entered our room Everything else perfect , We recently stayed here for 3 nights Its an excellent hotel 1 Staff are excellent They go that extra mile to ensure you feel totally taken care of Excellent in every way all of them The doorman The receptionists The bar people The breakfasr staff All the managers always smiling and helpful The maids did a lovely job keeping the room clean and fresh 2 The rooms We stayed in an executive club room The room was large All the extras included Wiifi toiletries Dressing gown water breakfast Very spacious Bed huge and comfortable 3 breakfast Excellent service brilliant fabulous choice free papers to read A great start to the day 4 location close to kensington high street with all the shops try the world food shop with a cafe upstairs yummy its a 25 min walk to portabello road market close to kensington palace The tube is just a 3min walk away so the heart of the city is accessable easily our son whom has a disability stayed in another room and the staff were brilliant with him He used room service and they were excellent and treated him with respect when he sat in the bar Will definately be back 
513623,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Room decor quite tired but it looked like they are refurbing the hotel in places so may just be the luck of what room you get when you arrive or maybe what rate you paid I got a good rate Room was not very big No fridge Sliding door to WC has an inch wide gap down the side making it not very private you can watch someone on the toilet if you want TV was awkward to use no EPG and remote control had loads of redundant buttons because of their bespoke system No free wifi service but got 3g service on O2 network Bed was twin beds joined together not unusual I know but had a massive valley in the middle so if you were not on your own side you felt like you were falling in the hole Hard to find by car on first arrival because they don t have a description of the hotel position on the website and just use a generic google map by the way it s next to the Copthorne Tara Hotel and actually more on Scarsdale Place than Wrights Lane it is on the bend at the end of wrights Lane where it becomes Cheniston Gardens , Helpful and friendly polite staff doorman concierge etc Acceptable level of cleanliness to be comfortable Two free bottles of mineral water 
513624,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Size of room a little disappointing breakfast only okay nothing more slow check in check out process , Great location and pleasant staff 
513625,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I didn t use the pool gym because there was an extra charge which was disappointing , Nothing not to like staff in particular were very helpful and friendly 
513626,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The only thing that wasn t excellent was the wait in the bar for drinks We enjoyed the table service but would have liked to get our drinks quicker waited about 15 minutes each time and they weren t that busy , Nothing was too much trouble the travel cot was already set up in our room and there were plenty of staff at hand to help get the buggy up and down the stairs without waking our sleeping baby The whole hotel was lovely and clean decor was good and there were plenty of open areas to sit down entertain our daughter We thought the coffee bar was really good and they served great coffee there too 
513627,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Asking such money for use of internet is ridicculous Guys look around it is just robbing In lobby bar you pay Europe s highest price for a cup of coffee anyway but then there is one more 1 pound for service What service Giving the coffe cup over the bar desk ,No Positive
513628,Holiday Inn London Kensington,No Negative, Great location only a few mins walk from High Street Kensington Tube and on a quiet backstreet Our superior double room was quiet very clean perfectly spacious for Central London with a comfy large bed and small but nice bathroom with bath which filled very quickly Nice and friendly staff Didn t use the other facilities this time although the spa looked great Very good value for its location and a nice place to stay would recommend 
513629,Holiday Inn London Kensington, although they said they had given us an upgrade there was nothing to show that was the case , The personal touches when my friend and i arrived and that they had bothered to read my comments that it was a trip as a present for my friends 40th birthday as they all wished her happy birthday The location was good and easy to get to 
513630,Holiday Inn London Kensington, No minibar but I don t use it so it wasn t a problem Would have liked a complementary bottle of water though The plug hole in the bath was not working correctly it wasn t draining so I had to remove the plug cover for it to drain The bathroom didn t have much room for storage no countertop so I had to keep toiletries on the bedroom desk No electricity point near the bed for charging phones etc but I kept my phone on the desk The room wasn t big but ok for a single room All in all no big problems and I had a comfortable stay Would always come back here for my London visits , I had stayed here a couple of years ago while it was going through refurbishment and had had to change rooms because the original one was terrible old and dirty But this time I got a wonderful room the first try I presume all of the rooms are now up to this standard The room was very clean the single bed was comfortable the staff and the hotel itself is completely good nothing over and above but absolutely no problems Clean bedroom and bathroom good hot water and shower pressure The location is ideal very short walk up the road to the underground and to High Street Kensington shopping and 5 minutes walk to Hyde Park No problems and a great comfortable stay Still a little expensive but nothing compared to other hotels in the area and this is a proper hotel not a motel so the price was acceptable 
513631,Holiday Inn London Kensington, After paying an expensive amount for the room this was excluding breakfast at 12pp per day and the use of the facilities at 8 pp per day The double bed is two single beds combined into one with a bed sheet over both bed with a zip running down the middle very very uncomfortable The room is small For an executive room I am very disappointed And for a student this was too much over my budget and not worth the cost , The location is perfect for central of london
513632,Holiday Inn London Kensington, internet access was not included and the breakfast was decidely average The cooked buffet was all pre cooked and under warming lamps and did not look appetising The eggs in particularly were definitely passed their best ,No Positive
513633,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The lack of TV channels most repeat news channels Also requested for knife and fork to the room and took 20minutes to receive it Other than that hotel pretty good, The gym facility
513634,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Tv wasn t working as well as the telephone so there was no use of the service wake up call in the morning That was a scary excperience because I had to wake up early to catch my flight Even the handy man came to the room and he couldnt fix anything The wi fi was not in full function there was no quality signal A stay in hotel that was a nightmare , breakfast
513635,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The service at the bar was very slow the rooms weren t great The main issue was being given the room that hadn t been cleaned Appalling , After checking in and arriving to our room we noticed a tray full of glasses and left over food outside our door and once we got inside found dirt in the bath It was absolutely disgusting 
513636,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Leisure facilities over crowded and for the entry price of 8 this could have been a lot better No free Wi Fi was also a shame as I did not want to purchase the 24 hour fee Bedroom was meant to be an executive room but found it very tight and a little claustrophobic My view from the window was of a rubbish tip that was meant to be my upgrade , The staff were very attentive and very pleasant Amazing evening meal Bedroom was very clean very good night sleep If going to Olympia it is approx 7 minutes cab journey 
513637,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I had a single room and it was horrible cold very basic no mini bar the bathroom fan would run for 30 minutes after the light went out the bed was tiny The safe wouldn t take my laptop which has never happened elsewhere They charge 10 for wifi but it was so bad I couldn t work their response was I should have come down to use it in the lobby They didn t charge me in the end The difference in price for a double room was only 10 and I wished I taken one hopefully they re better Ok for the price but the room really let the hotel down, The location was good and the lobby area nice didn t try the spa
513638,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Bar food was awful Drinks were overpriced Sent back my main because it was inedible Opted for a pizza in my room but the staff neglected to tell me about a deal that would have saved me 10 then refused to refund the difference The manager didn t even acknowledge my presence Will not stay again , Really good pool and spa facilities 
513639,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Extremely small rooms no sound proofing between the rooms paper thin walls service charge on everything I always assumed tips were discretionary here they are compulsory, The location
513640,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The second room we had for our parents was really small , Location was perfect Nice neighborhood and 2 minutes walk from the High Kensington Tube Very friendly staff especially Alexandros at the reception 
513641,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The freezing cold bedroom room 608 Air conditioning did not work and facilities had to bring a dimplex heater and additional duvet Once we complained the following morning we were moved to a different bedroom for our second night However at no stage did we receive an apology from staff and it was not acceptable to be sleep deprived for one of our two night stay, The Location

513645,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Reception staff in the leisure facilities Unfortunately my daughter in law was rudely told off by a Leisure club member that she wasnt to use the changing and locker facilities as these were available for members only I mentioned this to the duty manager who assured me she would speak to my daughter in law and make sure she was o k unfortunately this did not happen, Excellent location excellent front of house staff
513646,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Drinks are a bit expensive Also have to pay 8 to use gym swimming pool despite being guest , Rooms had everything needed very clean and comfortable Staff very friendly and helpful Good location around 15 minutes walk to Harrods

513648,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Where toilet in room was situated we terrible and virtually inaccessible Was embarrassed at restaurant on first morning as details had not been passed on and was refused entry,No Positive
513649,Holiday Inn London Kensington, you have to pay to use the swimming pool even though you are a guest at the hotel Wi Fi is VERY expensive and is for 1 device only as we were 3 people husband wife and little boy and staying for 4 nights wifi would have ended up a fortune for 2 smart phones and 1 Tablet I bought a voucher on the first day but one gentle staff at the reception gave me free wifi vouchers from the second day of our stay so I didn t have to pay for the rest of the days and that was very nice of him the AC heater doesn t work unless you call them and they ask you to wait for about half an hour to fix it as we stayed in January we had to make the call every time we came back to the room , Very good location close to underground transportation and busses Very friendly staff spacious lobby where you can meet friends close to a hypermarket where you get a lot of fresh fruits veg and great food relatively close to Hyde Park close to shopping outlets including children wear which was very handy as we were travelling with a toddler who needed some extra wear

513655,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Free Wi Fi should be available for hotel guests , On arrival we were upgraded to a room on the 8th floor What a difference No comparison to previous rooms with a tiny bath and ridiculous awkward sink This was quiet spacious and proper sized sink in the bathroom and huge bed No bath but good efficient shower Efficient professional and friendly checking staff Good location for us 
513656,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Although I checked out one day earlier than booked due to an emergency which I explained during check in they still went ahead and charged me as per the reservation Also cleaning of the room takes place way too late e g 5pm and sometimes you have to complain before the cleaning is done , Great breakfast

513660,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Was disappointed that had to pay extra for leisure facilities, Unfortunately we only spent 2 hours in our room due to me being taken ill whilst out spending the night in hospital so we didn t get back till 9am after being discharged but what we saw and little experience we had was good
513661,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Could be slightly more competitive on price was disappointed that price of room was reduced by 15 straight after I d booked it on booking com Extra large bed was uncomfortable as it was two beds joined together they were at different heights so couldn t lie in the middle due to the ledge , Attentive very kind staff quick to assist with suit cases etc Delicious breakfast restaurant manager was friendly efficient Room lovely and modern but comfortable Pool jacuzzi sauna very nice This is our 3rd stay at this hotel as fantastic location in a nice area

513668,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Room way to small for what we paid having to pay for the gym and 32 pound a day parking cleaning service kept waking us early to clean room fire alarm beeping all night, Nothing
513669,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Should pay extra for Gym and Wifi I believe these are essentials for a 4 stars hotel and nowadays and should be provided for FREE, Location is very good staff is friendly price was great for this part of London
513670,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Other than the tight parking spaces that the hotel provides nothing could have been better maybe I ll use the train and tube next time , Bedroom was roomy and the bed was extra comfy staff were extremely friendly facilities especially gymnasium were way beyond the norm that you would expect in a hotel pretty much everything was outstanding 
513671,Holiday Inn London Kensington, You had to pay for everything as an extra the gym pool wifi movies breakfast all were at an additional supplement The movies and breakfast I fully understand but to asked to pay 10 for wifi in 2016 is a rip off Especially when cafe Nero 50m up the road has it for free and all you need to buy there is a coffee , Close to the tube and Kensington high street 
513672,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The bedroom needed further improvement with the room redecoration The woodwork needed sanding down filler applied and decoration The same applied to the corridor It looked worn in places Maintenance needs to be improved , Service was good with staff polite and friendly
513673,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The decoration of the hotel wasn t very refined For example the paintwork on the walls and skirting boards was shabby But this is only minor , The location is great The breakfast was delicious The furnishings were luxury
513674,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The single room in the 1th floor was cold old stale and not pleasent at all Renovation is needed , The lounge was good and the staff was helpfull The location is good 
513675,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We didn t find anything we didn t like a will be booking again next time we stay in London , Location cleanliness and facilities 5miniute walk from the nearest tube station And a short hop on the tube to the museums Lots of shops near the and a great Italian restaurant 5mins away 
513676,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Too many managers standing about doing nothing in the public areas Bathroom rediculously tiny Overcharging for wi fi Typical London hotel rip off, Staff were pleasant
513677,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The porters did not help with my cases They watched me struggle I put the kettle on in the room and it leaked everywhere Very dangerous Had to ring reception 7 times in one night to reset the TV for it to work You pay to use the gym and spa but you cannot lie in the beds round the pool as they are reserved for clients having massages I like to lie and relax with a book after spa The room got very cold quickly Could not get the Internet to work They gave us different codes after complaining several times Do I need go on , Felt like we were starring in Faulty Towers
513678,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The bathrooms were extremely small and old Not impressed at all The breakfast at 15 a head is pure extortion We went out instead , The beds were very comfortable and the rooms a good size 
513679,Holiday Inn London Kensington, nothing I didn t like about the place but my socks weren t blown off I will be using it again though at the price , good sized room with all the right stuff
513680,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Poor value for money The Copthorne Tara next door offers better option at same price I booked a executive double room and it turned out that the bed was simply two small single beds put together which offered awful sleeping experience Room was really too small to be called executive double Wifi unstable , Location is good 3mins walk from High Street Kensington
513681,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I just think for being booking com cheaper price they gave a worst room for me Was still the executive double but many problems I though looked smaller , I always stay in kensignton close hotel is my favorite for years 
513682,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We re told we couldn t pre book the car park but arrived and the concierge told us it was full with pre booked cars Also asked for a 1pm check in one room wasn t ready till 3pm, Great location staff nice
513683,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Staff on reception door men and help desk and house keeping very friendly and so helpful Night porter and bar staff not at all friendly and actually made me feel quite uncomfortable for some reason , Happy with room location and facilities
513684,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Wifi charge is 10 day And entry to spa is 8 day Bar service very very slow Showers are useless if your are taller than 5ft 10in and sink is slightly bigger than a soup bowl , Location is great 2 mins from tube station and high street 
513685,Holiday Inn London Kensington, They gave us a tiny room which was below standards of a travel lodge let alone a 4 star hotel we promptly rejected this room it was very unsuitable for this type of hotel 3 4 bed stuck next to wall and toilet crammed in between 2 walls the room we changed to was a standard for this hotel not luxury, Lobby area looked nice
513686,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The rooms are very small not match with a 4 star hotel The check in procedure was quite long The house keeping was done at 7 00 pm The furniture of the room were quite old and dated The worst of all was breakfast service which was in a messy way All items ran out and had to wait for a long time to be refreshed , The location is great The swimming pool and the spa is of great interest
513687,Holiday Inn London Kensington, you have to pay extra to use the pool and hot tub in the pictures and the hot tub was very small and always full , really good location beautiful buildings a short walk away and near to some great reastaurants
513688,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Mis representation of room We changed from our usual hotel Copthorne because of photo of your bedroom To be immensely disappointed and embarrassed having recommended to friends BUT we were moved to a slightly bigger room and ensuite Would not return if it meant the smaller rooms, I loved that the doormen and other staff had no expectation of a tip Hotel was clean social area was comfortable great for seeing our friends The staff were all great
513689,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The reception desk need to greet people with more enthusiasm They all seemed as though they wished that they weren t there Not one smiled once Also had to wait 25 minutes for our soup in the lounge bar We had to cancel the order as we were going to a show and had to leave without any lunch Thought it would have been nice if the waiter serving our table in the evening had made a comment when we told him it was our golden wedding anniversary The reason for a visit to London Also at breakfast it would be good to be asked if we would like more tea or coffee as has happens in all of the previous hotels we have stayed in I asked for a clean knife to spread the butter on my knife and waited for about 6 minutes but the waiter did not return My Husband stayed in the hotel several times in the 80 s and 90 s but he was very disappointed with this visit We didn t use the spa etc as we felt we shouldn t have to pay to use the pool if we are guests in the hotel , Our room was very clean and spacious The decor of the hotel lounge foyer dining area and restaurant was all of very good quality and immaculately clean The position of the hotel was perfect for the tube and The Albert Hall 
513690,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I payed for a later checkout but the room service kept on knocking on the door plus it was very noisey in the morning Lots of banging and knocking from the cleaners couldn t sleep , Easy access to the high street and station
513691,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Sliding bathroom door could hear all going on in bathroom Service charging for drinks in bar without explanation Next evening went to bar and ordered drinks and still got charged for service charge , Bed very comfy Breakfasts were also good 
513692,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Would suggest to give paying guests free access to spa facilities wifi would be a good free service to, Outstanding breakfast clean room and very helpful staff
513693,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Rooms a little on the small side but sufficient for our requirements , Excellent location as we were going to the Royal Albert Hall to see a show Friendly staff great service 
513694,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Wifi should be free Pool and jacuzzi area needs refurbishment some parts are rusty and old , Good location Single rooms are small but well formed and comfortable Good value for money for the area paid 80 for single room 
513695,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Whilst the base price was good for a central hotel there were lots of hidden extras The swimming pool cost 12 50 for me and my daughter Wifi was an extra 9 50 for the day drinks and food were overpriced At least there were lots of food options close by , Swimming pool was a good facility and the location next to High Street Ken tube was perfect 
513696,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Nothing to say here Faultless , Everything about this hotel was absolutely fantastic the location food staff and facilities all were fault less I don t think I ve ever stayed in a hotel and been made to feel more welcome We were a group of 2 couples in our early 20 s and we just loved it We are returning to London near the end of the year and we have already said that we will be returning Thanks for the wonderful hospitality that you provided 
513697,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Rooms small but good value for London wifi is flakey I did not have to pay as booking com genius otherwise I would not stay there any more I still find it outrageous that they charge most people 9 99 pounds per day PER DEVICE , Location is perfect just around corner from High St Kensington and shops
513698,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The description of an Executive Club Room is highly imaginative the spaciousness the bay window seating area had all been removed prior to our arrival Just an average cramped bland London hotel room TV WiFi failed to work without calling on reception Had better breakfasts at motorway service stations , Checking out 
513699,Holiday Inn London Kensington, No iron or ironing board in the room Receptionist gave me the wrong gym opening hours These are MINOR greivances , Fantastic service in the Restaurant very reasonably priced food Great gym and pool facilities couldn t have been happier 
513700,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The programming of the lifts elevators needs updated to be smarter and avoid long waits and or people who are going down coming up and vice versa , Huge bed Housekeeping very good Hotel location excellent for our purposes 
513701,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Only complaint was the room Had a gap of about 6inches between the bottom of the bed and wall to get round to other side of room Room is very small and the way they have crammed in the facilities was poor Small fridge just lying on floor and not making good use of wall space in my opinion Looked very amateurish and have had better rooms in a premier inn Dissapointing after walking into such a noce hotel lobby , Very good location an a 2min walk from the underground on kensington high street Very friendly staff couldnt do enough for you 
513702,Holiday Inn London Kensington, When you are charged 12 for breakfast and then charged 4 50 for an espresso coffee as an extra this is both pretty and bad business, Location and helpful staff
513703,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The part I stayed in seemed to have a lot of guests who only stayed the night and checked out at 04 00 banging doors and luggage and disturbing the rest of us , Every member of staff I met from Cleaner to Desk Clerk to Waiter were extremely friendly and helpful It is because of them that I decided to book a 2nd consecutive weeks stay rather than going to a Marriott Hotel 
513704,Holiday Inn London Kensington, They had no draft lager at the bar which my hubby was a little disappointed about The breakfast was brilliant with lots of choice the only thing I think could improve is to have fresh jam rather than the small plastic packed version , The staff was amazing and very attentive They made us feel welcome 24 7 In addition we got a room upgrade which gave us more space with a cot bed all free of charge We also used the pool which was lovely The quality of food in the restaurant was great too We can t fault anything and will come back here for our next trip to London 
513705,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room was very small and next to the noisy lift The Spa is an additional cost , The staff could not have been more helpful Allowed a late check out and they stored my bags Very good customer service 
513706,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Twin room very small with beds pushed together 8 surcharge per day to use the spa facilities Misleading on the advertisement, Comfortable beds near to tube station clean and modern throughout
513707,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The superior room was a bit worn and the bathroom to small and the bathroom furniture outdated The room was cold each time we returned to it but the fan warmed it up eventually t, Helpful stafff
513708,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Didn t like the way you had to pay 8 pound to use the pool etc the breakfast was very pricey too it should be included in the price the way most hotels are The drink selection of beers is very poor too , Nice clean hotel Staff were very nice and friendly 
513709,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The staff were horrible Aside from the gentlemen at the front that greet you when you walk in no one was helpful None of them speak English and never understood me when I asked them a question I had to ask three separate people before anyone could show me how to turn on the lights This made things very difficult when it came to figuring out parking ordering service to the room etc I would never stay there again just because the staff is so horrible The staff can either make or break a place and they really ruined this experience for me , location
513710,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I know I was in London but the bar was very expensive and 8 charge for the gym is excessive even when one day the steam room and sauna didn t work , Location 2 members of the bar staff in particular where great one lady from Sardinia

513713,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Did not know I needed to pay for pool and only wanted to use it for an hour Very disappointed as thought it would be free for guests Too little room between end ofbed and wall , Reception efficient and breakfast good choice 
513714,Holiday Inn London Kensington, size of the room too small Size of hot tub too small for more than 1 person at the time Paid wifi or swimming pool it should be included in the price of the room Cold water in the swimming pool too hot water in hot tub , Location Restaurant bar and lobby 
513715,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Breakfast was really below standard We arrived with half an hour to spare yet it looked like it was all finished No bacon sausage or mushrooms What was available was cold Table only half laid up Continental breakfast looked really uninteresting Poor selection of fresh fruit melon and a couple of Granny Smiths not good enough for the quality of this hotel Went without and didn t even waste our time on the second morning of our stay In addition we had an executive club room which certainly does not live up to its grand name Shower over bath and no grab rails Even with a slip mat quite hazardous , Location is superb which is why we choose this hotel regularly 
513716,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Size of room professionality at the reception, I arrived and the staff of the reception culdn t find my booking and they made a mistake with the bed of my room 
513717,Holiday Inn London Kensington,No Negative, Nothing was too much trouble for anyone great service and fantastic access to tubes and shopping high street plus very prompt when a request was made to help with luggage transfers

513719,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room had a big stain on carpet at bathroom door and sink had big crack through it The price of spirits very expensive and your not asked which brand you would like We ordered afternoon tea on Friday evening for Saturday after noon but think we were missed off the list the 2 staff came over quite rude about it we wanted a gentlemans one and were told we couldn t have it as it would have to come with champagne but we could only have the other choice The drinks arrived before the sandwiches It was ok but spoilt the experience we felt I then asked for s vodka and Coke and the girl said you will be charged extra well we knew that then she came back with the most expensive vodka Drank it but my birthday treat wasn t the best , For the price we had breakfast Wifi and pool gym included 
513720,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Tiny rooms smallest I ve come across Had to pay for wifi and gym swimming Rooms dated although bathroom was modern Mixed staff some were fantastic and helpful others completely the opposite , Location is fantastic lots to do in the area Reception area has a high end feel to it 
513721,Holiday Inn London Kensington, First night stayed in the smallest room ever Standard twin room but there was no space between the beds very limited space around the beds On request we were given a slightly bigger room for our 2nd night stay which was better , I liked the staff location
513722,Holiday Inn London Kensington, None of the lights worked in the room apart from the desk lamp Also the heating didn t work so the room was freezing cold all night , The breakfast was really good The staff were also very friendly 
513723,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I feel this hotel is very over priced You do not pay for the hotel here you pay for the location I had the executive double room i was told it was the biggest available but it was definitely so small I was shocked that it could be called an executive room If that is executive i feel terribly sorry for the people who paid for a standard room It must have been like a box , The spa was very nice
513724,Holiday Inn London Kensington, additional payments for internet and the swimming pool I would have thought that these facilities would have been included, staff were very courteous Very clean 
513725,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Although we had one of the biggest rooms at our price point it wasn t particularly big the window was hidden round a corner For the price you d expect WiFi and breakfast included Shower was disappointing, Staff were really helpful with finding us a quiet room 
513726,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The night staff was terrible We had a room rate that didn t include internet so we paid 10 per night per device for Internet Needless to say when it didn t work I was a little upset 10 is almost 18 When we complained to the night staff we were told it was our devices Well we tried that for a few nights I was extremely angry so when we checked out I asked for a refund which after some arm twisting was granted That said I think it is absolutely ridiculous that we had to pay for Internet at all especially when it wasn t even good service , The location of this hotel can t be beaten and the price was great The room was clean and it was very close to the High Street Kensington underground station The food in the restaurant was decent as well but there are also loads of places to eat in the area 
513727,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Would have been better if everthing wasn t extra surcharge to use the pool surchaege for wi fi etc Luggage rack in room would have been handy , Already recommended the hotel to friends going to London soon Great base oppulent feel without the price tag 
513728,Holiday Inn London Kensington,No Negative, Perfect location nice reception and bar but very basic rooms in need of updating You can t complain at the price compared to surrounding hotels though
513729,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Snacks not available after 10 30pm we went to a show and had to eat early and wanted a plate of sandwiches in bar to eat together, The convenience and location for buses taxis and just far enough but close enough to central London an excellent hotel I will be re visiting

513733,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Room was old and dated Really old fixtures and fittings worn out chair desk etc hairdryer looked to be years old Pictures of rooms advertised all show the modern feel but was not what we got Christmas parties at night were loud and rowdy in bar and reception areas so we were put off staying for a drink and meal going elsewhere, bathroom had been refurbished though and was nice Nice style to reception and restaurant bar areas Excellent staff No road noise in rooms Good location
513734,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Receptionist was inaccurate with information If you don t know just say or find out don t guess the distance to locations if you don t know The room was freezing even through we put the A C heating on 35 windows let cold air in hairdryer broken in room not spotless but clean charge for swimming pool and room decorated roughly Also felt like we were in the budget room as booked early for good deal , Nice location reception and bar Maintenance staff all friendly 
513735,Holiday Inn London Kensington, This is the second time we have stayed at the hotel The first time was amazing this time it was not so The room was very small the toilet was crammed into the smallest place possible If you have wide shoulder you are in trouble The wardrobe door couldn t be opened fully due to the closing bracket on the room door toilet rolls had to be asked for as did sugar and milk as not replaced All in all very disappointing following an amazing first stay at the hotel I had thought I would never need to look for another hotel in London however after this latest stay I will be shopping around for our next weekend away ,No Positive
513736,Holiday Inn London Kensington, When we arrived we had a superior room booked and when checking in they said that they had upgraded us to deluxe which we were pretty excited about When getting to our room it was less then a dissapointment The walls had dirt and scrape marks all over them the room was a box So small ive never stayed in sucha small room evan when paying for a buget hotel I was so disspointed that we had chosen to stay there for my boyfriends birthday I will never be staying there again and I would advise anyone to not stay there to , I like the location and look of the hotel 
513737,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Everything, The facilities are dark and dismal The room and the bathroom is so small that it is unusable The food downstairs is awful Even the coffee stand in Lobby is bad

513739,Holiday Inn London Kensington, When staying we paid extra for an executive room and from previous experience of staying here the room we received was nothing more than a tiny box standard room The only extras we got were free bottled water and stripey wood furnishings You also had to pay 7 each to use the pool , The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming The location is great to access the centre of London 
513740,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Unavailability of the basic complementary services like water The toilet flush was not working properly and was not fixed even after 3 times of reporting Wifi was not even provided in the hotel lounge in which it is considered a default service even in the motels, The location that is treasure our memories of studying in the same lane 
513741,Holiday Inn London Kensington,No Negative, The hotel is an excellent location two minutes by walk from the High Street Kensington undeground station We stayed in a Standard Room that was spacious clean and with a comfortable large bed The only sad note has been the absence of free wi fi both in the room and in the hall of the hotel instead available in the shops of the underground 
513742,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Despite it displaying that pool and gym facilities were available you had to pay 8 per day for them This is hardly visible on the hotel web site despite displaying that facilities exist It is also not visible on booking com Was booked in for the following week but cancelled and will never use them again as better facilities for the price elsewhere , Was close to tube and Kensington so very convenient 
513743,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Mattress was stained and was looked horrible and slightly overpriced 375 for 3 nights for such a small basic room considering its a 4star hotel , Great staff good location and good bar and food facilities 
513744,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Worst 4 experience Tiny Tiny rooms internet is 10 per device Per day swimming pool is 8 per person you pay in the spot for toom service no complimentary water in the rooms we were rncouraged to drink watet from the toilet taps Feels more like a glorified HOSTEL , The location and doorman was always pleasant
513745,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Although we had a standard room it still was much less of a standard size as we barely had any space , Breakfast was excellent and the foyer very welcoming 
513746,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The hotel was full for 3 days during NYE and the wifi does not work as there were too much people using it , The hotel is in a very good area and very clean We did not take the breakfast so I cannot comment it but the sandwiches at the bar are very fresh and delicious 
513747,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The kettle and cups were located inside a small shelf under the tv which made it awkward to make a coffee in the morning but it was hardly a big issue I got a coffee from the coffee shop down in reception instead , Loved the swimming pool and spa facilities It was easy to get to straight from the tube station The room was clean and newly refurbished and thought it was great value The bed was really comfortable too 
513748,Holiday Inn London Kensington, 2 unbelievably small rooms Needed to climb over one of the twin beds everytime to access the other side of one the room The wall socket to the TV was hanging of the wall Noisy heating system , Good location and nice friendly staff

513752,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Bit of mix up with booking new years eve table we were told guests DON T need to but we were then told they were full All sorted with a great dinner table, Reception staff room service staff location and doorman
513753,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Both Friday and Saturday nights there were parties in the ballroom We were in a first floor room just above the ballroom The music continued until 2 00 AM So if there are parties during your stay make sure that you are on an upper floor away from the ballroom , The common areas and rooms have been redone The first time we stayed there we had a miserable experience This time the property and staff completely redeemed themselves I would stay there again 
513754,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We paid extra for a deluxe double There wasn t much room to move about the bed and for two people to get dressed there wasn t a lot of room at all Also when we got there we was informed it was 8 each to use the swimming pool , The hotel looked lovely and a good location near the station and shops 
513755,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The bedrooms where poor I ve never stopped in a hotel with so small a room and en suite faculties plus single beds the booking Com has a lot to answer to not displaying this correctly like hiding it from us car parking not included in the price then charging 32 a day that was day light robbery again not clearly disclosed Booking in desk the girl did not offer any other size rooms or truthfully was a little abrupt not a good start for a rebooking needs to sell the hotel more the potential is there just needs more up front sales training just be transparent about what s on offer , The lobby entrance lounge and bar and dinning room areas where excellent dinning staff pretty quick at any request asked by us dinning manager was excellent with customer service made us laugh and happy with his good mornings to everyone he greeted a deffinate good feeling first thing from him running around organising the staff more coffee that table more tea excellent member of staff pride in his job well done 
513756,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Don t like it when a double room is two single beds pushed together, Was just round the corner from the tube station and was a lovely hotel Used the spa and had treatments which would recommend
513757,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Spa charges as above, Fabulous hotel in a great location Staff couldn t do enough to help you apart from the spa staff who weren t as pleasant or helpful We had not realized that the spa facilities were extra and just wanted a quick dip in the pool before heading out again We went to the pool without any money and were told we had to pay there and then before we used the facilities It was an expensive dip in the pool at 8 pound each We didn t return on our 2nd night
513758,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The rooms are very small, The hotel location is perfect 3 minutes walk from High Street Kensington Station the lobby is nice and the rooms are very clean

513763,Holiday Inn London Kensington,No Negative, Even though we arrived early our three rooms were ready so we were able to check in immediately and the reception staff were extremely pleasant Very convenient for the Albert Hall and an excellent breakfast the next morning Bathroom a bit snug so it was fortunate we were all slim and reasonably agile 
513764,Holiday Inn London Kensington, we were given the wrong information and staff were not very intuitive to anything we said to them and didn t attempt to help or rectify situations not much atmosphere, great location
513765,Holiday Inn London Kensington, the linen bedding was terrible the duvet was uncomfortable to use very hard and paper like the bed was too soft It was a very uncomfortable night for myself and my husband, The location and restaurant staff were the best part of our stay 
513766,Holiday Inn London Kensington, No gluten free choices for food available so found it difficult to eat at hotel, Staff were excellent just enjoyed staying and would love to stay again I
513767,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Room very basic despite being upgraded to Superior dread to think what standard is Bar stopped serving at 1am, Lobby area facilities and location

513770,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Image from internet viewing was positive but reality very different Executive double booked the reality was a box room particularly tiny inadequate bathroom Obvious signs that the hotel was an ex municipal building Indifferent poor quality full breakfast View sound from window of adjoining buildings services air con Problem with room heating 6 hours to solve Management agreed to upgrade after packing and waiting in reception we discovered that move was impossible because of plumbing problems told to go back to original inadequate expensive room Overall view hotel very poor value for money Best moment of stay was checking out 3 days early Discovered that the adjoining hotel Copthorne Tara regularly received dissatisfied guests checking out immediately early from the Kensington Close Overall a rathole would never return at any price , Location OK public areas satisfactory some staff good particularly the doormen
513771,Holiday Inn London Kensington, So we checked in All was good until they told us that Wifi was extra use of the pool was extra use of the gym was extra breakfast was extra It s 2015 almost 2016 please get with it and stop trying to fleece people , Everything about this place is good except for all the add on s
513772,Holiday Inn London Kensington,No Negative, The friendliness and professionalism of the staff they were universally prepared to go that extra mile The bar was comfortable and good to relax in room great 
513773,Holiday Inn London Kensington, My only complaint is the wifi policy 9 pounds a day It is ridiculous in 2015 that some London hotels still try to charge these exorbitant rates when every small cafe is able to offer free wifi , Location perfect for business trip in South Kensington handy for tube and shops 
513774,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Internat wifi facilities should be upgraded Bathrooms ave VERY small TV channel selection is also very poor , the location good gym facilities which i think should be free for hotel residents Good breakfast 
513775,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The staff was fine but not terribly attentive The rooms were very small and while clean they were tired The staff in the health club followed my 11 year old around as if they expected him to do something wrong despite the fact he was supervised We paid 15 pounds for the 2 of us so it was disappointing that they would take our money but clearly not trust that he would behave , The hotel was located just off Kensington High Street and the metro station It was a great location for shopping or getting quickly to other parts of London The health club had a good assortment of equipment The pool was large and clean 
513776,Holiday Inn London Kensington, 2 Upgraded rooms but both very small Bar staff made it clear they wanted an early finish and felt abit rushed , Location was great lobby was really nice aswell comfiest bed ever 
513777,Holiday Inn London Kensington, didnt like the fact they classed a double room as being 2 single beds pushed together quite uncomfortable but as it was only for a single night shouldnt really complain , hotel staff were very polite helpful and cheerful hotel itself was absolutley spotless we would definatley consider staying here again in the near future 
513778,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Too noisy Walls door too thin for a four start hotel Having to pay for wifi in 2015 not feasible either, Location good room clean room fairly big given the price
513779,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The staff weren t helpful and tried to give my friend and I a double room not a twin the beds had no support and were uncomfortable to sleep on There was no lock on the bathrooms door and the door handle was hanging off , The locations was ok to get into central London but did have to swap on the tube along the way
513780,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Should warn parking overnight will cost about 40 in their car park although doorman gave great alternative , Good Hotel for weekend break Room adequate in size for London where every inch of space is expensive

513783,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The background noise of plumbing water running through pipes during early part of night We should have asked for a bath when booking, the general efficiency and friendliness of staff was excellent any queries we asked were met with helpful and very polite replies 
513784,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I felt that staff were scrutinising the guests Security no doubt When I went for breakfast I entered the dining room via a back door nearer my room This caused much more distress than it ought to have It was ridiculous and uncomfortable The room I was given was too small I didn t have time to change it or have the endless discussion required so to do , The open spaces in the lobby
513785,Holiday Inn London Kensington, bathroom was rather on the small side not much room to move around in , I liked the location of the hotel has all facilities needed friendly staff always attentive 
513786,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Staff had a very poor level of English and openly showed their discontent of whatever concerned them in front of guests , Location ideal for tube and restaurants

513788,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Small room when requested bigger as we had a child Small bathroom with barely anyspace to sit on the toilet Had to walk sideways to get of this space Bed was tiny Cot for the little one was clean but was rock solid , Location
513789,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Room cleaning was adequate but lots of areas missed No milk for hot drinks Base price of room was OK but absolutely everything else is extra and expensive , Location
513790,Holiday Inn London Kensington, A standard double room was so small the bed was right up to the wall on one side Not ideal to shuffle into The curtain was too short so we were woken at first light , The location
513791,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Room small bed really uncomfortable could feel the springs didn t sleep much and couldn t make TV work rang reception and they said they would activate but never did Breskfast not inc I always thing is so easy jet with the hidden extras that bump up price I have medical condition which means I can t eat very much So spending 12 on half slice of toast and cup of tea seemed a lot , The foyer was very beautiful and the staff that checked us in were pleasant 
513792,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Staff were a little distant Computer issues when I tried to check in made it difficult to use my key card to get into my room , The location and the price 
513793,Holiday Inn London Kensington, room with a view means looking at the back of the hotel area no view at all, the location is fantastic really close to tubes to reach anywhere buffet was very nice although it was cold Best gym ever seen in a hotel with weights appropriate for pro weight lifters

513797,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Initially we were given a room designed for wheelchair access meaning the bathroom facilities were not right for us We mentioned this to reception and they kindly moved our luggage to another room whilst we left for the theatre This would ve been fine except we were given one with twin beds as opposed to the double bed we had booked and as we didn t get back until very late we decided not to mention this to reception It was a shame but other than that it was a very nice hotel Breakfast was great too , Location is very close to Kensington High Street underground Staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel was very nice 
513798,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Found it annoying to have the housekeeper knocking on the door at 5pm to ask if room had been cleaned and was I happy with the it I don t want to be bothered every day by that it is her job to check on the cleaning after it has been done in the morning , Great location
513799,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Having to pay for the wifi and use of the pool after paying to stay in the hotel Many children in the spa pool so it certainly was not relaxing , Christmas Decorations Great Staff

513804,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room was appalling Freezing cold and we couldn t get the heater to work adequately Thin pillows Tiny tiny sink with huge tap led to water splashing on the floor and an inability to wash one s face Very small bath that you couldn t lie down in and I m only 5 4 The deafening extractor fan stayed on for an hour after only being in the bathroom for a few minutes Very expensive Wi Fi without any free time at all Breakfast was chaos we took one look and went elsewhere We ordered a newspaper which didn t arrive and staff weren t too bothered when we told them it hadn t arrived This was repeated the next day despite checking our order They did move us to another room which was warmer but the sink extractor fan and bath of course were the same , The location just off Kengsington High Street was good for our visit Plenty of taxis outside was useful The hotel lobby was roomy with plenty of staff on duty

513818,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Its a bit of a task getting there because the subway station it is closest to is not really very convenient You would have to make a couple of change overs to get anywhere Their business model is based on giving you a stripped down rate with nothing thrown in Fair enough only surprise is that the wifi is charged because even the cheapest hotels nowadays have free wifi , The hotel is a nice and clean property close to a lot of shopping on Kensington High Street The concierge desk was quite helpful and courteous and gave me many insights about travel to various locations in London 
513819,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Really think it s unreasonable to have to pay nearly 10 for 24hrs of internet access I usually stay at The Hoxton they provide free wifi other hotels in Europe I have stayed at also provide this free Would actually prevent me staying there again on principle , Very friendly staff and plenty of them Brilliant location near Kensington High Street Tube Station

513831,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I asked for a room with a bath and was given a room with a shower miles from the lift and being disabled found this quite far they did move us when we complained to a room with more problems the bathroom door was so hard to shut I am disabled but my husband also had great problem sliding it shut as it was rubbing on the outers later that night when I came to have a bath the water just ran away as the plug was broken so no long soak at the end of a hard day we met our business associate in the restaurant for coffee he had to go to out to another meeting so he told the staff to put our food on his bill as he was staying there too this didn t happen we ended up paying for it the food which was very disappointing the veg was so raw I could not eat it the food was barely warm and the meat was tough the breakfast wasn t warm either maybe the bain marie s hadn t been turned up the bed was the smallest double I have seen it didn t fit the base so I kept catching my leg on this also the bottom sheet was too small to tuck in and upon waking noticed the mattress was stained I must say this is the worse hotel experience I have had , the parking was ok Staff where pleasant
513832,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Rooms are very small An executive double room was little more than a cupboard at 16 sq ft We had to pay an extra 120 to have an acceptable standard of room , Convenient for transport into central London Staff were all very friendly and helpful 
513833,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I don t think my room was acceptable Room 5016 There was no light by the bed couldn t read my book there at all Not a pen or a piece of paper in the room They took my own private washing cloth there weren t any in the bathroom at the beginning so where did they think mine came from There was a cold draught from the window right where my head was in the bed I had to turn my head to the other end of the bed when sleeping They asked me how I liked my stay when I checked out I told them in a kind way that I wasn t really happy They said Oh we are sorry to hear that Then they said We hope you will be back soon again I said Hmm I m not so sure Then they just smiled Why didn t they ask me what it was all about So it could be fixed That would have been great service PS Internet for GBP 9 99 Also not cool Naaa not a happy camper , Great location 
513834,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Youve got to bear in mind tghis is London so some of the smaller rooms are not big , Greta value for money and overall a great package and smart hotel feel 
513835,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The spa was not enjoyable because of the chlorine in the water You could nt stay in the jacuzzi because your eyes were smarting after less then a minute , It is close to the city by bus or underground still quiet 
513836,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We stayed 3 nights the first was in a twin room we are both size ten ladies and struggled with the thin beds you were frightened to move in case you fell out The bathroom was very small but was clean We were situated at the front of the hotel and could hear conversations at the door we were on the first floor and the window was closed The bacon was overcooked , On the second night we upgraded to a superior double room the bed was massive the room was huge the bathroom was lovely it was really quiet at the back on the third floor and it was a completely different experience so if you can afford it it would be worth upgrading 
513837,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Limited attractions in area value for money poor Food was poor standard for such a high class hotel and room size was pathetically small and over heard other customers complaining You could hear the two adjoining rooms when they plugged in something or in the bathroom House keeping woke us ever morning at 7am , Location to high street excellent and tube excellent
513838,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Not value for money No draught beers or lagers available at the bar and bottled beverages vastly overpriced , Location was excellent for our requirements

513844,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The bedrooms are very basic with the bedding just comprising a white duvet cover I think that the cost of 155 00 is overpriced and that you should not have to pay the full price of 15 50 if you only require a Continental breakfast , The hotel is located in a very convenient area The Public Rooms of the hotel are well furnished and comfortable 
513845,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I thought the staff in general were very friendly Some were misinformed though and I was told that I had to pay for my wifi when in fact I did not You have one concierge whom you employ called Dimitria something that sounds like that who is a true gem Congratulations to him on his approach his manners and his friendliness However the other concierge Peter I think was the opposite of the above He made us feel very uncomfortable and was down right rude to my colleague , I liked the location The room was on the small side but since we did not spend so much time in the hotel that was ok 
513846,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Room service took quite a while and had to ring again to chase up Other guests were quite noisy banging on doors at 1am which wasn t nice , Brilliant spa very relaxing after a busy saturday and late night Very helpful and friendly staff large spacious room with excellent facilities Very close to high street and tube station Set back so no road noise at all

513872,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The staff were thin on the grounds in the bar area and unfortunately we were left waiting long periods with no drinks The public areas were really well presented clean open and of high quality but beyond the public areas the rooms were disappointing The room was really small and literally only large enough for the bed The room had very poor lighting so it was dark and the ensuite was clearly an afterthought with the shower over the bath pouring water all over the floor as the shower curtain wasn t long enough to reach round the bath The fittings looked tired and there were insufficient toiletries A Premier Inn room would have been a better option given that the room price was over 329 night which is costly given the quality of the room , The public areas are excellent including the facilities restaurant bar etc

513881,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room was tiny the bathroom smaller Charged extra for everything including the SPA which was not made clear at booking and parking The bar closed early and we were charged service charges The doorman was miserable , The breakfast was good 
513882,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The facilities basic facilities like wifi were at an extortionate additional cost 10 day The hotel is marketed with all the pictures and information as having a pool which is why we choose it but the pool cost 8 per access to use Very bait and switch The hair dryer didn t work , The location was great the facilities were great but absolutely everything was at an additional cost so technically for what you book you get very little facilities enless you pay 10 day for wifi or 8 per day to access the pool 
513883,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The elevators are very very slow , The staff is very friendly and accomodating Although there are no fresh vegetable for breakfast Jefferson took care that I get a fresh salad every day Lovely check in with Frederike and check out with Maria Would love to go back one day 
513884,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Bar staff were surly partially I suspect because they had no stock to offer guests They had run out of Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc by the glass on both nights 1 possibly but in London 2 surly someone could have restocked Show complete lack of management , location
513885,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The service was ordinary wasn t even offered nuts or crisps at the bar after ordering pricey drinks When I asked for them they said they had no nuts and couldn t give me crisps because the kitchen was closed Even offered to pay for them This was at 10 00 pm after being out for dinner and wanting a drink at the hotel bar Also over 10 days one of 2 main lifts was out of order and never worked all the time I was was there The breakfast buffet is very ordinary food quality for the price All in all wasn t happy won t stay there again , The location is good
513886,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Our twin room was the size of a closet instead of a real room Very difficult to walk between the wall and the bed to get to my bed The room was quite uncomfortable We had one breakfast in the dining room and I was quite unhappy with it Food and beverage was not hot Staff did not seem to be attentive I won t book this hotel again , Kensington Close is a nice looking hotel on the outside and in the lobby area and is in a great location When I am in London I like to stay in this area because of the proximity of the Tube Station I usually have stayed in another nearby hotel but decided to try Kensington Close this time 
513887,Holiday Inn London Kensington, should have been advised at check in my room was more easily accessable by another lift slow check in out car parking system a bit odd, location cleanliness
513888,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Not quite sure why the Fire Alarm kept going off , Very nice friendly knowledgeable staff really helpful with directions Double room was perfect size Hotel is in a brilliant location and the tube is a 2min walk 
513889,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Location was not great as we visited the O2 during our stay which was a fair distance The rooms were very compact for the price paid , Hotel staff were very friendly and courteous Breakfast was fantastic and reduced price if purchased from reception Close to tube station 
513890,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Our stay began badly as on arrival about 4pm our room was not yet ready and we had to wait an hour or so It seems that the hotel has problems getting enough staff Cleaning of our room was bad despite complaints except on the day when the regular cleaner was obviously off duty Of the two lifts near reception one was out of order for the full week of our stay and another neat the dining room was out of order for four days leaving just two lifts working Luckily we were on the first floor so could use the stairs Service at breakfast was good and the staff friendly but clearing away from tables no longer occupied was not a priority not enough staff , The hotel is convenient if and when the Inner Circle line and District are working 
513891,Holiday Inn London Kensington, 24 hour Charge of almost 10 pounds for internet access and have to go to Reception to collect voucher though when asked the staff did this over the phone , Great Location with easy access to underground and Kensington attractions Staff generally very helpful and customer friendly 
513892,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Only the lack of shelving in the bathroom caused me any problems where to put toiletries bags , Room was a good size the bathroom was compact the shower was great as was the view from my room 
513893,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Paid far more than on previous visits to this hotel but that was due to the rugby World Cup Very disappointed on this occasion The executive double room was poor The en suite was really very small nowhere to put a wash bag and the previous Molton Brown toiletries have been downgraded to Gilchrist Soames and were not replenished during our 3 night stay Nor indeed were the bottled water or milk There was only one mug for two guests Hugely disappointed with the room and housekeeping , Location is perfect Two minute walk from High Street Kensington underground traffic noise minimal 
513894,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Woke up one night by hotel housekeeping but this was rectified by a reduction in bill which they didn t have to do Lourdes was the DM thst next day and noise on street construction min check out day but that s not to be helped, Pure luxury now we didn t go for a fancy room as it was me and my friend If ur a couple I d upgrade and we had executive twin only downside single beds but comfy pillows lovely staff so helpful in anyway possible gym pool amazing 
513895,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We were informed breakfast was 12 each on check in reception didn t clarify that if we didn t prebook the price increased to 17 50 each , Loved the location which is just off the Kensington high street
513896,Holiday Inn London Kensington, At check in I was told my room was a large room with a large bathroom It turned out it was an accessible room This was a shock They changed it They give you a luggage rack and a fridge only if you ask I asked They gave me a fridge that was not working I called to complain None of the numbers answered the phone not even emergencies , Nothing really For all this money I could have stayed at a much better hotel The Manager did listen to my complaints but a guest should not have to complain in order to get value for all that money they charged 
513897,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The bed was separately although I ask Queen bed The very small room The pastry not well baked 700 room and one recipient officer I waited fir 20 minutes to check out and I am heading to the airport , Nothing
513898,Holiday Inn London Kensington, They only problem is the size of the room I booked an executive double room The bad was a king size one perfect but there was no space to move in the room Veerry very tiny , The hotel is very big and a bit noisy I really liked that it was very clean 
513899,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Refuse to pay extra for wifi it would be smarter to build free wifi into a slightly higher room rent For a cup of coffee or a short walk there is a better deal just up the road Just travelled throughout Brittany and free wifi all the way in hotels Lack of attention to detail by housekeeping basin plug broken desk lamp not working Tv cut off at 8 am Wrong check out time on housekeeping list Didn t bother me but the rooms and bathrooms are small As a single traveller that could be the reason my rooms over two stays were weeny Wouldn t have wanted to be a couple or much fatter , Location Cleanliness Lively Super pool
513900,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Slow reception staff Mainly because of large air crew parties often checking in together mRoom key kept failing and card had to be reset a few times as wouldn t open door , Location Quiet room 
513901,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The male staff member in the lounge area was rude and only wanted you to sit there if you had paid for something from the bar Considering the lounge is massive with plenty of space and seats and no customers he came across as a jobs worth After all we were paying guests of the hotel and spa , The swimming pool is long and you can swim properly and do lengths The pool did have children s swimming classes so if you are anti children you may not get the full spa experience The cooked breakfast was lovely and staff let you know when breakfast was closing so you could get the food 
513902,Holiday Inn London Kensington,No Negative, My stay was absolutely wonderful The staff were so helpful the room was absolutely spotless and very comfortable and I hope to return in the future 
513903,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Cracked sink in bathroom room so small an Executive Double but not big enough for 2 suitcases and 2 people Room noisy but better than last time a stayed here when there was a knife fight outside my room in the middle of the night I should have known better than to give it another try , Nothing
513904,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We have stayed several times at the Hotel but on this stay were allocated a very small room I asked to be changed if possible and the desk staff found another standard double room which was only marginally better Be warned if the room numbers have double zero eg 2008 as there is only squeeze room around the bed on two sides and no room for two suit cases We have travelled around the uk and Europe for 15 months and were not impressed by the room size A disappointing stay , The location to High Street Kensington tube station and parks 
513905,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Terrible food which took over an hour and arrived with half missing and cold Very little apology from equally cold staff when we politely complained about time and taste They also charged and extra 10 for wifi which was not excepted from a hotel of this size and cost , great location for last minute price 
513906,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Wifi cuts out a lot and the hotel is dated and dismal , Staff are always great and see to work really hard I think the appearance and general cleanliness of the hotel lets it down but not their attitude or approach to work 
513907,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Requested alarm call it didn t come most disappointing indicates an unreliable standard from the hotel Timing can be important to a guest , A comfortable bed in a cupboard size of a room Very clean room The helpful room staff on the seventh floor where I was staying Also helpful the porters at the front door 
513908,Holiday Inn London Kensington, One of the other guests came back late and was very noisy in the corridor One of his friends came banging on his door at 5 30 a m then again at 6 00 a m shouting in the corridor to try and wake him up If the hotel picked it up on their security cameras they surely did nothing to stop the door banging Use of the spa facilities was supposed to be included in the price but I had to pay GBP8 per day when using the pool facilities , Very friendly staff and really good restaurant with excellent service The food was excellent as well 
513909,Holiday Inn London Kensington, There was an exceptionally long queue in reception and not one word of sorry for waiting I think some customer service training is required There seemed to be long queues at reception quite a lot Also room was very dated even though paid for upgrade , Great location Good value for money
513910,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Rooms were small the bathroom door wouldn t close property and you had to pay extra for WiFi, Great location besides the underground lovely spa and bar
513911,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The room was too small for its price The wifi was not free which is ridiculous And the gym facilities were not free If i was paying for a hotel i d expect all facilities to be included , I liked the location it was a 4 minute walk to the High Street Kensignton Station I liked the staff and receptionists were very friendly 
513912,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The bedroom 534 was a ri diculous size not standard at all The bathroom was too small to dry yourself comfortably after a shower and the toilet was tucked in a corner so difficult to use and im a size 12 anyone bigger would struggle , The staff were very polite and service was good Hotel delighful dining experience was very good and food excellent would stay again and recomend but in a different room Excellent location
513913,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We were hoping to use the pool and spa area as i expected this to be included in the price however there was an additional charge of 16 00 per day for the two of us this was not clear when i booked with booking com Disappointing , It was a very nice hotel in a good area nice and quiet 
513914,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The fact that both wifi and spa swimming pool were separate fees per person We were upgraded to double executive because we were celebrating a birthday so the wifi was included apparently But still these days we thought extremely expensive for 9 99 pp and we would not have paid it anyway We didn t use the pool either on principle Air conditioning in our room seemed very slow so glad we didn t have a heatwave that day as such , Staff were very helpful at all times especially on both Reception and Concierge and Luca was extremely helpful Breakfast food was superb although it should have been included in the room rate
513915,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Would have liked a bar fridge in the room It s convenient to grab a drink or a snack rather than calling room service Milk and coffee not replaced daily had to call room service on more than one occasion , Location and excellent concierge service They were very helpful 
513916,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The spa facilities were poor and a little shabby Also some of the decor was a little worn Terrible marks on carpets , The food and relaxation was lovely The staff very friendly 
513917,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I really don t understand how this is a 4 hotel On this stay when checking in and out there were people complaining to reception about different things It s always dirty and noisy here , Location
513918,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Charging for wifi is the height of meanness Am now travelling in France and each hotel is offering free wifi at least in public spaces if not in the rooms , Excellent pool 
513919,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I didn t like that to use the pool you have to pay 8 each extra It should be included in the price since being 130 a night , I liked the environment and the customer service was excellent The staff are very helpful and polite The pool and jacuzzi was enjoyable Overall we really enjoyed our stay and Kensington is a beautiful area itself 
513920,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We were cutting it fine getting to breakfast but weren t made to feel very welcome All the breakfast items were cleared away very quickly If breakfast closes at 10am surely the hotel expect guests to be still there at 10 30 but we felt we had to rush away , The staff were wonderful The doormen were charming and most helpful The desk clerks were welcoming and the staff in the spa were very friendly and room service was excellent 
513921,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Disappointed that we up graded our room and I feel it was no different that a standard room Felt room was very small, Location and general standard of hotel
513922,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I could not find anything nice in the room to look at from the first minute I was in the room I regretted booking in that hotel The next morning I checked out to move to the hotel next door , Nothing 
513923,Holiday Inn London Kensington, When we arrived they initially said we did not have a reservation so that took 20 minutes to sort out No mention of children s swimming lessons in the pool so we paid 8 each for a noisy toy cluttered pool The Spa could not find my booking despite after the massage giving us the receipt and were rude They said we had not booked breakfast despite already paying for it and that took another 20 minutes to sort out by which time the food was cold and congealed , Nothing 
513924,Holiday Inn London Kensington, It was a twin room but for a couple this room will be very small Pity you only have 24h Wifi for free Hotels should offer free Wifi through the whole of your stay , Quiet room good buffet breakfast
513925,Holiday Inn London Kensington, In my booking it said free wifi yet I was never given a code or anything and had forgotten till the morning so was pointless by then The car park attendant needs a lesson in manors and how to talk to people and how to smile he was the only real disappointment in the whole visit and annoyed me massively with the way he spoke to me when I tried to park in the underground car park thankfully your staff in the hotel made up for it, The staff in the hotel couldn t have been more pleasant and helpful each time I spoke to any of them 
513926,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Had to request that the rooms be made up Bed not properly made up had to remake our beds everyday Extractor in bathroom not working , All staff were very eager to help wonderful to be greeted at the door and be helped with taxi 
513927,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The reception would not take Scottish notes and told us it was not real money The bar and room service however were happy to accept payment in our Scottish money There was a long wait to check in and the reception staff were slow , Room service in particular the man who brought it was delightful Door men were great 
513928,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I did two category of bookings The first was double which was not very nice as I had stayed in similar category the first time Secondly single room I booked was in an area where the Wi Fi of the hotel was poor , location and internet access in the business centre

513933,Holiday Inn London Kensington, My husband and I both opted for a Kensington Club Sandwich in the bar area which was disappointing as we were not given an option as to what bread we wanted and there was no egg mayonnaise and there was traces of egg shell also the toast was burnt When I tried to explain to the waitress she didn t understand what I was trying to say , Very helpful staff and informative Breakfasts were very good Front desk and doorman very helpful 
513934,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We upgraded to a superior room which was two singles pushed together so I spent the night sleeping on a dip The ad on booking said Molton brown products which they weren t We also went for a more expensive hotel as they had the spa and were very disapointed to have to pay an extra charge of 8 a day to use the facilities even whilst Being customers Very disappointing ,No Positive

513940,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I did pay quite a lot of money as a special treat for me and my son so I was expecting it to be the teeniest bit more opulent particularly the luxury room which was not as big as it seemed in the photo And there could have been a bit of variation in the breakfast However on the whole I had a very nice time ,No Positive
513941,Holiday Inn London Kensington, While I appreciate I paid for a fairly cheap room within the hotel I did expect something a little larger The room was very compact smaller than an equivalent room in a Premier Inn or Travelodge , Staff were incredibly polite and professional and the room was beautifully clean and well presented Short walk 3 4 minutes from the nearest tube station meaning travel was incredibly easy
513942,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The bathroom is very very small the toilet seat space is very small less than one meter you can not take your rest in the bathroom The service is so slow we requested a tooth kit and we didn t get it till now , location not far from
513943,Holiday Inn London Kensington, We booked and paid for a Superior room The room that we got was so minuscule that it was almost fully occupied by the bed Two people could not move around the room at the same time and in no way could this be described as Superior , Excellent High St Ken location
513944,Holiday Inn London Kensington, the drinks prices at the bar were very expensive and to receive a service charge on top was a bit of a rip off the first time I have felt like that on numerous trips to London, the friendliness of the staff and the clean and comfortable room
513945,Holiday Inn London Kensington, As we walked in the receptionist greeted us saying We have updated your rooms we did not get updated rooms so what was the point of this remark , fresh fruit for breakfast and soya milk available Vey friendly and helpful staff Beautifully clean and a very comfortable bed Lovely sitting areas in the lounge bar and waiting areas room for using wifi 
513946,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The hotel did not provide any information in the room and enquiries had to be made about check out time and facilities Wifi was included with the room however required a user name and password which was not supplied until reception was queried Despite being an executive suite the room did not have an iron or ironing board which took numerous calls to have supplied , Great location
513947,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Large noise of shutting room doors in the moorning Lots of types of pork meats but no lamp and checkins in the breakfast , Locatio Staff Swiming pool Interance lobby Service
513948,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Having stayed a couple of times each room is always dirty from pubic hair on the bedding on arrival this time and a bath towel with a dodgy stain on , The location is great and I am put up here by work Had I a personal choice I think I would look further I m sure the facilities advertised are great but so costly compared to other hotels in the area that offer the same for free

513950,Holiday Inn London Kensington, staff very unhealpful especially with regard to car park payments ability to swop notes for coins to pay the meter unhealpfullness with issues raised ie no ownership of problem just a straight no leaving us stuck with the issue spa had no availabiltiy for massages etc completly defented the point of booking a spa hotel mens changing room in repair so the hotel seems to think walking from the spa to a hotel room on the first floor in just swim shorts which were dripping wet after swimming was an acceptable soultion it was embarresing and frustrating also linked with that no mens toilet facility in the spa area so again back to the first floor hotel room , location nice bed swimming pool
513951,Holiday Inn London Kensington, car parking to expensive almost cost of extra 2 nights hotel room WiFi has to be paid 10 4 star hotel should be offering complimentary WiFi as standard , Location and cleanliness was great
513952,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Paying 9 pound a day for wifi paying 8 pound for use of the pool being told there was a fee of 1 pound to use a locker For heaven sake And housekeeping staff very slack Did they really think two people should share a bathtowel and 2 teabags to last 6 days , Location of the hotel and ease of using public transport to get around Hotel was lovely and the staff at the desk very helpful 
513953,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The lifts they need to improve their maintainance because having a room on the 5th floor can mean either a lot of waiting or a lot of stairs , The location of the place is superb for connectivity and for an early morning run in the park 5 mins away The staff is kind and helpful though not particularly warm at reception The bed was comfortable and the toilet spacious compared to the size of the room
513954,Holiday Inn London Kensington, Following the fire alarm sounding instead of immediate evacuation some guests chose to loiter in the foyer and some even stopped in the main entrance to take selfies as the majority of guests behind them were trying to make a swift exit Fortunately it wasn t a fire but they didn t know this , For London it was well priced good location for central areas and also has a secure car park

513957,Holiday Inn London Kensington, The lifts were very small and one was broken As we were on the first floor we just took the stairs Also the swimming pool and sauna are charged at 8 per day this should be made more clear before booking , All the staff at kc hotel were fantastic very friendly and professional The location of the hotel is ideal too At the end of a long day we were grateful that it was only a short stroll from High Street Kensington station

513962,Holiday Inn London Kensington,No Negative, Helpful pleasant staff Others have complained about room size Yes the room was compact but very nice clean and comfortable Unfortunately most major cities are expensive to stay in especially if you want nice suuroundings facilities If I was travelling with my wife I would have upgraded to a larger room suite It s all relative and about choosing for your needs budget

513965,Holiday Inn London Kensington, I don t believe this should be a 4 star hotel I initially had to swap rooms as the first had what appeared to be mould on the bedsheets and the carpet was nearly threadbare In the second room the air con didn t work properly frustrating in August The bed was creaky and uncomfortable and I later discovered a thick dark hair in the bedding Disgusting , Location and transport links were fantastic Some of the staff were enthusiastic and helpful
