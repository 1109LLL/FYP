431453,Hotel mbit Barcelona, As the wash basin and toilet area had no doors or walls so a bit awkward if travelling with a friend due to no privacy The we was located in another part anoth a door so that gave the privacy when doing my business , The rooms with a terrace although more suitable for couples 
431454,Hotel mbit Barcelona, The modern style went a bit too far with the open concept shower in the middle of the room You may like it Rooms were a bit small but that is to be expected in a city hotel , Friendly helpful staff Bright clean rooms Modern appointments Plentiful breakfast buffet Very near Placa Catalunya Las Ramblas and the Gothic quarter

431464,Hotel mbit Barcelona, Wi fi connection was average at best depending on the location you were having within the room The rooms are rather small for the price they re charging and from the pictures that are publicly displayed on its page you cannot quite tell the dimension of the room Breakfast was ok but fairly standard with too little variation whatsoever The AC system is coordinated at a central level and even if you play around with its settings you do end up either with a too hot or with a too cold room the air flow being continuous , Location is fairly central near to all Barcelona s main attractions and landmarks The personnel is very friendly and helpful The room is comfortable and has all the basic facilities that you would expect from a 4 star hotel

431477,Hotel mbit Barcelona, Honestly nothing really comes to mind a first for a hotel stay , The room design is the best I ve ever seen in a hotel you can see into the shower stall from the bedroom if you want there s a blind you can use to obscure the view if necessary all the power outlets are high off the ground and the furniture in the balcony is quick dry 
431478,Hotel mbit Barcelona, On booking there was a question about wanting quiet room which I didn t choose should have done as had terrace overlooking a childrens play area school yard thus view from terrace not really what was expected and being woken by children playing wasn t ideal am start It didn t spoil it significantly though, very comfortable tastfully designed room

431486,Hotel mbit Barcelona, I would have liked a room with a balcony or some sort of view but as a man who travels a lot with my young son we re used to being shoved off into a dark corner of the hotel but it s a small negative because our stay was enjoyable , I liked the location central but quiet I enjoyed the free coffee and the comfortable lounge area my Son loved the hot chocolate but best of all were the staff nothing was too much trouble for them and always very helpful

431489,Hotel mbit Barcelona, Only that the cleaners started their tour as early as 8am so you have to make sure to put up a do not disturb sign if you re not up early , The location was excellent I chose the single room because I knew it would oversee a quiet courtyard I also specificially asked for a quiet room and ended up on the 5th floor with no noise at all Perfect 
431490,Hotel mbit Barcelona, No lobby and small selection of TV programs But since Barcelona has so much to offer these things can be neglected , Hotel is located close to several touristic locations with many bars and restauranrs in the area Access to public transportations is also excellent Wifi in the first level worked perfectly well

431495,Hotel mbit Barcelona, The room was a bit small but being in town for such a short time who needs to stay in the room for purposes other than for sleeping , It is very close to the center yet away from the hassle traffic noise crowds etc that comes with it 
431496,Hotel mbit Barcelona, The size of the room and the bathroom was shocking at first and the style of decor high tech in a rather depressing colour scheme contributed to it My single room overlooked a tiny courtyard but it was quiet as a result so because of this and general good standard I liked it , Central location clean very helpful and cheerful staff very comfortable big bed with good quality linen a common terrace where I could have a cigarette with complimentary coffee fresh renovation nice Christmas tree Quiet for the centre of Bcn good wifi Good special price offer I could stay there again
431497,Hotel mbit Barcelona, The only thing that I could say keeps me from giving this a 10 0 is the restroom situation , The staff was excellent Nacho and Ernest in particular were very helpful and welcoming And there are great cafes on every corner It was close enough to tourist spots but far enough away that barcelonas authenticiy comes through 
431498,Hotel mbit Barcelona, The balcony faces a school playgrounds very noisy in the morning The fridge only had water A single bottle of champu was the only toiletries provided no soup , The bath with hydromassage system The breakfast The free still water 80 night

431505,Hotel mbit Barcelona, The school behind the hotel sometimes created noise Especially when adults were playing on the basketball courts at night It was hard to shut out their noise , The staff the convenience to everything all day coffee price of breakfast 
431506,Hotel mbit Barcelona, There was no hood in the toilet but even a toilet freshener and a toilet brush either It was disturbing that the bathroom was in the room and the door was completely transparent glass there was no cover on its surface Although we hang out the do not disturb sign the air condition cleaning staff knocked on the door The last day before we left they didn t replace the run out paper tissues and didn t put up toilet paper either Unfortunately the daily cleaning didn t include mopping the floor although it was spotty And a small thing it would be nice if the hotel can obtain a balance to measure the luggages to avoid repacking them at the airport due to the weight limit , The staff especially at the reception and the breakfast was very kind and attentive They tried to fulfil every requests The breakfast was very plentiful and varied Brand new renewed hotel Constantly available free coffee machine is a small but very kind attention

431517,Hotel mbit Barcelona, Nothing bad Just note that there are no tea and coffee facilities in the room There is a free coffee machine in the breakfast room but it only runs at certain times if you have an early checkout i e before the 7am breakfast you ll need to find a coffee elsewhere , The staff were so welcoming and accommodating Very professional and eager to help Some of the best I ve come across The room was modern and very clean if a little basic in amenities

431524,Hotel mbit Barcelona, In the shower there is a glass wall meaning you can see the shower and toilet from the bed Not the best for non couples Not the best for couples as well The breakfast is nice could be better but was fine , Location location location 5 minutes walk from everything while not being in the middle of the noise Great location The staff were very kind and our entire experience was very good 
431525,Hotel mbit Barcelona, not sure how well the fittings will age as they look easily damaged , conveniently situated to the sights and to the airport bus room was all newly decorated and although compact was more than adequate for a short stay 
431526,Hotel mbit Barcelona, It was weird that there was a glass panel between the shower and the room because the neighbors could see everything what you are doing when the curtains are open But also as two friends it is weird to see each other naked Maybe it s possible to place a foil on the glass but if I went with my partner I wouldn t mind So it s not really a bad thing just something to think about , The staff was very helpfull and well educated When you enter the hotel they stand up and greet you even when they re working on the computer I ve never seen that in a hotel Also the breakfast was amazing All fresh products and you could take coffee tea whenever you want all day long In the reservation I mentioned it would be my 22nd birthday the day I would arrive As result we got two mini bottles of Codorn u in the mini bar what we really appreciated
