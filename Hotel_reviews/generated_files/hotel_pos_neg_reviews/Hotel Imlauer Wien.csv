435579,Hotel Imlauer Wien, They offered an upgrade which was bundled with late check in larger room and reduced price breakfast It would be better to upgrade each item for a separate price instead so we And get a better value, We liked the hotel location Everything was clean and as expected The front desk was very helpful

435594,Hotel Imlauer Wien, The pillows are too soft , Its a good location quiet and there are closeby restaurants and stores The staff were helpful when we asked them to check the temperature of the room 
435595,Hotel Imlauer Wien, Not all stuff members were that nice Neighborhood is not the most fascinating It needs a good walk down the river to see interesting places , Room was more than perfect clean and fully supplied Breakfast was really good as well with lots of options The neighborhood is a classic Viennese one close to the center 
435596,Hotel Imlauer Wien, I was given a quite small room for standard double room I was given a room with a lot less space since I have a huge wall cutting off the space of the room Looks really different from the picture location is not too close to the city center requires minimum walk of 20 minutes location is also a bit hidden in a small alley that does not feel safe at night At one point the electricity in my room went off and only after I called the reception that they got this fixed AC works centrally so If you feel warm you can t turn it on , bar was okay freebie to drink at the bar if you did not request for a housekeeping service bedding was comfy clean staff were nice 
435597,Hotel Imlauer Wien, The internet network was not too good Besides that the breakfast or atleast tea should be included in the charged amount , Loved the clean rooms and the comfortable beds 
435598,Hotel Imlauer Wien,No Negative, Everything was just absolutly perfect It s the second time we visited Imlauer and we were not let down The rooms are great the beds are really comfortable the staff are amazingly nice and the breakfast and coffee is just great The hotel is in walking distance from the old city including the Stephans Dom but there is also a few public transport options closeby This is a really great place to stay when visiting Vienna 
435599,Hotel Imlauer Wien, the reception and breakfast area looked run down there were no fresh towels no slippers or robes for the spa nor room service, The staff seemed friendly enough the rooms were new and clean wifi loaded quickly
435600,Hotel Imlauer Wien, The spa space is not very well done and there is a lack of indications inside the hotel, The staff was nice the location is good the hotel is spacious
435601,Hotel Imlauer Wien, Could have done with more teabags in the room but was easily sorted by asking reception , Beds were comfy and the room was very clean Very quiet hotel Short walk to 2 metro stations red and purple line which was so handy Close to a few nice restaurants We didn t have breakfast at the hotel but the bar and restaurant area looked lovely 
435602,Hotel Imlauer Wien, The shower was not hot and strong enough the water at the sink was so there was something wrong with the shower itself We only stayed for one night so we didn t ask for it to be fixed untill afterwards or for another room Overall it was a nice hotel , Nice location only 10 15 min walk to city center Metro and tram stop 1 minute walk and a few shops and bakeries around the corner The room was spacious and i liked the bathroom it was big and clean 
435603,Hotel Imlauer Wien,No Negative, Friendly personnel and eager to offer information and assistance the reception can make all your reservations taxi calls etc that you will need during your stay in Vienna There is a very nice bar coffee area The room was very clean plus the hotel has a voucher type of environmental policy offering one 5 euro voucher for the bar for each day one wishes to skip housekeeping service 
435604,Hotel Imlauer Wien, There was a lack of temperature control in the room , The hotel was easy walking distance into central Vienna but also in an interesting neighbourhood with great bars and restaurants nearby Great value and easily accessible for transport links to get around the city with u banh tram and trains within minutes As a small hotel the rooms were of a standard You would see for a large hotel group 
435605,Hotel Imlauer Wien, nothing , very central nice neighbourhood private parking spot room was fantastic bathroom incredible i m very picky with showers staff very helpful and kind
435606,Hotel Imlauer Wien, For the hotel to be so affordable to say at everything else about it was pricey Breakfast laundry service mini bar water lol other then that I very much enjoyed my stay at this hotel , The location isn t exactly in the center of town but it is situated next to two underground stations and one big train station so that you can get around Vienna no problem 
435607,Hotel Imlauer Wien, Mini bar expensive A bath in the room would have been nice also Only minor points though , Fantastic staff Good location Nice breakfast Room nice and clean 
435608,Hotel Imlauer Wien, Nothing , This was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at Not only was the location great the room was well facilitated Clean great strong shower comfortable bed and cosy heating during winter Breakfast variety was also great Bar was excellent and staff extremely well mannered and helpful There was one staff members name Amy Millet or Miller that should definitely receive some form of customer service reward or something for her excellent service and assistance to us 
435609,Hotel Imlauer Wien, Breakfast include only one type of coffee, It was near to the metro and you can go everywhere Quiet warm hotel and very clean Internet was very fast and personnel was friendly 
435610,Hotel Imlauer Wien, The location was a bit off the centre takes some time to get in and out if you want to walk The room service were noisy since the morning you could hear the vacuum cleaner hitting the walls they talk with a very loud voice There were some strange noises at night coming from the walls seemed like heating related but it was annoying The staff were helpful but didn t seem exactly keen they seemed too serious and not very friendly , Very nice big bed the room was clean and large 
435611,Hotel Imlauer Wien, Receptionists were not helpful Even simple questions as where is the nearest pharmacy open they did not bother to help , The rooms the breakfast cleaness 
435612,Hotel Imlauer Wien, Some of the staff members at the reception seemed a bit short tempered Nothing major but could have been warmer , The bed was comfortable Very comfortable 
435613,Hotel Imlauer Wien, Outdated hairdryer and no extras complimentary gels lotions within the bathroom to help make the stay feel more welcoming and easy on the travelcare needs Hotel bar open late From the outside it s deceiving As it s seems a simple hotel but Hotel is warm and friendly on a positive turn , Large room all equipment and air con heating in good working order nice bed ability to get fresh air by openable windows There is a great bar to the right of the front of hotel next door that is open late as is not labelled but a great spot for a late drink away from hotel 
435614,Hotel Imlauer Wien, We had two minor problems The first was about the inconsistency of the Wifi service within the hotel and our room This is becoming a typical problem we encounter and so I use the hot spot feature on my smart phone when the hotel s service is fussy The second is a no harm no foul story I had asked the hotel to arrange car service from the airport to the hotel they did and we were met by a very energetic driver who moved through the substantial traffic like Nikki Lauder the race car driver However upon arrival at the hotel he asked for 50 euros instead of the 39 euro quote from the hotel We came to a very quick understanding in spite of the driver s gradually disappearing English He took 40 euros with a smile but did not help carry the luggage up the stairs A couple of days later when I felt comfortable with the staff I mentioned the incident to the hotel s apparent manager who wanted more information and for the remainder of our stay apologized on behalf of the hotel and the car service whose owner wanted to know who that driver might have been I explained that no harm had been done and that as travelers we expect these sorts of things and just wanted the hotel to know what happened for the benefit of future guests who might not be so understanding , We selected this hotel because of its price and advertised amenities we did not require its having a restaurant but did want a bar so this met our needs coming in and exceeded our expectations after spending 4 nights Our room was very comfortable as were the beds The staff was excellent in making recommendations for three restaurants that were within a quick walk which was important in the very cold and somewhat wet weather we encountered I have written reviews of these three on Trip Advisor Leopold Skopik Lohn and El Hans While we did order breakfast in the room on one morning we enjoyed venturing out into the neighborhood for breakfasts on the other mornings just pastries coffee tea and yogurt 
435615,Hotel Imlauer Wien, The building has many halls which can be a bit confusing until you get used , We had a relaxing stay in the clean and confortable rooms and we enjoyed walking to the city center as the hotel is situated at 15 minutes by foot 
435616,Hotel Imlauer Wien, the breakfast is very expensive that is why we were staying without, good location very nice room spacious family room there might be free parking for the weekend nice facilities for gym and sauna
435617,Hotel Imlauer Wien, Didn t like the wooden floors as you could hear the maids walking about in the mornings At the end of our stay we were nearly charged for bottles of water from the room which we never used drank Just keep an eye out on that when you stay There was also miscommunication at the end of our stay as the staff member at reception tried to make us repay for our stay even though we paid at the start This was resolved quickly , The room was modern looking and the shower was great Amazing location Would definitely stay here again 
435618,Hotel Imlauer Wien, Room in the ground floor close to the reception with windows directly on the street so no privacy at all fortunately a quiet street, good location free WIFI clean room and very nicely furbished all in all a very good price service hotel

435620,Hotel Imlauer Wien, There was a small stain on the pillow case Perhaps the bed linen could be renewed However as there were many pillows to use it was not that much of a problem , The breakfast was good and coffee was served for each table which was pleasant I slept very well as there weren t any noises at all This is the place to be when you are looking for peaceful place to stay 
435621,Hotel Imlauer Wien, I liked it all Perhaps a tad pricier than I would have wished but I didn t mind , The bed was most comfortable The location is convenient and quiet And the bathroom was exemplary 
435622,Hotel Imlauer Wien, The lack of complimentary drinking water and bedroom slippers , The quiet attic room which was given and the friendly and responsive staff at reception It s nearer on foot from Taborstrasse rather than Nestroplatz station as informed by hotel 
435623,Hotel Imlauer Wien, Nothing There are great options for breakfasts close by the hotel which are much cheaper It was important for us to find smoke free places they are there if you look , The location in Leopoldplatz is a little off the beaten track but still an easy walk to the main parts of town We liked the less touristy more authentic neighborhood Liked that it was very quiet even though the area is quite busy Couldn t fault service thanks 
435624,Hotel Imlauer Wien, I was there twice and there is a difference between the new room and the old one It is better to have a room not using the lift near the reception, A good position near the city center
435625,Hotel Imlauer Wien,No Negative, Superior location about 10 mins walk to the very centre of the city Parking garage available for additional 24 eur per day fee Very clean cozy friendly stuff Tasty breakfast as well Recommend this hotel for sure if you want to explore Vienna in few days with a convenient service at reasonable cost 
435626,Hotel Imlauer Wien, Lack of the bath wraps, Nice and cosy atmosphere friendly staff very comfortable bed clean room garage very tasty and various breakfast Everything was nice and as per expectations A place to be reccomended also by being so close to Prater and Stephansdom A place to go back 
435627,Hotel Imlauer Wien, Wayyyyy overpriced I got a booking com discount but I would have been really upset if I paid the normal price This is nowhere near a 4 Gym is only opened 7 00 11 00pm which is useless if you get up early and have to work No restaurant in the hotel either Overall very disappointing , Rooms are nice but mainly quiet TV level is blocked so neighbors will not make noises
435628,Hotel Imlauer Wien, Located in a quiet residential area you have to walk a bit to get anywhere Situated between two subway stations but you have to walk a few minutes to reach them , Rather large room clean and well maintained Helpful and friendly staff 
435629,Hotel Imlauer Wien, Although the hotel claimed there was free wifi The wifi did not work I was relying very heavily on the wifi for my work and was extreme disappointed and frustrated that it wasn t working properly The staff was very accommodating and came up t the room to try to help but it didn t make a difference ,No Positive

435634,Hotel Imlauer Wien, One staff member was rude and the assistant manager had attitude defending her which was unpleasant The rest of the staff were lovely and the place nice , I paid for a good room so enjoyed the comfort of this Most of the staff were friendly and good They did try to make me feel better and welcome

435636,Hotel Imlauer Wien, Location of the room right by the street noisy and smoke coming in constantly Breakfast is ok but too expensive for what it is Too basic toiletries no body lotion , Friendly staff decoration of the room Coffee Tea facilities in the room 
435637,Hotel Imlauer Wien, Didn t like the pillows very soft Asked the reception for firm ones but said they didn t have a different kind Offered to give us two extra pillows of the same kind which didn t do the trick either 24 hours without hor water When I asked the reception in the morning they said it was a technical problem and that they would have fixed it by the same evening However the problem remained no hot water in the evening either I had to wait until the next morning to take a shower On the last day of our 4 nights stay wifi didn t work at all although it was working well the days before When askink the reception they said they had fixed it but it still wasn t working Breakfast was way too expensive 19 EUR per person didn t try it preferred to have breakfast at the viennese cafes instead , Big room very tasteful decoration Big bathroom Comfortable bed Good location close to metro station

435640,Hotel Imlauer Wien, We paid 200 per night which is pretty much for the room we got First we booked a junior suite with balcony was very important and didnt get one they let us sleep in an other junior suite which was really terrible For excuse we get a voucher for two drinks which seems like a big joke cause the room was really not comparable with the room next day we get We re really disappointed cause is a good name hotel and we can t believe that we paid for so much for this creepy room , Nice junior suite
435641,Hotel Imlauer Wien, I wanted to join their effort by not having the room or towels cleaned changed every day on the 3rd day we left the sign out by front door knob so they can clean and replenish they did not and had to call to tell them our tiny garbage cans were overflowing we needed some soap shampoo and towels , staff was great and helpful
