234779,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch,No Negative, Managed to get a much earlier check in than was booked for The hotel has a pretty good location with easy access to tube and Liverpool St station There was free coffee in reception that was pretty good and there was access to a wetherspoons where a full English breakfast can be bought for a about 10 less than the hotel charge 
234780,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Parking parking and parking , London hotels are hit and miss at best and this one is no different It s a converted something else building The conversion has been well done though Having a small front entrance on a very busy London street meant arriving at night in the rain by car was very difficult There is NO parking the closest parking lot is quite a hike away and VERY expensive 40GPB per day The shower was a little narrow but the water pressure was very good 
234781,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, We didn t really use any of the facilities within the hotel such as the gym and business centre or wifi so can t advise how good or bad they were The duvet cover on our extra child bed was not ironed and the TV in the room didn t work however as we were not in the room for long to watch TV it wasn t a huge problem for us , Great location and room at the rear of the hotel meant that we were not aware of the traffic so had a great sleep Sara at reception was very nice too 
234782,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Nothing, Location is perfect hotel is very clean and modern Staff are very helpful Complimentary tea and coffee station and water just added that extra special touch I have used this accommodation my last 2 visits to London and will continue to stay here on further trips
234783,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch,No Negative, It was my 30th Birthday and the guy that checked us in had a bottle of wine placed in the room which was a lovely touch The check in process and check out process was very straight forward and the rooms were as expected The beds were enormous and very comfy 
234784,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Eaten alive by bed bugs the first night when they changed rooms and second night much better Staff dealt with the problem efficiently which was excellent , Staff and friendly service
234785,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, We weren t told before checking in that the hotel take a pre payment so essentially being charged twice and taking 7 days to return to my bank , The location was great and accessible
234786,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Parking is off sight and a littel walk away , great location friendly helpful staff Booked the Queen room and there was ample space for the two of us Bonus was a Weatherspoons next door 
234787,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Sink in bathroom was a bit smelly could do with something like a sink and plughole cleaning foam Toilet took a long time to fill after flush , Great location air con was a must and well used Comfy bed and good facilities in reception including tea coffee and breakfast bars 
234788,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, An ill thought out reception which consisted of screens and card issuing gadget Had to ask for an extra pillow , Location is excellent and given that the room we had 724 was quiet
234789,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, We travelled with our 5 year old granddaughter The extra single bed was unfortunately unsleepable The mattress was too thin I tried it resulting in the metal underneath protruding through Very uncomfortable Also considering the 25 degree temperature a room fridge would have been ideal for water etc , The wifi was excellent even on the 7th floor as we were probably the best I ve come across in my extensive travels Staff were very good It was soon identified that the extra single bed was overlooked and would be remedied immediately which it was The location was good near to St Pauls Cathedral 
234790,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Room could do with a better clean shower still had remnants of last occupant , Was pleasantly surprised at the size of the room Very quiet no noise from outside or corridors could be heard Staff very helpful and welcoming 
234791,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Bathroom size a bit too small eating facilities lack of choice for special dietary needs , The main bed was amazingly comfy but the extra bed was not at all Excellent a c free filtered water bottles and friendly and helpful staff Lovely complimentary toiletries Live music an added bonus 
234792,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, When booking it said 141 00 including breakfast but when we came to paying they put on 23 60 for VAT then charged us for breakfast another 26 89 so a total of 168 49 When we went down to breakfast we were told a cooked breakfast with eggs would cost 15 00 each but continenal breakfast was free yet they charged us for it Not happy will be contacting them , The room was clean tidy lovely 
234793,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The bed was very small 1 5 rather than double bed the room was a bit dusty I wasnt also sure whether the blanket cover was changed after each guest fabric seemed to suggest that it wasnt which is not very hygienic , I liked the lobby Also liked the plastic bottles and the water machine to fill them up in the corridors The location is very good 
234794,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, I think I was tricked into booking this place as a hotel it s not a hotel it s a building that hires out rooms no easy parking not food after hours no staff to look after you to speak of that said the daytime guy was fine , Location
234795,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, a bit of confusion on the actual booking regarding the inclusion of breakfast or not think that needs to be more clear on the website, great location comfy beds well stocked
234796,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, there wasn t anything i didn t like, this is my second stay here and it s very clean the bed is very comfy and has everything you need including tea and coffee making i would definitely recommend and stay again 
234797,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The staff on check in were abrupt regarding th different in payment something about a deposit on top of the room fee I was left standing at the check in desk while they checked someone else in even though there was two members of staff available Also I wasn t informed that you need your room key to move the lift , The room and hotel in general was very clean and had nice decor
234798,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The walls were paper thin so there was a lot noise coming into the room from the hallways The floors were a bit creaky The washrooms need upgrading The toilet didn t flush properly , The automated check in was awesome the decor was nice The fact that the hotel was attached to several restaurants was very convenient 
234799,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Everything was to our liking Sports channel on TV would be an improvement , The room was spacious and quiet Having facilities to make tea and coffee was great Walking distance to so many attractions 
234800,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, No complaints whatsoever, Bed was really comfy and large Felt very safe as you needed the card for your room to use the lift therefore not anyone could just walk in 
234801,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch,No Negative, Good location Clean good value for money Chose to eat breakfast at the crosse Keys next door Had no meals in the Hotel Did not require parking however I do believe no parking facilities are at the hotel 
234802,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Weekdays there are free newspapers and fruit and cereal bars provided in the mornings none at weekends Also given disabled access room was not aware of this at check in and thought they were all like this Discovered at check out that we could have had a change of room and that it was the random allocation of rooms when we arrived No explanation of facilities at check in including access to bar next door , Close to underground quiet room nice shower
234803,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Weirdly spongey matress , Great location for the city and Liverpool Street station Complimentary filtered water tea and coffee available Decent sized lobby with PC working desk seating area available for guests Good well equipt bathroom with nice toiletries

234805,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The check in system wasn t well set out One person manning two screens and running between both didn t give you the type of dedicated service you look for at check in The bathroom looked a bit tired , Comfortable and clean hotel room Great location for walking around London centre and close underground links 
234806,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch,No Negative, nice touch having refreshments readily available hot drinks and chilled water on tap a refreshing change good space in the room with plenty of storage and to a very good clean standard A great location and the bonus of the direct convenience and access of a wetherspoons next door 
234807,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Had to switch rooms at the start as the room we got had a heavy cigarette smell But the staff was very apologetic and easily switched us Location in financial district made cheap breakfast outside of the hotel an issue on the weekend But we found some great spots that were 10 15 min walks away , Staff was pleasant Rooms were comfortable Great AC Easy to get to Booking com first time user and everything was correct 
234808,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, coffee machine not working saturday night really fancied one but not too bad as we made one when back in the bedroom, Room was a good size and comfortable

234811,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, the bathroom was very small but was only there 1 night so it was fine , being attached to Gaucho and very close to a lovely weatherspoons for a good breakfast
234812,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, All the reception stuff were not that friendly as expected Even we ve paid everything when checking in they were still blocking an extra warranty GBP20 night Even we ve had a voucher of GBP 40 from a previous stay we couldn t use it as they said the room had to be booked directly using their system Obviously on the voucher such conditions were not mentioned When we asked if there s any TV channel broadcasting Champions League final the answer was try zapping and see if you can find it sometimes they re doing it , Location is great wifi and complimentary coffee water were highly appreciated
234813,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Not the greatest of views our window looked in to some sort of void however we weren t there to enjoy the views from our room Sadly the night we stayed was when the incident on London Bridge and in Borough took place and whilst it didn t affect the hotel and its functioning it did mean that our stay was affected as some of the party decided to leave early on Sunday, Good location within walking distance of Spitalfields and London Bridge Bed was comfy and bathrooms clean Nice touch having the coffee machine complimentary downstairs and the free bottles of water on all the floors 
234814,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, It s not about the property but I have to say when we arrived the staff were amazing I genuinely couldn t of asked for more Due to booking coms muck up we got a free upgrade and late check out thank you so much to everyone at the hotel ,No Positive
234815,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, I don t have anything negative to say about the hotel it met our requirements for the few nights we were there , Check in was easy We had a triple room which provided plenty of room for us all There is a small kitchen the room with a fridge and a sink and even a microwave Although the room was on a busy road it wasn t noisy at all We stayed for 2 nights and domestics were in while we were out leaving fresh towels etc I would not hesitate to book this hotel again 
234816,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Couldn t get kettle to work Showed the kettle to receptionist he plugged it in downstairs and it worked but it still wouldn t work when I tried it again in the room, Free mineral water coffee Fridge and microwave in room were useful would ve been perfect if there d also been a toaster
234817,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Hideous reception desk and cramped lobbies area Room was not as on website Disabled access bathroom And we are not disabled Poor facilities in room Cheap toiletries poor tea coffee marking facilities Would not come again, Nothing
234818,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Staff attitude Didn t feel welcome wasn t given receipt of payment wasn t given any information about the hotel We will not be coming back , The bed was comfy 
234819,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, not staying there, i booked a bath didn t get one and the 2 receptionists on the Friday evening were impolite One didn t even say hello and welcome just ignored me and the other wouldn t find a room with bath Air conditioning was not good and it was very hot In this case the customer was always wrong Car park was miles away and 42 00 for 24 hours no warning of this on Booking com or the hotel website that this would be the issue When I booked I added an extra note to confirm booking was onsite and to reply if it wasn t as I didn t hear I presumed all was OK I felt conned and made a total fool of when I tried to discuss this with the receptionist who quite frankly couldn t careless 
234820,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The bed wasn t very comfy and there were no spare pillows in the cupboard, The room was clean and in a nice location with heating and air conditioning which was a great bonus It was a good size for a small room The free coffee was a nice extra
234821,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Room felt tired The room service was a disaster you book through an external site that accesses many local restaurants 45minutes after ordering dinner I got a call to say they could not fulfil my order and suggesting I start again There is no real check in it is DIY So they don t tell you but only one of the lifts gets you to the restaurant and gym you have to work that out yourself But there is only one lift button so the same wrong lift kept coming back and I basically had to wait for someone else to get in that one for the right one to come to my floor It is almost laughable how bad that is And as for the business lounge well that is the entrance hall with a few seats in it Nice idea but poor implementation , Location for the city is great 
234822,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Breakfast should be included with rooms and not sold separately for 15 service charge , Good location as it was close to my training course venue Nice of them to offer complimentary hot drinks water 
234823,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Some noise in corridor quite early Sunday morning sounded like bottles being cleared away, Good size bright room Staff v friendly good price for City location
234824,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Breakfast because it was classed as an Argentinian breakfast it was an acquired taste however probably suitable for some but not me , Room was huge even though it stated a small queen we loved every part of the room and location was amazing for everything we needed to see 
234825,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The room was a bit pricey for the amenities it offered and room was small for 3 people The front desk staff gave us wrong directions which made us loose our way and resulted to us walking around longer than we should have , Walking distance to the underground 
234826,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Room was small so difficult getting out of one side of the bed , Great position quite quiet but walking distance to Monument and London Bridge Helpful staff we were able to check in early 
234827,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Just to have been told me needed to pop our key card on the button in the loft before we could select our floor we thought the lift wasn t working until another guest told us, The bed was really comfy liked that we had tissues speakers with multiple docks would definitely come again excellent value for money
234828,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The coffee machine at the main reception was out of order in the evening Would have liked a drink before bed , enjoyed the space within the room and the effectiveness of the checking in process The staff were very keen to make you comfortable

234831,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, There was no small fridge in the room Breakfast buffet was rather limited , I would stay here again if I want a hotel in this part of London Our room was not on the street side so it was quiet No idea if the noise level on the street side is an issue Free coffee tea water and WiFi available Comfortable bed 
234832,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Wi fi was slow to non existant Staff were discreet to say the least The room area could have used a little fresh coat of paint , Comfortable and rather large room as far as London is concerned Decent bedding great shower accomodations Calm neighboorhood great sleep quality The presence of a fitness room was also a plus 
234833,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Basement breakfast service very poor Too few staff on duty Felt sorry for the staff , Hotel tidy and comfortable Ground floor lounge and coffee facilities were very good 
234834,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Not a great area at the weekend All the restaurants and bars in the area were shut on Saturday and Sunday Also hotel restaurant Gaucho was closed Sunday night Rooms were ok but a bit functional Not sure I would pay the money again for what looked very similar to a travel lodge , Gym facilities were good and access to cross keys pub was good 
234835,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch,No Negative, Easy check in at the hotel no reception as such but there are staff available to help The rooms are spacious and comfortable with the usual amenities There is also a room on every floor with extra pillows and blankets etc for you to help yourself Free coffee in the lounge area and a water machine on every floor too The location was great for exploring walking and easy access to the tube There is a pub next door which was closed at times over the Easter weekend this was a bit inconvenient for us but we found others about 15 minutes walk away 
234836,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The toilet was old and made loud noises when flushing the shower had a cloth curtain the windows were thin and every day at around 6am we could hear trucks loading unloading the room had no minibar we just expected more value for the money we paid , Good central location although weekends and bank holidays is dead as it is located in a business area There are fresh water machines in every floor with bottles to fill up and take away 
234837,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Only one pillow each and despite the option to pop to the service cupboard for extras there were none available on any floor , The free coffee in reception is a lovely touch and really good coffee thank you The connecting door into Weatherspoons for breakfast also excellent and superb value for money The Argentinian restaurant in the basement served the best steak ever 
234838,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The hotel has seen far better days The room was dark and had a seventies feel to it the bed and the desk were probably far older the desk even had burns on it Needs a significant refurbishment, Staff were very friendly
234839,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, I was extremely disappointed with the room standard It was very small with very poor air circulation almost humid When i turned on the air conditioning to try and cool the room it was extremely loud and i could not sleep The bed was uncomfortable The breakfast the next morning was terrible I had to ask 3 times for a coffee that wasn t cold On the third occasion the coffee that was served was completely undrinkable I would not stay here again , Location

234842,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Sure the price but it s London and we know that isn t cheap , Very good hotel with clean and spacious rooms and a good staff It is situated in the city so a little out from the real centre but the hotel is served from a lot of bus and tube lines and this help you don t feel the distance from the centre If I ll come back in London probably I ll consider it

234844,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The bathroom facility didn t match the high standard of the rest of the hotel, Great location in the heart of the city Easy check in and out process Friendly staff
234845,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Several room amenities listed were not provided Was told there was a help yourself cupboard in the hotel corridor where there was no toiletries left so had to go to another floor Notified Hotel prior to arrival that it would be my mother s birthday so to make it a special visit yet nothing extra was given at all Disappointing overall , Comfy bed and good night sleep Staff were helpful with questions and location great

234858,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, When checking in we were given a wrong room which was already occupied Locally noone was inside the room but what would happen if we had walked in while someone was there Plus it made us wonder if they could so the same and give our room by mistake to other guest and we get a surprive random visit Unacceptable , Location was good
234859,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Most of the coffee shops around the hotel are closed during the weekend Not much to eat for breakfast brunch on Sunday , Good location at walking distance to metro station Monument Even better if one is traveling for business as it s close to the business district Our room was big enough with a big bed and great sheets pillows One could get purified water on each floor and complementary coffee from the lobby There is also a vending machine at 1 floor with snacks Overall the hotel is really good and offers great services

234873,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Room and bed sizes could have been better We had a one double room and one family room In the family room for three people s stay the sofa bed was made even before we entered the room which could be great if someone check in at night but not middle of the day giving room a dormitory like look than a nice hotel room It would been really great if either the house keeping could have helped making the bed for third person later and left the the sofa as is when we enter the room, We could not have asked for a better location and was the best thing we liked about the hotel Having the water place on each floor with bottles was very helpful Staff was nice rooms were clean 
234874,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Coffee machine in the lounge wasn t working 2 out of the 3 times I fancied a latte and the cold drinks and nibbles which were on the photographs for the hotel had been removed, Room was a good size and very clean
234875,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, We stayed at the weekend and the area was very quiet which wouldn t have been an issue only that most of the restaurants bars etc were all closed The hotel is obviously in the heart of the business district hence the reason for not opening but it just restricted our options locally , Quick check in which is great when you just want to get bags dropped off and out to explore all that London has to offer The room was clean and even though we had booked a small double room it was more than big enough to suit our needs Shower was powerful and lots of warm water The hotel offered free water coffee juice snack bars fruit which is a lovely addition Also the water bottles on each floor of the hotel is a welcomed bonus Modern hotel in lovely area which is just a short walk 5 minutes to the underground getting you to all places central in just a few stops 
234876,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, It s located in the business area so there aren t too many restaurants but that s why the price is better than others , Nice staff easy check in and check out free coffees
234877,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Room and bathroom very small one of the sockets didn t work internet didn t work though I understand from the hotel that that was due to a problem external to the hotel In general the room was not commensurate with a 4 star rating and had I paid full price for it I would have been very disappointed and felt that I had not received value for money , Bed very comfortable
234878,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Heating was not working so a heating fan was supplied which did heat the room but was very noisy and couldn t sleep Consequently room was freezing in the morning , 3rd time staying here Easy access to Bank station 5min walk free chilled water coffee in lobby Good shower nice room 
234879,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, no baths that s a no no with me but the bathroom was nice , great staff incredibly helpful Free tea and coffee downstairs and ice machine for ice was a bonus Lovely big bed good sized room Really good location to explore the river Pub and Gaucho Grill next door

234881,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The room was extremely small for the price and the bed was not actually a bed with a matress instead it was just two large connected stools , On the bright side they offered free candies snacks and coffee near the reception We were also offered free printing facilities 
234882,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, A bit pricey and breakfast not included Personnel could be more friendly , Convenient location in the heart of City 10 walk from the Tower or Liverpool St station Modern and clean 
234883,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The Bathroom decor was tired with cracked floor tiles peeling paint No heater or mechanical extraction in the bathroom either so freezing and very steamy after shower The large window by the bed was very draughty and not very well sound proofed , Great welcome from staff Extremely helpful when needed Easy check in out Excellent location with close access to tube station and close to the Tower Tower Bridge and other well known attractions The area was free of hustle and bustle on the weekend All cafes and most shops were closed probably because they cater for office workers during the week as this is the financial district 
234884,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The lounge area was not large enough to relax especially when people are checking in and out throughout the day Also the vent in my room on top of the ceiling was noisy even when not in use , The restaurant and bar facilities were excellent Staff service was impressive 
234885,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Checkin checkout process was a little odd Appreciate that it is computerised but simply not enough computers to use , Great location service and price 
234886,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The small cramp reception area and at times large numbers of bags in the narrow entrance with people checking in and out , Gracechurch is very quiet at the weekend as this is part of the Finance Area of London The staff were very professional even though reception area was very small 
234887,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Maybe the heating system was quite loud when on , The receptionist booked me in early which was great because I was able to leave my case and get around easier He was very welcoming and friendly The room was nice and warm and clean and the shower was fab so powerful Loved the free complimentary drinks in the lobby was a nice touch 
234888,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Room was rather small Bed wasn t comfortable with one one pillow each and a sheet for a duvet Very basic not what I was expecting for my first time staying in a London hotel More suitable for business travels , Was very clean Hotel itself had nice decor and a little lounge you can sit and enjoy a hot drink 
234889,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Situated in business district so not much happening on the weekend , Its walking distance to Liverpool street station and tourist attractions such as Borough market tower bridge london bridge
234890,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Breakfast option limited and restaurant very dark , Manager and staff extremely friendly and helpful Refreshments and snacks in the reception area was excellent 
234891,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, no slippers dark room just only small windows to atrium no breakfast they don t return my deposit 40 pounds yet i have been there two weeks ago, Very good location big room tea coffee and water complimentary kettle and fridge in the room good value for money quiet room
234892,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, At the weekend most of the nearby shops are closed including the coffee places there is a good one directly opposite where you might have breakfast instead of in the hotel where it is served in the Goucho Resturant under the hotel and street level There are newspapers and fruit supplied in reception near the tea and coffee machines but these are not available at the weekend If like me you need something in your stomach before heading out there is a Sainsburys local on the next corner open every day , The hotel is well located in the City of London with lots of transport links nearby We arrived into Liverpool Street Station and it was an easy 10 minute walk to the door Our room was on the 6th floor and facing the back so we weren t affected by street noise that other reviewers have mentioned The room itself is set up for business people so has lots of gadget connectivity and good wifi 
234893,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Little desk area a little awkward when there were a few guests checking in and out as que nr the door and cramped But staff amazi g very friendly and helpful , That it was covienient for our plans
234894,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Size of the room maybe due to limited space, From my experience it was a very relaxing stay in this hotel I was given a upgrade to queen room and the staffs were helpful Fast check in check out with kiosk The location is central with restaurants bar metro underground bank monument station and supermarkets nearby Walking distance to tower hill and London bridge about 15 20 mins The bed comfortable to sleep though the room size is small perfect for couple The bathroom was clean with good hot shower There s executive lounge with free tea coffee cappuccino latte machine and business centre Got gym and Gaucho steak restaurant Distilled water machine is available in each floor Overall a feel at home hotel with facilities 
234895,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Reservation was confirmed by booking com so we assumed all was good When we arrived booking had been cancelled because they had been unable to take test payment from our card registered with booking com which worked perfectly on the night of our arrival HOWEVER they had not informed us directly or via Booking com As it happened they still had a room and honoured the booked price so all was GOOD but would advise directly confirming your booking especially at busier times of year , Central near to tube 
234896,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Bed was a bit small for a queensize bed No minibar in the room , Nice atmosphere to make you feel at home Big pub Whetherspoons with good breakfast cheap drinks right next door in the building Free tea coffee in lobby refillable bottles and water stations on each floor Fitness machines were good Location is great near train station 2 Underground stations 
234897,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Pillows too hard An option of soft fluffy pillows would have made my night s sleep perfect , Excellent location with Bank and Monument tube stations only 5 min walk away Also within walking distance of Borough Market which if you re a foodie is a must visit Hotel excellent quick and easy check in out Appreciated the fact you could fill a bottle with spring water by the lift on every floor and help yourself to coffee in the reception area 
234898,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch,No Negative, I specifically liked the staff in the restaurant within the hotel bubbly charming and helpful I also enjoyed the free coffee and snacks in the foyer The room had a great view excellent bathroom and cosy bed 
234899,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Check out felt a bit rushed and the member of staff checking us out wasn t as polite as I d expect , Check in was good Great location and value for money 
234900,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Air Con control in each room but overriding whole hotel heating was too nosey like sleeping on a plane, Quality was high Nice touch with free coffee coke downstairs and iced water on each floor Nice bed
234901,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch,No Negative, Very central location in the City just opposite to the Leadenhall market really huge and comfortable bed easy to find and access freely available coffee and quality water Perfect either for a business trip or short holidays in the city 
234902,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Not really sure I tend to stay a cheaper hotels Didn t find anything negative, Room was spacious Had a lot of storage such as draws and cupboards to put clothes away There was free coffee and tea as well as a free bottles and water machines on each floor 
234903,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Nothing , Water machine with plastic bottles on every floor Customer Service room on majority of floors where you could help yourself to additional pillows coffee sachets etc Plenty of shops cafes restaurants within a stones throw 
234904,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Top floor noise from outside cooling fan when next day we told staff lady said people do complain about this noise we should have said they would have moved us one night stay , clean and tidy but not a place for tourist
234905,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Nearly everything Room was difficult to find Very poor sign posted Bed was too close to the wall so quite difficult to go on from my side Side table was missing No breakfast As we stay over the weekend lots of shops and bars were closed on Sat morning , Good water pressure in the shower 
234906,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Breakfast which is not included Staff not friendly and the hotel has cut back from 2 years ago on what it offers Is it too much to ask that hot drinks are brought to the table You have to collect your own hot drinks no teapots and nowhere to put used teabags except on clean saucers which appeared to exasperate the waiter so provide a bin Hot water for tea in flask on buffet table but not nearly hot enough Coffee flask not labelled so I assumed it was hot water dirtied a cup which also ppeared to exasperate the waiter Quality of the food is fine however the experience is not For anyone visiting Club Quarters in Gracechurch Street I suggest you nip over the road into Leadenhall Market and get breakfast in a cafe there or room service if you must , The room was quiet and the bed very comfortable The windows open if you like fresh air and room 518 overlooked a quiet courtyard so no traffic noise at all 
234907,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The bed it was smaller than it looked The room was hot even with the air con on They didn t have enough pillows even when we went to their store room for the extra things , The location and staff were friendly and very helpful when we needed something 
234908,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The fire alarm went off waking me up I trekked down eight flights of stairs to discover that it was a false alarm had it stopped immediately I might have stayed in bed but the staff were unable to turn it off fully It was ringing at low volume for a significant time just loud enough to keep me awake The following morning my room key card stopped working This required two trips to reception to access my room retrieve my suitcase and then a further trip to check out , The staff at breakfast were attentive and the service well managed The bed was comfortable 
234909,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The recommended food service in the hotel was a lot more expensive then just booking through just eat The only difference between the service is you can t charge to your room , Chilled water re fillable bottles on every floor great little addition Guest comfort cupboard on every floor including extras you would normally have to go to the reception for e g mouthwash ironing boards Wifi was fast and stable enough for regular web surfing Location was perfect for London Bridge and connections via the tube with a short walk to monument and bank stations Convenience stores close by and a couple of nice bars if you are after anything a bit more special you can reach the Shard or the Duck Waffle within 15 minutes walk 
234910,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, A lack of information in the information booklet in the room and no ironing facilities in the room The location ok but most of the shops bars etc shutdown over the weekend so the immediate area becomes a ghost town It is an ideal location for business in the week but not so for weekend travellers This should be reflected in the price , The room was clean and tidy and the bed comfortable Plenty of sockets and USB ports for devices 
234911,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, I have asked for an early booking but it was not possible hotel was full booked I can understand that but they didn t respond to me by mail asking that service before my arrival I would have known Nevertheless they were trying to do their best when i arrived , People are nice responsive practical You pay for what you have 
234912,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, We had two terrible night sleeps due to mattress being too hard and pillows not to our liking Didn t realise that breakfast was not included with the room Breakfast was quite pricy as a result with not a lot of flexibility in the choices i e I could have egg benedicts but not allowed any fresh fruits from the buffet , The location is perfect Short walk from Liverpool street station Monument underground station and major attractions like Tower bridge and Tower of London Even a small double was a decent size room Good shower Loved the wee body scrub soap Very good egg benedicts for breakfast 
234913,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, know how many guests are coming to provide the correct amount of toiletries though the very friendly staff accommodated us kindly on this small matter ,No Positive
234914,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The room was showing signs of wear e g chipped paint on the wardrobe door old bedside table Bathroom was a bit dated but clean and functional The room was very basic re food drink facilities given that the hotel does not offer food packages it would have been nice to have more than a kettle and mugs this was OK for 1 night but could have got very limiting The bed was a little too soft and pillows a bit flat , Good location in the City short walk from Tube and near to Tower of London A good variety of food options in the area Filtered chilled water was available on all floors and a bean to cup machine in the foyer Rooms a little dated and basic but functional enough for an overnight stay Hot shower Otherwise this is a basic budget hotel with very little in the way of extras 
234915,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Nothing we thought the hotel was better than expected and will be visiting again , Very easy to book in Helpful staff A larger than expected room with great facilities Very comfortable night The best part was the location very near to the tube with good access to the whole city We will be looking to stay again The close proximity and internal access to The Crosse Keys was very useful no need to worry about getting good food and drink at very reasonable prices 
234916,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Room was not so clean carpet was dirty bathroom could do better Price high for the given facilities but London is expensive anyway , The location was excellent near Bank and Monument stations 
234917,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Cleanliness is not good the bed was not comfortable they put two single bed and combined them together as one bed the water s smell that used for washing is very bad, The location is great

234919,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, COMPUTERS ARE QUITE SLOW AND SHOWER ROOM IS RATHER COZY , YOU HAVE ACCESSIBLILITY TO EVERY THING YOU NEED EVERYONE IS HELPFUL AND NICE I LOVE THE SOAP THERE 
234920,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch,No Negative, Excellent only one night stay but a lovely one The bed was extra comfy and we loved the free water on each floor as you came out of the lift It certainly helped the hangover 
234921,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, A little fiddly to find from the tube station we had gprs on our phones though so found it quite easily , Had such a good nights sleep although the other couple we were with did not so I guess it depends on your preference Free drinks and snacks downstairs in the lobby was a nice touch
234922,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Check in was very impersonal Staff impact negligible but didnt detract from stay , Clean room in a good location Good 24hr chilled water ice and coffee
234923,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Not long after we arrived we asked for a couple of extra pillows to be brought to our room Later in the afternoon not realsing there were glasses in the bathroom we asked for two to be brought to our room Later that evening we asked for knives and forks as there were none in our room The person who answered our call seemed annoyed that we were asking and suggested we ask for everything we wanted at once to save time Being made to feel that we were a nuisance by calling guest services put a dampener on what would otherwise have been a very enjoyable stay The rest of the staff were all pleasant helpful and friendly , Clean and comfortable the staff that gretted us were happy and friendly 
234924,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, no complaints, nice free coffee and newspaper to read whilst relaxing in the lounge area also pub next door near to monument bank of england and the river thames and metro

234928,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, My daughter and I found the pillows a bit on the hard side but that s all I have , The location was perfect We used the Bank Station coming from St Pancras Intl then Momument Station for the Circle and District lines in getting around Both stations are less than 5 minutes from the hotel The amenities at the hotel are great Water snacks soda coffee tea breakfast bars Will stay here when in London again or elsewhere if it s an option 
234929,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, A little renovation of the rooms would be fine but all in all the room was ok And there is no heating in the bath and so it was very cold in there in December , Free and delicous coffee and water the staff was very friendly 3 tube stations in walking distance supermarkets and shops next door Ideal place to explore the city 
234930,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Really really noisy hotel never stayed anywhere so noisy Bathroom was tiny and old fashioned I ve had better bathrooms in lower star hotels No bedside cabinet on one side of the bed so nowhere to put water phone etc but plenty of room for one Would not stay here again ,No Positive
234931,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Checking in via machines when there are more people to help you who could do the checking in and it takes twice as long is wrong and makes no sense We were given a room adopted for disabled persons and not asked if we were ok with this No Bar and no Breakfast available Room key failed to work and had to wait 10 minutes for manager to return as no one else available to reissue key Rooms were old and small, Beds were comfortable Shower pressure was good 
234932,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Location is good for access to the business district but it s a 5 10 minute walk to the tube , Small snacks and coffee in the lounge area is a great plus
234933,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The maid walked into our room knocked lightly we said no but came in instantly without properly checking it was ok to do so , Easy to checkin and out
234934,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, There was no breakfast and the restaruant was closed so yes there is some improvement possible , The location is very good right in the middle of the City and close to the underground station Bank The rooms are simple and clean everything works fine 
234935,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, No breakfast facilities and the restaurant was closed A reasonable alternative is the crossed keys put next to the hotel gor pub food , The rooms are not too big but comfortable everything works as it should 
234936,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, no soundproofing difficult to find it, Free high quality coffee machine friendly staffs I would like to thank member of staff named Ismaeel who helped us with late check out 
234937,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Standard room a bit small Separate shampoo and conditioner and biscuits with complimentary tea coffee would have been nice If the heating is left on overnight the air becomes very dry woke up several times with a very dry throat One of the room keys didn t work , Friendly staff quick and easy check in free purified water and bottles on each floor Right in the middle of the city surrounded by bars restaurants and shops closed at the weekend Good room service options including local restaurants food delivered to your door The towels smelled of caramel 
234938,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Only downside was the shower was very narrow , Despite being a small queen room it was a good size Wifi was excellent Staff very helpful Free coffee soft drinks and snacks in the lounge were a real treat 
234939,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Breakfast too noisy you can hear everything from other rooms Decoration and conservation outdated not a 4 stars for sure, Restaurant staff Business facilities Location
234940,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Woken 3 4 times between 3 and 4am by people in the corridor They weren t especially noisy but the sound carried badly Toiletries too feminine a fragrance for male use , Good location Staff welcoming and helpful 
234941,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, It would have been nice to know that in this location every single shop and cafe closes at the weekend It was unbelievable It was like a ghost town , It was good it was near the central line just as well as every single shop cafe was closed at the weekend The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was comfortable 
234942,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, There is no illuminated signs to the fire exit on any floor from each room or enough signs to the lift for normal use if there was a fire and the lights went out it would be a mega disaster for most people who don t realise how to find their way around the maze of rooms in the dark I informed the desk person who didn t seem too interested , We liked the price and the no fuss
234943,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The amount and pressure of water coming out when showering reminded me of a trip to Niagara Falls years ago But in this case I consider it a massive waste of water ressources May also be the reason for the quite audible sounds of running the tap and shower from the neighbours The sheets gave the feel that they were covered with rubber on the back side to project the mattress Not comfortable , Quick and easy check in and check out Efficient reception staff Free purified water and bottles provided Good location Nice firm bed 
234944,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Our room was tiny with no room on to get out of bed on one side mattress had you rolling into the middle and the room overlooked a side road so very noisy early in the morning with waste collections , Amenities were good free water and coffee in lounge and location was excellent
234945,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Small rooms maintenance is as 3 star hotel personal is not very friendly they were pushing us to provide credit card even if the booking has been 100 prepaid and we refuse to have any additional services Very stinky towels even fresh ones looked dirty even fresh ones I would say only location is the benefit nothing else from claimed 4 stars , Location is good
234946,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Towels seem old and hard room was very basic no frills whatsoever no after hours dining service, Location very close to many tube stations including Liverpool Station Tesco Starbucks efficient check in and check out very clean coffee in lobby lots of charger stations

234949,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The beds weren t the comfiest and we used the blanket in the wardrobe for an additional pillow each Rooms weren t the biggest but then again we did book a small queens room , Location was perfect and easy to get too from the tube Check in and out was really easy and the staff were helpful with any questions we had Might be easier to explain the 20 00 deposit for any accidents as the customer checks in rather than expect the customer to do it anyway Held out luggage after we checked out was really organised and easy to collect when we were ready 
234950,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch,No Negative, Brilliant location with easy access to tube station Lovely seating area in reception with complimentary coffee Bed was extremely comfy and room was spotlessly clean We arrived by 11 30am to leave our luggage but were able to go straight to our room which was great

234952,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Just a nice little touch would to have been given spoons or stirrers with our tea coffee and shortbread biscuits or any biscuits in our room Perhaps the staff forgot , The concierge was fabulous We arrived stressed and I told him it was my Husbands birthday and he very kindly sent us a bottle of complimentary wine to our room That kind gesture meant a lot We had a lovely room and enjoyed a super evening at Gauchos where the staff sang Happy Birthday to my husband A great stay 
234953,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Not a traditional Hotel feel Very much a venue for the independent traveller who wants to eat out or order a delivery from a Restaurant , My daughter and I shared a room which had a kitchenette consisting of microwave fridge plates cutlery and napkins We also had a work station large television and settee Clean en suite with pleasantly perfumed washing toiletries Comfortable bed and extra pillows available We would have been very comfortable staying longer Ideal for someone travelling on business or as a base for sight seeing 
234954,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Walls are paper thin could hear everything in the next room, Extras offered such as filtered water available in the corridor and bottles to fill up and take wit you
234955,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The hotel is noisy Walls are paper thin Maid was very annoying an persistent knocking on my door after half hour , Good value by London standards Central for the city 
234956,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The room was that clean TV didn t work and the wires were hanging out of the electronic equipment , The location was fantastic surrounded by good food The hotel was nicely decorated 
234957,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The reception staff and Gaucho restaurant staff were really poor Terrible attitude We arrived early and even though I notified the hotel of this fact months in advance the receptionist looked at me as if I was crazy when I asked for an early check in She actually said Absolutely not sir Check in is at 3pm and we were fully booked last night The waiter during breakfast in Gaucho restaurant was also incredibly unfriendly We ordered eggs benedict and he said With this you get free juice and fruit but nothing else Almost protecting the few croissants that was laid out on the excuse for a buffet table We are paying goood money to stay at your hotel and you have a waiter who is protecting your croissants Not that I wanted one but I thought this was ridiculous If you want some free advice Send your staff on a customer service course They work in hospitality and they are extremely inhospitable , The fact that there is a Wetherspoons next door is a huge plus And the Lydenhall Market across the road Good access 
234958,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, shower curtain bed was noisy and slightly uncomfortable very small room very basic bathroom no mini bar, Shower pressure and temp was good free bottles of water location

234961,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, All rooms should come with a bath extra pillows would have been good, Location was good but very quiet over the weekend Great for London Bridge and the City
234962,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch,No Negative, There was a booking mistake and the room reserved for us was too small for a family of 3 The staff quickly upgraded us as a gesture of goodwill even though it was not their fault either The new room was perfect and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay Highly recommend 
234963,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The room fit out was tired needs renovation This is consistent with our stay at other London Club Quarters We probably wouldn t stay with Club Quarters again , Great location for a London weekend break 
234964,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Only a bed side table on one side of the bed Some complimentary biscuits with the tea and coffee would have been nice , Great location good sized room very comfortable bed Free filtered water tea and coffee available 
234965,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The hotel do not have their own restaurant on the basement there is a Gaucho restaurant where Breakfastare served Very average poor value for money , Free fruits and coffee at on the lobby Friendly staff
234966,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, We had a little bit of plumbing issues in our room the water in the shower backed up and it took several tries to get the toilet to flush We told the front desk and they gave us some tips to deal with it implying that it is a known issue In the end it didn t really impact our stay that much at all , We loved the location and the overall atmosphere Everything was very clean the staff was very friendly and most importantly the location was very close to the tube station 
234967,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Staff weren t very engaging on check in and didn t tell us how to get to our room Room was freezing cold when we got there and heating took quite a while to warm up when we put it on , Bottles of water to take and fill up for free on your way really nice touch So pleasant inside the hotel very clean and glamorous Beautiful building on the outside too 
234968,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Noisy district a lot of pubs and the market always full of shouting people construction fields nearby Rooms are too small and a bit shabby Not every staff member is polite and helpful enough Seems like they never wash bedcovers and throws there is an unpleasant smell , Clean rooms Tea coffee and some basic snacks sometimes even fruits are available in the lobby always excepts weekends Located not so far from several tube stations
234969,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Directions to help find as the numbering in Gracechurch Street seems anything but logical , The cold water dispenser is a good idea but on floor 7 is not easy to spot 
234970,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The room lacked facilities e g no hairdryer or iron the bathroom for a room that was 160 excluding breakfast was outdated the noise was terrible you could hear every door and pipe being used only one thin pillow was supplied in the room I could go on , The water and tea coffee facilities
234971,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, I couldn t stay any longer So I shall be coming back at the first opportunity Every single member of staff appears to have been specially selected then given the fullest support by Management They are in a class of their own , This is the best Hotel that I have ever stayed in The facilities are beyond all my needs The staff are amazing This will from now on be my stay of choice I have tried many Hotels all pretty good but not in this league 
234972,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Minor issue coffee machine preparing very good coffee when working in lobby was closed for maintenance most time of our stay , Location is perfect Location in the same building with the Crosse Keys pub adds some extra value you can have very good and reasonably priced breakfast even it is not included in your hotel booking 
234973,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, I could moan about no bar nor restaurant on a Sunday Autumn evening but not seriously We even walked to China town from the Hotel , Not too ostentatious very nice clean rooms and toilets Location good near main line and tube stations Very nice little lounge and water bottles on each floor
234974,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, They don t have a check in desk You have to do it yourself though they do have people there helping you Then why not just have a check in desk , You could fill your own water bottles and they had a nice lounge area
234975,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Apart from Wetherspoons and Gauchos next door everything else was closed at the weekend because it is the financial district but we walked up to Liverpool St on Sunday morning where there is plenty of choice of places to eat , Good sized rooms with big beds coffee making and aircon Free cold water and bottles to refill everywhere as well as coffee in the foyer Beautiful building and really lovely helpful staff My husband was wearing a Birthday Boy badge when we arrived and within minutes we had taken delivery of a gift of redwine chocs and snacks Great value for what you get in central London 
234976,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The front desk staff was very unhelpful They showed irritation when they were being asked questions , Breakfast at gaucho was the only good thing during our stay at Club quarters Gracechurch
234977,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Every night the coffee machine in the hall is broken which I believe it s a lie For some reason they don t want people to use it in the evening , The room was really nice
234978,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Pillows too soft Be good if extra pillows were in wardrobe so that you can have the choice of having more than 1 Reception area very small a bit claustrophobic, Pleasant staff Good location
234979,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The only thing I would say bad about this hotel is the bed was not comfy it was just too firm for me so I didn t get enough sleep , The location was great bank and embankment are the just down the road The room was big and clean The shower was great very powerful and hot Little touches like the water Cooler in the corridor with free bottles to fill was a great idea 
234980,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, We did order chinese food from externals btw mr chan s it was disgusting and the cleaning stuff didn t take the plates along the next morning probably should have put the plates in front of the room so they d know that we were finished with this Chinese food D, In deed a comfy bed heating was working and the shower very fast warm as well veeeerrryyyyy nice In comparison to other cities it was still an expensive stay but in reference to other options in london it was probably the best value by far we could have gotten for our money They even provided a facilitating log in onto a food delivery platform so you could pay officially on the hotel bill for it very good idea Next time again 
234981,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch,No Negative, Used as a Base for exploring London and a night out in London someone always at hand to help at the front and literally 2 minute walk from Monument station so excellent location Room shower and everything comfortable 
234982,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The housekeeping was a total let down bathroom bin had not been emptied when we checked in we got a candy basket as an apology and were proposed another room when we told about it at the reception the mirror was not clean and carpet had not been properly vacuumed Toilet roll was stocked under the bed Rooms are not soundproof and they need an urgent update The bed is not comfortable for 2 people one moves and the other one is jettisoned into the air it s so soft , The location of the hotel is very good easy access from London City Airport We got a big size room on a high floor in which we could open the window Complimentary water 
234983,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The breakfast hall had no windows and was dark and gloomy There was no real reception area that allowed a pleasant arrival for the guests , The bed was comfortable the location very convenient and I liked the complimentary water and tea selection

235014,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, It felt like a dormitory not a hotel and check out took ages despite the fact we had pre paid perhaps if our invoice had been slipped under our door that would have been one less person in the enormous queue Also having coming back after a lovely evening and dinner the staff on duty were curt and uninterested when we asked where we could get a nightcap and the information was wrong , Location

235028,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, It did get a little noisy at night later in the week from voices carrying outside especially towards the weekend which was surprising since the whole area is pretty empty after 7pm on weekdays and pretty empty the whole time on the weekend a bit like how Wall Street gets in New York Also it was pretty hot at night if you don t ask them to keep the air conditioning on they turn it off every night in your room , I m 25 this was my first business trip alone and my first time to London I was a guest here for 8 days and my office was right around the corner It was a convenient location near a lot of tube stops it was very clean bed was comfortable workout area was clean and I loved the free printing for my plane ticket and free water bottles Overall I had a great experience
235029,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Room service was shocking It took 1hr and 25mins to get room service delivered That was after 4phone calls to ask where it was and be told three times it s on it s way to be then told it hasn t been cooked at all and was on the grill When it turned up the order was incomplete chips were cold and the chicken having allegedly just come of a grill was all dried up At that stage because it was 9 20pm I didn t have the energy to complain or ask for it to be replaced Terrible terrible terrible service and food NEVER AGAIN ,No Positive

235038,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Nothing to complain about however this hotel is located in the business district of London and may not suit all It was disappointing that the added treats in the lounge were not available on the weekend , The lounge was enjoyable during the week days when there is access to newspapers nibbles and fruit The coffee machine in the lounge delivers good coffee The microwave in the room was useful The location was convenient for us It is close to Monument station and the Thames is only a short walk away The view from the room window took in the Gerkin the Shard and the Walkie talkie Leadenhall Market is just across the road and is very picturesque Wi fi is good 
235039,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Dusty rooms and did not look like the pictures on the website, Very nice location in the middle of the city and clost to monument and bank underground stations

235041,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Bad noise during the night causing disruption to our sleep The neighbour appeared to be having a bedroom party at all hours while slamming their door Felt afraid to say anything No hairdryer in the room as advertised , Complementary toiletries and water very tasteful and accessible very clean and well decorated bed was comfortable there was free coffee in the reception 
235042,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Room was not wide enough for the bed so it was a challenge to get out of bed Mattress was cheap so restful sleep was not an option A laughably hiked price of 17 pp for breakfast was an option we did not take , Shower was really big and the water pressure was very good

235045,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch,No Negative, Cannot recommend this hotel more Booked it as part of a surprise trip for my father s 70th birthday and the staff were fantastic great communication prior to our stay and they happily accommodated a couple of small requests I had They also provided a welcome basket and a bottle of wine I m not sure if this is standard practise or due to the special occasion but it was a nice touch all the same Room was lovely large clean and nicely decorated Location is excellent for getting around London Bank station is a 5 min walk and has great connections to the rest of the city Walking distance to London Bridge St Paul s Cathedral and a number of other attractions The immediate area is very quiet over the weekend not many restaurants bars open so you will have to venture a little further afield As it s the business district Friday night was very lively with local workers but the area seems to shut down Saturday Sunday There is a Wetherspoons right next door to the hotel which does reasonable food and is open every day Overall a fantastic stay I will definitely be back 
235046,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, It s abit dated Cleanliness is not there You could tell the carpet and duvet needs a thorough clean The toilet design needs an upgrade So are the doors of the closet and the toilet the tables in the room are all dated , The facilities gym ice free water coffee and tea 
235047,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, for a 4 star hotel I had expected a minibar and a rack to place the suitcase on insulation of the room could be better noise from the corridor was sometimes to hear, Nice big room even with a little view friendly staff water bottle station with chilled water on each level free drinks in the lobby coffee water 
235048,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, found it strange there was not hair dryer in our room We did look for it but could not find it anywhere so we assume it was not provided , air conditioning in the rooms was amazing the bathroom facilities were nice and check in and check out process was so fast and streamlined very impressed
235049,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, I like to sleep fairly high so asked for an extra pillow was told they didn t have any Air con was very noisy The room described as Queen sized must have been one of those really small queens But apart from that much like any travel lodge style hotel nothing special but ok for a stay in central London , It was adequate and a great location handy for London Bridge and attractions 
235050,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, There needs to be a mirror over the desk writing area so one can see oneself when using said hairdryer The full length mirror round the corner doesn t do the job at all , very convenient for my visit I liked the coffee machine and complimentary snack bars and fruit and access to water Good to have professional grade of hairdryer
235051,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, There could have been more staff Checking in and out there was a long line and only one staff member trying to help There were computers for check in but I prefer the human experience to the automated one Again probably best for a business trip but fine if you re booking last minute and there aren t many affordable options left in central London , It was a very nice clean hotel I think it would be perfect for a business trip Close to the underground and right in the financial district Staff were helpful luggage storage was convenient I thought it was a great price for the quality and being fairly centrally located 
235052,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch,No Negative, Lovely Hotel great value for money It is walking distance from most sightseeing attractions Our stay was very comfortable Loved the fact that we could get purified water for free 
235053,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Once the cleaning service didn t change towels , Location is excellent Inside the hotel is very beautiful Staff was helpful and friendly There were free snacks nachos and walkers cookies and water 
235054,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, A room for 3 people and a kitchen with 2 knives 2 glasses and 1 fork A double bed with only one bedside table Bedside lamps that didn t work Dirty drip marks down the woodwork and you don t want to know how horrible under the bed was I dropped my glasses down the back of the bed due to the lack of a bedside table and had to crawl under the bed to retrieve them The phone was unplugged so I had to charge it up to use it Finally on arrival we couldn t even nap due to the bagging on the wall behind our bed by workmen , The location and the air con 
235055,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Don t prepay 17 for breakfast if the option comes up when booking it costs less when you just order from the menu when you are there , Convenient location for the City of London for meetings comfortable room and pleasant staff happy to help with any questions 
235056,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, There needs to be a clearer arrangement between booking com and the hotel on breakfast We booked breakfast with our booking paying 17 for a full English breakfast but found that there was not a full English breakfast on offer for this amount There is also a lack of flexibility in the breakfast offering This is not a comment on the quality of the food which is good but the the lack of clarity on booking ,No Positive
235057,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Our room had a window but opposite to that was a wall So no sunlight or view The room had a slight odour like someone had smoked in there Tho location was pretty central in the city of london but the nicer eestaurants etc are somewhere else Maybe better suited for business trips At the check out it turned out that the hotel restaurant tried to charge us something we didn t order That got sorted out after a while Then my card didn t work the first time the receptionist tried it and he started asking if we had enough money The situation was pretty awkward The third time the card worked fine who knows what the proplem was All in all I wouldn t recommend this hotel You can find better for this money , Quite a clean hotel
235058,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Nothing , The kitchen facilities available including a fridge The tea coffee lounge The free filter water and bottles provided to fill and take with you The air conditioning in the rooms The bed was super comfy 
235059,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch,No Negative, This is the first time for us to be in UK and this is the first hotel of our trip The location is really good and there is a subway station nearby which gives a lot of convenience 
235060,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, No complaints The hotel provided adequately for my needs , I booked a suite for myself and two adult daughters as we were attending a family wedding in the City The suite was very spacious had a kitchenette with fridge and microwave and was really like home away from home for the weekend we stayed It was more than adequate for our needs The hotel is in a great location for anyone who wants to take advantage of City sights and above all it is very good value for money Don t be fooled by the small check in desk The hotel provides for all your needs 
235061,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Very small reception area no place to just sit and relax and very small basic rooms Just felt like a budget hotel , Fairly good location although a good cab ride or long walk from Shoreditch 
235062,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, This does not feel like checking into a normal hotel No customer service what so ever barely acknowledged that I was a customer standing in front of them at check in I asked to have extra pillows delivered to my room and they told me to collect them in a guest closet myself on the floor I was staying on There was nothing in the guest closet except 1 iron so that wasn t very helpful , The bed was comfortable but the room was a bit worn Nothing special
235063,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, No Parking as there was a P symbol on the hotel features list we assumed there was Yes there is parking but only public parking and not too close I had emailed the hotel the day before about this to check but received no response I emailed the manager this morning and again no response I would not have booked if I had known website is misleading , Location
235064,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, No hairdryer in the room Gap in bathroom door fine of you are a solo traveller but not if you have company , Location was good 10 min stroll to main tube and train station Refreshments in lobby were nice 
235065,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The first room smelled like cigarette and the window didn t close They offered me a second room which didn t have a sofa and whose bathroom doesn t works correctly You have to pull hard to make it flush I am sure my booking included a bathtub but after the check in even the image of the room changed so I couldn t complain , Limpieza
235066,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Not many places open in the surrounding area near hotel at weekends you do need to travel to a different part of the city for entertainment, Near the subway easy access to London city centre 
235067,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Gym was rather paltry , Chilled water readily available on each level near the lifts with plastic bottles was amazing for filling up before heading out 
235068,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Prices are still extortionate That s London for you , Good location just ten minutes from Liverpool street Really comfy beds and helpful staff Fast wifi and good coffee downstairs 
235069,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, a little expensive compares to other club quarters in other countries , perfect location free coffee and snacks in the lobby good baggage service two elevators
235070,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, There were self service check in and out desks which made the entry and exit feel impersonal The carpet was dreadful and the spoons for tea were plastic stirrers cheap disposable The view was another building , Bed was comfortable and the shower had good water pressure Liked the midday checkout

235076,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Had little contact with staff but didn t give them top marks because when I arrived the person on duty seemed a little perfunctory She explained whatever I needed to know but it was all done quickly with little warmth Otherwise excellent, Complimentary drinks and papers in lounge Room facilities excellent
235077,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Kettle in the room switch was faulty But a minor inconvenience otherwise superb, Excellent location Accommodation of a very high standard very impressed
235078,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, I had trouble choosing just egg sausage bacon mushrooms beans on the breakfast menu although they did mostly facilitate my requirements when I asked , Very comfortable and all the good things above
235079,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch,No Negative, Room was fine bed comfy shower glorious Tea coffee milk etc freely available Water fountains with bottles are an excellent idea Proximity to Liverpool St station 7 min walk for train to Stansted Airport 
235080,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, I didn t find anything I was unhappy with, The location is brilliant beside Leadenhall Market The bedroom was large clean and well equipped for preparing for meetings with desk etc

235082,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Informed you before our visit that it was my wife s birthday on the 25th No offer of a complimentary anything which was very disappointing Hotels in past have always done something to make the day special , Location good Room small Shower not bath and not informed of No mirror at the dressing table Hotel room Door would close on a spring with a very loud bang No discount offered to eat in the hotel 
235083,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The hotel is in the financial district close to the Thaimes and some main stations However this area is pretty dead in the weekend There is no threshold in the shower so the bathroom floor is totally wet after a shower , Quiet and comfortable rooms and fast internet 
235084,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Large room but strangely it wasn t well designed bed was right up against window could only easily get in from one side or end Couldn t easily see tv from bed Cupboard door opened out in front of desk Only one lift working , Huge very comfortable bed good shower Comfortable chairs in lobby lounge with complimentary tea coffee and iced water As the breakfasts were expensive we went next door where there is a Wetherspoons who do good basic fare served promptly Convenient for Monument tube just a short walk 
235085,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch,No Negative, Perfect location the resturant downstairs gaucho was just lovely fab setting great staff and wonderfull food also there was a pub just outside our window and we couldnt hear a thing with the sound proof sliding glass 
235086,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Breakfast was very expensive especially when you consider there is a Weatherspoons next door offering breakfast for a quarter of the price, The staff were friendly room was clean and an ideal location
235087,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Staff not very personal approachable open and friendly , The location is perfect Central and close to the metro station Lots to do in the surrounding area of the hotel as well 
235088,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The reception was possibly the worst I have encountered not only because is was in a cubby hole but it was the least welcoming It was all about taking the money There was no smile no welcome and no explanation for example of breakfast or how to use the life For your information you need to use your key card in there in case they don t tell you First impressions are so important and for that reason it had a big impact on the stay , The breakfast was querky with a south American twist I think I actually quite liked it The room was clean and OK 
235089,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Nothing, The bed was very comfortable room great size had everything to make A comfortable stay in the foyer coffee machine iced water soft drinks all free nice staff great value for London underground close bank and monument would come back
235090,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, No parking but that s London , Quick check in excellent friendly staff top restaurant beautiful rooms with large beds very clean and comfortable 
235091,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The lighting in the room was not practical one switch turned on all of the lights in the room so when I went to bed my husband and son had to sit in the dark in the separate living area otherwise I would have a bright light above my bed if they switched the lights on Nothing luxurious about the furnishing or fittings in the room bathroom but simple functional and clean Because it is in the business district most nearby shops are shut on the weekends but comes back to life on weekdays , We upgraded to a room where the queen bed was partitioned from the living room This gave more room for my son s extra bed in the living area the triple room with queen sofa bed was too cramped for the 3 of us Purified water available on each floor and snacks down in the lobby lounge in the afternoon were convenient but simple 
235092,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, It s clearly a hotel that caters for the business traveller predominantly But sadly with no sanitary disposal equipment in the bathroom there s a worrying assumption that city guests are male only Very disappointing , Proximity to Shard London Bridge and City sights 
235093,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Nothing Only one lift was working but this is because the other was being repaired , The helpful staff the room was very clean very quiet the shower Air con coffee machine at reception 
235094,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, As the hotel is located in the business district most of the shops and bars are shut or close early Keep this in mind when booking Our room backed onto the alley at the back of the hotel which was very noisy plus the room next door had a problem with the pipes making a loud noise every time the toilet was flushed This led to a sleepless night , The location is great to get around London The ease of check in and out was great The room was basic no fridge but the small queen was a good size and was ok for one night

235137,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, I found the service appalling I had Firstly called your hotel on Friday may 6th to advise i would be using another card to pay for my stay than the one i had originally booked with I had asked could I just charge the original card or would I need to have it with me the man i spoke with advised I would need it with me and he would have to send me an application of authorization I never received the email Secondly on my way to the hotel I had called to advise what the situation would be and that I would be using a new card instead The lady on the phone advised me I could not check into my room until 3pm when making my booking on booking com it specifically asked me what time i would like to check in I selected 11 12 box This was another stress that was not necessary and the lady still could not guarantee my room would be ready This should not be advertised to customers if their rooms are not available until 3pm Thankfully there was a room available when we arrived On checking in there was no explanation that my card was going to be charged an extra 30 pounds for a security for breakfast etc I checked my bank account today and had to call the hotel to ask what this extra charge was for none of this was explained on arrival We were not even given times of breakfast or told anything about the Amenities in the hotel At exactly 12pm on Sunday may 8th checkout our telephone rang in our room reception presumably 5 mins later a man knocked on our room door as i answered he he was asking am i staying an extra night or checking out I found this absolutely outrageous that within 5 minutes of being late out of room i had telephone call and a knock on my door I was at reception to checkout by 12 09 It was harassment I will never return to this hotel I was absolutely disgusted with how guests are given no information about anything and the lack of interest your staff show towards the customers , The room was comfortable shower was spacious

235147,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, I got a small Queen room nothing bad just that would have preferred if there is a cupboard for me to hang clothes and that the hotel provides toothpaste I kind of expected these two items to be included in a 4 star hotel regardless of room size , I had to bounce between Tobacco Docks and SOHO so the location was pretty good for me near to Bank station which has access to a few metro lines and some of the attractions like Tower of London Borough Market St Paul Cathedral Tate Modern Staff were friendly and helpful WiFi was strong and good

235153,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, When asked if we could book an extra night staff stated as we booked with booking com we were obliged to do so again online This was slightly inconvenient as we were in a hurry The room had various stains on chair seats and on the carpet giving the room a dirty appearance The room felt very much like a ferry cabin airplane bathroom More suited to the travelling business man rather than a luxury trip away , Location was handy and within good walking distance to major stations Sound proof rooms Good heating system

235174,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Disliked the automatic check in process that wasn t immediately obvious and being made to feel an inconvenience by a staff member who had to direct me to a machine , Great location for a night out in the City and I was surprised how quiet it was given its location Liked the free filtered water machines on each floor too many hotels charge a fortune for bottled water 
235175,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Very much geared towards the business sector but to be expected being in the financial district , The chilled water and bottles on each floor was good as were the closets where you could pick up extra pillows etc without bothering staff

235182,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The room this year was tiny I don t think I ve ever seen such a small shower which was squeezed into a corner of the bathroom literally no room to turn around , Have stayed here before as a handy location after the work Christmas party the room we had last year was so much better than this year though Overall though its really good value 
235183,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The room was not as clean as I thought it would be and the carpet was a bit dusty as if it had not been cleaned before we arrived we also only had one towel so had to phone for more as soon as we arrived but the staff were very quick to respond and helpful , The location was ideal for the tube stations and the Gaucho attached to the hotel was amazing 
235184,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Too noisy Our key stopped working and we couldn t use the lift so we had to ask someone to use their key to go to the reception area Hotel food was too over priced a coke alone was 3 And the area was closed at 5 so nothing was open And the view we had was pipes on the rooftop and another building , Staff were friendly There was a water base with free bottles Flat screen tv good sized room Massive bed 
235185,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch,No Negative, Staff were very helpful The location is well located for City business travellers although a little further for main tourist attractions However the underground is very close as is the river walkway While the room was fairly compact it was perfectly adequate and comfortable for my needs

235193,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, As we visited at the weekend a hotel in the business district perhaps wasn t the wisest choice of ours as all of the bars and restaurants were closed so we had to go further afield for food and drink , Great looking hotel Great room well appointed and with some nice touches like an iPod dock and a little fridge for keeping our own drinks cool 
235194,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Rather depressing everything is grey in this place nothing cosy here ok for sleeping but that s about it definitely no 4 star feeling, Location fast check in pretty cheap for London 96 for a Friday night

235197,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, Very uncomfortable bed and I m pretty sure it has bed bugs On the airplane on our way back home both my husband and I noticed we were full of bites , The location of this hotel is the best thing going for it In the business district and within walking distance to the London tower restaurants and public transport Walk out of the hotel go right and about a block away is the largest T K Maxx I ve ever seen It also has a pub next door which serves very decent food for breakfast lunch dinner

235201,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The rooms are in need of some renovation because they are starting to look a little old and neglected The doors to all the rooms slam shut when they are closing which can be annoying especially if your neighbours are up earlier than you , The location was great not in the centre but close enough The staff were really friendly and helpful 
235202,Club Quarters Hotel Gracechurch, The room was very hot at night , Hotel was comfortable clean and our room was well equipped We did not pay for breakfast as went to the Weatherspoons next door Location is brilliant as close to Liverpool Street No charge for leaving cases after check out Impressed with the complimentary wine and nibbles for my son who was celebrating his 21st birthday
