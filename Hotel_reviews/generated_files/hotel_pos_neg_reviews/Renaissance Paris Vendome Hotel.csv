178253,Renaissance Paris Vendome Hotel, The restaurant in the front corner of the hotel wasn t great service wasn t great However there are many restaurants in Paris , The staff was very friendly The Concierge was very helpful Our room had a view of the street which was nice but the street is loud early in the morning it s a tight street The location is great for The Louvre Mus e d Orsay and the RER Metro Which is what you ll likely take to the Palace of Versailles All easily within walking distance My advice is to use the concierge to book all restaurant reservations and to buy tickets for all of the above attractions The Place de la Concorde is also close for a great walk down the Champs lys es to the Arc de Triomphe this is a bit of a hike but wonderful The Eiffel Tower is not close to the hotel again the Metro easily takes you there and there is no view of it which might be the only slight drawback My advice is to greet everyone with an emphatic Bon Jour and then ask to speak English Have fun with it it s amazing the difference you see in Parisians when you try to speak as must French as you can 
178254,Renaissance Paris Vendome Hotel, the noise from the street was a bit early and loud that is my major complaint other than they said they were going to remodel soon ugh which means i will not be able to stay there again sadly till its done and then hope the prices wont double I hate it when beautiful hotels decide they have to remodel why mess up a good thing , service was GREAT and food was good to great and location FANTASTIC
178255,Renaissance Paris Vendome Hotel, Overall rooms were tiny and inconvenient for a price of nearly 500 per night Air conditioning not working the first night and next day , I really liked the Conceriege service David he is terrific and an asset for an overpriced and under delivering physical property Not a luxury Martiott as advertised
178256,Renaissance Paris Vendome Hotel, Definitely not on a par with other five star hotels in Paris although some of the staff tried to help when they had cancelled one of our rooms by mistake to be told that they had overbooked by six rooms what not acceptable at this price and supposedly quality of hotel,No Positive
178257,Renaissance Paris Vendome Hotel, Hotel is expensive for the facilities While the hotel is luxurious and well maintained because of its small size and lack of facilities like swimming pool and others commonly associated with 5 Stars it does not quite qualify as one We got billed additionally after we left and settled the bill and customer service did not respond to our query , Location of the hotel is excellent and makes it easy to access the Louvre Notre Dame Musee d Orsay Concorde and Retail Stores Hotel is nice but small does not really qualify to be rated a 5 Star Steam sauna and small fitness room are useful facilities Rooms are nice although small We did not have breakfast as we were leaving early for the airport 
178258,Renaissance Paris Vendome Hotel, Wifi was not available for first day and evening Bar not open at all Breakfast was avaerage at best and room service was not good at all food poor , Room was beautiful Location is great and I stay at this hotel or another in this location each time in Paris I visit about 6 times a year
