260102,Le Littr , My window faced out over a terraced area where there were some noisy guests The hotel staff did nothing to quiet them down One of the other rooms in our group had a malfunction hairdryer The staff replaced it but it still did not work , I booked a Standard Room and it was still one of the nicest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in It had both a Walk in Shower with a Rain Shower and a separate Bath Tub We had three rooms The others did not have the same set up but all were nice 
260103,Le Littr , improve the wifi quality in the room It is necessary to improve the air conditioner level not cold enough , staff was efficient and the service was excellent The reception office the dining room staff the cleaning room 
260104,Le Littr , No hotwater on most mornings of our stay Quality of Wifi in the room very intermittent especially in the evenings Mattresses are too soft and hollow Room very small No complementary coffee , Location in 6th arr close to Metro and very restaurants n Rue Rennes Saint Germain in a quiet street Interior of hotel recently uogradedes 
260105,Le Littr , Would have loved access to the roof terrace to watch the Eiffel Tower lit up at night , Warm welcome wonderful service delicious breakfast and a very comfortable stay 
260106,Le Littr , Would have liked a bigger bath but I m being picky , Welcome on arrival and treatment Location was very good just round the corner from the Metro 
260107,Le Littr ,No Negative, Very friendly staff Public transportation to the property There are 4 metro stations around from which you can reach any point in Paris in 20 minutes and TGV Monparnace station at few minutes distance A lot of cafes and restaurants 
260108,Le Littr , The elevator is veryold old fashioned And small size No trolley for bags, The cleanliness of the hotel including the room and the nice smell of the lobby Serving candy in the reception 
260109,Le Littr , Room was a bit tired could do with some freshening up bedcover and head board and room could have been a bit fresher And bathroom robes need replacing , Great coffee and decent breakfast selection Hotel layout felt nice too 
260110,Le Littr , Made 3 local phone calls from the Hotel to an Airline Got charged 52 00 Euro on checkout Not the Hotels fault but Hotel info should be more easily available , Location very close to Montparnasse and the Metro Excellent Breakfast lots of little Brasseries within walking distance Room with a view of the Eiffel Tower extra charge 
260111,Le Littr , Noise isolation is not good you can hear next door guests talking Bathroom door closer is really annoying Breakfast is understaffed Everytime something is out If you have juice you can t get a glass and if you have a glass you can t get juice , Staff very helpfull and polite Room and facilities very clean Near to Monparnasse Rail metro station A lot of TV channels in other languages helps when you have poor french 
260112,Le Littr , I ate breakfast elsewhere because it would have been an additional 20 Euros My traveling companions had it included They had booked through a travel agent and I booked myself online It was a fine room but overpriced since I didn t use any of the amenities , Staff was helpful about metro directions etc 
260113,Le Littr , Peeper across street night receptionist cranky breakfast sub standard, Room was amazing we were on 1st floor peeper across street had to keep curtains closed Breakfast was sub standard compared to what had at other places Comfort wise the room was an A 
260114,Le Littr , There was nothing that we did not like about this beautiful clean hotel , We got upgraded to a room with a balcony and a view the Eiffel Tower Variety of breakfast options Staff very polite and obliging 
260115,Le Littr , There was a noise that seemed to be coming from the ventilation system that was very annoying We told the staff about it but nothing was done , Very nice room good breakfast staff very friendly and helpful 
260116,Le Littr , The breakfast seemed a bit pricy but hotel breakfasts always do We just went to the Cafe St Placide on the Rue de Rennes instead , Every single member of staff was helpful and friendly The hotel was quiet but we liked that Everything was clean and well kept The beds and pillows were wonderfully comfortable There was a bar although it was so quiet that you sometimes had to go to reception to ask someone to come and serve but they always did straight away Close to restaurants and cafes but also easy access to the metro We loved it and I would happily go back More than lived up to expectations
260117,Le Littr , Room too small, Got hotel welcome letter once booked the room and can feel the hospitality via mail Staffs are really great and location is very convenient 
260118,Le Littr , My son had a flight scheduled a few hours ahead of us so we asked the receptionist on duty the night before he had to leave to schedule a small taxi because he was trying to save money on fare He said yes The morning my son had to leave a taxi van came to pick him up He had to pay 9 euros more than we did for our van Everything else was fine except for this The receptionist should have communicated this to my son since he arrived in the lobby 10 minutes before the van arrived , We like that the staff is very approachable for the most part although with our lack of French communication was not that easy at times But that s expected by most visitors in France Nonetheless the staff treated us very kindly 
260119,Le Littr , No bad experiences I just wish that breakfast had been included but it was not because we didn t book directly went through Booking com Breakfast costs 20 Euros per person per night so we ended up at a cafe close by which was much cheaper albeit less convenient , The location was perfect nice quiet but close to restaurants shops the Metro etc We could easily walk to the Seine Les Jardins de Luxembourg the Pantheon etc Staff were friendly and the room upgraded to superior was spacious comfortable and very clean
