20090,The Ampersand Hotel, The cupboard length was too short for clothes to be hung , The attention to detail paid to the furnishing decorations and accessories The lovely drawing room The location is excellent 
20091,The Ampersand Hotel, The standard rooms are tiny but smartly organized For 2 people it s better to get a higher category , A very nice atmosphere great location and very friendly staff As we ve stayed twice in a week the second time they made us a complimentary upgrade which was thoughtful and nice Very nice breakfast nice lobby cute rubber ducks in each room 
20092,The Ampersand Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location Great staff The room and bed was amazing The bar restaurant incredible Beautiful hotel My favourite London Hotel highly recommend
20093,The Ampersand Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is beautifully appointed and the staff are very helpful and friendly It has a relaxed feel but all the extras are greatly appreciated eg free refreshments in the rooms large bathrooms with lovely toiletries provided The bed is very comfortable and the quality of linen excellent The location is great close to museums shops and transport 
20094,The Ampersand Hotel, Nothing not to like , Very nice hotel close to South Kensington station Well appointed lots of thoughtful extras as in free soft drinks in mini bar nice toiletries and free papers Friendly staff would certainly stay again but probably not in a small double was very nice room but slightly cramped 
20095,The Ampersand Hotel, Room was very small Water not replenished after the first night Shower has a very bad smell One of the towels was stained Breakfast buffet was poor , Very good location very close to South Kensington tube station 
20096,The Ampersand Hotel, More walkable nightlife would be great , Comfy beds lovely decor just the right size loved that you could easily take the beautiful spiral stairs Nice lounge area with treats that I never got to try Convenient taxi rank right outside and nearby tube station 
20097,The Ampersand Hotel, My only complaint would be that dogs are welcome in the rooms and tea room but not in the restaurant It would be nice if the hotel was pet friendly across the board rather than only in some areas Other pet friendly hotels in London such as the Milestone do this so it would be wonderful if well behaved dogs who are hotel guests are welcome everywhere , Beautiful rooms lovely doggy bed and bowls for my little Maltese Reception staff very helpful and welcoming Also an unbeatable location next to South Kensington tube 
20098,The Ampersand Hotel, I didn t like that we were in a room that had lots of adaptations for a person with a disability nothing was mentioned when we checked in Room 115 Nice size room though Lots of grab rails and emergency cords hanging My sister has a disability and uses a wheelchair this would have been perfect for her and her husband There was no switch for the fan in the bathroom In the bar at night we ordered drinks and they were never brought it was a little late but it was like they were forgotten The night before we ordered food in the bar and had to send a burger back as it was raw inside and very undercooked Overall I was a little disappointed really for the cost of our stay , The rooms were of a nice size staff were friendly Location was great so close to tube station lots of coffee shop and patisseries etc 
20099,The Ampersand Hotel, With all that we liked and more there was nothing that we didn t like, The Ampersand Hotel and the location to the South Kensington tube station was beyond expectations based on the location and the quality of the hotel Being so close the Royal Albert Hall and the museums was excellent since we enjoyed both The concert at the hall was a must attend event given the acoustics history and beauty We started our days at Gail s Bakery a little corner coffee shop and ended our evenings at The Hereford Arms local pub 3 times over 3 days after daytime underground tube travels to the Borough Market and beyond We will return to the Ampersand Hotel for our next trip to South Kensington and try other local offerings 
20100,The Ampersand Hotel, At 1 30am the tablet guide that is provided as courtesy to the guests was vying for attention beeped vibrated and lit up it asked me to rate something or other so I just flipped it over and got back to bed wasn t fully asleep yet but still a tad bit annoying having to get out Also bathroom was lacking a toilet brush , We arrived around 9am and could already check in at 10am after our breakfast in the drawing rooms Staff is very helpful suggesting places in the hotel where we could work when other rooms were not available or already booked We could work the entire day after check out in the Wine Room which was fantastic Wifi connection throughout is great No passwords or other complicated sign ups required it just works Toilets in common area are spotless Food from Apero and service during the day is fantastic Dinner at Apero was as always have been to the restaurant many times before superb The themes in the hotel are very nice and give it a very homey feel 
20101,The Ampersand Hotel, When the terror attack happened my partners family called the hotel to make sure we we re ok only the staff said it was not there policy to wake us up to make sure we we re ok No note that they had called either You d think in these circumstances they would of knocked the door to see if we were in or not , The hotel was lovely and in a brilliant location Staff were friendly and always helpful 
20102,The Ampersand Hotel, Didn t like the fact thst there was no inclusive breakfast rate and especially the fact that refills of tea and coffee were actively offered and then charged ,No Positive
20103,The Ampersand Hotel,No Negative, Beautiful rooms comfortable beds and very helpful staff Also loved the free wifi and bathroom toiletries from L Occitane Location is fantastic too just minutes from South Kensington tube station 
20104,The Ampersand Hotel, Housekeeping poor with failure to restock minibar and very late making up the room Breakfast service was very slow we felt forgotten about on one morning Bath filled very slowly the shiny bottom of it was a hazard whilst showering , Best full English we ve ever eaten very good value Very comfortable bed Early check in was a blessing after an early train journey Our requests for decaf coffee bath with shower plus early check in were complied with
20105,The Ampersand Hotel, It s a bit on the expensive side of the scale but London in general is quite a pricey place , Excellent location subway station parks and museums are close by very comfortable and seem to be recently renovated rooms soft drinks are included high quality toiletries from L Occitane All in all a perfect choice for a business traveler or a tourist 
20106,The Ampersand Hotel,No Negative, The staff hotel and location were superb Everything was as expected and would highly recommend this hotel Many fine restaurants pubs and shopping within walking distance 
20107,The Ampersand Hotel, I assume the price is OK for London which means overpriced but the rooms are quite small for the money , The Hotel is well situated very near the subway station and the staff is very friendly so if you don t mind the rather small rooms it s a good choice 
20108,The Ampersand Hotel, None, The staff are ver helpful Location is really great closing to tube and taxi stand Very easy access to torist attractions shops and dinings in walking distance 
20109,The Ampersand Hotel, Room was very small and just along from reception entrance and on road level so was a bit noisy Room very hot despite air conditioning but we were unable to open the window due to traffic and general noise, Nice bar area and good location
20110,The Ampersand Hotel, Everything was great I ordered breakfast the night before leaving the paper hanging on the door as instructed The breakfast was not delivered in the am but it worked out fine for me I wasn t even going to mention it but I wanted to order again a few days later and explained that I no longer had the paper needed to order They immediately came to my room and took it from me personally to make sure the order would be taken care of they apologized profusely and then returned with complimentary champagne That was the only blip but it only served to show that they have good customer service , Staff understand the meaning of customer service Everyone was friendly and accommodating I never heard noise or anything disruptive the bathroom floor tiles were heated room service is 24 7 minibar is complimentary I was there a few days before my birthday and without prompting they left a nice plate of chocolates and candied desserts with a Happy Birthday written in chocolate on the plate All the little things added up to make it an excellent stay and a fantastic hotel 
20111,The Ampersand Hotel, Attractive modern hotel impression of crisp and clean However it is let down by the bathroom The hardware is flimsy and cheap the shower cubicle was falling apart the mixer tap on the basin was loose The hand held shower unit was squirting out from the base of the nozzle ,No Positive
20112,The Ampersand Hotel, Room was a bit stuffy and had an mildewy odor Very small but I expected that since it was a small double Located at the end of a hallway near the exit door which made it very undesirable View was of workmen on adjoining roof , Great location Staff was very pleasant and attentive Beautiful decor 
20113,The Ampersand Hotel, The bathroom was too small only 1 person at the time In front of the sink you had the door handle in your back Very inconvenient Noisy little dead end street next to the hotel which kept us awake 2 nights in a row drunk people in car and drunk people sitting on the street Also noisy upstairs neighbor ceiling walls are thin We my husband is American had a very hard time understanding the English of most of the staff Italian Spanish Price quality totally out of wack like most hotels in London , The location is great The hotel is clean 
20114,The Ampersand Hotel, Room is way too small for what it costs , Staffs are very helpful and friendly Make a big difference as it makes me feel more welcome and warm Location is excellent 
20115,The Ampersand Hotel, There were two drawbacks Firstly there were no grips to get in and out of the bath so I could not take a bath and it was very dangerous getting in and out of the bath just to take a shower I am no longer young The other thing is that the bar and restaurant is in a basement and I have never seen that in any other good hotel and may account for why there was never anyone there I certainly am not going to eat in a basement at a 4 or 5 star hotel, The air conditioning could be turned off and the windows opened The TV was a good size There was always some juices and water in the refrigerator The hotel was quiet and seemed to have a pleasant guests with good manners
20116,The Ampersand Hotel,No Negative, The room was small but extremely comfortable I loved the decor bath products complimentary drinks in the mini fridge The bed was amazing it was by far best sleep rest I had during my two weeks abroad The breakfast offerings were phenomenal I wished I would have had more time in London another night at the Ampersand I will definitely stay here next time I m in London 
20117,The Ampersand Hotel, It was a little expensive but it met all our expectations Ok there was a gentle rumble from the underground but hey you are in London , The staff of this hotel knows the importance of attention to detail From the complimentary soft drinks to the reliable internet the thought that has gone into all guest provisions is obvious The bed was superb and the staff were very obliging no matter the request 
20118,The Ampersand Hotel,No Negative, Stunning decor and friendly attentive staff Comfortable beds fluffy towels and loads of hot water Lovely touches including robes slippers toiletries and complimentary refreshments 
20119,The Ampersand Hotel, The superior room we got was unexpectedly small but it did look as good as on the pictures , The hotel is lovely Pleasant and helpful staff really liked the fact that you have a smartphone to use during the duration of your stay came in handy while finding our way walking around London The hotel room was nice and the bed was really comfortable I cant remember the last time I slept so well during my travels Last but not least location location location Everything you need is minutes away 
20120,The Ampersand Hotel, There didn t seem to be a permanent member of staff to serve drinks in the lounge adjacent to check in , Proper milk in minibar fridge Modern design Complimentary soft drinks Excellent service Excellent restaurant within the hotel Apero Fantastic location 
20121,The Ampersand Hotel, Breakfast was very busy and no tables free We were accommodated upstairs but lacked staff then to get any extras, Clean friendly staff good atmosphere Lots of goodies in the bathroom
20122,The Ampersand Hotel, Choice of pillows would have been good and not enough mirrors in the bedroom near a socket to style hair , The staff were very welcoming and helpful during our stay The hotel and rooms were very clean The bar and breakfast are was excellent Loved the fact that they would store our luggage after check in whilst we spent the rest of the afternoon site seeing before leaving for our train home 
20123,The Ampersand Hotel, I booked the smallest room which was fine but probably a little cramped for two people I would stay again but book a bigger room next time , Nice bar in the basement and bright room on the ground floor for afternoon tea 
20124,The Ampersand Hotel, Maybe mats for the bedside tables to stand a hot cup on it feels wrong to put hot crockery on a polished surface though some previous tenant hadn t felt so It would be SO nice if hotels would offer the package as Bed and Breakfast rather than tacking that on as an extra who doesn t want breakfast , Just a very nice hotel nicely different because it s independent and not the usual chain everything the same look Musical themed room was nice Staff pleasant and attentive 
20125,The Ampersand Hotel, The wifi was a little slow and the room was incredibly warm during the night , The staff were very friendly helpful and interested in us Walk in shower was amazing as well as the little touches such as books in our room the complimentary minibar and the L occitane toiletries The staff went above and beyond for my boyfriend s birthday as we got back from our evening out to find plate of cakes in our room with chocolate piping around the edge and a little card too Lovely personal touches 
20126,The Ampersand Hotel, Distant rumbling from deep below ground of tube trains but really not a big deal Didn t keep me awake Probably only affects rooms on ground floor I was in room 007 , Did not eat at hotel at all due to my ongoing illness but room was terrific in every way and staff extremely helpful Free soft drinks and water in minibar Free phone calls Bed and pillows VERY comfy 
20127,The Ampersand Hotel, Lack of mirrors One in the bathroom and one inside the cupboard door except when the cupboard was open there was little space to stand in let alone dry your hair A full length mirror on a spare wall by the door would ve been great Not sure I m thrilled on staff wearing jeans as their uniform though they do have white shirts waistcoats with them , The hotel was literally across the road from the tube station Beds were comfy and bathroom spacious
20128,The Ampersand Hotel, We took afternoon tea We requested coffee rather than tea no problem When then we asked for a second cup we were charged extra 6 00 which is was outrageous when two ladies sitting at the next table were offered a second complete set of sandwiches at nil cost When we raised the issue at Reception when settling up we were told by the Receptionist I have nothing to do with the dining room and that was that Only 6 00 you may say but this mean mindedness has put us off a ever returning and b recommending the hotel to others , The bed was very soft the room a tad on the small side and the TV set at the foot of the bed was overpowering 
20129,The Ampersand Hotel, Nothing , The staff were excellent Room very clean and comfortable The room was quiet even though we we overlooked the main road The air conditioning actually worked Each room has an Android mobile which has free calls to local and 9 foreign countries It also comes with a free data plan so visitors can use internet and GPS free of charge 
20130,The Ampersand Hotel,No Negative, We stayed at the Ampersand Hotel Kensington on the eve of our wedding and our wedding night The staff were so friendly and helpful especially Miguel who showed us to our room and helped with our bags The hotel itself was clean and as described on their website We were not disappointed with our room which was a compact but functional suite on the 5th floor the room had a well stocked complimentary mini bar robe slippers tv s etc and even our own secure wifi bubble it also had a balcony over looking Harrington Road which was nice The little extras that the hotel staff arranged were so thoughtful I received a little postcard an hour after we arrived wishing me a happy stay and wonderful day accompanied by a small box of tasty sweet treats On our arrival back at the hotel after our wedding celebrations there was a plate in our room with happy wedding written on it in chocolate and more sweet treats it was such a lovely touch We would not hesitate to recommend the Ampersand Hotel and will definitely be back for our anniversary 
20131,The Ampersand Hotel, Couldn t get into the restuarant on the Friday night as it was very busy , Excellent location Short walking distance to tube station restuarants museums and Harrods 
20132,The Ampersand Hotel, Nothing , Very good customer service Every time I call housekeeping in seconds my requests were there Very accommodating reception as well There s always someone to assist you 
20133,The Ampersand Hotel,No Negative, This was our second time at the Ampersand and it was just as lovely The tea room is charming and the kids played in the game room for at least an hour It is also a nice location for visiting the museums 
20134,The Ampersand Hotel, the room is small facilities are average lights are very dim there was a bad smell and there was no view whatsoever, the bed is very comfortable the location is excellent and the room is clean and tidy
20135,The Ampersand Hotel, The room turned out smaller than I expected but I didn t dwell on this fact because I did book the room online and the images could be deceiving What my main issue is and what left me utterly speechless was the lack of trustworthy staff this hotel employed I left my ring in my room s table I put it in the same spot every night and when I remembered after coming back to the hotel it disappeared I decided to not assume the worst and looked everywhere but there was no sign of it so I decided to speak to the reception and ask for their help to check which members of staff entered cleaned the room The response which left me utterly shocked was when I asked them to check cctv and they replied that they would but that s assuming someone from outside the hotel somehow entered my room and took the ring They didn t want to question any of their staff at least the ones who entered the room because they wanted to give their own employees the benefit of the doubt I understand that employers must protect their employees but what if that compromises the customers experience My primary issue was the ring that was stolen which has a lot of sentimental value linked to it but it s certainly a matter of trust now You d expect the hotel to contact you even if they didn t find the ring and the issue they claimed to look into But guess what No one has contacted me ever since it s been a month even to apologise I m writing this review not to express my anger only but to warn other customers from a hotel which clearly has their customers at the bottom of their priority list , Nothing it was a disappointment 
20136,The Ampersand Hotel, Room was exceptionally small no room to even put 2 suitcases so for a couple too small to even move around each other Should have upgraded the room and paid a bit extra , Staff exceptionally nice and helpful Hotel beautiful and nicely done 
20137,The Ampersand Hotel, Absolutely nothing , The hotel is in a fantastic location in the heart of London and only a 1 minute walk to the nearest tube station South Kensington The staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and polite The room had plenty of character was in immaculate condition and was spotless The room service was excellent and reasonably priced for a hotel of this standard Unlimited complimentary soft drinks were also provided for the mini bar which was an added bonus we were unaware of I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for something with a bit of character in the heart of the city We will be returning 
20138,The Ampersand Hotel, We liked the hotel the staff and the location was perfect for our trip to the V A Perfect , The staff were amazing It makes such a difference to your stay and we will stay with you again Thanks 
20139,The Ampersand Hotel,No Negative, Well placed for tube and therefore many parts of London We only stayed one night and although the room was very small it was attractive and clean with good quality toiletries Staff were extremely charming and helpful No hesitation in staying again 
20140,The Ampersand Hotel, The breakfast is not so great I tried full English menu bread was burnt and bacon was overcooked I will come back for the hotel but just go out for breakfast , Everything is good nice deco helpful staff great location
20141,The Ampersand Hotel, Not that it s any different but more variety in the mini fridges , I enjoyed being greeted as soon as I opened the entrance door I loved the staircase and enjoyed the shower a lot Comfy bed and clean towels 100 
20142,The Ampersand Hotel,No Negative, Extras in the room were very good i e minibar tv toiletries Room was comfortable and large Really close to South Kensington tube station which was perfect 
20143,The Ampersand Hotel, A couple of coat hooks on the outside of bathroom door or side of wardrobe would have made a big difference in such a small room , Bed very comfy staff very friendly 
20144,The Ampersand Hotel, Nothing at all , We had a very busy time in London and didn t have any time to enjoy the hotel facilities but we really loved the very comfortable bed and pillows Looking forward to having a longer stay next time 
20145,The Ampersand Hotel, The street outside is a little noisy but considering you re in the heart of London I think it would be remiss to fault the hotel for this fact , The staff went the extra mile to make our stay pleasant and memorable the room was absolutely luxurious and the location is incredible 
20146,The Ampersand Hotel, The double room was so small very caulostrphobic the room stunk the smell from the back of the fridge was like stagger water and when you run the taps in the bathroom the smell of drains was disgusting , Location
20147,The Ampersand Hotel, We arrived at 3 30pm to check in we were advised to arrive 2pm and our room wasn t ready We were asked to take a seat and have a coffee or leave our baggage and the reception staff would call to let us know when the room was ready By 5 15pm we still hadn t been called We came back and were advised that the room was ready and for our inconvenience we could have a complimentary breakfast for two However despite this the cost of the breakfast was still added to our bill Room was very small dark and had no natural light , The location of the hotel was great and breakfast was delicious The bathroom was also very spacious with lovely toiletries 
20148,The Ampersand Hotel, I ve stayed here before but this time I was very disappointed with my room It was tiny with a very large shower room that looked like a disabled toilet I couldn t open both my suitcases in the room I had to store one in the bathroom The hanging space was tiny and it was difficult to access the kettle to make a cuppa , Beautifully decorated around main hotel Luxurious touches in rooms 
20149,The Ampersand Hotel, The double room was small with no view outlook onto a wall But there was an indication of this in the hotel description and for one night this was fine , The special touches including a ready loaded mobile phone with maps and tourist information The extra special specialist teas soft drinks Inc in price L Occtaine soap storage of our luggage after we had checked out which enabled us to enjoy the rest of our time in London 
20150,The Ampersand Hotel, I had arranged that on arrival there would be a 18th birthday treat in the room but unfortunately it came later The sink was faulty on second night and had to be attended to , Comfy bed and quiet
20151,The Ampersand Hotel,No Negative, This is a lovely hotel in a perfect position next door to the South Kensington Tube I have stayed here three times and it is always good The hotel is a stylish retreat in a busy city with a good restaurant a comfortable drawing room and helpful staff 
20152,The Ampersand Hotel, The games room was a mess when we went down there on Friday evening to play table tennis There were half cups of tea everywhere seemingly left from during the day I told the staff before we arrived that our stay was a birthday surprise for my boyfriend but they didn t make any extra effort like other top hotels do , Comfy bedding and nice bathroom 
20153,The Ampersand Hotel, Room sizes were tiny and too small for us as a family Also there were no adjoining family rooms, Staff were amazing kind especially as my kids are rather excitable and noisy restaurants were atmospheric food delicious especially breakfast
20154,The Ampersand Hotel, We stayed for about a week and didn t want to live out of our suitcases that long but there was very little dresser or closet space into which to unpack Also as someone short of stature the very high tub was challenging to step into But these issues would not prevent us from returning , The great things about this hotel include the attentive staff the great location the comfy bed and did I mention the very helpful staff Wonderful experience 
20155,The Ampersand Hotel,No Negative, Kind staff comfort heated bathroom floor great multiple choice breakfast with good expresso many good restaurants around a few steps to the underground station the handy phone guide to take with you to visit around 
20156,The Ampersand Hotel, Staff were a mixed bag to be honest On arriving back at the hotel after night out we couldn t get into our rooms as the system had advised we d checked out I was then questioned and queried by the night staff and made to feel like it was my problem and not the hotel s I had to wait over 20 minutes for keys to be re programmed to gain entry to the room Not much sympathy from the Duty Manager the next day This was the only bad thing but did leave a cloud over our stay The lady that we checked in with and checked out with however was a delight ,No Positive
20157,The Ampersand Hotel, It was all amazing , The staff were so friendly and helpful Nothing was too much trouble They looked after my 80 year old parents brilliantly The food was also excellent and I recommend the seafood risotto Fantastic location for the Royal Albert Hall and the museums Couldn t have been more perfect Thank you
20158,The Ampersand Hotel, Nothing it was a faultless stay , There was a free mobile phone in the room for use in or out of the hotel not that we used it but a great idea The drinks in the fridge were complimentary Comfy bed great shower fantastic location 
20159,The Ampersand Hotel, Rooms really are tiny no space to even put a suitcase Staff were overstretched in the evenings The lounge area is always full of non residents making use of the afternoon tea service When checking in the full accommodation and extras cost was reserved on my credit card When I checked out I was told the hold would remain for 10 days company policy the standard excuse Unacceptable , Great location and very lovely contemporary hotel Staff very accommodating and helpful 
20160,The Ampersand Hotel, Nothing , It s a wonderful hotel and we will certainly stay there the next time we re in London The location room staff breakfast everything was perfect I don t have anything negative or slightly less positive to say 
20161,The Ampersand Hotel, Room was next to lift so heard some lift motor noise and foot traffic , Location was excellent Hotel clean tidy Perfect base for The Royal Albert Hall museums 
20162,The Ampersand Hotel, The room wasn t that big but it had a great king size bed But I thought the value was very good , The location is fabulous just 1 4 block from the tube There is also an area of outdoor restaurants nearby The staff members were terrific 
20163,The Ampersand Hotel, Everything was excellent , Our stay at the Ampersand hotel met all our expectations and we will recommend this hotel to all travelling to London We are looking forward to our next visit 
20164,The Ampersand Hotel,No Negative, Great Location friendly and helpful staff For a London hotel I think I have finally found value for money I wont be staying anywhere else from now on Comfortable beds clean and central to everything 
20165,The Ampersand Hotel, Very small rooms more choices for breakfast you could hear the tube underground vibration if you have a room on the first floor but it was not a concern of mine but may be for some people , Boutique hotel quiet and right across the street from the tube Close to Knightsbridge
20166,The Ampersand Hotel, Couldn t quite get the air in my room right so was really stuffy for most of the stay They did send maintenance to look at it seemed to help some but never really did cool down Otherwise it was wonderful , Love the staff the location the restaurant the decor and all the little touches that go above beyond The rooms are a good size you get lots of closet drawer storage It s really a lovely hotel and extremely close to a tube station restaurants 
20167,The Ampersand Hotel, I didnt like that we had to pay 50 pounds in advance I have been in several hotels and never had to pay money in advance, THE bed was super Everything very clean staff very friendly 
20168,The Ampersand Hotel,No Negative, Staff couldn t have been more welcoming friendly and helpful The added touch of the dog bowls and bed for our puppy in the room really made our stay Bed is extremely comfy and the room much bigger than I had previously got in London for around the same price 
20169,The Ampersand Hotel, The only negative I would say that I disliked was that there was a sound of glass being thrown into some kind of bin near our window I don t know it was a recycling bin or what but because our room was on the main floor the sound was rather loud Other than that it was a great stay , The staff were kind enough to keep our luggage in storage for 10 days at the hotel we were traveling before our stay at the hotel and our luggage was placed in our room at time of check in that service was absolutely appreciated The staff were super friendly and were very attentive to our needs The rooms were so much more spacious than what we anticipated and immaculately kept Would stay here any time I have a short stay in London 
20170,The Ampersand Hotel, Faultless , This was a special occasion for the family and the hotel felt very special It is imaginatively furnished very comfortable very clean great facilities The staff were very cheerful and helpful they seemed to enjoy their jobs I only wished we could have stayed longer 
20171,The Ampersand Hotel, Wardrobe space rather limited, Excellent location over road from South Kensington station Comfortable well appointed rooms Very helpful and friendly staff 
20172,The Ampersand Hotel, There was no mirror over the desk dressing table to do hair make up There was space for one on the wall so this would make the room perfect, Beds were really comfy Compact room but had everything we needed

20174,The Ampersand Hotel, The size of the standard room is very small it was hard to move around bathroom size was ok though very nice and clean , Location is great close to a lot of nice restaurants and shops Room is nice and modern Great hotel overall 
20175,The Ampersand Hotel, The room was small even for two people but for the location and price we made it work , The location is around the corner from the metro across the steet from a number of restaurants and a fresh fruit store Our room was very quiet newspaper on our door every morning complementary orange snd apple juice and water Staff was amazing 
20176,The Ampersand Hotel, The restaurant Located in the basement and never open when we were hungry Smelt of fish and unappealing , Wonderful location We booked for one night as we went to the Proms at the Albert Hall Easy walking distance to there and Hyde Park for a morning run and coffee

20185,The Ampersand Hotel, Underfloor heating in bathroom may be good in winter but we prefer not to have this in summer , We nearly always stay in The Ampersand and every time we go back we think why did we try anywhere else A great boutique hotel with very friendly staff and the most comfy beds ever 
20186,The Ampersand Hotel, Staff in the front parlor were hard to come by made getting a quick coffee in the morning difficult and we had to wait quite a while to get someone to seat us for tea , Location was perfect close to the tube and walk able to lots of restaurants and bars Rooms were small but very comfortable

20220,The Ampersand Hotel, Sadly this is where we felt the highlights ended for us We were celebrating our Wedding Anniversary and although we were left a gesture in the room the service we expected was far below average I called down to reception to advise that we had opened the balcony door and could not shut it so if someone could have a look at it and whilst they were heading up could they provide ironing facilities The room was not looked at for several hours even though it was pretty cold and when they did arrive no ironing facilities were provided I called down to reception to advise not to worry however I would like the Bluetooth code to connect to the media system to which I was told they did not know what it was but someone would call me to let me know Again I was let down and no call was received I quickly overlooked these things as the time came for us to head down to a pre booked dinner in the restaurant for our Anniversary The Restaurant is in the lower grounds of the hotel We arrived at 7 45pm a little earlier than our 8pm reservation however the waiter was happy to seat us early We asked for a drinks menu so we could order a bottle of wine and decided to order some olives whilst waiting for the food menu 15 minutes passed and still no food menu 25 minutes later and after asking once already the food menu it finally arrived 1 hour and 15 minutes later and no wine left in the bottle we decided that clearly no one was interested in taking our food order again after asking 2 waiters if we could be served Finally we got someone s attention which turned out to be the Manager and he was very quick to apologise and as a gesture agreed to cover the cost of our olives and did not apply a service charge How spoilt did we feel We had noticed we were not the only people facing difficulties as a gentlemen sat opposite had to ask for cutlery twice as his food sat in front of him getting cold In all honestly for the money sadly we won t be returning , We drove to the Hotel and paid the extra to park at the Hotel s recommended carpark This was simple although I would suggest making sure you call the hotel 5 minutes or so before arrival as the wardens waiting in the road along side the hotel are very quick to pounce The initial greet and at first sight the hotel is lovely A great location for people wanting to explore what London has to offer The tube station and Kensington itself is only 2 minutes walk and the Natural History Museum is also only 5 minutes walk away The room size was good and very clean Not much of a view but we had London to explore so not too worried about that
