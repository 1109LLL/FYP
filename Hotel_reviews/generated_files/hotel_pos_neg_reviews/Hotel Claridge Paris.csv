164072,Hotel Claridge Paris, The access to the lift for travelers carrying heavy luggage was a bit of a let down The lifts were also too small The friendliness of the staff and their willingness to assist made up for the inconvenience , The bed was big and comfortable The hotel was close to many good eateries and the metro station made it convenient to travel with ease Its location and close proximity to tourist attractions made it a perfect place to stay The staff was also very helpful and friendly 
164073,Hotel Claridge Paris, The staff at the front desk were quite rude and didn t seem to care whether I felt comfortable or enjoyed my stay I interacted with different people on four different occasions and received the same treatment They were quite abrupt and indifferent when speaking to me at all times, The location is close to champs de lysees
164074,Hotel Claridge Paris, Hallways and stairs were dated need to be cleaned up and refreshed , Staff was excellent Room was charming and spacious I was traveling with my adult daughters 18 21 and we had plenty of room 
164075,Hotel Claridge Paris,No Negative, My wife and I like the room decoration very much when manager knows this is our honeymoon trip they give us a bottle of champagne as gift What a surprise All the staff are very nice and helpful This a very pleasure stay experience 
164076,Hotel Claridge Paris, Was probably an accident but the room was not made up by housekeeping While there is 24 hour room service the bar and eating area are unattended except for breakfast , Staff very helpful when we did not like the first Delux room assigned Changed us to a room which was more like the photo on Booking com
164077,Hotel Claridge Paris, the hotel is really in need of renovation everything is old sound insulation nonexistent loud air conditioning you only pay for the location, Location breakfast personnel
164078,Hotel Claridge Paris, I didnt like that room has only one bottle of water at least should be two bottles it does not matter but at least the house keeping should refill with one bottle of water the next day while cleaning ,No Positive
164079,Hotel Claridge Paris, I couldn t sleep because of the noise I didn t like the staff because they gets angry when you ask for anything The condition is not work ,No Positive
164080,Hotel Claridge Paris, The room air conditioning didn t work at all well on a very warm April evening We didn t say much as we only had two nights and we opened all windows at night Still slept ok nothing worth complaining about at all , Warm and friendly welcome Staff were polite and spoke excellent English Great location and plenty of lovely dining experiences nearby Fantastic mini break Thank you 
164081,Hotel Claridge Paris, Instructions how to use the mixer shower Sounds simple but the top of the tap was missing and it needed a very good pull, We didn t get much time to eat but excellent friendly staff
164082,Hotel Claridge Paris, The rooms were NOTHING like the photos from which I had chosen the hotel We were in a plain small room and took til night time staff to come on to make the bed into 2 singles as requested The air con was controlled by reception It was very hot inside but we could not make it cooler and when we asked them to put the bar fridge on we were told we could not put anything from outside in it Customer service could have been a lot better , The location was great The breakfast was good 
164083,Hotel Claridge Paris, We dont have any complains, The staff and location are great its a 5min walk to the champs elysees We knew where we want to go and what we wanted to do but the staff were very helpful in general
164084,Hotel Claridge Paris, The first point that I didn t like is that when the hotel charged me by mistake they took the money twice When I called the person on the phone was extremely rude telling me that it was a bank holiday in France that this kind of things can never happen in this hotel and seemed to don t care about On the top of that while we were on the phone he spoke to his colleague telling him that the cake was in the fridge At the end he told me to call the following day to speak with his colleague who had been more helpful and understanding The second point which is for me extremely unprofessional is that when we checked out at 12am by mistake we forgot in the safe around 250 and my passport After 5 hours we went back to take our luggages but they didn t let us know they found them We realised we didn t have them only when we arrived in the train station In any other case we could have missed our flight We called back the hotel and weren t still not sure if they found anything We had to go back and fortunately been given everything They should have let us know they found them at least when we came back for our luggages , I liked the location the hotel itself was really nice too As well the room was clean and everyday the staff checked properly our room and let it spot on 
164085,Hotel Claridge Paris, We were very disappointed by the staff and facilities One example was that the wifi constantly stopped working every ten minutes When I asked the staff about this they said it is always like this and we just have to accept it The overall attitude of the staff does not match the marketed image of this hotel We came down for breakfast a little after 7 The staff said it starts at 7 He begrudgingly let us in after I said to him that it was already past 7 During check in they also ignored us while chatting Took my credit card but didn t give us any price info We booked 2 double occupancy rooms with only 3 ppl Yet they felt they had to interrogate us about how many ppl were in each room I also saw them ask the same to another group They seemed to be 4 ppl in 2 double rooms Overall they only thing food about this place is the location But there are other hotels there too ,No Positive
164086,Hotel Claridge Paris, The socking fact that the staff access your room with no permission not even door knocking happened 2 times while I was sleeping and they weren t housekeeping 1 very small elevator internet access was terrible you need to re enter password every 5 min , location was the good thing about it
164087,Hotel Claridge Paris, Breakfast was a bit too expensive , My two young daughters loved the decoration which is a mix of old and new styles Staff was very friendly and helpful 
164088,Hotel Claridge Paris, There was no milk for tea or coffee Breakfast was a bit boring Same food every breakfast , The location is to die for Beautiful Champs Eysees Walking distance to Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe 
164089,Hotel Claridge Paris, breakfast is a bit expensive and leaves much to be desired particularly compared to other local hotel breakfasts , Nice decorations and decent beds Excellent bathrooms a fun place to stay 
164090,Hotel Claridge Paris, Problems with payment system unable to work out issues between booking com and their system Key cards must face up but are hard to see which side is up and must be totally shoved in , It was ok Fairly close to the arc d triumph about 15 minutes walking Bathroom was great 
164091,Hotel Claridge Paris, Having to leave We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would love to visit again in the future , The staff were absolutely brilliant always helpful and polite The room was lovely and bright and always kept clean The location is perfect for all the main attractions most within walking distance 
164092,Hotel Claridge Paris,No Negative, Really comfortable bed large airy room helpful and friendly staff Location ideal for exploring the area around the Champs Elys e Avenue George Cinq and the Seine This is the 2nd time I ve stayed here the first was for a holiday and this time for business and I will continue to make this my base for future trips to Paris 
164093,Hotel Claridge Paris, Breakfast could have been a little better but didn t detract from the whole experience and in fairness we had arrived direct from a five star hotel in Cannes , Staff very friendly and efficient Great room on first floor Really handy for the tourist attractions which were within walking distance
164094,Hotel Claridge Paris, The tea service in my room could have been better There was no milk available to have a cup of tea in the mornings before breakfast , On arrival we were made welcome When your dry cleaning service got the oil stain from my evening gown quick to offer umbrellas when it was so greatly needed 
164095,Hotel Claridge Paris, my friends suggested more options for breaklfast However I had breakfast at Laduree and that was close by only a few mins walk , location helpful staff lovely clean rooms and bathrooms 
164096,Hotel Claridge Paris, Wifi is free but poor keeps on requesting the password Haven t tried the breakfast but 24 eur per person sounds a lot , Spacious rooms perfect location for shopping and sightseeing Several underground parkings in the area so easy to get by with car 
164097,Hotel Claridge Paris, The bed was fine but we stayed in a room with three beds and the third bed should have been as sturdy as the other two The buffet breakfast was a bit too pricey in general and with regard to the selection of items , The hotel is in a great location Very close to the Champs Elys es and public transport and the staff will call a taxi if needed but there is also a taxi stand about a 5 minute walk away The room was large enough for three and in Paris that is sometimes hard to find The staff was also very pleasant and helpful and the welcome and complimentary grapes and chocolates etc were a welcome addition 
164098,Hotel Claridge Paris, The reception girl is very helpful but not that nice The hotel is a bit far from the metro , The location is really good if you plan to do some luxury shopping The room is clean The beds are also comfy I like everything in my room The city view is available for some rooms so if you prefer the city view don t forget to make a request before check in 
164099,Hotel Claridge Paris, Took me a few tries to work out key needed writing face up to work LOL, Fabulous location and extremely helpful staff who spoke English View of Balmain Atelier and just around the corner to the Champs Elysees 
164100,Hotel Claridge Paris, I suggest a little refreshing of some rooms while keeping the French cachet , Wonderful staff always ready to make helpful suggestions You feel at home and truly welcome Great breakfast too 
164101,Hotel Claridge Paris, I have nothing negative to report , Front desk staff were most accommodating and helpful The hotel is very quiet with beautifully furnished rooms We did not try the restaurant but they do offer breakfast if you d like that The elevator is small but saves you the trek up the winding staircase with bags Location is one long block off the Champs Elysees and the FDR Metro entrance so it s near tons of restaurants and shopping venues bring lots of money 
164102,Hotel Claridge Paris,No Negative, Perfect location Perfect family run hotel for families and business travelers alike Beautiful rooms with a very large peaceful staff was perfect
164103,Hotel Claridge Paris, Walls are not sound proof One of the elevators was down and the one that worked could only carry two people max, Location is great Clean Staff are lovely Considering the high rates in Paris I believe I got value for my money during my stay Cozy lobby
164104,Hotel Claridge Paris, Extremely small room and corridor one can barely move inside main elevator was out or order and standby one was like a goods lift not a persons , Location breakfast staff 
164105,Hotel Claridge Paris, I incidentally broken one of the two coffee cups and it has never replaced for the whole stay , The main elevator didn t work properly for 3 days but the staffs are willing to help 
164106,Hotel Claridge Paris, The regular elevator was not working This was not informed on the website or thru booking com We have to use the service elevator which is a space for only one person Also you have to give an extra 15 mins waiting for this elevator This was a major hindrance The checkout person was annoying as he did not wish to work in the morning There is no bellboy to take your luggage as he did not arrive as per his schedule time It took 30 mins to checkout with constant complaints about his work and then calling the taxi for the airport I recall his name was Patrick , Location very near to Champs elysses The rooms were quite reasonably sized The bathroom was very clean and spacious Extra care like bathroom slippers Voss mineral water etc was given on the first day Good hotel 
164107,Hotel Claridge Paris, old facility old furniture cracked and broke old toilet ware old and unclean floor no sound proof from external noises not even internally from other guests in the hotel as I could hear conversations some times The most frustration was with the elevator capacity it was one adult with a child size imagine when you go for shopping one person should be in the top and the second in the ground to load the bags, Nice location for those interested to stay close from famous brands outlets cafee restaurants Triumphal arch and Place de la Concorde Cosy bid Friendly staff and helpful during the whole stay
164108,Hotel Claridge Paris, Some area s after a few days where worn but overall this took nothing away from this beautiful hotel Lift not working but only on 2nd floor do we used stairs anyway , Really comfortable room which was really clean and when we first walked in got a very big wow Reception was beautiful and welcome was really good
164109,Hotel Claridge Paris, , The rooms are very nice and all with a balcony with a view of the street The room we stayed in was well equipped against the sounds coming from the street outside The bathrooms were also nice and clean I visited three rooms in total friends staying there The location is good very close to the Eiffel tower and the rest of the city fairly close by 
164110,Hotel Claridge Paris, We had lots of inconveniences during our stay The smell of the cooking in the kitchen woke us up at 6am daily the elevator stopped working for more than 24 hours The plexi ice buckets are broken so the ice would melt and water will fill the table On avarage the staff is very unfriendly except for Julien Luckily the front door manager Julien was there He did his best in every way to make our stay more comfortable Thank him for that , We were three adults in the room The room was spacious and the beds very comfortable The location of this hotel is very good Close to many shopping and touristic areas 
164111,Hotel Claridge Paris, I l liked it all only minor for me was that It would have been nice to have hair conditioner in the bathroom , I liked everything about this hotel It feels luxurious and is very comfortable and cosy The bed was very comfortable and the room was quietly located The staff were extremely friendly and helpful There was a good selection of food for breakfast There are lots of restaurants and bars nearby and located close to the champs elysees The location was great 
164112,Hotel Claridge Paris, The hotel look totally different than the pictures in your display you can t even move the room is too small and at night there was a loud noise all night from the bar down the street the staff is not helpful and one of the used bad language regarding a women in the street which I thought out of manners the value of my stay is way too high for this kind of hotel the last time for me to use booking, Nothing
164113,Hotel Claridge Paris, The bar service was poor and quite disorganised If we came in late we were unable to get a drink from the bar Also breakfast for me who requires gluten free very poor despite pre warning We had to eat out most mornings, Excellent location very central and the staff were extremely helpful Room was nice would have benefitted from a set of drawers 
164114,Hotel Claridge Paris,No Negative, Excellent staff and great facilities Rooms were good size considering some places in France rooms are small Great location to all major attractions and shopping area Our stay and communication via the hotel was brilliant Highly recommend 
164115,Hotel Claridge Paris, Not quite to the standard you would expect at the UK Claridges Extra cost for breakfast, This hotel has a lovely central position to visit all the sites The staff could not do enough for us they were pleasant helpful and informative
164116,Hotel Claridge Paris, The only let down with this hotel was the unhelpful miserable staff at breakfast which was a shame considering everyone else was brilliant , The location was excellent the service outstanding the reception staff brilliant the room perfect loved this hotel well worth the money 
164117,Hotel Claridge Paris, Didn t get breakfast because it was 25 eruos , Charming hotel right in the middle of the fashion houses but easy walk to Champs d Elysees Room was beautiful complete with chandelier and rain head shower I got a great deal on Booking com which is why I said it was a good value for the money I couldn t afford their usual prices 
164118,Hotel Claridge Paris, I don t think we had the warmest welcome when we arrived but the rest of the time we were there we were made to feel at home by the staff There was one member of staff that worked the night shift that went out of his way to help us However disappointed with the hotel itself considering it was a 4 star hotel I think there are probably better 4 star hotels in Paris Also could hear the person in the room next door having an hour long telephone conversation late at night which kept us awake , Excellent location Almost all of the staff were friendly and very helpful 
164119,Hotel Claridge Paris, I did not like the room very much and there was not much of a view In addition the bathroom was very very small , I really enjoyed the location and their breakfast set up was better than that of Hotel Powers which I stayed at a month before 
164120,Hotel Claridge Paris, The sink in the bathroom was badly cracked and stained not what you expect in a 4 star hotel it had obviously been cracked for some time and should have been replaced, The position decor of room
164121,Hotel Claridge Paris, The lift for some reason is in the middle of the staircase What a crazy idiotic design Had to drag suitcase up and down the staircase , Staff was friendly and helpful
164122,Hotel Claridge Paris, cheap small room bathroom broken sink difficult to regulate water temperature overcharged for 2 inexistant breakfasts no excuses Worth 2 strars max, location

164124,Hotel Claridge Paris, The noise isolation is not effective I imagine what the situation would be if the neighboring tenants had babies Also the doors need lubricants to eliminate the sqweez sound Other than that it is a good environment , We liked the location the spacious room and toilet the cleanliness the staff is great all of them The hotel interior is majestic historic type
