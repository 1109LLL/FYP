302326,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Everything was excellent No other comment needed, Hotel is in an excellent location on one of the main shopping streets of Milan A metro station to the M1 line is just outside walking distance to the Stazione Centrale the site seeing tour bus stop is 20 m away a good selection of restaurants in the vicinity 
302327,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo,No Negative, I had a small incident with my card bot related to this hotel and i was very angry at that time Sonja the front desk amazing woman was very helpful even when i was kind on throwing my anger upon her and insisting that the incident related to my credit card pre authorization comes from the hotel Indeed it was a true customer service that we always strive to see in the hotel management field Thank you again Sonja you made my day back then when you gave me all the evidences 
302328,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, No problems just a minor with a bit hard pillow but there was a better pillow in the closet so no problem really, Breakfast fantastic spa too Great service from the personal as well room very clean and perfect refilled with shampoo and minibar 
302329,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The rooms were a bit small but had all comodities needed , Front desk staff very kind and helpful when asking directions Good interaction Tasty breakfast 
302330,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, This had been booked as a birthday present to end a two week trip around Italy and it was an extremely disappointing stay On arrival staff were rude and did not greet us or welcome us to the hotel They made us feel uncomfortable and as if we were an unconvinced to their day We were not told about the facilities available within the hotel or shown the direction to the lifts or where our room would be When entering the room I was extremely disappointed with the dated decor and to discover that the wall paper was peeling off the wall and that they had attempted to stick it back on by using tape As a surprise my boyfriend had emailed to ask if they could supply us with sparkling wine and roses on arrival like in their pictures they did not respond and obviously did not acknowledge or prepare this for our arrival Overall very disappointing , Hotel in a good location Were able to store luggage before check in time 
302331,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo,No Negative, A beautiful building that is delicate and quiet off busy streets A degree is solitude and the spa center amazing Breakfast tastefully done and although there for a stop over was well worth it after some hectic traveling A short walk to main shopping district cathedral and the Campari bar 
302332,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo,No Negative, we stayed in the suite with the balcony we liked the free minibar you can walk to a big park great for traveling with kids best coffee in breakfast and great service
302333,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Couldn t stay longer , Excellent room and breakfast We were upgraded on the first visit to a lovely room and couldn t believe a restocked complementary mini bar 
302334,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Everything was positive, Great location and very attentive staff Very Good breakfast Nice elegant and clean building Nice rooms not so big but enough to be comfortable
302335,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, There really wasn t anything not to like , Wonderful stay on our first visit to Milan We caught the train from the airport to Centrale and then walked the kilometre or so to the hotel Wonderfully warm greeting at the front desk and early entry to our room We booked an Executive room on the 6th floor reasonably large with a great bathroom and bath We were delighted on check in to discover that we were eligible for a half hour free massage in the spa and they were lovely Breakfast was simple and included in the rate as was our room s minibar but very nice and wholly sufficient We re good walkers and did the Duomo castle and the fashion district over the course of an afternoon If we ever go back to Milan we ll definitely be staying here 
302336,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Had to change room once because the first floor room we got had basically a window 1 foot from a wall It faced the Garden which is the smoking area so with the window open it reeked Excellent staff however who went out of their way to get us a new room which was excellent complete with balcony and all Would have liked to know beforehand that the Pride parade ended just outside the hotel It was nice and all but made it difficult to enjoy being in the room with the loud base for several hours , The service of the staff was excellent They really made the stay very enjoyable and went out of their way to accommodate us The breakfast was also great with fresh orange juice straight from the countertop juicer espresso and buffalo mozzarella that gave my day a flying start Hotel was situated on a main street with plenty of good restaurants and shopping and within 20 minutes walk from the main attractions in the city center Complementary minibar was a nice touch restocked every day with Coca Cola beer orange juice and still and sparkling water Friends staying in superior room also had hard liquor such as gin and whisky 
302337,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo,No Negative, Comfortable room clean and quite view to the courtyard and good breakfast buffet Easy walk 1 5 miles to the Doumo and main tourist attractions of Milan
302338,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo,No Negative, We were met at the front door by the manager and he and his wonderful staff were available for any questions we had It was a beautiful hotel and we loved staying there while visiting Milan 
302339,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, That the property was above a metro so every time a train went through 15 min intervals your hotel room shakes They re running all day and don t stop until midnight and start again at 6am I also didn t like that the reception said there were no rooms to upgrade to the classic rooms are very small and run down I then showed her on booking com that there were Executive Rooms available so then I was able to upgrade It was like she couldn t be bothered change my booking , Great location walking distance to major tourist attractions and right above the metro Close to delicious restaurants and shops 
302340,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Although professional and never rude the front desk personnel could ve been a bit more friendly and welcoming They seemed to be a little bit aloof and I only remember being smiled at and welcomed once during my three day stay , The hotel was beautiful and centrally located The staff at breakfast was very professional and kind and the breakfast was delicious 
302341,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo,No Negative, The hotel is amazing with a fantastica localization The breakfast awesome I highly recommend the hotel And the frigobar is free of charge 
302342,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The room was super small I even didn t expect If you re a croissant fan you gonna like the breakfast If not you ll be missing fruit and vegetables surprisingly narrow choice for summer time , Good hotel helpful staff location close to Milano Centrale and subway station 25 30min walk to Duomo Rose upon check in and jelly sweet on the night table Complimentary drinks in minibar 
302343,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Couldn t fault anything on my stay, Upgraded to a beautiful refurbished room best bed I ve slept on in a hotel excellent friendly and helpful staff excellent breakfast with an extensive choice complimentary mini bar which was a first on my many travels was hard for us to leave 
302344,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo,No Negative, Hotel was well located to public transport walking distance to centre of town very nice cafe across the road and supermarket close by room was adequate size clean staff were very helpful reasonably priced would recommend
302345,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, juice and water could have been colder and coffee hotter at breakfast Is my only dislike , large bed clean throughout complimentary mini bar out door smoking area close to Metro links Excellent all round 
302346,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Sadly breakfast was poor for all 3 days cold bacon and sausage which were horrible anyway , Great location Great spa Free massage with executive room Room modern with free minibar restocked each day with executive room Book an executive room as they are more modern 6th floor and above Staff lovely
302347,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The breakfast was really poor and the airco in the room didn t work well, The hotel was located in the city centre of Milan on a very popular high street The thing I liked the most was that the city sightseeing tour bus stop was not far from the hotel I can t fault this hotel I had a good time 
302348,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, We requested for early check in but once we got in air conditioner and water pot was not prepared It took an hour to fix but except those everything was great , Nice staff big bed and nice texture of bed sheets shampoo and shower gel was also from decent brand near from the station 
302349,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The rooms are a bit small but maybe that s because Milan is a big city , The location was amazing close to the centre and close to the public park The breakfast was so delicious and fresh The staff was extremely friendly so lovely 
302350,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, In our room we had lots of noise through the pipes when the neighbour rooms were taking showers This was a little annoying , Very good breakfast excellent location right next to underground system clean room with everything you need Very comfortable bed 
302351,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, On my visit three weeks prior I had been unable to sleep the first night on the second floor due to subway noise The next day I was moved to the quieter fifth floor and I booked and was verbally confirmed the same fifth floor room for my return visit I saw the front desk clerk type in my room reservation to the hotel s system When arrived at midnight for this visit the hotel claimed to have no record of my booking of the fifth floor room and again put me on the loud second floor as they were sold out Once again I got very little sleep and the next day insisted on being compd for the first night speaking to the front desk manager and then the director of the hotel I was moved to the fifth floor on the second night and believed that I would not be charged for the first night The hotel did not deliver the room I had specifically reserved had cost me another night sleep and half day in Milan due to exhaustion and I would not have returned to the hotel if I thought they were going to put me on the second floor When I checked out there was no record of a credit and when the front desk manager called the director he denied speaking to me about not paying for the first night a lie I ended up paying for only one night because they ran my bill before reaching the director I was so upset about the way this was handled that I forgot to mention that I definitely heard rats or mice several times in the walls during the second night I would never stay in this hotel again , This was my second visit to the hotel in one month and my experience this time was miserable 
302352,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The hotel had no record of my reservation when I arrived They blamed a system conversion As the hotel is located on the 1 subway the rumbling of the train kept me awake nearly the whole first night I was able to moved to a quieter room on the fifth floor and reserved this fifth floor room specifically for my scheduled return three weeks later which the hotel failed to honor , The hotel was well located near the M1 subway with many good restaurants within walking distance 
302353,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, I was booking that nice and quite expensive hotel because of the spa possibility but if we wanted to go there the receptionist told us that the children under 18 years old are not allowed we were disappointed , Very nice bed bathroom location personelle 
302354,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, the room was rather small at least mine Breakfast was ok but it could be better Not exactly a great value for money I would add rather a fair one , The location is rather good easy to get there also walking from the main train station The hotel has a very nice lobby and restaurant excellent for informal meetings 
302355,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Nothing great hotel for a quick city trip , Breakfast was delicious lovely fresh orange juice The rooms were lovely and our bed was huge although a friend travelling with us had a small single room The spa was very relaxing 
302356,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Very little the sauna was very busy when we tried it but that was just bad luck I wouldnt fault the hotel for that , A fantastic hotel that has a very welcoming and relaxing atmosphere The complimentry mini bar was certainly a bonus and returning to our comfortable room to find a couple of choc Easter eggs was a pleasent surprise The breakfast room is not the largest but once you are up relatively early its not a problem nice food too 
302357,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo,No Negative, Staff was great location is great room was nice clean and spacious for European standards I will definitely go back Close to shops restaurants and transport
302358,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Luckily we are relatively slim otherwise the narrow shower stall would have been a problem Valet parking costs 14 Euros , Good breakfast by most standards although very little whole grain bread or rolls For that a large selection of sliced fresh fruit and dried fruit We enjoyed the giant Italian prunes Marmelades average Hotel location is convenient a few blocks from cathedral and Scala opera house Good restaurants cafes and snack bars in the neighborhood Helpful reception desk staff 
302359,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, It was a little unpleasant when we had to change the room because a fuse had tripped and no one was able to replace it Executive rooms give free access to the spa however due to the limitation to 10 12 people which is smart access should be booked in advance which we didn t know , Perfect location Beautiful inside Clean rooms Amazing spa Good breakfast 
302360,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Room was a bit noisy you can hear cars and the people from next floor walking Room was not renovated at all Bathroom was looking really not nice And whole Hotel was not the cleanest , The entrance area looks great and the ground floor is in general very beautiful Staff is really nice but a bit slow 
302361,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The room we stayed in could use a little renovation and cleaning The bathroom did not feel too clean and there were two faucets above the bathtub only one was working and also holes in the tile where the shower holder was placed before The minibar was a funny little box placed right next to the tv this did not cause any hardship but felt a bit out of place , Good location friendly staff free minibar consumption good value for money 
302362,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Breakfast was good however if you could include kiwi banana or any other fruits would be awesome Also the reception if they can be more welcoming would be awesome , the breakfast area staff are attentive well mannered many likes Breakfast was good however if you could include kiwi banana or any other fruits would be awesome Room was good size for 1 amenities in room good wifi works well mini bar in room was superb location just steps away from P Ta Venezia red line Metro 
302363,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Staff at reception was unprofessional we had to give passports twice because they forgot to give third room and looked at us very surprised why we are not walking away to our rooms Rooms are tiny double room had only one set of towels one robe and slippers Non smokers where placed into smoking floor and room noone asked if this is ok Breakfast so so very superfically , Complimentary rose during meeting
302364,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The hotel did not have availability of the room that was booked two smaller rooms were offered instead at the same price which spoilt the feeling about the hotel , Great location for the centre of Milan 
302365,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, It was unbearable that there were every sound and noisies Snoring sound from next room flashing noise of toilet from upper floor big noise of taking shower from everywhere Breakfast and free mini bar were nice I can t believe the hotel is rating high , The location is not bad
302366,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Booking com could have been more explicit in the information about the hotel that breakfast was not included in the price , It is really a genuine very nice and high quality hotel housecoat and slippers in the room refridgerator and mini bar without charge no wine though comfortable and generous bed And with very nice and professional personnel so helpful I d happily return and recommend this hotel 
302367,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, the hotel is good but the staff is totally unprepared and disorganized The night before our checkout we asked for a late checkout the agent checked and confirmed the possibility However another desk agent wasn t informed about it and instead of communicating the mistake in time mistreated us and said the hotel was full We were forced to pack and checkout in a hurry and still had to tolerate his rudeness,No Positive
302368,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, big difference in standard of 4 th floor and level 5, hotel has renovated part and not renovated You have to check where is the room Renovated part is excellent unfortunately I have stayed 4 days in not renovated part I will give 3 star only
302369,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Everything was perfect , The location is excellent with many nice shops restaurants and bars around The city center is just 20 min walking distance away There is a metro station for those who don t like to walk The venue itself is nice and clean The staff is responsive and helpful I would definitely go back 
302370,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Couldn t fault one thing, This hotel is amazing pictures do not do it justice breakfast was fantastic Staff are very helpful this hotel should be classed as a 5 will defiantly be going back to Milano and staying here I travelled with my daughter for her 13th birthday on arrival staff have her white roses bloones and chocolates 
302371,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, If you get a room facing the main street like 210 the noise from the road might be disturbing although it didn t disturb me There is double glazing but you still hear quite a bit of noise My friend tried the SPA and gave it a 7 out of 10 Avoid peek hours as you might not be able to go in SPA gets crowded , Breakfast was ok Freshly squeezed orange juice and good capuccino Very limited choice of fruit and bread Location is very good with the metro Porta di Venezia just a few meters away Very practical if you need to catch the tube to the Cadorna station or the Duomo for instance But the Duomo is only a 20 min walk away The good location of the hotel allowed us to go everywhere on foot Right opposite the hotel there is a Vinoteca worth going to Very nice food and good wine We went to Mamma Rosa about 10 min walk and loved it Great service and great food 80 euros for 2 people including 2 main dishes oysters sparkling wine on arrival great bread slection water and coffee Many places to eat around the hotel and nice shops too I will stay here again Good value for money 
302372,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Breakfast ended at 10 10 30am There wasn t a terrace lounge area which is a real bummer because everyone in Europe enjoys lounging outdoors , Breakfast was good but wish it could end at 11 30 for those who wish or tend to sleep in 
302373,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, When cleaning other rooms in the morning it was very noisy, The sauna and steam room and pool was lovely Towels should be clearly available in the changing rooms though
302374,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo,No Negative, Staff was friendly and helpful The room was very comfortable Location is excellent it is on a walking distance to good restaurants and shopping places There is a train station next to the hotel entrance
302375,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Extremely disappointing stay my single room was minuscule 90x200 bed and provided a shower room instead of the bathroom advertised on Booking com The shower room was so small you could not sit on the toilet because of the shower directly in front the spa attendant did not speak English and couldn t answer my questions I could not go to the spa NO SOUNDPROOFING AT ALL My neighbor took a bath at 1am and it felt like the bathtub was filling in my room needless to say I could not sleep The normal rate of the room was 120 night for an 8sqm room but I felt like a 2nd class guest I got a last minute discount but had I known I would have gone to an Ibis hotel and I would ve spent a better night Sadly won t be coming there again , Ok breakfast 
302376,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The hotel is ok for 1 night but I was on room 344 and the room was not worth the money The shower was so small I couldn t wash myself witouth touching the dirty walls there was damage all over the room It looked also pretty outdated For 200 eiros the night I expect a lot more , The location was great near a park and the spa was nice as well We only missed a jacuzzi 
302377,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The very heavy perfumed bodylotion soap and shampoo in the bathroom It was much more delicate in the spa though and more discrete Was surprised so many guests in the spa had their smartphones in the spa photographing and making selfies over and over again that was odd and nothing I expected to see in a delicate spa had nothing to do with the spa facilities which was very nice though A bit disappointed about the hamam looked forward to try it but there wasn t any staff there maybe because of the time we visit the spa Friday evening 18 30 , The hotel staff during the day was super nice and friendly Don t know the name of the nice man in the reception but he was super competent super polite warm and welcoming recommended a nice local coffee shop an easy way to Malpensa Airport without the stress from the Central Station and overall he was good to catch our interests on our very short stay in Milano without recommending too turistic places He really made our stay pleasant Breakfast was good and staff was great and super service minded too The lady with the classes was so nice discrete and welcoming too Everything in the minibar was free Wifi was free 24 hours stabile and easy to connection to Rooms were made twice a day which was surprising but nice too Felt so spoiled The spa was very nice would wish it opened at 8 though and closed at 22 though so we could had started the day in the spa before the breakfast or finished the day in the spa after some hours with aperitivo Loved our romantic stay our view overlooking the shopping street Would stay here again for sure 
302378,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, I think that the breakfast could have been included in the price, All the comforts a rose as welcome very cozy and quiet the bathroom had everything I needed more than I needed actually The staff is super friendly and everyone speaks English fluently 
302379,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, SPA is too small and poor too many people want to use it with not enough space and facilities personnel try to make queuing but they missed our registration expected more from the restaurant but was disappointed by the quality of dishes e g shrimps should be without sand which is crackling on the teeth , early check in was welcomed with no problems unexpected flower for my wife and sweet gift were very pleasant good and rich breakfasts fine location
302380,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo,No Negative, High level service was provided by very friendly staff the manager of the hotel really knows how to create a good mood you ll find small surprises everywhere from beginning till the end Bravo 
302381,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Breakfast facility is very neat and efficient however could have been a little more spacious , Location was perfect for access to the city Allowed us to walk to most locations and return was easy through underground Many restaurants close by and Hotel has its own too Bedrooms Bathrooms all very neat and efficient for a quick stay Impressed Staff extremely friendly and helpful at all times Value for money and stay most enjoyed 
302382,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, breakfast needs more vegetarian vegan options that aren t just bread and cereals pancakes tofu scrambled eggs soy yogurt etc , the spa the room with a balcony view was great 
302383,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The single rooms have view only to the inside courtyard I specifically mentioned I wanted a nice view when I booked and then got a v unpleasant surprise The relevant information should be added in the single rooms description ,No Positive
302384,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Would of liked more tea sugar milk in room as only enough for one cup , All was good clean comfortable got a single room quite cheap Also had a kettle in room with tea or coffee 
302385,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The safe didn t work due to the low battery There was no view from my room The noise resonate when something hit the floor like footsteps or moving chairs in other rooms , The ambience was sophisticated Receptionists speak good English The room was warm enough for the winter It takes 20 30 minutes to walk to the Duomo and city centre but the Metro station was right there so it was no problem 
302386,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, There were some difficulties with login to wifi only with my telephone With my laptop it went fine , Location was great staff very friendly and helpfull Same people during breakfast office hours and they recognized you including the things you asked before Room was very pleasant 
302387,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo,No Negative, I stayed in this hotel two years ago and I just loved it Everytime I flew to Milan this was on my top list but most of the time fully booked This time I was lucky to find a room Staff are very friendly and helpful What I like the most is their fresh breakfast and late check out at 12 pm Location is just great for shopping I will always come back

302389,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The rooms are reasonable but need some reform especially in the bathrooms which are small and old , We stayed only for one night The public areas of the hotel are very good and well cared The staff is very friendly and helpful and the breakfast quite good The location is good with the metro station right next door and a neighbourhood with lots of shops and good restaurants For 89 it was well priced 
302390,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, I loved absolutely everything about this hotel , The location is amazing on a shopping street and 15 minutes walking to Duomo I cannot describe how helpful kind and polite the staff was The room was great just like the breakfast Definitelly recommend this hotel and will stay there again If I am back in Milano

302418,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, No wardrobe just a hanging rail with not many hangers however when I asked for extra hangers they were brought within minutes, Very friendly staff booked a small double it was spotlessly clean and perfectly adequate for a short break Would recommend the restaurant abuzzo not far from the hotel for great food and great atmosphere 
302419,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, A hotel of this category and price should have a broader internet band Walls are too thin I could hear my neighbors talking, Elegant hotel near transportation historic center and shopping Great breakfast not only good selection but the service is super

302433,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The advertisement of shuttle service is essentially false advertising costing nearly 200 euros when getting the bus was 10 The staff tried to tell us we had to get taxi to bus station and would be unable to use uber think they get a cut of the business as triple the price Spa facilities were a bit naff but we hadn t gone for this so wasn t an issue , Extremely clean and in a good location Breakfast was even pretty good Comfortable enough bed and air con working fine Mini fridge stocked with drinks etc ample toiletries supplied Staff friendly and helpful

302439,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The restaurant was not open for lunch on Sunday or Monday and only had cold dishes for dinner on Sunday Usually this would not have impacted my view of a hotel as we dine out but we had credit to spend , Very good location walking distance to the centre and beside a metro stop Staff were very accommodating when we had to change our reservation for 2 to 1 night 
302440,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The room was very small but cosy The sauna and turkish bath room weren t available on our second day due to some failure The spa needs to be better taken care of and cleaner There are some signs of degradation , The hotel has a great location in front of an underground station which is four stations away from the city centre There are lots of restaurants and shops near it You can also walk to the train station but it s quite far so it s better to take the underground The staff is very friendly and they even give you a flower when you check in and fresh water at check out Breakfast was spectacular diverse and tasty

302444,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, There was some building work going on which meant access to the spa was through the main hotel reception little awkward in dressing gowns The spa also had one of the rooms out of access steam baths I think which was slightly disappointing , The hotel was smart clean and tidy All the facilities and accessories you could need were readily available 
302445,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, nothing , Everything was really great Especially good customer service they presented my wife with a rose when we arrived it was our anniversary and the reception staff spend ages explaining the top sites in Milan it was our first visit and generally they couldn t do enough Lovely clean well decorated hotel Spa was open even though they warned us at booking that it might be closed for renovation Breakfast was amazing so much of everything For what we paid an absolute bargain Can t recommend this hotel highly enough

302449,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The spa could have been better all the water related treatments like the showers and stuff were cold so the sauna and steam room were the only ones worth using Also for the price I payed a bigger room would have been nice I ve payed much less money for much bigger rooms in other places , Room was nice comfy and clean staff were friendly and accommodating Got given a rose when I arrived which was a cute extra detail Also the breakfast was nice I ate loads

302452,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, the single bedroom wasn t basic it was a cell , Stefano the night manager was very nice and very helpful We also liked the goodie bag given to us on check out with cold water and cold towels 
302453,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, the hotel was being renovated so this caused a little disruption on entering workmen milling around the Spa area meant it was uncomfortable entering with a robe on I took the opportunity to have a pedicure in the Spa and while the staff were very pleasant the quality of the pedicure was substandard given the cost of 60 Euro so terrible value for money, great location helpful staff good restaurant
302454,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, noise coming from construction works it wakes me up early morning also there was bad smell in the towels and bathrobe, very great location nice staff and helpful reception taxi are very close and metro also there were a lot of restaurant and coffee shops around the hotel
302455,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Tiny bathroom and the shower handle was broken but functional, I ve stayed here before and both times the staff have been lovely Great location and a great room also with tea making facilities which you don t often get in Italy 
302456,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Grout in the shower needed attention and the alarm cord was also very grotty which was surprising as attention to detail in other areas was impressive , The lounge and bar area was very welcoming quiet and comfortable Pre dinner drinks included generous bar snacks which we re appreciated There was a range of newspapers available in different languages Staff were helpful with tourist advice The hotel is very close to underground train options and there are numerous shops and restaurants in easy walking distance 
302457,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo,No Negative, Workers in hotel are very friendly try to help with everything Good breakfast good locations subway is really near A lot of shops and restaurants around The price is really good 
302458,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo,No Negative, It was an excellent stay and I have nothing bad to say about this hotel It has a great location and proximity to Porta Venezia metro station is a huge plus My room was very comfortable bathroom was in a good standard The renovation work hasn t disturbed me much Breakfast is good there is a choice for everyone s taste I believe Wifi is strong and worked perfectly on all of my devices But the best thing about this hotel is the staff Everyone was incredibly friendly and welcoming Very nice staff at the reception they were ready to help before I even looked at them They had a great knowledge of the city and its attractions Always greeted me back with a smile and a nice word Also the staff supervising the breakfast was very professional the lady who was there everyday made sure all worked perfectly Every staff member whom I have encountered from the reception to the maids was smiled polite and friendly I think this is how the good places are becoming the great places 
302459,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, View from room , Lovely room Small but adequate for our needs Work on the hotel did not effect our stay though view from room onto the work was poor However no noise at all so didn t mind 
302460,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Restaurant is very small without windows Felt like a cellar Breakfast choice is very limited Hotel is under construction now Noisy It was announced on Booking site Unfortunately I did not read it because it was not written on GENERAL INFORMATION , The location is wonderfull very central Parc is very close by Excellent wifi Very friendly professionel staff 
302461,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, I was very disappointed that the turkish bath was not working Temporary hitch though The fact this facility exists is to my mind a real plus for this hotel , Room was larger than I expected I booked a single room Staff were lovely and very helpful Well stocked bathroom with a great shower Terrific selection at breakfast Very comfortable bed Fantastic spa relaxation facilities including turkish bath sauna low light spa pool and relaxation area with snacks herbal teas and fruit I really liked the location of the hotel equidistant between the station and the duomo so away from crazy tourist crush but close enough to walk Metro station just next to hotel so very convenient 
302462,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Disappointing view from bedroom just lots and lots of scaffolding Obviously future guests will benefit though as the hotel is undergoing some work , The breakfast choice was amazing definitely something for everyone You could even have chocolate brownie which was SO good just like Donna Hay s 
302463,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, construction restoration was going on during our stay the room had a poor view, the bed was very comfy our reservation included use of the hotel spa 2 hours More than enough time to try out the spa emotional shower relaxation room and saunas 
302464,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Breakfast options could be better ie nicer bread more healthy options Saturday was the gay parade so very loud music during evening, Wellness room Location close to metro nice and clean and tidy
302465,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Aircon did not work properly and it was very hot during our stay resulting in awful sleep during our stay Room so very small and outdated for this type of hotel Bed was very small and extremely uncomfortable and far too old Tv had a very bad picture Bar fridge was not cold and could not even open the door fully as it was blocked by the bed Not good value for money , Cleaning service was excellent Staff were friendly efficient and helpful Location of the hotel is excellent Outside of hotel and common areas are great but even in common areas aircon seemed to have a problem 
302466,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, We were extremely disappointed to find out ONLY after our booking had been completed that the hotel is undergoing refurbishment This is the reason for the relatively low score ,No Positive
302467,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The decor was a little dated and there wasn t a great range of complimentary teas in the room The spa was nice but you couldn t really describe the pool as a swimming pool as it was too small to take more than two strokes The breakfast was dissapointing A lot of the food was prepackaged and there wasn t a great selection , Good location The bed was really comfortable 
302468,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The hotel is under reconstruction and there were some noise from this from early in the morning The standard double room is very small we had problems fitting us as a couple and our two suitcases in the room Standard of the room is ok but not good and I guess that s why they need to refurbish , The hotel has a great location in the middle of a great shopping street and very close to the subway station There was also a small park close to the hotel where we could have a short run for some exercise Breakfast was great an the staff are very nice and helpfull 
302469,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo,No Negative, Efficient and friendly service area to unwind after a long day and a warm welcome Easy to reach restaurants metro bus tram and great for shopping 
302470,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, What I didn t like was the hotel was currently being renovated and being woken at 8am on the Saturday and the Monday of our stay wasn t to plan If I had known this I wouldn t have stayed Also opened a bottle of beer from mini bar to find it wasn t beer but something else not sure what it was but it wasn t pleasant , All about the location which is very good Breakfast very good lots of options fruit cereal and plenty of meat too 
302471,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The renovations in back yard do not seem to be in a hurry A bit pity as it could really be a comfortable add on to kind of small single room just opening a window to nicer space without the scaffolding ,No Positive
302472,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The hotel is going through renovation so on weekdays works started around 8am We were lucky cos stayed there over the weekend Also another small issue we had Middle of the night water started to flow out of the air con system I called them up and checked it straight away Next day was fixed so we didnt have to change our room , The hotel was very nice Worth the money definitely Cleaned every day and changed our bedsheets and towels everyday Breakfast was amazing 
302473,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Breakfast was not included at this hotel and would have cost 12 Euros per person A little far from the train station We had to take the metro to get there, There is construction work going on at this hotel at the present time The building is encased in scaffolding The inside is clean and modern Our room was spacious comfortable and air conditioned The staff was friendly and helpful They even gave my wife a rose when we checked in 
302474,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, i reserved with breakfast and i surprised when i finished the reservation no breakfast included and you must pay for room with good view, Good location
302475,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Restaurant staff was not very nice We were an inconvenience to them A bit pricey but still a nice stay , Nice oversized bed very comfortable room Great location for walking 
302476,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, There is a construction outside Sometimes noisy in the day time The shower cannot be properly closed It keeps running making a waste of water and noise Wifi is slow but at least it is stable Enough for surfing the internet , The breakfast is awesome and the employees are helpful The room and especially bathroom are very clean 
302477,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, As I said it was all almost perfect We were a bit surprised though finding that the Superior room was located in the first floor facing the trafficated Avenue that means noise all day We thought that you could 1 provide thicker windows better noise isolation from the outside 2 renovate the bathroom style is old like if it was beautiful 30 years ago but now is a bit outdated Beside these two we wanted to thank you for the great service , We booked the Superior with a spa package included and we loved it we rate 10 every aspect but the value of money These are the pros and cons great location easy metro access and just a nice walk distance both from the train station and the city centre staff very friendly and professional both in the hotel and in the spa Very nice spa the package with 30 minutes massage was spotless and very well done we loved it Great breakfast minibar wifi luggage storage breakfast all included 
302478,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Unfortunately there was building improvement work taking place during our stay the front entrance was hidden by safety boarding and the work taking place outside our bedroom window meant we had to keep curtains closed and windows shut there was a letter of apology from hotel in room and we were aware of work as it was notified on booking com before we travelled Work carried out from 8 00am 5 00pm , Good location in a long street of shops only a 20 30 minute stroll into Piazza Duomo 15 minutes by taxi to Da Vinci s Last Supper convenient to the Centrale and Porta Garibaldi Railway Staions plenty of eating options nearby if you do not want to use hotel restaurant Good sized room with large double bed teas making facility good sized bathroom security safe Breakfast was typical continental with a bacon sausage and scrambled egg option Staff on reception were very efficient and helpful breakfast staff were very attemtive 
302479,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The room was a little smaller than expected and very small bathroom Although all clean and great shower , The staff were so friendly throughout our stay So welcoming when we arrived late in the night The spa facilities being free was amazing Lovely dip pool and sauna and steam room Enjoyed our stay very much 
302480,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo,No Negative, Room could have been a little bigger Bacon with as very fatty and over cooked the scrambled eggs were very dry Can t speak highly enough of the staff in the restaurant nothing was too much trouble for them 
302481,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The current renovation is pretty noticeable small and outdated bathrooms , The breakfast the location city center and touristic sites very easy to access 
302482,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, There were some restauration going on in the yard of the hotel The window looked over scaffolding and workers , The hotel location is just perfect and 5 m from the p ta Venezia metro station A very convenient location in the heart of Milan and 2 stops away from duomo The gesture of leaving a gummy candy on the night stand everyday is very kind The breakfast is just right light and tasty Loved the morning cappucio 
302483,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Spa was very disappointing Too dark in the steam room the spa was just an oversized bath Nowhere to hang towel etc Shower not practical could not adjust height ,No Positive
302484,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Parking around the hotel is difficult and cost insane money Leaving car for two nights few blocks away from the hotel cost me 95 Euro Do not go to Milan with a car , The hotel itself is quite good clean quiet comfortable located in a good place near subway station May be just a bit overpriced 
302485,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The sound proofing between rooms could be better , It was my partner s birthday and they offered us a complimentary drink at the bar which was really nice 
302486,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Only one negative work being done to the exterior at the moment so scaffolding is erected to the rear of the building But this didn t disrupt our stay , Excellent location underground shops restaurants all a stones throw away High class establishment for reasonable money 
302487,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The room was too tight the bathroom was too small and the hair dryer would stop working after a couple of minutes Add to that that there was construction in the building and just outside our window which interfered with privacy , Staff were very pleasant and helpful which made our first time in Milan a good experience The breakfast was very good and the location is within walking distance to the shopping districts 
302488,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The interior is a bit used in certain places wallpaper slightly teared away shower fixed , Breakfast was excellent Very helpful staff Complained about the water pressure and it was solved immediately Comfortable hotel located directly at Corso Buenos Aires 
302489,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The hotel is not worht 4 stars The room was really really small The breakfast area did not have enough tables we had to wait outside for someone else to leave before we could sit down to have breakfast Also the isolation of sound is very poor we could almost follow the conversation in the room next to us , The room was very clean and the staff was friendly The wellness is nice
302490,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The bad news I read the previous reviews and was concerned about the metro noise so asked for a quite room the staff couldn t have been more helpful and polite I thought the room would be perfect back of the hotel away from the main street which is busy upper floor level 3 All good so far 230 am the guests in the adjoining room arrive back at the room and shower turn on the TV to a high audible level and start doing their stuff They might as well have been in my room as there is practically no sound insulation between the rooms I took a sleeping pill It made any rumble for the metro pale into insignificance To the hotel management you need to look at your sound insulation problem or find another architect contractor too many reviews complaining about noise will eventually sink your rating a pity as it ticks all the other boxes , My usual hotel was booked out so this was the option I found Good location right above Porta Venezia Metro station which is an easy connection to the parking at Cascina Gobba Don t bother driving into town it will just stress you finding a park The room I was given was refurbished and in good contemporary taste small but it was an overnight stay and perfectly comfortable and well designed equipped For those who need it there are tea and coffee making facilities I was well aware that you get what you pay for and it was a very good deal for the night so I m starting from low expectations 
302491,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The hotel wifi just did not work The solution is to buy a local SIM from Orange store which is nearby less than 500 meters away and use that to create a hotspot It costs Euro 30 but shop closes at 7 00 and you need to show them your original passport , The hotel was super clean and while we were worried about the comments that there was construction noise frankly we did not witness any The location is excellent with metro stop 50 meters away from the hotel door The staff is very professional and courteous Breakfast is very good and we enjoyed it everyday We have travelled to a number of locations in the last 5 years and stayed at numerous hotels both for work and leisure but this has been one of our finest experiences 
302492,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Other hotels serve better scrambled eggs and cakes Loose appliances in the bathroom It s nice when the staff can offer some personal engagement in addition to official smile and greeting , Nice and cozy really good Redecoration works do not disturb much however to protect your privacy windows should be covered at all times 10m away from P ta Venezia metro station at shopping street Corso Buenos Aires found a nonexpensive decent restaurant 2 minutes away Clean and quiet enough Ironing board provided in the room on request Umbrellas available for self service during the rain Good continental breakfest good selection of food including fresh juice 
302493,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, On the lover levels of the hotel the metro noise is very disturbing I can t sleep , The spa and the breakfast is very good The location is also very convenient metro station is front of the hotel Mian Centrale FS is only 4 stop by tram no 5 
302494,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The hotel situated under the metro so from early morning there is a noise of trains arriving to the metro station , The hotel situated in a main shopping district Near metro few stops to the center and by walk 10 15min to Duomo

302496,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The walls were too thin you could hear everything from the corridor and the neighboring rooms , Excellent location short walk to the shops restaurants and old town Very helpful staff 
302497,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, At breakfast no yoghurt and no fresh slices bread Even the uppgraded room and bathroom acceptable but still small, Friendlyness off staff Location Free use of hotel umbrellas Free uppgrade to bigger room
302498,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, If you prefer a quite room better ask without view as windows might overlook at busy street was a bit noisy at night But the hotel provided earplugs , Great location just minute from metro and few stops from Duomo located on busy shopping street Very friendly and helpful staff Hotel s interior looks lovely and quite romantic Was pleasantly surprised with tea facilities in room as I arrived late it was just exactly what I needed Upon arrival received a rose from a receptionist mood went up immediately spa is a great advantage check in advance opening hours Breakfast is simple but all you need is there and waiters are very fast helping to refill coffee and arrange tables Recommend this place for 1 2 nigh stays As hotel going through renovation might be a bit noisy during the day 
302499,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Dust in the area of coffee machine from the room No shower gel in the room Although the room was for two persons in the bathroom there were toilet things only for one person A lot of noise because of some construction works of which I was not aware In one word it was not a good experience and definitely it was not worth the money paid ,No Positive
302500,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, My room was dark I would like to stay in during the day for that reason but good to sleep in There were works taking place in the hotel which detracted from the experience somewhat , A perfectly comfy hotel in a good location I liked it Good bed and bathroom 
302501,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, There are works in the building at the moment , Location is good and in front of subway Breakfast is accurate Staff is professional and attentive especially the breakfast staff Spa is a good plus 
302502,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Noise from the building works Noise from the Metro Indifference from the staff particularly on the front desk Not that helpful Considering this was a First Clas Hotel I had a high expectation , Sad to say not too much apart from the dinner in the restaurant on the first night which was fine

302505,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, my room had to be changed althought was upgraded due to a smell of drains in the room was sorted hotel was under construction works but their was no noise nor dirt , staff where more than excellent service was super room was lovely
302506,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, room felt claustrophobic when the radiator heater left on during the night Had no ventilation so we opened the window every time it got too stuffy during middle of winter with rain The room seemed to have an AC unit but didn t turn on , everything else was fine 
302507,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, If you arrive after 9 30am for breakfast you ll have to wait because the restaurant don t accomodate many guests , The room is very cosy and the location is excelent near a metro station and good restaurants 
302508,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Be aware the hotel is above the metro so some rumbling can be felt and heard Ask for a higher floor We were on the 1st floor and had noise from the metro and people on the street, Very friendly and helpful staff Massages in the spa were very good Didn t eat in the restaurant but mamma rosa and 13th giugno are nearby and excellent especially for seafood
302509,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Renovations were reported as per Booking Com site from Nov 28 Dec 28 However renovation had already started even on Nov 19 and the noise was significant and disturbing There was a letter in the room upon arrival regarding this but correct information should have been given beforehand , Excellent location for shopping especially and friendly service 
302510,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Food in the restaurant over priced and lacking in taste , Very central next to Metro Try to get a room overlooking the street the back rooms are rather lacking 
302511,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, My room was really small really noisy I could hear the metro passing by all night long and it smelled really bad specially the bathroom, Staff was super nice 
302512,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Don t pay attention to minor things like some very little noise from the outside as the hotel is located near a busy city intersection and a metro stop metro line going underneath But come on if you want peace and quiet go to the countryside not to the middle of city life and stop complaining that you didn t get a soundproof room , Fabulous breakfast buffet and breakfast team above efficient Freshly squeezed orange juice there is a machine squeezing oranges as you watch wide selection of everything spotless dining hall I just wanted to stay there and keep on eating and drinking Front desk very helpful very kind Location very conveniant literally next to Piazza Venezia metro stop and within a walking distance to the Cathedral Great small single rooms in accordance with the historic building and in line with what a traveller might expect coming into a historic area All smells and sounds you would expect from a big busy city around but nothing to complain about very comfortable very cosy and the staff is just great Will definitely want to keep coming back 
302513,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The room is to small and the air conditioner is turned of and some time the temperature gos high little bit and you need do air condition the toilet is tiny difficult to do event to turn, The location of the hotel is perfect metro station is just 2 minutes away and there is alot of restaurants close to it and so many shops and duomo square is just 10 min away

302516,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Poor breakfast Noise from the metro It was a vibration every few minutes when a metro was stopping as it is right above the metro station but that did not bother me that much and I was able to sleep but for somebody else that might be a problem , The location is very close to the Milan Dome square on a main road walking distance from the center and to the Milan Central Railway station You don t need any taxi metro or bus Very friendly staff

302521,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, I thought this room was extremely expensive for what it was and did not represent good value for money but it might be that Milan is an expensive city , The staff were very good welcoming and quietly efficient The breakfast was very good an extensive choice in an extremely pleasant setting 
302522,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, out dated small room with small bathroom max worth three stars narrow corridors, kind and helpful staff lobby good restaurant nice wellness free wifi
302523,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The room I had was extremely small and in regards for the price it s not coherent The metro kept passing under shaking my bed from early morning The rooms aren t very good isolated so besides from the metro passing I also heard every activity from neighbor guests But possibly the larger rooms are more comfortable , Polite staff from welcoming to departure Good location close to city center and central station 
302524,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The only thing to improve is a noise from a water bomb or something that was annoying at times at night , The location is great there is one metro station meters away to get to Duomo area The staff is very kind and the spa was also very good 
302525,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo,No Negative, Friendliness of the staff especially in dining room was excellent Location for Metro couldn t have been better with it being right outside the front door 
302526,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, An Italian couple were literally doing it in the Spa and there were not staff around to tell them off Even a fake camera might have put them off , Great central location Nice rooms that were very clean 
302527,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Nothing to report at all , Simply amazing staff and hotel Located just 3 short train stops from Il Duomo and downtown area Well worth it Spa included in price 
302528,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo,No Negative, Loved the facilities at this hotel turkish baths sauna steam room etc all included Great to relax after a hectic day sightseeing Staff here are also very helpful and really good food in the restaurant here 
302529,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The only thing was the shower didn t drain very well and sometimes there was a bit of a smell from it should have reported to the hotel but didn t get chance It was still usable however just would have preferred it to drain a little quicker , The location and breakfast Lots of choice at breakfast hotel was in walking distance from all sights wifi and view from hotel from room was great too 
302530,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Very small bathroom, The spa was very nice and the breakfast was fantastic The hotel was situated right next to the metro but walking distance from city centre 
302531,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The underground was very noisy unfortunately my room must have been above the metro This stopped later in the night , Very friendly and helpful staff safe secure clean boutique style hotel with an excellent healthy buffet breakfast 
302532,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Upstairs hallways were tired and rooms a little old style some peeling wallpaper but overall still quite clean and comfortable , Spa and breakfast were great
302533,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, The bed in the economy double room was a bit small less than 2m in length the bathroom very cramped but then again that s why they call it economy, Very good location in the very city center Spa access for 2 hours every day Very nice reception and lobby bar area
302534,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, While clean my room smelt strongly of old smoke and the hairdryer in the bathroom got so hot it melted when I mentioned these to the staff they just appeared disinterested and in the end the ladies in the attached spa let me use their facilities The wifi barely worked most of the time , The breakfast had a lot of choice and the location was great
302535,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo,No Negative, I enjoyed an absolutely fabulous stay here Every single staff member that I encountered be it at the front desk the breakfast area or the night doorman was super friendly Small things such as the rose that you receive at check in and which bloomed more beautifullly every day of my week long stay and not being able to pass the reception desk without being acknowledged and greeted make you feel truly appreciated as a guest I stayed in a small double room but I didn t feel trapped in a back closet which the added small made me fear On the contrary the room was very comfortable with sufficient space a good bed and a stylish bathroom I ll definitely come back to this hotel if I ever visit Milan again 
302536,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Breakfast was not the best limited of choice because How the hotel presents it self throught it would be amazing but was not The wi fi not the best But these are not big things, The hotel is a nice hotel was given rose on arrival The location is close to the airport but have to catch metro do get around which isn t far from the hotel 
302537,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, Rumble of underground trains can be heard in 1st floor room ear plugs supplied Used to this in London hotels but may be off putting for some , Staff very accommodating
302538,Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo, A bit long walk to the main sightseeing points Not many restautants nearby At the check in nobody told that children are not welcome in the sauna and pool area which was disappointing , Good location if you come to the City for shopping Complimentary usage of Quiet Spa with different saunas and a small pool 15 minute walk to Duomo Got free upgrade to a bigger room Very polite reception staff especially a bit older man working in the evening and during the night between 10 11 Aug
