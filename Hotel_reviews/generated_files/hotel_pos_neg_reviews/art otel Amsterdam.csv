418909,art otel Amsterdam, Its pricey but I think you get what you pay for , Great hotel with perfect location for exploring Amsterdam Large public parking over the road was handy as we drove there and back Facilities in the hotel are very nice and the Spa is a welcome place to relax Rooms are modern and very nice with great room service and well stocked mini bar Breakfast was amazing and very much welcome after a long night 
418910,art otel Amsterdam, Although all was cleaned they must pay attention to the lamps in the room They weren t clean , It was my daughter B day and they were very kind to put a baloon in the room with a card She was so happy This small big attentions have to be recognized THANK YOU The staff the location the facilities Overall 5 
418911,art otel Amsterdam, The dark room which had no closet the self proclaimed art the inaccessibility to parts of the hotel for hotel guests including the gallery due to private showings , I liked the night time staff and the bar The lady at the reception at night helped us a lot and was very kind Another front desk guy helped us when an order was a no show and gave us two free drinks for the bar that was nice The barmen was a pro too 
418912,art otel Amsterdam, Nothing, everything more than perfect i never see all staff in any other hotel in Holland like this hotel i miss the 2 person front of the door hotel this 2 person different color but same Blood this 2 person very friendly with all staff and all gust hotel many great to HR Manager for choosing all this staff in art otel with same cute and same blood i rely enjoyed my stay in art otel 
418913,art otel Amsterdam, Grit in the spinach for breakfast unacceptable It was also the weekend of my girlfriends 40th birthday and i wanted to buy some wine to take up to the room to drink when we got to it the lady reassured us that there was a little something already in the room for us When we arrived we found that there were 2 vouchers for cocktails on the bed but it wasnt what I had asked for So we had to either use the mini bar which didnt have a decent sized bottle of wine in or go back downstairs which we didnt want to do after we d just arrived The restaurant staff were terrible except the manager with the jacket and blonde hair who actually seemed like he was working quite hard there were 2 3 guys who were clearly not interested in serving customers but were more concerned about looking busy as they were obviously under observation by their manager They had work facial expressions feigning concern but they were very unattentive even after several deliberate attempts to get some kind of service after waiting for too long The evening time came and i thought id try the restaurant noone to greet me when i arrived and so i sat at a vacant table and waited for service noone came I was then told after id stopped a member of staff that I hadnt been served because noone knew that iwas there Get your act together please I paid almost 800 euros for 2 nights i feel like ive been completely ripped off and unless I receive a sincere apology and some degree of compensation for my experience there I will never ever go there again , Location Swimming pool smoking lounge decor 
418914,art otel Amsterdam, nothing, Annabell the assist manager was absolutely brilliant there was a wee problem with our room and she flew into action Could not have been nicer or more professional 
418915,art otel Amsterdam, Nothing Perfect stay, One of the absolute nicest hotels I have ever stayed in From the staff to the style and the luxurious and very sexy rooms the hotel exceeding my expectations in every category I was a apprehensive of the location so close to Central Station but that also turned out to be a great feature The hotel feels brand new it s perfectly maintained and has a very playful spirit The best part is the actual room Super luxe details lighting and high ceilings It did not feel like a hotel more likes staying in a luxury apartment Breakfast also terrific Gym is large for a hotel gym too and there is an indoor pool A great stay for 4 nights 
418916,art otel Amsterdam, The mood light system could be more clear to operate and the room could be more sound proof Closing of other people s hotelroom doors are clearly heard No toilet brush in the toilet Although the hotel serves soy milk at breakfast the warm food breakfast items made to order could not be served with soy milk A soy milk porridge would have been nice , The breakfast the warm food eggs bacon coffee etc are made to order on your request by the chefs and are superb The beds in the hotel were great 
418917,art otel Amsterdam,No Negative, Coolest hotel ever Right across plaza from train station in center of city makes it super convenient for trams Double windows so you can make it quiet They serve you a delicious breakfast from a menu e g eggs benedict which is included 
418918,art otel Amsterdam, The fact that we couldn t stay longer I personnally didn t like the hussle and bussle of the the Main Street leading to Dam Square because of heavy footfall However visiting Jordaan and De Pijp districts were quieter quaint areas to visit , We loved the look of the hotel very stylish and artistic Rooms were absolutely stunning finished to high standard and were spacious Train station was just across the road close proximity to attractions However if you wanted to go to the quieter districts which we did such as Jordaan and De Pijp these were only a 20 minute walk away Here you could sit out at a cafe and watch the world pass you by 
418919,art otel Amsterdam, Uncomfortable beds towels had black stain in the folds area The main disadvantage that they creat a financial problem to me as they did charge me the full price twice on my credit card in advance and in check out Also the block money twice from my account I did not get my money back until next week , Helpful staff but that was for other staff mistakes 
418920,art otel Amsterdam,No Negative, We travel a lot and this was BY FAR the BEST HOTEL we ve ever stayed in we loved the modern fusion and art The Staff was the most friendly and attentive that we ve ever encounter 
418921,art otel Amsterdam, The cleaner did not clean the toliet and bathroom at all They need to be focus and supervise or else the reputation of the hotel will be in stake due to cleanliess Making the bed it not good enough a check is required too ,No Positive
418922,art otel Amsterdam, Check in and check out was very time consuming Even though there was only 3 people in front of me it took about 20 minutes to get the card to the hotel room , Good breakfast large and comfortable bed but the best thing was the walk in shower 
418923,art otel Amsterdam, Can t think of anything , Friendly but efficient staff who greeted you and remembered names Comfy bed and good bathroom Very good range of breakfast foods Nice lobby seating area and interesting artworks 
418924,art otel Amsterdam,No Negative, Great location close to the central station and few minutes walk to everything restaurants De Dam shopping The restaurant in house 5 33 is absolutely superb with an extensive Italian theme menu Super friendly and fun staff nothing seems too much to ask Breakfast was a treat and a break from the usual buffet style Warm food eggs bacon coffee etc made to order with a minimal waiting period Great spa hotel amenities
418925,art otel Amsterdam, Nothing We had a great stay , The hotel was amazing Very modern with a decent sized room great bathroom and comfortable bed Staff and service were great and you can t find a better position for touring 
418926,art otel Amsterdam, Swimming pool was pretty cold Maybe nice after a work out but for a relax swim in the morning its a bit small and cold, Nice breakfast room and photo exhibition
418927,art otel Amsterdam, Some rooms have no view or a view of a close wall but if you have a romantic stay who cares The room and atmosphere is even better with blinded windows , We had a two night stay in Art otel This is a true pearl of Amsterdam which made our stay a gateway with my wife from two kids very special The whole spirit of the hotel is romantic and far from being average The service food rooms LOCATION are perfect Next time we re in Amsterdam art otel is our choice 
418928,art otel Amsterdam, The surroundings have mostly fast food stuff Nothing really decent The restaurant at the hotel is fine But one isn t going to eat there three meals a day , General efficiency friendly staff
418929,art otel Amsterdam, My breakfast order was forgotten even though they was just two more tables occupied room service did not take in account that I had put up do not disturb sign and knocked on my door 3 times waking me up when I complained I just got a that should not happen room service did not make up my room for the night witch the guests pay for I also got the wrong bag from the hotel when I got back to collect it after waiting on my flight home I had asked and got a later check out but on the check out day I could not get into my room since they closed my card at 12 I would recommend to use this hotel when they have lots of guests since the service gets better if it s busy My first days there was not so many guests there and the staff seemed to take it as a day off or something , Nice rooms 
418930,art otel Amsterdam, Proximity to Centraal station meant it was very busy immediately outside the hotel therefore could be noisy As such We tried to cancel the second night but we were not allowed to although I d booked a cancellable option so wasn t happy about that As first time visitors to Amsterdam No welcome pack or maps given to us which would have been helpful Advice on the Navigation of the hotel would have been helpful too We Found out on the last day that they had a smoking room inside the premises and we had not been told My sister as a smoker had been outside in the rain for two nights and had been kindly given an umbrella don t understand why when she could have been inside all safe and sound Shame the hotel couldn t be picked up and moved to a quieter area to match the upmarket facilities it has , Bed and pillows were the most comfy I d ever experienced Good room service and breakfast menu Rooms were very well appointed with everything you d ever need especially with Elemis toiletries and Illy coffee machine Complimentary water crisps and nighttime bed turn down with lip balm and pillow spray was a lovely touch Staff were so professional courteous and friendly and all with perfect English Very close to the station but that had its drawbacks Beautiful dining room bar and relaxing areas Very clean and well run hotel Breakfast was plentiful with lots of choices Great bar and cocktail menu and not silly prices Staff were great I ve Said this twice now as they were 
418931,art otel Amsterdam, The television had poor sound but didn t really affect our stay as we didn t watch it much, Loved the decor the staff who were so helpful and friendly loved the restaurant The bed was so comfortable and the bathroom just gorgeous Great location too 
418932,art otel Amsterdam, My phone in the room could not dial out so I went downstairs to ask for another pillow as per the pillow menu in the room It never arrived Second night of stay I was awoken by a putrid smell of sewerage and I was so sick from it I could not sleep A staff member came by to ask me next morning how everything was and when I told her about this she said there had been a burst sewerage pipe during the night All she said was sorry I paid for that nights sleep and couldn t because of the disgusting smell No compensation offered and phone never fixed , Large room with beautiful lighting options large shower are with separate toilet Very modern and well designed decor throughout the hotel and right across the road from Central station 
418933,art otel Amsterdam,No Negative, Perfect stay Right in the city center in front of the train station but all noise is cancelled Spacious modern rooms with a big bed Super friendly staff and excellent breakfast This hotel is a must 
418934,art otel Amsterdam,No Negative, The room was modern with beautiful design and warmth We were thrilled about our room The room was well thought of and consequently we were carefully thought of I love the fact that the bed was specially made around dinner time Turned into a cozy space The breakfast was wonderful really chic It is a delight to get a newly made egg of our liking and bacon by order In addition the restaurant was a really nice dinner place too All the staff were professional helpful and smiling which increased our state of happiness this weekend 
418935,art otel Amsterdam, The bathroom offers almost NO intimacy especially the restrooms Impossible to use the toilets without letting the other person in the room hear everything I would NOT recommend this hotel if more than one person in the room For a single person the room is good , Good location Nice staff 
418936,art otel Amsterdam, Breakfast service was very poor So bad in fact we didn t end up bothering to have breakfast in the hotel the second morning of our stay They took up until we were almost ready to give up and leave to come take our order for eggs and coffee Then the coffees took more than the eggs to make it to our table completely cold which told me they must ve been sitting around forever We got a halfhearted sorry by the end but by that point we were just done Second point the cleaning staff on our floor 3 rd spent at least 15 minutes talking on full volume in the hallway outside our door at 5am both nights which ruined our sleep Considering the reputation and cost of the hotel we were not impressed and would probably not return as sleep quality and breakfast are quite important to us , The room we were in was perfect big comfy bed excellent shower great overall 
418937,art otel Amsterdam, The breakfast chef preparing to order eggs was inconsistent day to day This was the only issue , The breakfast choices were varied and generally quite good 
418938,art otel Amsterdam, Although i wrote that we are celbrating two events birthday and pregnancy only simple hand written congratulations card were waiting to us The hotel could have Put some more efforts , Well designed very artistic in atmosphere cool and very friendly staff clean and neat tasty breakfast and beat located Just wonderful 
418939,art otel Amsterdam, Nothing thanks to keep everything like it is , One of the best hotel I never stayed what a friendly staff fully dedicated to the customer satisfaction you feel like at home 
418940,art otel Amsterdam, Nothing major I did not like Just bear in mind some rooms have a view only to internal building I was lucky to have a street view which was great , Clean rooms modern hotel well located super helpful staff Nice Gym with excellent breakfast options Also nice bar with music top barman and great lobby Overall great experience Recommended
418941,art otel Amsterdam,No Negative, The location was ideal for access to the downtown entertainment area The room was very comfortably decorated and amenities were available Pleasant place to stay on a visit to Amesterdam 
418942,art otel Amsterdam, Coffee machine in the room was overly complicated More personal space in the mini bar fridge would be nice Too be honest it s hard too find any real faults with the hotel, Breakfast was excellent staff extremely helpful and friendly Room was of an outstanding finish It is by far one of the best hotels that we have stayed in The location to all major transport and areas of interest in the city is fantastic 
418943,art otel Amsterdam, Dark interior in hallways A bit off putting But room was very nice Comfortable beds and quiet even though we were in a very busy location , Close to the train station which was convenient for tram and travel to and from Staff were excellent Very friendly Chef in 5 33 restaurant was excellent Wonderful meal 
418944,art otel Amsterdam, The bathtub while a beautiful art object was not great for bathing No flat surfaces as the bottom was rounded made it hard to stand Also nothing to grab to get out of the tub no rails and the edges of the tub are narrow and sharp Fortunately the separate shower was excellent Out room did not have a dresser There were no drawers for clothing just hangers in the closet , Excellent central square location close to trams trains easy airport access Very easy to take a quick tram ride to the major sites and museums Very clean and comfortable rooms great bed quiet excellent shower and bathroom staff are amazing friendly knowledgeable fast In house breakfast is cooked to order and included bottle of water in room included they don t add extra for all the nice extras espresso machine in room included Hotel is very contemporary with art in every room Always felt welcomed and safe Probably the best hotel staff I ve ever encountered 
418945,art otel Amsterdam, There was nothing about this hotel I didn t like , This hotel is very well situated Close to the station and all the action but quiet It is artsy and modern which I liked 
418946,art otel Amsterdam, Lighting controls in the room operated different areas of the room but would have liked bedside controls Liked the private toilet stall in the bathroom but the bottom of the door scraped the floor making a loud noise , Convenient to places we visited quiet at night very comfortable bed good breakfast and fantastic friendly responsive staff 
418947,art otel Amsterdam, Wish the window in my room was a little larger otherwise loved everything about the hotel , The friendliness of the staff They were so kind they gave me a free upgrade They were so accommodating and helpful to explain where to go and what to do in the city The rooms were big modern and very clean 
418948,art otel Amsterdam, The hotel could have a better sign at street level , The staff were superior the breakfast service was exceptional This is now our hotel of choice in Amsterdam 
418949,art otel Amsterdam, Breckfast seemed a little chaotic on Sunday Breackfast seemed pre prepared Luke warm sausages poached eggs cold Coffee didn t come until we finished breackfast , Hotel was visually amazing staff also amazing and little treat for us as anniversary 
418950,art otel Amsterdam, Nothing could have been better, Loved the breakfast and the very friendly members of staff especially the receptionists All very helpful and beautiful Extremely quick to get to from Amsterdam Central and only 5 10 minutes away from everything you need in the heart of the city
418951,art otel Amsterdam, The reception area was very tired the sauna area was very smelly as a group of two couples we tried to organise massages way in advance to be informed that the spa was an external company with only one therapist Not what you should expect from a hotel supposedly one of the best in Amsterdam , The staff were great and the location was perfect 
418952,art otel Amsterdam, Overall it was a nice experience The only thing which could be better There is no business center or even simply zone with computer and printer at the hotel so to print anything you need to send it to the reception go and wait there Not very convenient especially when many guests , Nice comfortable and clean hotel with perfect location in a very city center close to the railway station if need a train to the airport etc to the key shopping streets and the other attractions While the hotel is in the center is pretty quite so good for comfortable rest Good breakfast choice and quick service nice design overall Light and spacious rooms Friendly and ready to help personnel 
418953,art otel Amsterdam, Too noisy Room location on first floor street side so could hear trams and traffic And on Friday night the band in the bar downstairs was very loud until midnight , Design and features of hotel room were excellent including the peekaboo mirror Loved the little things like the art books signs and toiletries Pure luxurious heaven 
418954,art otel Amsterdam, Nothing , The room was well equipped and a nice size with an extra large very comfortable bed The staff were friendly efficient and very attentive The hotel was centrally located ideal for shops restaurants and bars 
418955,art otel Amsterdam, BREAKFAST For a 5 star hotel the breakfast provided was a massive disappointment There was a small selection of food extremely poor service and not enough caffeine First of all you sit down and they take your order for eggs and hot drinks Then there is the open continental buffet They would always advertise 3 different cheese but at least 2 of them would be finished in early hours of the breakfast and never be replaced Meanwhile the simple coffee we ordered would take 20 30 minutes to arrive and the eggs would take even longer This is because there is only one coffee machine and they make coffee for hundreds of guests from the same machine By the time they do yours your continental plate you prepared from the bar would be empty you would have a single cup of coffee and if you decide to drink it with the eggs it would turn freezing cold Imagine 2 chefs preparing egg based dishes individually for hundreds of people I simply can t understand why they can t put 1 2 coffee machines at the bar so that guests can help themselves I mean fair enough if a waiter waitress brings your coffee some people probably think its more classy however if you are getting everything else from the buffet yourself then why not coffee too After complaining about the breakfast for 3 days they finally gave us a voucher for cocktails which was a nice gesture , Very helpful receptionists providing honest advice Great location Within 5 10 minute walking distance from the central station 
418956,art otel Amsterdam, We had trouble with the wifi connection in our room during our entire stay Unfortunately could not be fixed , The breakfast is unsurpassed It offers buffet AND a la carte both included and the service is impeccable The buffet is always clean and well stocked and for coffee or a freshly prepared hot dish eggs pancakes etc you never have to wait or look for a waiter And the hotel was at full capacity during the Easter weekend In general the food drinks staff breakfast 5 33 and the bar area is very VERY good They are efficient and charming Could find NO fault very rare in Amsterdam The location is top notch 5 min walk from central station easy stroll to Dam and Jordaan 
418957,art otel Amsterdam, Lighting in the room absolutely appalling especially in bathroom All mood lighting very atmospheric but completely impossible for e g applying make up No reading lights on bedside tables either Also nowhere in shower to put shampoo etc except the floor Staff at checkin very poor On arrival after the checkin time one of our two rooms wasn t ready We took the other room and were told they would personally bring us the key for the other room in 10 minutes maximum 20 minutes later we had heard nothing so I rang reception to enquire and was told they would make enquiries and get straight back to us 10 minutes later having again heard nothing I rang again and was told the same thing At that point we went to the other room and tried to get a chambermaid to let us in She called reception and after more to ing and fro ing she said they would bring up the key We continued to wait Eventually someone brought up the key Very poor first impressions of the hotel , Comfortable bed good bedding and linen Great gym pool Excellent breakfast Good soundproofing we were not disturbed by busy traffic and passers by outside Good TV
418958,art otel Amsterdam, The evening meals were a bit to unconventional and disappointing not mention expensive , The staff looked after us exceptionally well Rooms were comfortable and funky Breakfasts were scrumptious Location excellent 
418959,art otel Amsterdam, This is really nit picking but the turndown service is at 6ish just when we were napping before going out and woke us up so just remember to put the do not disturb sign out , Front of house staff were amazing Gave great advice on where to go Room was really comfy I was with a friend we both had big comfy beds Breakfast is fab every choice under the sun Fantastic location 
418960,art otel Amsterdam, The concierge had very little knowledge about what places to go to restaurants in particular and couldn t answer extremely basic questions regarding things to do ,No Positive
418961,art otel Amsterdam, Pillows were not so good and should be improved We could not use the coffee machine I guess more information would be better The breakfast was good but we always asked to the waiter for coffee and tea I prefer if I can get it anytime I want , The hotel s design was very different and we liked it Our room was big only we did not have a view The bad was comfy Location was amazing very close to ceentral station and other attractions in the city 
418962,art otel Amsterdam, I was told on arrival would receive a free birthday cocktail voucher along with balloons for my partner We did not receive this We went down for breakfast was seated quick enough but waited over 15 mins to be served I had to go up to waitress at kitchen to ask if could place our order From then on ordered breakfast in bed as service was poor in restaurant , Rooms were great couldn t fault The male who greets you when come into entrance very nice friendly 
418963,art otel Amsterdam, Slightly disappointed with the pool area Pool was colder than expected bar next to poolside wasn t open and relaxation area was also cold , Great location Very trendy hotel Excellent cocktails Room was fantastic 
418964,art otel Amsterdam, Not one single thing , Great location and wonderful staff Really made it a memorable stay went above and beyond for us will definitely recommend to all our friends and return ourselves Thanks again xxx 
418965,art otel Amsterdam, The way from the room to the spa through restaurant in a spa suit But not problem for me maybe for restaurant guests , Excellent hotel valuable art books in the room good kitchen 
418966,art otel Amsterdam, Nothing we loved our stay , The room was very spacious the bed super comfortable and had absolutely everything you would might need during your stay The swimming pool and the sauna was a plus which together with the location made our stay great 
418967,art otel Amsterdam, I didn t like the pillows but the bed was very comfortable , Breakfast was very nice Cooked food included There was a smoking lounge available Great location 
418968,art otel Amsterdam, A lack of natural light atmospheric but unrelieved Bedroom temperature seemed to be centrally controlled were very warm overnight the alternative was to open a window noisy or put on the air conditioning , Breakfast very very good Lovely set up for swimming towels to hand etc Attentive staff
418969,art otel Amsterdam, The a la carte breakfast dish was a bit disappointing very small and not particularly tasty The lesiure facilities weren t in line with the rest of the hotel Badly laid out and in a very depressing style not luxurious like the rest of the hotel , The room was very nice
418970,art otel Amsterdam, Pool was closed for renovation and I had not known that in advance , Room is in good size with nice decor Breakfast is amazing and the dining area has excellent atmosphere Gym is very well equipped One of the best I have seen for a hotel 
418971,art otel Amsterdam, The breakfast taken at room was 5 per tray which we thought was mandatory later found a restaurant also that can be waived , Croissants were perfect and yummy Toilets were v clean and spacious The coffeemaker gave us strong aromatic coffee Location is the plus We could walk around everywhere 
418972,art otel Amsterdam,No Negative, The room was great especially the bathroom that was super stylish Location is everything here Canal cruise Hop on off bus centraal station all are 2 minutes away from front door 
418973,art otel Amsterdam, I disliked the front office arrangement as it made the hotel looked tiny and crowded which could decrease the comfort feeling towards visitors I disliked the minibar system that even if you empty it you would still be charged cause of the computerized system making it difficult to store personal stuff like medicines One last thing gym is quite busy because it is a shared gym with another hotel People should know that , Well I liked the location the room service staff were so so so helpful along with the breakfast I m addition it was the help u get over the phone whenever u need it as I went on sick and they helped in guiding to hospital quickly 
418974,art otel Amsterdam, Only thing I could fault was the noise in the bar we was on the first floor and from 9 2am it felt like we was at a disco we could even name the songs But we kinda expected it , Couldn t fault the property at all was so central that we only had to take one train to central station and the hotel is basically on the door step We then walked the whole weekend Was so easy to get to everywhere It was my partners birthday and there was a not and ballon for us checking in the hotel staff also wished him a happy birthday Was truely the nicest experience ever Breakfast was amazing 
418975,art otel Amsterdam, I would kindly suggest to improve little bit choices in breakfast Also WiFi connections was disconnecting time by time Need some improvement in WiFi network , Very professional and friendly staff specifically General Manager Willem Verhoeven and barmen Alexandros Samaras Hotel is clean and with nice Interior design I got 5 star hotel service I have kindly requested room with Central Station view and reception girl arranged it for me I will highly recommend this hotel 
418976,art otel Amsterdam, Amsterdam is a very expensive city and this is a very expensive hotel in it You absolutely got what you paid for but cheaper alternatives are available , I arrived late at night and the journey from the station to the hotel was very easy The staff were lovely and welcoming My room was very large absolutely stunning and well equipped There was a 24 hour swimming pool but unfortunately I left my kit at home Breakfast was a combination of warm a la carte dishes and breakfast buffet This was all clearly fresh and very nice 
418977,art otel Amsterdam, Cold swimming pool old gym fiddly coffee machine in room Staff grumpy and not very charming or helpful No print ink at check out or staples for bill For this price I would expect more perfection No child friendly food in room service Fiddly room phone and room service never answered anyway , Clean and comfy rooms and nice Elemis products and huge bath 
418978,art otel Amsterdam,No Negative, Overall this is a great hotel Good location close to the Centraal and many attraction The staff is very nice and even prepares a packed breakfast for us to enjoy on the train The bed and linen are good and it s quiet Highly recommended to anyone travelling as a couple and want something extra and artsy The breakfast they offered at hotel is well worth the money 
418979,art otel Amsterdam, the first night there was a private party at the hotel bar so the room service was very poor and there was no food which we found quite unacceptable,No Positive
418980,art otel Amsterdam, Event on in the evening Both the dining room and bar were completely closed off to guests No pre warning ahead of booking the room, Stylish spacious rooms with complimentary refreshments Breakfast cooked to order and of a high standard
418981,art otel Amsterdam, Location of the fitness zone must pass the reception it is not practical especially when it is cold and you are sweating and must also go through the restaurant , Great location especially if you are coming or going by train Close to almost everything Everything was nice but since the walls are gypsum boards and the ground is wood whenever any close by room closes its door you will hear it as if it was the door of your room 
418982,art otel Amsterdam, Unfortunately the pool was not open a shame as this was partly why we picked hotel The evening menu was limited and therefore we ate out Not really a complaint but the dark moody decor inside makes going outside into the daylight a little startling , Excellent location Really friendly and helpful staff Quirky decor Fab breakfast Freshly cooked Eggs Benedict were delicious Croissants truly amazing Live music at the bar was fun and very comfy seating nearby to relax into Loads of books everywhere to flick through Love the inspirational messages on the carpets 
418983,art otel Amsterdam, Just that the time we visited the pool and sauna was out of order Not a big problem but would have been nice to use all the facilities, Pretty much everything It s a fantastic hotel with great staff 
418984,art otel Amsterdam, Well I was very disappointed in the spa facilities for the fact that they was not available and I would not have booked this hotel if I was warned about this the whole point for my stay here was to take advantage of the spa and to have a relaxed time here that unfortunately did not happen and I will be taking this further as it slightly ruined my time and I was there for a relaxing time, I liked the restaurant at this hotel and also the fact the staff where friendly location is also key and this was excellent
418985,art otel Amsterdam, Very expensive restaurant The cleaning staff knocked the door too early in the morning , The location is fantastic The decoration was impressive The staff was very helpful The fact that the main station is right outside the hotel helps anyone to go everywhere he wants 
418986,art otel Amsterdam, nothing except u can t open a windows, the most wonderful helpful tasty design place that we have been and we are travailing at list once a month
418987,art otel Amsterdam,No Negative, This hotel is a true experience One of the most modern full of energy hotel I ve ever been Breakfast unbelievable the room outstanding and the service really you will not believe it The hotel fullfilled every last demand we had Noelia is one of the best customer service we ever had Really professional hospitality Thank you for everything 100 I will come back 
418988,art otel Amsterdam, Leaving It was so warm and friendly 0, The impeccable and caring service I arrived tired and hungry after a three hour train journey and just wanted a coffee and a bread roll The man on the door who helped the guests on arrival organized this and was told it was on the house A small gesture that meant so much 
418989,art otel Amsterdam, In our sixties and didn t really appreciate the loud thumping music in bar dining room in the evening , The staff were brilliantly helpful and friendly 
418990,art otel Amsterdam, we were a bit unlucky with our room which was located directly next to the cleaning staff preparation area and because of that I didn t feel the room tariff was justified during our 2 days stay the galary was closed another unlucky coincidence , Definitely a hotel I d recommend great location stylish rooms good breakfast lovely in house bar The hotel manager Maria if I remember correctly was absolutely wonderful 
418991,art otel Amsterdam,No Negative, Lovely hotel went for my partners 30th and it was excellent Breakfast was lovely wide variety to choose from and a lovely room we had Would definately stay here again and recommend to to anyone else 
418992,art otel Amsterdam, It was nice that staff were so attentive but it would be constantly a knock on the door to check if everything was alright and if we wanted anything which when naked or asleep wasn t ideal , Very good location close to everything with a very nice breakfast Great room with lots extras and a few nice touches including bottle of water in room 
418993,art otel Amsterdam, Nothing Everything was just perfect , Our room was unbelievable The Art Room XL was one of the best hotel rooms I have stayed in and it truly did live up to its name of having an Iconic view of central station 
418994,art otel Amsterdam, Pool area was really not clean piles of dirty towels And the area was cold Including the sauna Found dust in the room have picture of that , Nice big room Beakfast was good but long waiting for a simple coffee 
418995,art otel Amsterdam, The rooms did not have windows but drafts Inquired about DVD player in the room prior to visit through booking com and the answer was that we could borrow at the reception however when asked upon arrival the reception told us that they do not have any DVD players We planned to stay in to watch DVDs but we had to change our plans Also the hotel staff visited our room so many times for nonrequested services refilling the mini bar fridge water supply etc I feel that they should have done those before we arrive especially refilling of the minibar and greet with complementary water once Overall not really comfortable stay , nice breakfast with warm breakfast options
418996,art otel Amsterdam,No Negative, The room the breakfast was perfect but if you would like to have breakfast in the room the service is poor Gym very dirty small and cold Swimming pool is not nice The staff aren t professional The lobby is not elegant too simple And the curtain is awful very old not fashionable It s a good 4 stars hotel but not 5 stars No londiner

419009,art otel Amsterdam, The breakfast each day we felt was poor It was barely hot the eggs were overlooked The bacon sausages on all occasions were hard The coffee we ordered was cold on all occasions and we had to call down for milk By the time the milk arrived the coffee was freezing so it was pointless having the coffee to start with , We really liked the decor within the building it was warm comforting and contemporary 
419010,art otel Amsterdam, This sure not a hotel for self drive guest nobody cares you drive on not car park is 15 minutes away This is sure not a 5 star hotel looking at service the worst of all hotels i have stayed is the breakfast here The F B Manager really need to go for training first you are in Holland but i have the feeling this hotel is Italian They try to make you to be served but nobody knows how to handle so you wait for hours and still you got nothing on our first day i order coffee and two boiled eggs breakfast is limited i ask for dutch cheese the chef behind the counter said we have italian cheese i told him we are Holland i would like Dutch cheese he sorry we dont have when i was still waiting for my eggs and coffee i ask 4 waiters finally after 40 minutes my wife left from anger the restaurant i waited other 10 minutes and i left as well without the coffee and eggs and complain to the reception they give you all kind of promises but nothing happen next day we went early not many people still a long wait my advise don t book hotel with breakfast its a disaster there Second morning as i was sitting on front of the counter i saw the chef flirting around with the female waiters cutting food and give it to the female waiters and secretly they are enjoying there food than looking after there guest Than out of the blue i got the house keeper standing in our room how is this possible people can walk in to room like like that they provide coffee in the room but they don t refill the coffee so we to ask again we complain so much i got a call from the duty manager and he said sorry for all this here are two cocktail vouchers from the house we never used, only the location

419013,art otel Amsterdam, We were quite unlucky with our reservation At check in we were told the hotel was fully booked My wife and I were quite disappointed after our trip and had the feeling the staff was not helping much to solve the issue They offered us an accomodation in a hotel next door which was not as nice for the first night At check out we were anyway asked to pay the full price for the 2 nights as if we stayed at Art otel which I still find rather twisted and offensive They then offered us two complimentary cocktails they must have thought that would have been enough to make up for the first nigth which we honestly took as a joke If you think 2 free cocktails are enough in these cases well there s something we will never agree on customer satisfaction All in all not a nice experience First time in my life I was told our booking was scrap paper as they had meanwhile sold the room to someone else Customer service really poor if your target is to be fun and creative you should also make sure your customers are almost always satisfied I would have appreciated a call to let me know about the issue in advance so that i could have cancelled the booking and reserved somewhere else When you are travelling you don t want others to decide for you where you gonna sleep You surely have loads of loyal customers and understandably so since yestarday you have lost 2 returning customers , Quite a wide choice for breakfast building is new and nicely decorated The atmosphere is also fairly vibrant and location is superb right opposite the station therefore easy to reach from Airport and conveniently located nearby most attractions in the city centre 
419014,art otel Amsterdam, We didn t sleep well two out of three nights due very loud music downstairs in the hotel bar There were some events going on One night till midnight and the next night till 2am We complained but it didn t help Actually I pay for a bed in a hotel to rest and sleep and not to get disturbed by awful noises It s an expensive hotel and not a youth hostel , Good location opposite the central station big and clean room delicious French toast for breakfast

419022,art otel Amsterdam, They tried to book us into another hotel for first night as they had no rooms despite the fact it was pre paid I had confirmation They sorted it after a heated discussion Breakfast was slow my order took over half an hour the waitress tried to blame it on their electronic system not working it was working for everyone else who were getting their orders within 5 mins I then saw her finally write it down give it to the chef At checkout there were lots of things wrongfully added to our bill A telephone call didn t touch the phone other than when reception called me extras from the minibar I d had a water juice but told i d had other stuff too And best of all apparently i d ordered 34 fast track tickets to Van Gough museum Which was not correct either All items were taken off thankfully but i don t find it particularly acceptable to have to prove oneself innocent after spending 900 for 3 nights and especially when suffering from a sore neck from the really terrible bed pillows , Locations good nice bar great shower

419047,art otel Amsterdam, We were on the top floor where the windows are much smaller than the floors below so although we had booked an iconic view it was only possible to enjoy it when standing at the window The room was expensive so it was only just value for money , Excellent sized room all very comfortable Loved the artworks all around the hotel Super breakfast with swift service enjoyed the swimming pool and sauna Efficient lifts 
419048,art otel Amsterdam, more cheese options on the breakfast buffet maybe a proper working scale for the luggages late checkout options could be inviting they charge a percentage of the daily fee over an hour late check out s long time travelling guests should be informed by the laundry time it is once a day at 9 am shoul be improved , great location and good staff very clean staff is lovely and diciplined 5 mins walking to the centraal station 15 mins walk to flower market and around beds are the comfiest decor is artsy but not tiring it is a small almost luxury hotel indoor smoking area

419051,art otel Amsterdam, The front desk staff try to be helpful but seem reluctant to provide specific information Would be helpful if they enlarged a map of the tourist area and clearly indicated the most popular streets so that this could be easily distributed to guests rather than always answering the same question where should we walk We kept getting lost on boring streets and are pretty savvy travellers It was a waste of time We wanted to be on the best streets as there are so many Also when asked to send water to the room or call a restaurant to say that would be late and to hold our table the staff did not oblige the requests which was disconcerting and unfortunate These were items that could have been avoided and were frustrating these make the difference in having a positive experience or not The bed was not comfortable and the bathroom was extremely small and unmanageable The air conditioner was very loud and made it difficult to fall asleep And where was the hot water warm at best so don t count on that steaming hot shower Again the location made up for many of the glaring faults The ladies at the front desk did try very hard and were vey positive and delightful The gentleman had attitude , The breakfast was excellent in a lovely breezy room overlooking the square and via Augusta the pedestrian street The front desk staff gave good restaurant suggestions for dinner 
419052,art otel Amsterdam, Was slightly confused when asked to pay for the stay with deposit when we checked in as it clearly states that payment is expected on check out Not that this made any difference to us however could not help feeling had we been dressed in designer gear and sporting a matching Armani luggage set then this would not have been the case Where as the self serve choice at breakfast was good the cooked breakfast was poor in quantity and flavour One hard poached egg on one slice of toast was dissapointing Felt sorry for the sausage which appeared to have been kept on a hot plate for three days Hard and tasteless and inedible unless one had a chainsaw , The friendly helpful staff The housekeeping of our room was exceptional To return from a busy days sightseeing to our bed turned down for the night with pillow spray and relaxing balm mood lights and music on was magical Fabulously comfortable bed and pillows Exceptional bathroom with gorgeous smelling gels soap and cream Loved wrapping up in the soft towel dressing gown and slippers Smoking room a bonus late at night 
419053,art otel Amsterdam, Concept of hotel is minimalism which does not work well if you need a place to put your clothes while there was a decent closet there was no space to put underwear t shirts etc Edgy decor included very dim lighting in elevator hallways as well as art which might be seen as bad taste by some , Wonderful attentive staff who were super helpful Comfortable beds great toiletries and bathroom very good breakfast included in room price Very good location near central train station and multiple tram bus lines making it easy to get to many different parts of the city

419061,art otel Amsterdam, Sauna and swimming pool surroundings could be better organised and cleaner Everything was soaking wet even though there was someone supposedly in charge of keeping everything in check Similarly in the changing areas It s quite inconvenient that to reach the pool you have to go by reception the restaurant and the bar area , Best thing about the hotel is the personnel attentive helpful and genuinely nice Location is great as well Breakfast very nice although sometimes they re so busy that by the time the cooked breakfast arrives at the table it s a bit cold 
419062,art otel Amsterdam, Our room was beside the staff stuff room and we had noise from them coming and going picking things and slamming the door We said this to the reception guys but they just said we are sorry The room they offered us for changing was not in our rooms class , Breakfast area and foods they offered was amazing Decoration is interesting but a bit weird Little life quotes here and there was my most favorable at this hotel 
419063,art otel Amsterdam, However the noise protection could have been better When the neighbour s door is shut even though automatically the whole room shook from its impact Noise proof was not very good Hope you can do something with that Thank you , All was perfect We really enjoyed the stay in Art Otel We will definitely come again 
419064,art otel Amsterdam, Very dark room lift restaurant Lots of mistakes by staff Staff friendly but not as polished in service as expected for the price Pool very cold , Good location Nice breakfast Nice sauna Good wi fi

419092,art otel Amsterdam, What otherwise would have been an impeccable experience was marred by a string of inexplicable minor defects in service For example We checked in on a Friday but were given the weekday breakfast hours rather than the weekend breakfast hours The handwritten welcome card in our room was addressed to someone else On each of the two mornings we took breakfast in the hotel one of our orders was prepared incorrectly , The general set up was that of a good five star artsy romantic modern hotel in an exceptionally convenient and somewhat scenic location 
419093,art otel Amsterdam, Grossly overpriced no bath lighting in room appaling when staying as a couple breakfast very poor only one toaster which was faulty Room was noisy with poor soundproofing from road outside Extremely disappointed in this hotel , The central location of the hotel
419094,art otel Amsterdam,No Negative, Had a major problem with my bill when checking out Wasted approx 2 hours getting the issue resolved Staff insisted the charges were correct with no proof of them and took payment from my debit card against my instructions Eventually after a long process I got the money refunded and the issue resolved Not worth the hassle and waste of time 
419095,art otel Amsterdam, The fact you had to check in with reception when you wanted to use the pool late at night was a mild annoyance , Excellent location and cannot speak too highly of the staff friendly and professional Breakfast was excellent and the food in the restaurant was amazing but be prepared to share 
419096,art otel Amsterdam, Checking in was relatively straightforward if a little cold We were shown a city map and some things to do but weren t shown to our room or shown the restaurant and pool facilities Maybe that s being picky but I would expect special treatment from a 5 especially as it was not overly busy The room looked nice from the surface but the toilet made a sound every hour I d put this down to bad plumbing the shower drain also stank of sewerage Breakfast on the first morning was ok at first the fresh orange juice was nice but the service was terrible after being seated we were asked what we would like before receiving the menus after asking for the menu the waitress stood over us as if we were going to make a decision in that instant After asking for 2 minutes we were ignored for 10 then after calling back the waitress we ordered earl grey tea and an omelette with cheese tomato ham and onion What we received was generic tea and an omelette with nothing inside but absolutely covered in salt While my girlfriend was at the table and I was fetching some croissants as we couldn t order pancakes as we were ignored from that point on I was offered a coffee and my girlfriend requested that the waitress ask me when I return to the table After all The waitress never returned so we left Just a terrible experience We didn t go to breakfast the next day as the amount of salt in my eggs made me feel sick so we paid for breakfast at a local cafe for very little money and not only was the food better but the waitress was attentive too Upon checking out we were hit with a myriad of random charges 5 for a room service tray next time I will ask them to bring it in their hands The room service tray was also never collected so I had to leave it outside the door it was still there after midnight by the way , The bed was comfortable but that was about the only good thing 
419097,art otel Amsterdam,No Negative, Amazing hotel Loved staying here and will use this hotel every time I travel to Amsterdam from now on The staff are amazing and go above and beyond they even brought my boyfriend a birthday cake and prosecco which was so kind thank you for the amazing stay 
419098,art otel Amsterdam, Pricing varies by day A little noise at night due to proximity to street , Friendly and accommodating staff Nice breakfast selection and a very convenient location 
419099,art otel Amsterdam, Fried eggs were overcooked and scrambled eggs were just weird Odd to Put them on a piece of bread Fruit bowl was mostly apples would have loved more berries Kiwi oranges bananas, Good bed and pillows AC issues Croissants were good porridge was good 
419100,art otel Amsterdam,No Negative, Extremely noisy sound of trams plus noises from other rooms got little sleep I was told I didn t ask for a quiet room on my booking As if one should have to ask even though I actually did Staff management elitist attitude Booking com very helpful Staff even entered my room when I was in my robe when I said wanted to check out 
419101,art otel Amsterdam, Nothing couldn t fault it , The attention to detail style and class of the establishment was impressive All the staff were very attentive and professional Our super King room was gorgeous and very spacious we couldn t have asked for a more convenient location and better value for money Thank you for making our experience of an awesome city break very special indeed we will be back 
419102,art otel Amsterdam, The noises from the train station and the tram The hotel location is in a crowded place so if you are planning to sleep tight you will not get a quite sleep , Poached eggs were amazing Breakfast was extermely good De or and furniture was decent 
419103,art otel Amsterdam, No grouches really breakfast was very busy but you could see it was all hands on deck The Illy coffee machine was either faulty or just not able to meet standards set by Nespresso , From the high standard of the reception through all the way to design staff effeciency friendliness and standards of service it was almost faultless And any fault was minor and not worth mentioning 
419104,art otel Amsterdam, Breakfast poor cooked breakfast mushroom very dry skin on sausage tough average choice , Bed and pillows fantastic staff very smart and helpful 
419105,art otel Amsterdam, Price is high on Amsterdam hotel market in general I believe 150 is reasonable and I d of stayed longer Taxis are super expensive In total is a pricey visit ,No Positive
419106,art otel Amsterdam, Can hear the trains from the room , I was unwell and the staff arranaged a doctor quickly and even called to check I was ok Coolest art work and location is fantastic 
419107,art otel Amsterdam,No Negative, Staff were exceptionally cheerful and helpful they even turn your bed in the evening and leave you small presents for the night And the coffee you can make in the room is excellent Room interior is arty and playful Perfect location 
419108,art otel Amsterdam, We did a mistake when booking the first time and selected the wrong week end with a non flexible rate no cancellation allowed When realising this we tried calling the hotel to move the reservation to the week before with the support of booking com The hotel management was not flexible and did not allow this obligating us to fully rebook for the week in question We do not understand this behaviour as this was a human mistake and our request was not to cancel the reservation but merely to move it No reason was given to us either For this reason I would not recommend this hotel which is a shame since our stay there was otherwise pleasant On the other negative side The spa was very small and full of people so a bit disappointing based on the pictures we saw of it On the whole I was expecting more of a 5 star hotel , The location is great next to the central station and the staff was kind and helpful in general The rooms are comfortable and clean 
419109,art otel Amsterdam, The cleaniliness the availability of room service given that its a 5 star hotel The staff can barge into your room anytime The maids will check the trash to find any existence of penalties that the hotel may benefit from E g even if they find pipe cleaning material in the trash they will claim u smoked The rooms and bathrooms are not five star material The quality is very poor and cheap The walls in the rooms are full of baggage scratches and poor quality black wallpaper The hotel may be five star but its definitely not 5 star quality The maids are not good with cleaning rooms If you have allergies you will continuously suffer Their is dust almost everywhere The maid will make minimum effort to clean the room just to make sure it looks tidy and rather not very clean The only thing good was the location Otherwise do not waste your money Stay in another 5 star hotel would be more worth the cost , Only the resteraunt downstairs
419110,art otel Amsterdam, There was nothing about our stay we didn t like would defernilty come back to the hotel again, Yes the bed was amazing and the whole experience was made even more pleasurably by where we stayed
419111,art otel Amsterdam,No Negative, The room was exquisite with beautiful lighting really comfy bed and excellent bathroom facilities The hotel brought us complimentary champagne strawberry and cake on my husbands birthday which was a lovely touch 
419112,art otel Amsterdam, Rooms and breakfast area were a bit dark and and access to spa after checking out was a bit tricky One lady responsible of the spa was not exactly welcoming while I was changing my clothes before leaving to the airport , The location and design of the hotel
419113,art otel Amsterdam, Evening meal menu was not varied enough overpriced and rather quirky THere was the same set menu each night We stayed for 3 nights and wanted to eat at least one evening meal for convenience at the hotel but once we had decided one night s menu didn t match our preferences there was no opportunity to eat on any other occasion as the menu was unchanging The hotel was a little parsimonious with the milk tea coffee supplies for making a drink in the room , Interesting and Original design concept for the hotel and rooms Room very comfortable and the en suite facilities were excellent Nice large TV screen Room was clean staff were friendly helpful A special cake was supplied for free for my birthday a nice touch Breakfast was very good although not exceptional for the price Close to the station which was ideal for us 
419114,art otel Amsterdam, Restaurant area very dark and dingy Breakfast mediocre esp the horrible coffee , Good location good sized comfortable well equipped room Nice bar cocktails Friendly helpful staff 
419115,art otel Amsterdam, The area is awful The room It s not clean enough The shower floor is plastic The design Its too dark for to take a breakfast There are no drawers in the closet , The food The gym Tjhe tv screen The amenities
419116,art otel Amsterdam, The stuff was nice but doesn t seemed to get a well treated introduction they felted often uncoordinated But they were always friendly I think the hotel need to school their stuff better , Breakfast was ok But the spark was not there
419117,art otel Amsterdam, Snacks in the bar were not that tasty No newspapers or magazines in the lounge area The location is central but in a very touristy area , Super friendly staff nothing is too much Good gym Rooms are big and comfortable Complimentary breakfast is really tasty and freshly made 
419118,art otel Amsterdam, The girl that checked us in could have been more efficient otherwise the staff were lovely, interesting interior designed modern hotel with lovely rooms and delicious breakfast in a great location opposite central station and near the trams 
419119,art otel Amsterdam, The hotel restaurant very busy You need prior reservation for dinner the hotel guys shoud let us know when check in For the ladies bad make up light in the bathroom , Great personnel great rooms great location great food
419120,art otel Amsterdam, Nothing , Very central location Service was excellent all staff were extremely friendly and helpful We were celebrating my husband s 50th birthday and they couldn t do enough for us Our room was fantastic with a great view of Central Station Beds were very comfortable Hotel d cor is fantastic very quirky Food was lovely both breakfast and evening meal We had an amazing time and would definitely return to this hotel Thank you 
419121,art otel Amsterdam, There is nothing I didn t like about this property It s absolutely perfect , From the moment you walk in you re greeted with a friendly happy face and the staff never cease to look after your every request until you leave They have mastered service So helpful to organise things for you and give advice Such genuinely friendly people The food and bar is also amazing They even have Cristal I loved staying here I hope I have a reason to return one day 
419122,art otel Amsterdam, Some live music DJ at hotel for once we d come back from our night out as there wasn t any on on the nights we stayed mon Tues , Loved the hotel really great design and amazing food in the restaurant
419123,art otel Amsterdam, The sound proofing of the rooms could ve been better you could hear the other room doors opening and closing , The interior design of the hotel was exceptional Perfect location Very friendly and helpful staff 
419124,art otel Amsterdam, Slightly noisy in the morning from train station, Massive and yummy breakfast Huge bath tub Really nice coffee machine in the room And the hotel could not be more central 
419125,art otel Amsterdam, Spa and sauna were a bit disapointing , Service and staff in general was very good Restaurant and bar also worth a visit Good food and Great cocktailin Breakfast was super Our room was very comfortable clean and modern though if you want a room with a view make sure you order room with iconic view 
419126,art otel Amsterdam, The only things I could mention as a negative were the price it s not a cheap hotel to stay in by any means and the bed laying on it initially it felt super comfy but after a night I felt like I was not fully rested There could be two reasons for this A The most expensive single item of furniture in my home was the bed and it s soooo comfortable that it might be tricky for other beds to compete B It appears the beds had a topper on and although it has to be noted it s a very high quality topper I think after 7 8 hours maybe the thickness was just not up to the job Saying this I would say that maybe I am very particular with my comfort in bed and most people may find everything completely ok , Staff were amazing really helpful very friendly the whole hotel is very nice indeed great ambience great breakfast great facilities
419127,art otel Amsterdam, That there is only one like this in the world , If you are looking for a place that is Center five star pampering pool luxury breakfast with a bar and restaurants that are considered one of the best look no more This place is a perfect combination between luxury and fun The details of the room were unbelievable They have taken it to the extend how every little corner had a touch From the In room nespresso machine free snacks water beds Linen amenities shades The check in itself process was very easy and I must say this has been one of my best places I stayed at Furthermore I asked someone that is in the hospitality industry look into details that regular people that are not in the industry do not see and I must say I have not found any complain The breakfast itself is something else to talk about and if I ever visit them again and not stay here because there usually fully booked for sure will come here for the breakfast and of course the nightlife it offers Thank you for making my stay eight unforgettable experience 
419128,art otel Amsterdam, Service was very slow Staff sometimes needed asking to go stuff but once they did they were attentive Nowhere to easily park , Breakfast was excellent Iconic view well worth the extra 
419129,art otel Amsterdam, The lounge area could be more comfortable and inviting , Nothing was too much trouble for the staff The facilities were good and the location excellent 
419130,art otel Amsterdam, Nothing , The staff at this hotel are wonderful all friendly and very helpful The rooms were modern and clean the fitness suite good and breakfast excellent A special mention to Gino one of the concierges he made our stay so easy booking canal trips and providing tram tickets You pay more for this hotel but it is worth it 
419131,art otel Amsterdam,No Negative, This hotel is amazing I loved staying there It has a contemporary and artistically decoration It is very comfortable and technological also Besides all of this it is right in front the Central Station of Amsterdam in a beautiful region with many interesting things to do and know about the city s way of life I stayed only for a night but I do want to come back 
419132,art otel Amsterdam, Had room service twice and they forgot the bread basket both times Minor matter though Gym and health facilities are shared with their partner hotel next door which is probably why it seemed a bit crowded , Buffet breakfast was just right not too much food but everything was fresh Also liked the fact that the warm breakfast was cooked to order and was excellent Food was also very tasty and fresh had dinner and room service David at the front desk went out of his way to get me an English newspaper from their sister hotel next door I thought that was service the way it ought to be going the extra mile 
419133,art otel Amsterdam, Room was noisy above DJ and Bar had to be moved for next two nights Also the room was on front of hotel so trams were passing every few minutes second room was very quiet neither room had any drawers for storage of small items such as underwear Spa facilities were small, Location excellent
419134,art otel Amsterdam, The rooms are no way five star this hotel is four stars at best its way overpriced and punching above its weight in my honest opinion The bedside tables were filthy with dust under the glass tops and the room looked battered and was starting to take on a more tired look The rooms are very basic no bedside lamps no alarm clock cheap looking flooring and not so great tiling in bathrooms one sink and a coffee machine for DIY coffee addicts old looking mini bar with a boring variety of contents bed was comfy enough room was also freezing cold with air conditioning left on when we arrived Great in summer not so great in march when its 2 5c outside I don t mind spending money if i am going to get 5 star treatment but this really is not the case with art hotel and I recommend somewhere else if your looking for somewhere more up market I do have high expectations however i expected much more from this hotel its just such a rip off for the cost I have stayed in better 4 star hotels in france and spain than this place Safe to say i will never stay there again, We liked the location of the hotel and how modern it looked the staff were nice and friendly but a bit pushy in getting us to check out this hotel does not warrant 5 stars 
419135,art otel Amsterdam, Bar staff not as friendly Several occasions we had to remind the breakfast staff of our tea coffee requests, Reception staff excellent Lounge staff excellent 
419136,art otel Amsterdam, 1 Poor room allocation we were given a poor room with poor bathroom even though we arrived at 16 00 Large group and many rooms blocked Room changed next day 2 Groups We were refused yes I mean this access to the breakfast room due to a 60 plus group of Chinese and despite there being space for us Instead we were forced into the bar and expected to sit on a bar stool or in a low settee Neither acceptable for breakfast I had to ask quite forcefully to have a proper table moved from the group area into the bar bad grace and illogical as we could have sat at this table anyway 3 IT in the rooms We were unable to connect our Ipad to the room System In the first room there was a wall socket but this didn t work despite your staff trying Instead we were offered a free movie but this didn t work either In the Second room 4029 there was no socket and so no way at all to use the TV Unimpressive , Staff were delightful and clearly upset by our experience They all knew and were extra nice Manager on duty wrote personal letter immediately and made sure to chat with us on departure He also told us that the staff were unhappy with the group which was an experiment for a boutique hotel Hopefully not to be repeated otherwise this hotel will not last long in its niche Breakfast was terrific with outstanding home made cereal and freshly made hot food of high quality Second room was very nice with great bathroom and large enough for a city hotel Don t expect views as most rooms are internal whic makes them quiet really quiet at night Excellent coffee machine AND a kettle and free water and crisps made it feel generous Location is very convenient for main station and trams 
419137,art otel Amsterdam, Breakfast wasn t worth for that money Only 2 3 kind of cheap cheese and a few choice of other foods on the bar Like a 3 hotel breakfast buget Menu breakfast was better Crokery set was broken Nearly all plates and bowls had broken parts The shower in the room need to be checked out , Staf was very friendly and helpfull Location was okay 
419138,art otel Amsterdam, The staff need serious training Frankly they are young and need to understand the basic principles and application of hospitality management The check in process was not efficient And at the check out despite the fact that I provided my email address when I made the reservation online to which I received a reply from the property and when I checked in the hotel did not have my email address correct when I checked out Also I requested to receive a copy of the hotel bill via email and had to request it from the property the following day In addition the staff interface at breakfast was frustrating I had to wait several minutes to be seated despite the fact that there were numerous tables that were unoccupied And then the service associated with ordering hot dishes and beverages at what is billed a buffet is overly controlled and slow , The location of the property is good and the pieces of art that are on display and the overall d cor are tasteful and modern 
419139,art otel Amsterdam, Honestly there was absolutely nothing i did not like about it , I liked how easy it was to check in And how the staff accomadated our early check in request The room design was Superb Very artsy hotel fun for friends who are looking to be in the centre of town and havr a good time 
419140,art otel Amsterdam, Nothing to be mentioned I liked everything , Everything about the hotel was awesome and great The helpful staff the wonderful welcoming and the great hospitality 
419141,art otel Amsterdam, Dinner was somewhat spoilt by the loud techno music which could not be turned down and which extended to the lounge area so no escape Such a shame as otherwise the food and comfort were perfect Art work is a bit of an acquired taste Lots of sculptures with a fertility theme make it difficult to recommend to all ages , Restaurant with Italian food was delicious Breakfast is amazing Staff are super helpful and friendly Very nice swimming pool 
419142,art otel Amsterdam, I believe its a bit expensive, breakfast was ok the staff was excellent and very helpful Also the location is i think the best in Amsterdam right in the center 
419143,art otel Amsterdam, Staff was very snobbish and breakfast was terrible Cookies so hard I had to call for the manager and he took all away but then he offered me a coffee which was anyway free and included in the breakfast so manager as snobbish and stupid as the staff at the reception Shower room floor tile was broken and room pseudo stylish and no cupboard for cloths just hangers , The location is good 
419144,art otel Amsterdam, It is a bit dark in the rooms but the interior is interesting anyway , Interior design of the place art around the hotel and the gallery The staff is very professional especially in the restaurant and at the bar Great food The whole atmosphere is a bit different in this hotel It is very funky and stylish 
419145,art otel Amsterdam, I was really hesitant to say this but maybe by incident my room was located below the fitness room For this reason I was a little bit annoyed by the sound of the treadmill that I could hear throughout the day ,No Positive
419146,art otel Amsterdam, The restaurant operations and speed could improve and the breakfast system is a little strange semi buffet semi order , Amazing locations incredibly service oriented staff and wonderful facilities Oh and perhaps the best hotel wifi 
419147,art otel Amsterdam, Hotel pre authorised my debit card at 10am which in the Dutch system effectively blocks the money on my account for two week I paid using my credit card so effectively I can t access that cash for the next two weeks Hotel know the problem and apologised but refused to do more When I arrived they said my room would be ready in 30 mins so I waited actually took 1 5 hours Breakfast was poor American pancakes a 5 year old would be ashamed of and cafe latte that was cold Got up to visit buffet and my table was cleared before I got back Struggled to get the room temperature right , The room decor is nice
419148,art otel Amsterdam,No Negative, Everything was perfect Great location close to public transport The staff were very kind friendly and eager to help you The room was perfect clean big and had everything that you would need and nice little extras I would definitely recommend 
419149,art otel Amsterdam, Expected more from the club bar it was one of the main reasons I stayed and I expected a club scene but really it is just a bar with a DJ Still a good atmosphere but doesn t compare to sky lounge at Double Tree Hilton just across the road , So close to the station 30 second walk Very smart hotel great interior extremely modern A cracking breakfast a feast in fact Staff cannot do enough for you extremely accommodating 
419150,art otel Amsterdam, Remnants from someones dinner were in the fourth floor hallway in the evening understandable but the same were still there at 9 30 the next morning quite appalling , Staff location nice restaurant 
419151,art otel Amsterdam, Music in the bar area was a bit too loud for us to linger over our drinks May be a sign of age , Very helpful staff good location comfortable rooms excellent breakfast 
419152,art otel Amsterdam, The temperature of the pool it was cold , The staff were great We were celebrating a birthday and they helped make it special Great location and rooms Really liked the coffee maker in the room too 
419153,art otel Amsterdam, nothing bad to report ive stayed in hotels that are 4 times as expensive and are not as good , Very easy going staff nothing was an issue and everything done in a relaxed but diligent manner Italian food was excellent very high quality and good bar on a Friday night busy with DJ did not really have to leave Hotel
419154,art otel Amsterdam, Room was small and fairly noisy I could hear the music from the restaurant in my first floor room as well as sounds from the plumbing , I really liked the sauna pool and fitness center The restaurant was a great experience as well both for dinner and breakfast 
419155,art otel Amsterdam, Minor but the spa changing rooms could have been cleaner there were no towels or robes available Mini bar was electronic and automatically charges for things lifted out of its station regardless of whether consumed or not , The turn down service with Elemis pillow spray and eye wake up gel was the icing Amazing breakfast Beautiful clean large standard room with mood lighting and free illy coffee machine Friendly staff 
419156,art otel Amsterdam, On Friday and Saturday nights the hotel bar turns into a nightclub with a DJ The music was so loud that when we I went down to reception to complain they could barely hear what I was saying The staff are well aware that the music can be heard in the rooms and most apologetic but are unable to do anything about it as having a DJ has been approved by the hotel management This is appalling for a 5 star hotel The music ended at 2 30am we were told the bar closes at 2am giving us 1 5hrs sleep on our last night before we had to leave for the airport , Great location very friendly helpful staff and one of the best hotel breakfasts we have ever had Unfortunately the worst hotel for getting any sleep 
419157,art otel Amsterdam, Maybe it s just me but I need a full LOCKABLE bathroom Since I don t respond well to air con I would have liked to be able to open the window , Loved the location the spa facilities and the complimentary Elemis products The artistic touch that is applied to everything in this hotel makes for very stylish surroundings 
419158,art otel Amsterdam,No Negative, I wouldn t of changed a thing perfect location stylish luxurious rooms great food and the most welcoming staff We will definitely be back I would highly reccomend 
419159,art otel Amsterdam, No view from our room but the rooms with the view face train station so also not optional , Great modern rooms fantastic gym and really nice morning breakfast Location is very central
419160,art otel Amsterdam, They didn t give us the option of room service on the third night , Hotel was lovely great location room was superb enjoyed Amsterdam in a whole apart from the rain 
419161,art otel Amsterdam, Breakfast was just ok check out was not great rushed one person working Price high for value , Great location right across from Central Station nice common areas with art designer feel wonderful check in friendly staff WiFi strong and simple to access 
419162,art otel Amsterdam, Our room was next to the lift so very noisy and our move was clumsily organised no two staff could agree what the system said was available 10 days after leaving I am still waiting for a hold on my account to be removed , Staff really friendly especially the animation guy at the front desk 
419163,art otel Amsterdam, Shower water leaked from the shower into the sink area leaving large pools of water making it slippy better seal needed or lip design fault really , Staff so helpful and friendly Beautiful modern hotel
419164,art otel Amsterdam, Getting coffee during breakfast is really a big challenge I had to ask several times and each and every morning we stayed there They seem to have only one coffee machine somewhere in the back long commute times Once you get the coffee however it is very good in taste and strength Selection of breakfast items was good Not sure about dining there but organization during breakfast really needs to improve as it was totally unstructured Power outage at room 2003 while we were using the coffee machine I read that another couple had the same issue with that room Looks like they did not do anything against it after the first time it was communicated Fixing the power outage however was done within 5 minutes I also need to mention the very loud music at the bar But this is up to you if you like it or not And the last point of improvement would be to have something like a night light The chances are very high that you push the wrong switch at night which then would fully illuminate the room and wake up others , Walking distance from central train station nice and stylish rooms Fast elevators Coffee machine in the room 
419165,art otel Amsterdam, Absolutely nothing, Hotel strategically located in the center very close to central station amazing staff food is delicious facilities are great and I ll definitely stay there again
419166,art otel Amsterdam, Room was not cleaned after day out Apparently you have to indicate this but staff did not mention this upon check inn Staff knocking on door and entering fairly quickly was a bit intrusive Rooms in a five star hotel should have a doorbell At breakfast the waiter took order first of some guests who came in later and the drink i ordered never showed up They clearly struggle to handle when at full capacity , Location close to central station fresh breakfast with good variety of choice excellent mattress good system to regulate temperature in room free water and snacks friendly staff
419167,art otel Amsterdam,No Negative, the location is wonderful What is really good is the staff They are helpful and make the stay very easy and enjoyable We love each one and every of them Gino in particular 
419168,art otel Amsterdam, The in room dining menu is paltry It would definitely help if there was more variety in the menu options , The staff are simply wonderful They went out of their way to make me feel welcome and were super friendly and helpful regarding what to do in Amsterdam 
419169,art otel Amsterdam, All staff were so helpful except for one male waiter on Tuesday morning 15 12 15 during breakfast was very unpleasant and actually told off a lovely young waitress in front of us He was so unprofessional , Lovely modern hotel centrally located near to rail station 
419170,art otel Amsterdam, The tram intersection is right outside the building and the vibration is felt throughout The hotel d cor of black is a little disorientating when you have poor eyesight , The hotel was very central to all places of interest Staff were friendly and polite The room was very clean and presentable
419171,art otel Amsterdam, instead of small slightly larger than a bathtub pool I would rather see a larger sauna and a shower area hotel is good but little bit pricy compared to its peers , size of the room its silentness not bad breakfast nice and always smiling team near grand central station which creates easy access to everything 
419172,art otel Amsterdam, Unsavoury incident with staff member in the bar who took exception to having to walk back to the bar to bring back an item missed on the original order Stayed all over the world and never saw a staff member behave in this manner She also made us aware that we would have to move from our seats as they were reserved quite bluntly maybe she was unaware we were residents Spending almost 1000 Euro s in your hotel it was my birthday and made for a very unsavoury experience which I spoke to the duty manager about, Location bar and decor
419173,art otel Amsterdam, Breakfast service level was a bit lower than the 5 star rating would presume mixed up orders long waits for coffee On last morning had to inquire 3 times before something gluten free was found for the wife The gym is a bit small not very cleanly and nearly zero free weights , The staff was helpful and nice laid back but still very polite 24 7 room service Clean facility very comfortable bed and pillows the interior design is superb with art everywhere Breakfast has good amount of quality options Gym in the premises 
419174,art otel Amsterdam,No Negative, very stylish and comfortable with a cool vibe nice large room cool bathroom coffee machine in room excellent breakfast and very good value i cant think of anything negative to say so i will definitely be staying again 
419175,art otel Amsterdam, Breakfast was cold when it arrived at the room no milk of sugar with the coffee and empty salt celler , Most helpful staff without being intrusive I ve come across in any hotel 
419176,art otel Amsterdam,No Negative, Amazing staff friendly and positive they were really helpful The hotel is really cool with a great gallery with some awesome artwork The breakfast was great and the cocktails at the bar were yummy 
419177,art otel Amsterdam, Most of the staff are young and inexperienced so perhaps failed to grasp what is expected of a 5 star hotel Have you got any butter No replied the young waitress When challenged she came back with enough butter to accommodate a small country for months There were more instances like this which slightly took the shine off our stay , Front of house staff were very helpful keen to help Kevin in particular was very good Floyd behind the bar made exceptional cocktails Breakfast was also amazing 
419178,art otel Amsterdam, The food late night supper and breakfast x 2 ordered to our Room was cold upon arrival , The friendly professional staff and the comfort of our Room with a view 
419179,art otel Amsterdam, Our only minor irritation during our stay was related to service at the restaurant and bar Bar service was always slow And the breakfast service and sitting arrangements on the morning of November 15 was uniquely sub standard compared to all other days , Excellent location So easy to access from Central Station and within easy walking distance of all sites of interest Breakfast was included and was superb Room size was large unique for European accommodations Staff were courteous communicative friendly and attentive 
419180,art otel Amsterdam, Maybe we expected too much of a classical 5 star service efficient but discrete respecting privacy Cleanliness wasn t great the corridor quite dirty safe in the room full of fingerprints heating aircondition panel full of dust door of the minibar dusty as well Turndown service in the evening was done by a very kind and friendly person but happened at about 18 00 18 30 which usually is the time one prepares for dinner has a shower relaxes In general the personnel was keen to please and very friendly but a bit more of training would not hurt from our point of view Being forced to greet everyone by shaking hands is unusual but yet can be accepted if the proper service follows in a 5 hotel an offer to help with luggage should go without saying being sent up to the room without being accompanied would have been ok if we wouldn t have found the assigned room occupied Check in procedure was quite long and got even longer after that incident We would have liked to have an aperitif or after dinner drink at the bar but music was annoyingly loud the bar was more of a disco so we refrained Check out was quick partially maybe because of the quite high deposit for extras taken in advance not really 5 but understandable in their position Not a bad stay in total but not great either 5 is definitely not fulfilled , The position is excellent the breakfast was ok
419181,art otel Amsterdam,No Negative, Super modern hotel in a central location close to everything One of the nicest rooms I have ever stayed in with a fantastic breakfast buffet included 5 stars 
419182,art otel Amsterdam, My eggs were cold at breakfast due to the relaxed service style the second morning they were fine as the manager served us , Location was great the atmosphere and the staff were very helpful 
419183,art otel Amsterdam, There are some minor details in the design the bathroom is closed by a sliding door so not much privacy In the shower cabinet you must leave your shampoo on the floor no shelf Even with a walk in closet not enough space Coffee machine in the closet , The staff of Artotel extraordinary Special thanks to Iliana Gino Mira they went out of their way to make our stay special Location was great in the heart of everything 
419184,art otel Amsterdam, The location although extremely central and convenient is too touristy and one night we ordered room service that never showed up Also we stayed in two different rooms as we checked out and decided to stay another night last minute one on the 4th floor was quiet and amazing and the one on the 1st floor facing the street was too loud , The hotel is great Large modern rooms big cozy bathtub positioned so I could watch tv Awesome The staff were very kind and eager to please One staff member in particular that was extremely friendly and a great presence in the hotel was the tall delightful curly haired Dutchman Fast internet great breakfast convenient location to Central station right across the road great bathroom products and overall great modern arty design The bar downstairs is very vibey with yum cocktails 
419185,art otel Amsterdam, A little bit noisy from oitside and from the bar 5 33 Not able to open the windows for refreshing the air in the room Obscure lighting The breakfast not so various and a mixt between buffet and a la carte, Excellent location Very interresting hotel deisgn
419186,art otel Amsterdam, lightning in the bathroom not sufficient also lights in the restaurant for breakfast too dark almost impossible to read something, Very friendly staff excellent room ideally located for walks through city and at the same time near to the Central station with good connections to the airport
419187,art otel Amsterdam, Fabulous room although smoke burn on the floor mat and stains on the seat , Great location friendly and informative staff plus a really nice breakfast 
419188,art otel Amsterdam, The rooms were too small and the tv system was very slow also you can hear anyone walking in the same floor or going to the toilet, I liked how clean is the hotel and the stuff were very friendly and helpful
419189,art otel Amsterdam, We had an issue with the drain in the shower which kept gurgling so obviously a small issue with the plumbing , The bar area and restaurant had a good modern feel to it and was comfortable 
419190,art otel Amsterdam, There were a couple of areas where the art Otel could improve We stayed for 3 nights and the 2nd 3rd days the room was not replenished properly We had to request to have new toilet rolls and coffee making facilities The food in the 5 33 restaurant was average to be generous I had pasta that was so Al dented it was almost crunchy Breakfast was also terrible The eggs and bacon were tepid as was the coffee But the fruit salad yoghurt and pastries were lovely, Hotel was very modern and stylish and room was beautiful Hotel was in a great location opposite the station and only a few minutes walk from all the sights of Amsterdam The bar in the hotel was very cool and played a great selection of house music The gym and swimming facilities were very nice indeed 
419191,art otel Amsterdam, Only complaint is the poor bathroom lighting for make up , Incredibly warm and helpful multi lingual staff made it easy to score hard to get museum tickets tram passes and restaurant suggestions Central Station location put us on every tram line with ease Spacious room creative artwork and a great hotel restaurant

419194,art otel Amsterdam, Having a room in the first floor meant you got to hear all of Amsterdam in the streets outside the hotel and central station along with the hotel lounge and bar music on the weekend Enjoying some nice quiet sleep did not happen and sleeping in no way , restaurant and breakfast were very good
419195,art otel Amsterdam, Poor check in process badly located by front door Very slow and somewhat haphazard , Stylish and esoteric Central position and friendly staff

419199,art otel Amsterdam, eccentric lighting system in the bed room reading light setting more akin to search light mode sleep setting put out ALL light so to get to the bathroom in the night meant crossing the room to put on bathroom light should be at bedside , very convenient location across the road from the train station and near tram stops and canal cruise terminals staff very accommodating and helpful food very good but portions on the large side buffet breakfast excellent superb poached eggs
419200,art otel Amsterdam, Hotel is right beside tram tracks and outside rooms suffer from the noise of the trolley and busy road , Very helpful staff unique physical structure and decor very good breakfast

419204,art otel Amsterdam, The room size but was ok for two, I really loved the interior and the property in general I have to mention the friendly staff from the reception restaurant and house keeping I will defiantly choose art otel again and recommend it to others
