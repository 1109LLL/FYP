132593,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The lady who greeted us was a bit grumpy and not particularly welcoming This hotel doesn t have a car park but parking meters outside that you cannot park at for longer than 2 hours Be careful of the step outside the room as I fell down it on my way out and hurt my ankle , Fantastic location opposite Greenwich Market and a short walk from the Cutty Sark I liked the young man who let us in at 1am he was fab Helped us to our room and ensured everything was OK The cleaner was lovely really happy and smiley 
132594,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The room was clean and good size but curtains were dirty and ripped so that run down the look of the room Bathroom was very small and toilet right next to the bath so to get into the bath one had to move the shower screen There was a massive gap between the bath and tile work and when showering water must have been getting right underneath So a small investigation by a cleaner and maintenance by management would have Fix that , I liked the location and access 4 min walk from the Greenwich Pier Staff was friendly 
132595,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The windows are old so sometimes they slam shut plus it would of been handy to have a small hand soap Other than that brilliant place, Close to everything Even the river to catch a boat taxi to the 02 only 8 mins on there 4 each way I will be back at this place plus I will highly recommend it to friends who want to stay in Lindon
132596,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Pubs limited menu for a meal , We liked the location for the venue we were visiting and the area around is vibrant with lots of shops and pubs There is a residents lounge that stays open after pub had shut 
132597,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, needs updating on windows mirror needed on wall for drying and doing hair in bedroom bathroom shaver point not working all needs a little attention , good nights sleep good breakfast cooked if you wanted it pleasant bar with plenty of atmosphere
132598,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Breakfast would have been nice to have more selection , Very friendly and couldn t do enough for u location was brilliant Would definitely stay again 
132599,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Staff were rude young and inexperienced They couldn t give a monkeys if you re staying there or not Drink was not made correctly took it back and one staff member actually said you don t have to drink it if you don t like it Complained and the manager did make everything right in the end but it made for a very tense atmosphere Room was so hot no air con Came out of a cold shower and sweating immediately The burgers in the restaurant are expensive and don t even come with chips which is usually standard Only stayed here to be close to a music gig Luckily that was amazing which unfortunately this hotel was not , Location Pub decor and atmosphere Clean room Shower was nice Manager rectified a mistake 
132600,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, This booking was a complete disappointment The hotel is old and worn down with cracks in the walls and stained carpets Although I had requested a double bed I was given a room with two singles The desk clerk asserted I had received what I had requested despite being shown my email stating the contrary Accessing the hotel requires passing through the pub which is problematic when the pub is closed in the morning After leaving the hotel in the morning around 8 00 to go to an ATM I had to knock at the door and wait for the staff to let me back in The free wifi requires entering your mobile number and waiting for a code this doesn t work with a tablet or laptop We saw that the staff had attempted to acquire the code for another customer but the effort was not successful ,No Positive
132601,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The site states parking but when we got there there wasn t any The poor staff say it happens all the time and they have reported it but nothing gets changed We were very disappointed because I would of gone elsewhere I booked it because it said parking We had to park in another hotel and pay 20 Not happy at all to mess around,No Positive
132602,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, Location was perfect for cutty sark and tubes to o2 arena The romm was bigger then expected and very clean Had to sleep with the window open has it was a warm night but wasnt too busy outside considering the location so had a great nights sleep
132603,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The carpet in the room The carpet on the stairs going up to the room , The staff were super friendly and helpful The did their utmost to ensure we enjoyed our stay 
132604,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, The room was spacious by London standards There was plenty space for my children to potter about The bathrooms were renovated well with a separate toilet which works well with so many people in a room The continental breakfasts were served in a charming pub with a garden conservatory that lifted the spirits in the morning The breakfast fare was sufficient to postcode is with the energy for exporting the city The venue is central to Greenwich with options to walk to Greenwich park Greenwich observatory and planetarium Maritime museum and the Cutty Sark It is also near the DLR station running to London The room has a fan for hot summer days and the windows open for fresh air The beds were comfortable The pub downstairs had entertainment for weekends which they did warn us about I rested well anyway after a hard day s walking in London In addition the building is a historical UNESCO recognised site and borders a historical church I thoroughly enjoyed the visit Historical practical perfect for my trip 
132605,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, As it s a pub it stays noisy till late The wifi was terrible the breakfast ok but nothing to get up for , This is a lovely pub with nice rooms in an excellent location 
132606,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, We stayed on the top floor and the water pressure wasn t very good at all Sort of to be expected in an old building but wasn t ideal Also the bath was sloped at both ends which made it very difficult to get under the water A bit strange on our first morning Breakfast was until 9 30 and continental buffet We arrived at 9 25 to be told we were too late A bit odd although we explained we d just pick up what we wanted in 2 minutes and was fine , Great location In the heart of Greenwich very close to Cutty Sark DLR Easy to get to central London Building is great and the room was big enough and well appointed Staff were friendly and helpful Good choice for breakfast although pretty ordinary cereals toast etc 
132607,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The room was shabby The room was too bright in the morning Thicker curtains required , the location was good and the staff were nice The bed was very comfortable 
132608,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The shower leaked from the top which was higher than the shower door so the bathroom was soaked by the time I got out of the shower One of the curtains was hanging off the rail so we couldn t close it properly and when the room was serviced in the morning the curtain was not put back up One of the windows slid shut every time we opened it which was a bit of a nightmare as it was a particularly hot couple of days It could also cause an injury, The room was nice and big and the bed was comfy
132609,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, We really cannot complain The only small annoyance for us was getting luggage to and from the rooms which are laid out in an odd way Although there is a small lift to rooms once on room level the short corridors with self closing fire doors and short stairs dividing individual hallways make it a bit more challenging to drag luggage through This is not a huge deal and cannot be helped due to the age design of the building 1840 Only a teeny inconvenience for such a lovely stay , Enjoyed our stay at the Inn so much we changed our plans and went back for two more nights for the last remaining part of our trip The pub on main floor is marvellous The building is historic and has got loads of character The decor atmosphere in pub is really nice quirky interesting and comfy There are three main eating drinking social areas two of which are outdoors We really loved it Staff is WONDERFUL very friendly kind and accommodating Another great thing about this place is the location in Greenwich It is close to EVERYTHING the awesome Markets are within a stone s throw and many shops and restaurants can be found in the immediate vicinity The Thames waterfront Cutty Sark and the Clipper boats that one can catch to ride up and down river to various sights important historic sites points of interest is a very short and pleasant walk from the Innkeepers Lodge Mitre We got to the Innkeeper s Lodge Greenwich by taking the train from Gatwick airport to New Cross Gate then hiring a taxi for the relatively short ride from the station to the hotel Fantastic 
132610,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, No wifi No phone in room No one on reception often Not welcoming The name on building says The Mitre not Innkeepers lodge I said that evening I am booked to say here in 2 weeks time and I hsve already paid but I dont want to come back could I have my money back and young woman said no manager not here The only low light on my first trip to UK Ireland and Europe A brillint trip other than my 2 nights at Innkeepers lodge The Mitre ,No Positive
132611,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The staff offer only minimum communication The decor is a little tired The room was uncomfortably warm however a fan was provided Didn t sleep very well due to traffic noise and heat Wouldn t stay here again , Plenty to eat at the buffet breakfast 
132612,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The corridoors and rooms have not been updated in a long time , Ensuite bathrooms were lovely and modern Breakfast was ok It was fine to rest your head for one night 
132613,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The lack of Air conditioning it was absolutely unbearable in the room the only saving grace was we had 2 windows and both could be opened fully but it did mean we had the noise of the road below all night long , staff fantastic and location amazing really easy to get to and very good for the Cutty Sark lots of nice cafes around also really good breakfast provided and a lovely looking pub nice conservatory area overall a really lovely place I would definitely stay there again just not in hot weather see below 
132614,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Need more choice at breakfast air conditioning would be good and a mini fridge in the room would have been great , Good location friendly staff comfortable rooms close to the dlr and plenty of restaurants nearby 
132615,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Having to go i love Greenwich , Loved my stay staff are so friendly place is lovely for a building 100 years old Felt like a local will be back for sure Beds are so comfy 
132616,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, rooms were very warm and unable to leave window open due to traffic noise but they did provide a fan water very slow from bath taps so it took a while to fill up bath , close to tube station rooms are reasonably size especially for price paid in london rooms were clean and bed very comfortable small fridge in room which was handy to put cold drinks into had lunch that was excellent roast dinner and good value for price near to shops resturants and bars museums and places of interest close by 
132617,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The hotel is in same building as The Mitre pub but only a very small sign outside said so which is easy to miss Stairs were narrow steep and twisty spiral Thankfully there was a small lift All of the hotel admin was done in the noisy and crowded pub Breakfast was also in the pub and was only Continental style with no option of cooked alternative even at extra cost Wifi didn t work at all not even in public areas , Good location for Greenwich sightseeing Bed was comfortable and room was clean 
132618,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The internet were not working , The room was clean and a view of the road through the window The staff were good and we liked it what we did not like there was no internet they said they were having problems with it we would go back again but when the internet is put right 
132619,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Our room was above the beer garden and was very very noisey even with the window closed No telephone in room and room quite small Despite this would stay again , The location was fantastic Really close to all the main atteactions 
132620,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, Excellent location for cocert at the Old Royal Naval College Quiet room with large comfortable bed Nice to have a fan as it was a warm weekend The pub downstairs served lovely meals which was really convenient A good continental buffet breakfast was included in the price Would definitely stay there again 
132621,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Actual pub part of the building is fine but the bedrooms are dire Very shabby staircase with stained carpet scuffed battered paintwork gives a really poor impression when going up to the rooms Carpets are bad throughout and need changing as a matter of urgency Rooms are OK minimalist with shabby cheap furniture grubby looking curtains and ill fitting net curtains at least in the two rooms we saw Bed was comfortable but pillows are cheap and need replacing There are also plumbing issues apparently let s hope our experience was a one off Generally in need of refurbishment and some money spending on it Could be great as the location is fab , Great location Close to DLR shops bars restaurants Greenwich park Cutty Sark Observatory etc 
132622,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Breakfast could do with some improvement but was sufficient enough to set you up for a day of sightseeing in London , Hotel was in a good location with a number of very nice restaurants and pubs close by 
132623,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The baths are quite short and unfortunately the plug in our room didn t seal properly The window in the bedroom didn t stay open unless wedged but this is an old property and has a quirky staircase too , The Hotel is in a great location with friendly staff and serves good pub food The toiletries in the rooms are fantastic with a lovely fragrance 
132624,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The room was comfortable but a bit tired and needed a really good clean bathroom fan was very very noisy, Staff very pleasant and helpful location excellent public areas great
132625,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, nothing, Brilliant stay lovely quiet area of London and just around the corner from the DLR so easy to get around London Will definitely stay here again 
132626,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, No hot water in the morning and it was a bit difficult to find initially as it only says Innkeeper s Lodge on a door plate That though could be sorted in the address on the site just add The Mitre , The room was spacious and at the rear so with view of the church and very little traffic noise A very good position right in the centre of Greenwich 
132627,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The free wifi was not available to me as I did not have an English number As per the pictures on the website I had been told I could choose a cooked breakfast but this was not the case, The staff are extremely friendly and despite being over a pub is a calm and quiet room hotel
132628,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, I thought the lift was very old and cranky I don t like lifts but the winding stairs were too much for me and my luggage as I was on the top floor , The single bedroom was adequate for me and the location was just where i wanted to be in Greenwich 
132629,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The wifi connection didn t work Also it was noisy from the bar downstairs especially the DJ noise between 8pm 10pm , We like the size of the room it was spacious This was perfect for us with a family of four people Also the included breakfast was good 
132630,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, that gorgeous stairway could be a problem for guests with a lot of luggage, love the garden seating with view of St Alphege Church good sense of place and history in a lovely old building yet the bedroom was unfussy and roomy for a single with a totally modern shower room for creature comforts 
132631,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, I stayed here with a friend when attending the Iron Maiden gig at the O2 which was a 20 min bus ride away so excellent location for the O2 The room was clean tidy the bed was very comfortable It was extremely warm so the fan we found was a bonus Free Continental breakfast is included but we upgraded to the cooked breakfast which was delicious worth the extra The staff were all very friendly helpful I would definitely stay here again 
132632,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The shower could have been more powerful also the toilet paper was rough There was also a problem with the WIFI, The beds were very comfortable a fan was also provided which was great as the weather was really warm and we were on the 3rd floor which seemed extra warm The location of the hotel was also great only a short walk to the River Thames which we did a lot of our travelling by 
132633,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Shower pressure and heat of the room but it had been warm for the week prior Drains in bathroom smelt a fair bit Bath plug didnt fit bath, There was a fan in the room essential Location was great Good price for a London overnight stay
132634,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Wifi did not connect automatically could not be bothered to go 3 floors down to ask why as no phone in room Was not mentioned in booing that breakfast was simple cereal and toast Extra charge for cooked breakfast No AC in room and it was almost unbearable on the third floor on the hottest day of the year even with 2 fans running all night and the windows open Took nearly 10 minutes for hot water to start running in the shower , Excellent staff attitude Great location After changing room once due to faulty tv eventually some comfort was achieved 
132635,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, We were right above the pub that was a bit noisy some nights Some smoke could come in the room from the downstairs outdoor seating if we left the window open, Our room was spacious breakfast was good The location was convenient to mass transit and far enough from downtown London to be a bit more relaxing 
132636,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, This was NOT a 4 star hotel at all 3 star at the most The building was very old and the floor was squeaky Breakfast was minimal Location was noisy , Decoration
132637,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Shower was a bit of a let down not very powerful , The room was clean good size for two of us Bathroom was nice too The staff were amazing really friendly helpful Breakfast was great too coffee and croissants were a perfect start to the day Hotel is easy walking distance to DLR bus stops the clipper making it really easy to get into the centre of London Would definitely stay here again 
132638,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Would help if the pub name THE MITRE was named in the listing as we walked past this place twice looking for a pub called INNKEEPERS LODGE not knowing that was a hotel chain Showerhead was lose and had no power and you could not stand under it due to the slope on the bath basin mixer was stiff and once again had no water pressure Yoghurt Cheese Ham should have been available for Continental breakfast, Location size of room size of the bed
132639,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, if the Windows were double glazed it would have helped with the outside noise but we expect noise when staying in central London, The room was well equipped and the bathroom was massive for London Bonus having the Mitre for drinks chill out fab place
132640,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Nothing, Non chain place with its own character Friendly staff good breakfast perfect for Greenwich and all the attractions Cutty Sark Royal Observatory so much here 
132641,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The name over the door and the name on the booking were different Bit confusing, Family room was very spacious and comfortable Would definitely consider it again 
132642,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Obviously it s pricey but then it s London and nothing decent is cheap For a twin room over a bank holiday weekend the price was acceptable , The twin room was nothing special but it wasn t cramped and it was clean and tidy The buffet breakfast was very nice with plenty on offer The rooms whilst over a pub with live music didn t suffer from a lot of noise which was great The staff were friendly and helpful they let us leave bags as we were early for check in and also on leaving day when we wanted to wander unencumbered for a few hours before our train The position of the pub was great a 5 minute walk to the DLR and all the great sites in Greenwich 
132643,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, It was noisy could use double glazing but we were warned about the live music so our choice in the end, The location cannot be better Literally a couple of minutes walk to everything including the post office markets restaurants Cutty Sark and Royal Observatory
132644,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Clearly advertises there is parking when you book this hotel This was the only reason I booked this place only to have travelled 2 and half miles to be told we would have to park on the street and pay for it Towel rail in the room is scolding hot Also says breakfast included If you re expecting a hot meal before you leave you will be disappointed as all there were was unwashed fruit cereal and crossaints , Had dinner on the evening there which was a good portion 
132645,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The Person i spoke to on the phone when u wanted to check in was unhelpful and cut me off twice, Location and good value for money Even had any elevator that was great for not struggling down a narrow step staircase with bags
132646,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, No clue how the wifi worked it said in the guest info book that you had to text to get a code or something to connect to the private wifi but there was only a free wifi service available Not sure if that was a change made after the info book was printed but the wifi sucked regardless Good thing London has excellent 4G Not that much of a drawback for only a one night stay , Honestly for a hotel in this area and for it s given price it was absolutely fantastic The staff were all lovely and despite there being a bar there was still a lovely friendly atmosphere at all times of the day Would definitely book here again if we needed another night in London 
132647,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Nothing, Excellent location for Greenwich with everything in walking distance Also great for our concert at the O2 just a short bus 188 bus ride away 
132648,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Think as a guest there could be an applied discount to the food in the bar as it wasn t very competitive with other eating places around the area and could be more encouraging especially for families The food is still good though , Good point to explore London from but also in a historical area which was interesting and picturesque with the view from the Observatory
132649,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, We had a wonderful stay here we could nt believe how big the room was so clean and the bed was super comfy The breakfast was yummy best croissants I ve had and the staff couldn t have been more helpful Thank you 
132650,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Breakfast could have a little more variety in terms of fruit and yoghurt flavours but that s just being picky really , So clean and comfortable and the staff are always very friendly and helpful The location is perfect for exploring Greenwich but also central London with transport links within walking distance 
132651,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, There were 4 of us staying here but only had 3 of everything towels mugs etc Not nice to have to ask staff for extra towels and mugs , Room was beautiful Staff are friendly This is the second time we ve stayed at this location and wouldn t stay anywhere else when we visit London 
132652,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The name of the hotel thank goodness I looked it up before we travelled as the pub is called The Mitre no mention of Innkeepers Lodge beware , Lovely bright room Breakfast more than adequate 
132653,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, We booked two twin rooms as we had an all male party and required two single beds in each room but we got one room with a double bed and one room with a single bed This wasn t acceptable and spoiled what could have been an excellent review , The hotel was good and the location was excellent but the rooms were not what we booked See below No problems with service cleanliness etc 
132654,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Would have liked to see one person who was delegated to looking after Hotel customers during the evening had to scream very loudly at a bar member to acquire extra milk for the room which was handed to me in a mug errr A little off putting when you are charging top rate prices , Typical vintage Inn style accommodation over a busy pub The room was in need of some tlc curtains rehanging and carpets look tired etc But despite this the room was large everything you needed and the bed was extremely comfortable We asked for a quiet room it certainly was a live band played until the early hours we didn t hear any of this Breakfast was Continental very basic and this could be made more wholesome with some ham and cheese which is typical of a European style breakfast as not a lot of choice I would look elsewhere for rooms but if there was little choice would stay again if I had to 
132655,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Nothing bad to report, The mitre pub Innkeepers Lodge is situated close to all local amenities street parking or the Ibis hotel opposite you can use on a first come first basis and charge 20 for 24 hours The accommodation it s self is lovely and d cor is very interesting with lots of different clocks it s in Greenwich after all so very apt We stayed in room 103 for just one night because of work and I would say that this was probably the smallest but it was well equipped with soaps and shampoos teas and coffee with views of the high street and each window dressed with lovely flower boxes The staff are very friendly and the food was very good I would stay again and would recommend to friends and family 
132656,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Very noisy Woken up by cleaners in the pub downstairs being unnecessarily noisy They should have been more thoughtful of the guests , Great location Friendly staff 
132657,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Room very warm and had to sleep with window open which allowed some traffic noise but still managed good nights sleep Good breakfast Would stay again, Very central location Easy to find from D L R Comfy bed 
132658,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, The bed was comfy the room nice and big nice bathroom Friendly staff helpful as well Breakfast was adequate the pub was lovely live music was nice too It stopped at 11 so we were not disturbed at all Lovely atmosphere to the place 
132659,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Room 203 was a bit small compared to rooms shown on Internet Room was comfortable and clean though so all OK , Buffet breakfast good Ate dinner on arrival mid evening excellent meal and good atmosphere 
132660,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, Friendly staff and great location Basic accommodation but OK Characterful hotel They really should make it clearer that there is actually a hotel called the Innkeepers on top of the Mitre 
132661,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Staff were not very chatty and particular the bar staff were a little rude was told the pub below stayed open until 11 30 we arrived back at 10 55 to find they had shut all the tills and wouldn t serve , Nice location took boat taxi to o2 just a 10 minute walk down the road 
132662,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, My room was facing the street and the window was not soundproof like at all Definitely get a room which is not facing the street , Very good value for money location is superb 3 mins from DLR lots of great restaurants in the area Room was quite spacious in regards to UK standards Breakfast was very good as well Pub downstairs is not an issue no noise no smell which was a pleasant surprise 
132663,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The shower is very weak making it difficult to wash hair I had to get a jug from the bar The lady behind the bar told us it was because everyone else was using the water at the same time I showered at different times throughout our 4 night stay and there was no difference There was also no light bulb in one of the bedside lamps Noisey as the hotel is on the main road and beside the trainline , Great location and fairly clean Hotel is a little run down but for this price in Greenwich it was expected Breakfast was basic continental however hot breakfast could be ordered with an additional fee 
132664,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, All was very good but the rooms at the front of the property are noisy due to the road noise If you want to open the window then this is even worse The only way this can be sorted is by installing double glazing , Breakfast was nicely laid out and the pub interior is beautiful The staff were very pleasant and the room was very clean and modern 
132665,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Although the hotel was in a lovely area and near to Greenwich centre It was noisy I understand that the building is most probably listed and the windows were single glazed because of this I was also aware when I booked that the bar would be noisy this wasn t an issue as we arrived late Sorry , The room where breakfast was served was interesting quirky and atmospheric 
132666,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The common ways especially the lift and stair carpet were a disgrace worn out and dirty The whole place is tired , Very helpful staff and very pleasant 
132667,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, I love the Staff they are helpful cheerful we were exteremely tired when we arrived we were helped with a suitcase The building is old but the interior is renewed i recommend it with all my heart lovely breakfast 
132668,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The complete building needs redecorating and updating it all looked a little shabby , It was the perfect location for seeing Greenwich as being right in the centre of all you wanted to see and for London it was reasonably priced 
132669,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, No croissants left at breakfast Plug didn t fit the bath in room 202 so water runs away before you can have a bath , Good value for money Friendly and helpful staff great location nice pub 
132670,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, The property is fine but finding it is a problem as Booking com call it The Inn Keeper s Lodge but the is NO sign that says that outside the property it is infact called The Mitre a pub Fortunately I had the address with me the picture wasn t great but I was able to finally find it however I would like to recommend that somewhere on the listing of this bed and breakfast it is also called the Mitre then it is easier to find Its a great location 
132671,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, I found our room unsatisfactory due to us having a leaky shower which meant we could not relax in there We also did not have any lights that worked which was a difficulty when we got back in the night , The breakfast was great as there was plenty to choose from and the location was also a bonus for us 
132672,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Was a 4 star hotel but Had a burnt iron mark on the carpet paint flaking off the wall by the window Lots of chips in the bath enamel Didn t really seem a 4 star hotel But was good value for money , Breakfast was good plenty of choice in the continental selection Really close to DLR and good Bus routes Lovely big towels Staff friendly 
132673,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Breakfast consists of coffee croissants corn flakes etc OK for me but if you like cooked stuff ham eggs etc are not included in the free buffet Not very good wi fi You connect via O2 network not sure if it works with all foreign phones , The hotel is on top of a pub but not much problem with the noise after 11 PM or so Greenwich is 40 min away of central London by metro but the area is nice Greenwich market bars shops park observatory etc Bathroom in very good condition 
132674,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Confusing reception having to ask staff behind the bar Very tatty decor in bedroom net curtains had holes in and were split Very noisy in the night coming from outside area as it was as pub had shut it sounded like possibly could be the bar staff I was on 3rd floor with room that looked at the church but could hear them shouting and laughing until nearly midnight Wish the windows had been double glazed then I wouldn t have minded how long the partied The shower room was very small and the shower door meant u had to stand under shower as it turned on with really cold water no possibility of allowing it to warm up before you stood under water Only mirror in room was in bathroom which means if u want to use hairdryer then bring an extension lead There is a perfect spaces for mirror above the unit in bedroom so don t know why there isn t one The lift is very noisy and shudders when stopping also the doors stick partially open before opening properly which was off putting , Clean basic accommodation The staff were helpful The bed was comfortable The food in the pub was really good The continental breakfast was fine with really nice croissants The location was really close to everything we wanted to do in Greenwich and ideal for our visit to O2 
132675,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The room was stiflingly hot we could not turn the radiator down Opening the window meant we got almost no sleep after 4am as the street outside was very busy and incredibly noisy HGV noise train hooters waste lorries The noisiest location I have ever encountered Perhaps some fitted air con might help for rooms facing the road Our friend s room was at the back and seemed much quieter The bathroom was clean but the shower was underpowered and barely a trickle and the shower head adjustment broken so that you had to origami yourself to get wet , Nice breakfast in pleasant surroundings with a lot of flexibility on timings Able to leave bags while we went out for the last day which was appreciated Help with getting taxi etc Location very handy with lots of interesting things to look at The bedroom was a good size well furnished King size bed was nice to find 
132676,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The information on Booking com about breakfast included in the room price was somewhat misleading What is offered free is of limited choice If one wishes English or Continental breakfast they are served on offer and charged additionally , Perfect location convenient public transport very clean warm and tidy kind and helpful staff It was a nice surprise to learn that the building was on the UNESCO Heritage list 
132677,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The bed was rock hard No mirror in room Room was dusty Staff wasn t that friendly Would not rate at a 4 star and do not feel the place is worth a 4 star I feel with it being a 4 star should not of had to pay more for a cooked breakfast, The view
132678,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, WiFi simply not available Had been advertised as free WiFi but a leaflet in the room said it was only available to UK phones When we queried this with staff they said oh yes we coukd get it but after no further success for us they said it s an outside provider and we cannot control it it s a busy weekend Greenwich was very busy but the WiFi was a major reason why we had chosen to stay there We were travelling and needed the Internet for many reasons , Room really clean Very good shower Staff very nice
132679,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, nothing at all , The bed was extra comfy We had a bit of an issue with the hot water on our first day but it was soon fixed The breakfast is everything you could want either cooked or continental and the location was within easy reach of everything we could want Loved it 
132680,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The hotel is old and not quite up to today s standards but ok as a budget alternative for a few days Possibly it s a four star Inn and pub but I would rate it as a two star comparing to regular hotel standards so it did not quite live up to my expectations , It is nice to stay in Greenwich A bit to travel to central city but very nice to return to a more quiet area in the afternoon after a long day of sightseeing and shopping in the busy streets of central London Nice to have a classic English pub in the same building No noise problems at least on the third floor 
132681,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The lift was very scruffy, The staff were great and helpful and cheerful despite a very busy weekend being Easter and tall ships visit The location for the museums river and Greenwich park was super The fish and chips in the pub were as good as the famous Whitby ones where I live Well done chef 
132682,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The breakfast The food was very basic with cheap orange juice and croissants The lady in charge of the breakfast was quite miserable When we asked for a table to be cleared we then had to ask again for it to be cleaned on both days It was not that there were lots of people there for breakfast The coffee was cold on the second day but was afraid to ask for more Was going to order the full breakfast at extra cost but after seeing the continental breakfast decided not to bother , The room was light and airy overlooked the church with nice white sheets and towels It was clean although the carpets in stairs and hallways could do with a clean I think our room had been newly decorated which was nice 
132683,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Bed clothes condition of hallways stairs and lift Poor lighting in bathroom due to faulty light fittings also in sixteen other w rooms according to staff , Location
132684,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The shower whilst clean on the tiles and tray was black with damp mould around the shower tray and between the tiles where there should have been clean grouting There was no bulb in the light over the bathroom mirror which did not please my wife On returning from visiting the local attractions at about 6 30 pm on the 13 04 2017 we wished to shower and go out for dinner however on attempting to use the shower we found there was no hot waster coming through this we found to be the same for the tap on the bathroom sink We reported this to the manager who advised she would investigate We were therefore unable to shower or wash prior to going out for dinner On our return at approx 10 00 pm we found the situation with the hot water to be unchanged we once again spoke with the manager who advised us that there was a problem with the boiler which she did not understand After much discussion and she making a phone call the her manager we were advised that the hotel did not have 24 hour maintenance support and the issue would not be resolved until tomorrow We advised that we found this unacceptable We had not been able to wash or shower the whole of the evening we would have to go to bed washing with cold water and there was to be no hot water when we arose in the morning to allow us to shower The manager advised she had a bar to run and could not help us any more her manager would see us in the morning to speak about compensation she did provide us with a complementary drink I find the fact that a hotel of this nature has no out of hours maintenance support to be totally unacceptable To leave guest for of fourteen hours without hot water to bathe cannot be justified My wife and I arose in the morning had a cold wash breakfast and then instead of enjoying our planned day at the Tall Ships festival drove home to Northamptonshire in order that we could shower and clean ourselves properly , The property was well located for our visit to the Tall Ships Festival and other local attractions The food was excellent and breakfast very good The pub staff were friendly and helpful 
132685,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Staff could have been more attentive on service in the bar Was ignored for locals twice Once I had the attention of the young male barman not in that way he was young enough to be my grandson all was well for the rest of the evening, Comfortable room and excellent continental breakfast Easy walking distance from the sites Greenwich has to offer Evening food was OK but portions were not exactly generous This pub was where my Great Grandfather was landlord in 1901 so it made it extra special It is a Grade II listed building so some original features still remain
132686,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Could be more warmly decorated and need to fix the rattle on the ceiling light , Best firm but nice room very bare and functional Had a hairdryer which pleased my wife and saved on luggage Great location to explore Greenwich and no noise on 3 rd floor exercise up narrow staircase or use an ancient lift 
132687,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, We left our suit case with the staff in the morning before check in and they couldn t find the case for 10 15 minutes when we came to check in at 3pm They may need to review how and where they store luggage it was a tense 10 15 minutes for all of us , Felt like good value for money for a London B B staff were pleasant 
132688,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Free wifi was very limited Could generally not get it to work , Convenient location great restaurants nearby Continental breakfast was adequate
132689,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, The Inn is a Pub too Situated opposite the Greenwich Picture house near brilliant market restaurants and close to O2 Cutty Sark river bus too City centre The Inn is full of character Really
132690,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, the windows do not close properly they are old sash windows which is understandable however on a busy corner it was quite noisy and a little chilly at one point , This is London so we are always going to pay over the odds for hotels however for a change this hotel has lovely sized rooms I ended up with a family room due to late booking but the room was massive If you stayed in here with kids they had loads of running around space The bathroom and toilet separate were both updated and clean The staff were super friendly from check in to leaving Breakfast was OK for me cereals hot flaky croissants juice fruit proper coffee etc and I took it to my room to have while getting ready with no problem I noticed people eating on the afternoon of arrival and the food looked good although I didn t partake The hotel is a few minutes walk to the tube and there is a good variety of shops around 
132691,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Bed settee mattress could have been thicker although not always possible with foldaway design or a soft topper mattress provided for on top , Superb location in Greenwich with good public transport nearby shops restaurants weekly markets Simple continental breakfast eat as much as you need Had an evening meal once too tasty good value locally Good competitive room rates We were able to drop bags there just kept behind bar not 100 so at your own risk as in most similar places valuables we kept with us prior to check in amble around Greenwich Would stay again when we re next in London 
132692,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Only slight niggles they need to update their description online as there was no hairdryer in either room and the entire hotel is non smoking , The location was superb and the staff were very friendly 
132693,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, This shouldn t be listed with parking It s non existent and is street parking on a meter if you can find a place Where do I start The entrance was locked forcing us to enter with luggage through a busy bar The receptionist was unhelpful and didn t mention wifi or breakfast The lift Is filthy dirty black with grime The room Was blazing hot the windows didn t open properly they are sash and slam down when opened The wifi doesn t reach the room The room itself How this property ever got a 4 rating is totally beyond me More like non star rated The room is much more basic than anything I ve ever stayed in The shower controls are fiddly un user friendly and it was hopeless trying to get a decent temperature The shower head is not detachable and fixed miles above head height so the useless spray is even more useless because you can t detach it and bring it closer The free bath gel dispenser was broken Breakfast Poor selection Not a coffee machine only old coffee being kept hot in jugs The morning receptionist was pleasant compared to the night staff Never again, Nothing I will never stay here again
132694,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The included continental breakfast comprised of cereal and toast Hardly continental The cooked breakfast at 8 95 was pretty good although there are plenty of better and cheaper breakfasts on offer just a short walk away , Location excellent and price reasonable The room was basic but clean and quiet so no complaints Saturday was live music night so beware if you plan on turning in early however it finished pretty much on time and the noise went away completely This is a pub after all so we didn t see this as a problem in fact I thought it was well managed The hotel is very close to the centre of Greenwich so restaurants transport and attractions are very easy to walk to O2 Arena is a 10 15 minute bus ride away but most of the other attractions are only a short walk away 
132695,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Only decaf coffee granules in the room and the maid didn t give us proper coffee even though we asked very small gripe But it was annoying No hair dryer in room but to be fair I didn t ask for one they may have them on request Pillows were thin but again we didn t ask for more so can t really complain as we didn t give them a chance to rectify it , Breakfast selection great fresh fruit cereal bread croissants yogurt juices brewed coffee Room very clean bathroom really nice and shower was good Fridge provided was handy Staff were friendly and an all night porter for getting in after hours was great 
132696,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Nothing , Excellent location staff very friendly easy to get around London on bus and dlr lines could not fault stay already booked for next March 2018 
132697,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Exactly what I expected No comment, Location perfect for my purpose visiting Greenwich Comfort quite good for this class of hotel Very friendly staff Typical British atmosphere 
132698,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, Everything was excellent Could not ask for anymore from the staff the breakfast the room the location was great for us as we was going to the 02 arena 
132699,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The main name on the pub location is actually The Mitre not the Innkeeper s Lodge can make it a bit difficult to find in the dark Wifi a bit inconsistent but ok , Stayed here for location relatively close to the O2 options for direct bus or rail via DLR Tube Clean and comfortable
132700,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The breakfast could have been better It was next to nothing No harm in adding at least boiled eggs , Very conveniently located walking distance to the University and the train stations Friendly staff members even allowed us a late check out The room was spacious and well lit 
132701,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, Have visited this hotel twice previously but a little disappointed this time Decor becoming a bit tired and grubby bathroom full of mildew and so easily could be got rid of 
132702,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The window was draughty when closed it was a very windy night The shower had very little pressure , Lovely continental breakfast but nothing gluten free Very comfy bed 
132703,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Wi fi a struggle, Good choice at breakfast Staff obtained soya milk within 15 minutes when I requested it even though they had run out they shopped for more 
132704,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Instructions to find are not very clear , Lively pub on ground floor but not audible in our room Good breakfast Very close to maritime museum and cutty sark and short taxi ride to O2
132705,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, The room was quiet clean and comfortable It was also big enough for two people The position was ideal for us And the food at the pub was excellent 
132706,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, We arrived at night and it was snowing the pub is called the Mitre it was not immediately apparent that we had arrived at the hotel Fortunately Google told us we had definitely arrived There was a warm welcome inside , A unique place to stay old world but with all the amenities that you need Bed very comfortable good choice for breakfast Staff friendly and helpful
132707,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, No toilet brushes and low water pressure in the shower which had a fixed shower head that sprayed water past the glass door to shower bath , beautiful restaurant pub right underneath the Mitre with great food sunday roast and quiz night MUST try sticky toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream very friendly staff location smack in the middle of Greenwich very close to DLR and buses 
132708,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, No wifi unless you have a uk mobile Access hotel through busy pub No food room service unless you go down to eat in very busy pub No interior painting for a very very very long time No answer from reception before 9am Very unhelpful disinterested and rude receptionist on evening shift Name of hotel hidden and does not look like photo on booking com,No Positive
132709,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, I would have liked a cooked breakfast but this didn t seem to be on offer so I didn t bother to get up in time for breakfast but overall the stay was really good and I would recommend staying here , The room was very spacious and clean The bed was comfortable The location was very good with lots of restaurants and pubs near by and a pub downstairs the staff were kind and helpful Also it was really close to the tube station so really easy to get to Really enjoyed our stay and hope to visit again soon 
132710,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The live music was loud but we were clearly pre warned so wouldn t have complained But would make room not suitable for younger children Also smokers from pub below stood under our window and we had smoke coming in, Booked as a family room for 2 adults and 2 older children Got twin beds and a really cronky sofa bed Not good especially as they emailed before and asked about beds expected 
132711,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, There isn t anthing i didnt like , The bed was huge I could star fish and my partner did not even know that was was busy star fishing Lovely room with exposed beams The staff were amazing 
132712,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Maybe a throw on the bed or extra blanket for warmth, Location was perfect staff were lovely and room was quiet even tho there is a busy pub below with live music 
132713,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Plug for bath was to small Water ran out of bath as it filled Radiator in bathroom didnt work Bedside lights positioned so high you haddd to get out of bed to turn them off , Breakfast very good
132714,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The mattresses were like cardboard on top of a sprung mattress pretty uncomfortable compared with some hotel beds The windows are lovely single glazed sashes it s probably a Grade 2 listed but secondary double glazing would mean that the traffic wasn t in the room with you And the curtains didn t have black out material so the room was full of orange light all night from the street in addition to the green light from the exit sign over the door All in all it was a great pity especially as my daughter had an important audition the following morning and I had hoped she would arrive for it refreshed Too many corners cut by the owners on what could otherwise have been a very enjoyable night that would have led to repeat custom Apparently we are not the only guests to have remarked on the poor night time light exclusion but no action has been taken , The staff were extremely helpful and friendly the pub was pretty and welcoming with all the little Christmas lights the breakfast was attractively presented and the croissants were indeed delicious 
132715,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Unfortunately I didn t have a very good experience with one of the bar staff and having been ignored whilst waiting to be served I challenged him however he was totally oblivious and clearly not bothered by the fact that I had told him he had ignored me and served 3 separate people Instead he just said what do you want me to do about it , Easy access to trains and nice being part of a pub which served very good food A very spacious family room too 
132716,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, As we travelled with a 6 year old the noise of a nighttime was a little loud however we did expect noise as the rooms are over a pub and it did not stop my son from sleeping, Room was spacious and well equipped The shower was very powerful the breakfast was more than adequate and the location was great for our trip 
132717,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, With imagination the Breakfast could just about be classed as Continental however the welcome at breakfast was Luke warm at best the replenishment of items poor and the clearing of tables almost non existent those that were cleared of plates were not wiped , The location was good from a tourist point of view There was a caution prior to booking with regards street noise and live music 
132718,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The bedroom was very bland very disappointing as it didn t live up to its potential Bar staff were friendly once one of them would serve you Breakfast was awful overpriced and it even turned up with no bacon , The building and bar were its best features a beautiful old building it was in a good location
132719,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Room was great as we just needed to sleep however it s due for a refurbishment and we wouldn t have liked it to have been colder weather with the window which didn t close fully and the bathroom radiator not working , Great location helpful staff great breakfast
132720,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Room was old dirty with worn out furniture and had a terrible smell like a dirty drain it was so bad i had to asked for another room which was equally old and worn out dingy but at least it didn t smell like a bad drain,No Positive
132721,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, Lovely large bed Ideally placed for Docklands Light Railway and Thames ferries Breakfast was simple but sufficient and well cooked Good for the O2 
132722,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Cold meat cheese would have made the continental breakfast just perfect The window in bedroom need dble glazing to keep the sound of the train out The lift was rather shabby , Nice large firm bed Spacious room 
132723,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, A long way out of London CBD Its an old pub and typical pub rooms Its on a very budy road and you get lots of traffic noise Windows are old and not double glazzed Tiny tv Its a Last resort place to stay , Bathroom was new and clean Plenty hot wster 
132724,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, I would suggest changing the shower bathtub handle It is fixed to the wall high up so I found that every time I wanted to have a shower I would have to adjust my body position or the shower head itself so that the water wouldn t reach everywhere drenching the floor A hand held shower head would be much comfier especially for those of us who don t want to get our hair wet , We really enjoyed our stay at The Mitre The staff were very kind and helpful Breakfast was just right they served toast fruit croissants cereal juice tea milk coffee etc They also offered pub meals We had drinks and dinner there the last night and they were really worth it The area makes a change from the crowded noisy centre of London with a 3 minute walk away from the Cutty Sark DLR station They also allowed us to keep our luggage there when we checked out so we could make the most of the morning before heading towards the airport I would definitely repeat our next stay here 
132725,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, they weren t able to print my boarding pass and didn t offer a substitute choice it was sunday and no internet caf was around , the location was fine and to have a pub down of your room is very nice 
132726,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Bathroom was mouldy the paint was flaking on the ceiling The w c took several minutes to refill There was little interaction from the young man checking us in The choices at breakfast were poor The bread was cheap sliced Fresh bread would have made such a difference , Large comfy bed Great location Fabulous bar 
132727,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Nothing everything was great, The location from the 02 arena was great just 10 in a taxi train station just 5 mins walk away hotel was fantastic really friendly helpful staff 
132728,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Unfortunately bathroom lights didn t work on arrival Staff were helpful and offered alternative room until fixed next day Then other lights in room didn t work This was a bit frustrating but didn t spoil an otherwise good stay , Great location right in centre of Greenwich Friendly helpful staff and comfortable beds Good value for this location 
132729,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, Perfect for the 02 We will use again Rooms good size beds comfortable and excellent shower and facilities generally Convenient for stations and ideal for central Greenwich did exactly what it said on the tin 
132730,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Because of the hotels historic value they are probably not allowed to change the windows for double glazed units The rooms at the front of the hotel are noisy because of passing traffic if you are a light sleeper , The staff were excellent Very friendly and helpful The hotel has lots of character and history and as fortunately not been over modernised and ruined The beds are comfortable and the rooms clean The continental breakfast included was also good The location is great for all the sites in Greenwich and close to public transport links into London Will definitely visit again 
132731,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Nothing really If I m being picky the room was at a little on the small side it was at the front of the building and had 2 extremely large windows on 2 sides which were not double glazed so the traffic did wake us early in the morning , Location to the 02 and exploring the lovely Greenwich Clean warm and hot water which is the most important A good continental breakfast and hot tea Would definitely return 
132732,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Wifi not so good in the evenings in the room some areas a little shabby, The room was clean and warm Bed was very comfy Breakfast was adequate and location of hotel great for sightseeing in Greenwich and visiting the o2 
132733,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Hard to keep window open Breakfast minimalistic , Comfortable spacious rooms with modern bathroom Clean Nice shampoo etc Excellent mattrass Perfect location Very close to the park tube and endless options for cafe s and restaurants 
132734,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Making espresso coffee cappuccino flat white etc available for breakfast instead of just ordinary filter coffee That meant we went and had breakfast elsewhere even though we had breakfast included in our rate No biggy though we are just coffee freaks , High ceilings and fan in the bedroom gave us a lovely cool and airy nights sleep Big bed Great location Generally a good experience and we would book again 
132735,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, For me personally a slightly better selection for the continental breakfast as I really like to have ham and cheese Even so the breakfast was adequate , Everything was really great The staff were very friendly and helpful 
132736,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Pillows a bit hard and lumpy but just a personal preference Staff were happy to change them for softer ones , Staff extremely friendly and helpful location is very convenient Good value for money 
132737,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The room was not very large or comfortable Very plain feel to it Breakfast was nothing special pretty standard continental breakfast , Great location in Greenwich Very busy and lively area short walk to Cutty Sark and multiple markets nearby The bar downstairs was nice good beers and food Friendly staff room was cleaned daily with no real issues Would stay here again 
132738,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, The Inn Keepers Lodge in Greenwich was a great hotel for our visit to the O2 The bus service to the O2 is frequent It s location is also excellent for the Cutty Sark Greenwich Park market and maritime museum all within walking distance The market on a Sunday is brilliant and makes the atmosphere in Greenwich really good We had a lovely Sunday lunch in The Mitre PH and joined in the quiz 
132739,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The windows are not double glazed so there is quite a bit of traffic noise , They gave us a lovely upgrade room we were very comfortable The breakfast is fine and the croissants were super The staff are very friendly and I would certainly go again 
132740,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The room we had was small with only enough room for one bedside The mattress on the double sized bed had seen better days Breakfast was unremarkable but fine , The location was great for access to all the tourist attractions of Greenwich Also easy transfer in to central London En suite was fine with good power shower All appeared to be clean 
132741,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, It looks like the bar is the primary business with the hotel lodge being more a side business if you want to check in you have to enter the pub and ask the Bartender its just a bit strange Its a bit too expensive for the room I got looking at the emergency plan I noticed I got the smallest room No bathtub in my room, The room was very clean The staff is friendly The bed was very comfortable Breakfast included and good enough
132742,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Radiator in bathroom didn t work and it was freezing Room 306 only had one mirror which is in the bathroom so my straighteners didn t reach Had this room a few times and it desperately needs a full length mirror by the door , Lovely big bed and nice bathroom
132743,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Not much to dislike except the fact that TV remote control didn t work room 107 I m sure they would have fixed it if we d mentioned it but as we didn t need the TV for our one night we didn t bother , Very helpful friendly staff and comfortable room Breakfast was a surprise as there was everything we needed 
132744,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, There was no dedicated check in so you have to go via the bar to access hotel reception and find someone but the staff don t seem trained in this so its all a bit bumpy No one told us about breakfast and we had to ask where our room was When it came to arriving back after a gig at the O2 we were told to just ring the bell for the night attendant but we were stood outside for 15 minutes in the cold waiting for him to come and unlock the door No security check or asking for our room numbers either with another 2 guests as well Its a little run down but is ok for a one night stop over if seeing something at the O2 , The location was great very close to the cutty sark DLR station and lots of nice restaurants in locailty The pub downstairs was well priced and had a lovely atmosphere 
132745,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Check in a bit of a mess guy behind the counter had a computer issue but failed to communicate and made no eye contact expected me to know that he was having a problem checkin took nearly 20 mins ,No Positive
132746,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Shower heat controls extremely sensitive , Lovely room with modern bathroom and plenty of room for 1 visitor Really convenient for Cutty Sark Greenwich DLR and the gorgeous Greenwich Park Breakfast relaxed and continental a nice change from mass produced Full English 
132747,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The bath In our room had a lot of dirt dust in it seemed like they had been decorating the bathroom and forgot to clean out the bath the pillows are also a bit too hard and give me a little bit of a stiff neck , Lovely room huge size for family s or groups staff all very lovely the check in was nice and quick and the decor of the room is lovely and neutral the pub downstairs is a beautiful shade of teal with a lot of wonderful personal touches to the walls also loved that it was nice warm in our room on arrival 
132748,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, We were woken up by someone hoovering at 1 am and then the cleaners were cleaning the outside area and moving furniture around right outside our window at 8 am Not a very restful stay unfortunately , The hotel is in a great location everything is on the door step The room was comfortable and cosy Tea and coffee facilities and toiletries which is a nice touch The breakfast was generous even though no hot food on offer 
132749,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Sofa bed was creaky family room was huge and would easily have fitted in another double bed for the children to sleep in which we would have preferred There is lots of noise from the very busy road outside which made it difficult for me to sleep Would have liked a plug socket near a mirror to make drying our hair easier , Very large family room with lots of space Very clean and pleasantly decorated Excellent location in centre of Greenwich close to the river Cutty Sark the covered market the park the museums observatory and transport links The Mitre is a lovely pub Complimentary breakfast was fine warm croissants cereals toast fruit and yoghurt 
132750,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Unfortunately we did have a hard time sleeping due to the road noise as well as the noise from the patrons outside in their pubs courtyard To add to the noise issue our kids sofa bed was very squeaky and they complained it was uncomfortable to sleep in , The location was fantastic The room itself was great and a very good size especially for our family of four The decor was lovely and the facilities ie king size bed bathroom shower room were clean and in good working order The continental breakfast which was included in the price was perfect We d consider staying here again 
132751,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Bit noisy from passing traffic but nothing that ear plugs didn t rectify Noise to be expected in a big city so we were prepared with ear plugs , Everything was great the history of the building the staff the location 
132752,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The young girl behind the bar when we arrived was totally unhelpful probably not on purpose she was just not very bright or useful, The location was very good and the bar facility was more than adequate
132753,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, There was no alternative area to sit with friends rather than the public bar and the breakfast was poor The check in was also very laboured However on a positive although the overall hotel is tired the beds were clean and comfortable ,No Positive
132754,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Room refreshments are on the basic side although OK Breakfast adequate Shower took some time to heat up With a few improvements the hotel could be very good , The hotel has an excellent location near the DLR and close by the Old Royal Naval College and St Alphege s Church and the building is quite atmospheric Friendly staff overall the hotel was OK 
132755,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Lack of imagination with morning croissants , Breakfast was okay but choice of croissants would have been better instead of the same croissants each morning 
132756,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The lift was very shabby and needs a complete refurb , Lovely clean modern room with a good bathroom and plenty of toiletries Continental breakfast was excellent with decent coffee much appreciated Right within the heart of Greenwich Village with easy access to the station DLR shops restaurants museums and the park Nice and quiet even though the rooms are above a pub Friendly and helpful staff 
132757,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The included breakfast was very limitied and you had to pay for any extra like egg and bacon , The room had what you needed but absolutely no extra except coffe and a water heater 
132758,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, It was very hot in the room although the radiators were not switched on Fortunately we could open the window but unfortunately this made the traffic noise louder , The room was a good size and the bed very comfy We had a room on the second floor and were not affected by noise from the bar on Friday and Saturday The continental breakfast was adequate and there was the added option of cooked dishes if required The staff were very friendly and helpful When we asked if we could leave our luggage they made sure our room was available earlier than normal We also left our luggage with them until the afternoon of our departure All the major attractions of Maritime Greenwich were only a few minutes walk away as were the buses or DLR for trips out of Greenwich 
132759,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Had to ask were to go to check in as i could nt see the sign for reception but the polite member of the bar staff pointed us in the right direction the room was but felt it was on the small side , The friendliness of the staff the cleanliness of the place prompt service aswell the bed was comfortable loved the main pub with all the quirky clocks on the wall breakfast selection was spot on and catered for both mine and my partners needs would stay again without a doubt 
132760,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The bathroom was very cramped The chief problem for someone with a leg injury like my self was getting in the high sided bath to use the shower There were no rail supports , Good location in very busy part of London near DLR Staff despite being very busy were very obliging The downstairs bar was popular and noisy I did not eat there but they seemed to deliver good food 
132761,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, It was very noisy until 2 a m Ish outside However if we could have closed the window it would helped enormously Very hot evening and only a plug in fan The bed was old and a small double ,No Positive

132763,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, We booked 2 months before My wife traveling separately from me went to check in only to be told that I had already done so in fact I was still traveling and hadn t checked in Consequently our original room had been given to someone else so we were given one which unfortunately was on the 1st floor on the street side so traffic noise was an issue all night as were the noisy drunken crowd under our window until 2 36 a m the latter not the hotel s fault In hindsight we should have taken the off road 3rd floor room option we were offered However we only booked for one night so wasn t too bad , The staff were very helpful Great location for all the attractions in Greenwich at a reasonable price Breakfast in the traditional English pub was very satisfying and to the standard we expected from Innkeepers Lodge Would use it again but with a room away from the traffic noise 
132764,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The water from the over bath showerhead was very hot happily there is a warning sign to that effect but in practice it was too hot to take a shower as such and no way of moderating the temperature A continental buffet breakfast is available within the room rate cereals cereal bars yoghurt toast fruit fruit juice and coffee but the only continental element were some fairly heavy duty and not warmed croissants rather then the range of meats cheese pastries etc that I would expect The accommodation is advertised as Innkeepers Lodge but this is not prominent until you are very close to the building which otherwise is signed as The Mitre , The bed and breakfast rooms form part of The Mitre public house in Greenwich Our room was on the the 3rd floor so well away from any street noise this is a busy road in the centre of Greenwich The room was a good size with a very nice and spacious bathroom complete with bath Bed was a full king size and very comfortable Staff were welcoming and friendly 
132765,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, Great location Fab old English pub Our only complaint would be is that when booking it says breakfast included Which is just toast or cereal Juice and hot drink No cooked breakfast unless you pay extra 
132766,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Noisy The pub closes at 11 p m and I was told that I could use the other door the supposed main door and ring the bell This caused me anxiety because there wasn t a person at the reception at all times I didn t like at all the fact that I couldn t buy something form the bar at 11 15 I m talking about a bag with potato chips nothing that requires preparation Yes the bar was officially closed but all the personnel was still around When I told them that they could charge it on my room they told me that the pub runs separetely from the hotel But still we had breakfast at the pub Btw wasn t great at all no bread just greasy croissants one two apples or bananas and cerals This hotel pub collaboration wasnt very efficient Despite the room was clean the cover of the chairs was full of stains The bath did not have any handrails for disabled people and was very slippery Hot room, Not far from Cutty Sark DLR station Hotel rooms bigger than usual in London Comfortable bed Clean
132767,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Stayed on a Saturday night and the live music was a little distracting We knew about this in advance and it finished at 11pm so wasn t too disturbing , Staff were very friendly and had good local knowledge Well situated hotel within reach of all local attractions Breakfast was a bonus 
132768,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, I don t think we could have picked a better place and will certainly go back , The location was very central just 2 minutes from the Cutty Sark and other attractions The room was very comfy and the bathroom was amazing Also the pub was really good at night

132780,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, They say that the live music is on until 11pm but what the don t say is that there music is still on full power until 12 25am Its a lively pub but they are a hotel too think that they forgot that bit,No Positive
132781,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Since the hotel is located near the road and near the station it is sometimes noisy at night Especially in summer time when windows are usually opened for cool air and people spend their evenings in the bar downstairs , Tidy room and friendly staff 
132782,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Be aware that the rooms on the 3rd floor can be really hot in warm summer weather , We had a problem with our room and staff gave us a different one for the remainder of our stay

132790,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Only thing that was a bit of an expensive let down was the lack of parking space On the website it says there is one but what you dont expect is that you have to pay and its behind the hotel across the street With london charges for such services costly However it is free after 6 30 pm, It was delightful people were nice and it was soo clean and tidy Room was very bright and there is nothing bad to be said about the establishment All in all it was a very nice place 
132791,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The bed in room 302 felt like it was sloping from side to side and I felt like I was going to roll out of it during the night Also 302 had a strong smell of dampness which was a little unpleasant The toilet paper was of a very poor quality ie too thin , We liked the friendly atmoshpere The simple but satisfying breakfasts were very nice The range of Beers ales was very good The evening meal was excellent value for money

132802,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, Great location in Greenwich Room wasn t large but was clean and comfortable Shower worked well Asked for a quieter room got one towards the back Still a bit of road noise but that was to be expected since its right on one of the busy streets in Greenwich Was there in mid June with nice temperatures so had window open Put some ear plugs in and slept fine Probably would be quieter in winter Great view of St Alfage s church next door There is a lift for those who don t want to take the stairs Breakfast was decent Nice breakfast room in the back of the pub Within easy walking distance of sights in Greenwich A few blocks from tube stop 
132803,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The only issue we had was that the room was very warm so we had to sleep with the fan provided on all night , All the staff were friendly and helpful great location especially as we were travelling by train Clean good sized room with a comfortable bed and good value thanks

132816,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Maybe slightly more on offer for the buffet breakfast meats cheese Cooked breakfast was delicious but had to pay extra for it Also rooms are above a pub so perhaps not suitable for those wanting an early night at the weekend , Staff were super friendly and couldn t do enough for us The family room was huge had a fridge very clean beds big and comfy Was really pleased and thought it was very reasonably priced to say it was in London Breakfast included in price was a buffet style breakfast cereals toast croissants 
132817,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, What a difference a change of shift makes Evening staff not at all interested in customers who are eating in the bar area Food cold and steak full of gristle we were not even asked if our meals were ok Empty glasses left on our table for an hour and a half not even asked if we wanted dessert presented with the wrong bill , Our check in experience and the relaxed atmosphere during the day the manager checked us in early and was lovely

132819,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, I took a double room as a solo traveler It was isolated and very spacious Would stay there with my partner and I think they offer a cot for a family or 3 travelers There was a loveseat in the room as well as 2 full sized closets Friendly staff and free and good wi fi O2 A cold breakfast was offered down in the pub and was very nice Pub itself is a listed building and has a nice and laid back atmosphere Very very good location 
132820,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, rooms too hot Sink on the small side for such a large bathroom , Excellent location Breakfast ideal full breakfast extra and very good wifi via O2 Large room and ensuite 
132821,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The man who booked us in was very frazzled and wasn t at all helpful regarding using the Hotel for dinner he wasn t prepared to book us in a table at the Hotel as it was Quiz night so having driven up from the south in the rain all we wanted was a meal noisy atmosphere or not it was our call if we wanted to brave it so we had to go out and it was disappointing to say the least Couldn t fault the breakfast the girls were very helpful and gave us assistance when one of our party was sick over night , Closeness to all attractions and eatng places Room was very clean and had everything needed
132822,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Lift was difficult to call at peak times, Location excellent for Greenwich but as close to Greenwich Pier able to catch river boat to London tourist sites

132826,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, They were quite disorganised in the restaurant with the wrong order being bought out after my friend had waited 10 more minutes to get her food as I already had mine, The room and location were both lovely
132827,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, We had already paid for breakfast to be included in the price of the room but then had to pay again to have the cooked breakfast Although it was excellent I felt a little irritated that I had paid twice also proper coffee would have improved this situation , Quirky building very comfortable The staff were amazing very polite and friendly and cheerful The breakfast is the best Full English breakfast I have ever had 
132828,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, I think this hotel could do with an information pack about using the hotel We weren t given anything on arrival so it should be in the room We could not call reception or get through to anyone at all so we had to go down to the pub to ask for help There was no information in the room regarding using the TV iron availability room service breakfast times or even how to get back in once the pub had closed My mother in law is 70 and had her own room which had loose tiles in the bathroom This was very hazardous for her Also we had requested a double bed but we got two singles joined together which was a lovely size but not very comfortable , We had a great stay at the innkeepers lodge The family room was very spacious with high ceilings and big beds We were right in the middle of greenwich with so much to see and do The continental breakfast was one of the best I ve had And the cooked breakfast was good quality Staff were very friendly and helpful We would stay here again

132831,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Not much at all the single bed seemed very small but in a Twin Room what can I expect , The location is fantastic in the middle of Greenwich For a hotel based in a pub it was a very nice atmosphere clean rooms with good facilities and staff were very friendly offering suggestion on travelling around the city 
132832,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The lift did not work The stairs are very dangerous particularly for mature quests Surprised h s passed them Sunday roast in the evening was almost inedible Male staff member on check in seemed uninterested and rather rude The fire alarm sounded at 10pm We came down but staff made no attempt either to give I information or advice They took no notice and carried on serving beer A customer told us it was smoke in the kitchen We will definitely never stay again , The room was fine The female staff were friendly and helpful

132836,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Road noise but it s to be expected in central London Could do with triple glazing if it s not a listed building, Position for the DLR Station and the ease of gettin to and from Euston even on a Sunday
132837,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Elevator out of order for more than 24 hours Carrying luggage through small staircase passage was very hard Single glazing and bad ventilation made the room s temperature very volatile no airconditioning to compensate Shower room far to small for even a slim sized couple , Good location
132838,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Room 302 smell of drains on return to room Evening meal disappointing on April 30th , Excellent transport links and location for O2 Close to all amenities The Mitre has a good ambience Not overpriced considering it s prime location Friendly staff Room kept very clean Husband enjoyed the pub quiz 
132839,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, To be honest nothing, The inclusive breakfast was excellent and catered for most tastes and the staff could not have been more helpful and the live entertainment on Saturday night was a great bonus
132840,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Bit more choice at breakfast Would love warm croissants , Locality is perfect for accessing transport and all tourist attractions Lovely pub and rooms just fine 
132841,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Wifi wasn t that great and radiator in the bedroom wouldn t turn on Windows are only single glazed so if your room overlooks the main road you will hear the traffic throughout the night and morning , Perfect for the O2 close to the river with lots of little boutique shops nearby and Greenwich market Hotel itself was clean and had everything we needed for an overnight stay Quite a basic breakfast but good nonetheless Decor in the bar was quirky and staff friendly 
132842,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, Everything as far as we were concerned Really helpful that we could leave our bags after check out so we could spend the day in Greenwich without dragging the case behind us

132845,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, No car parking despite what the booking page stated Too noisy at night Noisy drunks and rubbish trucks late at night I would not recommend this hotel for London Marathon participants I barely slept and was so stressed about trying to find a car park ended up 6 miles away that it ruined my weekend I wanted a chilled day before the race I didn t get this Wished I had gone to Novotel up the road , Closeness to the start of the marathon 
132846,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The selection at breakfast was poor Only white sliced bread No cheeses or meat no yoghurt on first day croissants cold , Lovely pub atmosphere friendly staff
132847,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Too expensive for what they offer my room was a bit nosy as it faced the road an I believe the DLR or some other train passes close by , I liked the location the cozy atmosphere of the conservatory where they serve breakfast andthe cleanliness
132848,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Small rooms no double glazing so very noisy with traffic and trains no black out curtains or thick curtains poor layout of the room which was also cold radiator didn t seem to work and bathroom needed a good clean Toilet had been used when we walked in and not flushed light bulb was missing from shaver light no loo brush Bits on the bathroom floor and found a long dark hair on my bath towel not mine and certainly not my husband s Cranky lift which was dirty and got graffiti scratched on it Other budget accommodation close by such as ibis premier inn and Novotel so they need to spend money and up their game Lack of comfort in rooms had to plug kettle in on the floor as no socket near the table and no mirror at the table either to sit and dry your hair Bed sturdy but very firm and pillows quite hard , The location and the pub below and all the staff were lovely 
132849,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Breakfast is poor no protein only white bread just fillers , The position in Greenwich so handy Staff friendly pleasant Good pub grub at reasonable prices 20 student discount off all food and drink

132851,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The part of the building I was in seemed colder than the main part of the building which was ok for sleeping but a little chilly for the morning shower, Friendly staff large clean room in easy reach of the DLR with good access to the Docklands Canary Wharf 
132852,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, To be very honest the staff in the pub were not that helpful we arrived at 1 30 pm and as per the website we knew we could not check in until 3pm which was ok but we just had to leave our bags unattended behind the bar when I though a locked room would of not been to much to ask with a very very late check in time and after receiving an email to say the lift was out of order we were directed up three very twisty stair cases to the top floor without even a mention with help with our bags finally the room did smell damp but was over all clean , Location was great and price was ok for the area
132853,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Food menu was being changed the week of our stay so some items listed were unavailable thus limited your options But that is being hypercritical All in all a very pleasant stay , Excellent location Just a two minute stroll from the cutty sark tube station the thames clipper service Perfect if visiting the o2 arena Friendly attentive staff Comfortable rooms Was made aware in advance via phone call that the hotels lift was out of order nice touch to let people know of the issue

132858,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Didn t sleep well because the room was uncomfortably warm despite the radiators being off There seemed to be a lot of heat coming through the floor Even with the window wide open to the noisy streets it was a sweaty sticky night and this was early April Despite the positives to this great place this alone means that we won t be returning unless the rooms are fitted with air conditioning , Top location excellent friendly staff great pub nice room 
132859,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, It s grade 1 listed with steep stairs so might not suit older travellers But they do have a lift , Great location Minutes from the Cutty Sark DLR station and the ferry An ideal place to stay if attending an event at the O2 Good continental breakfast 
132860,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Having to walk up two flights of stairs with our cases because the lift was broken the heating in the room didn t work and when we reported it the reply was oh thanks for letting us know and only white bread poor continental breakfast to make toast with at breakfast time And when we showed our room key we were told we d already been marked off as having eaten Trust me we wouldn t have bothered eating it twice , The location was perfect
132861,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, The mitre was in a great location especially if you are going to the O2 The staff are very friendly and helpful The pub downstairs feels separate to the hotel but is busy holding events such as quizzes and music nights these get mentioned to you but aren t forced
132862,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Small room and a bit claustrophobic Uncomfortable sleep poss bed too small and soft Couldn t turn heater off in bathroom and extractor very noisy 2 long flights of old spiral staircase and lift not working Shame because the pub was lovely , Lovely character pub right in the heart of Greenwich opposite the market We ate dinner in the pub which was very good 
132863,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Bath plug didn t work which meant I had to keep topping up my bath Window in bathroom didn t open , Warm welcoming atmosphere in both the B B and the pub and the food was great 
132864,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, As we didn t get in until very early the following morning the nearby church bells ringing from about 9 30am were not very welcome but couldn t be helped , Friendly and helpful man that booked us in Room was clean with an enormous and comfy bed The shower was nice and hot 
132865,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Electric shaver socket light heated towel rail didn t work in the bathroom , Room was good Bed very comfortable Staff very helpful especially Sara 
132866,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Parking was included in web site but on arrival we were directed across the road to the Ibis Hotel where we were charged GBP 13 00 for 24 hrs, The location is perfect as allows comfortable walking distance to Cutty Sark Royal Observatory and Maritime Museum 
132867,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Breakfast a little fresher but we were usually eating at the end of breakfast Supplement cost for Full English rather than normal customer price , Staff very friendly Location perfect for 02 with Thames clipper ride 
132868,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, Love this place great hotel 1 stop on clipper from o2 great service great room great food best pepper sauce on a great steak Fantastic continental breakfast Book it
132869,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Hotel facilities not used check in desk and restaurant so everything managed through the adjoining pub The Mitre No parking on site but can use the local Ibis car park with a discount , Lovely clean room Great adjoining pub in an excellent location in the heart of Greenwich 
132870,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, NOTHING, EXCELLENT LOCATION STAFF VERY HELPFUL ADVISED US ABOUT CHEAP PARKING OPTION AT NEARBY IBIS HOTEL WHICH SAVED US A FORTUNE ROOM WAS SPACIOUS COFORTABLE AND VERY CLEAN CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST MORE THAN ADEQUATE OUR ROOM WAS ON THE FIRST FLOOR AND ALTHOUGH ABOVE A BUSY PUB WITH LIVE MUSIC AT WEEKENDS OUR ROOM WAS VERY QIUET
132871,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Needs a little work in small areas but I am sure these will be completed soon , Extremely helpful staff Amazing location and facilities in the room were good Pressure from the shower was amazing Very good value for money 
132872,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, the first room I was given had no electricity working the second room was ok however was woken up at 4am with water running from the ceiling It seemed the hotel had a big issue with a leak or burst pipe of some kind as when I left there were buckets in the hallway and stairs no part refund was offered,No Positive
132873,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Feel booking com gave wrong information calling it the innkeeper when it s actually called The Mitre Even the local cabbies couldn t find it Made us late booking in and joining family party , Perfect location in Greenwich large room views of busy Greenwich
132874,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, breakfast uninviting and I didn t bother to stay for it it would have been good to have had someone around at 7am to welcome guests into the breakfast area shower facility a bit poor but if they could improve in these areas it would be a good hotel, comfortable enough and very clean excellent location atmospheric building
132875,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Loud music until the early hours of the morning kept us awake also the bed was not particularly comfortable , Great location very convenient for everything you might want to see in Greenwich Not part of the deal but the dinner was excellent and service quick although it was busy would recommend the food 
132876,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The Hotel area going up to the rooms could do with more pictures on the walls its a little bare Just to make the place a little more inviting , Location and food excellent friendly staff things to do in town Rooms comfortable heated towel rack breakfast in the morning Very active place worth a drop by 
132877,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Parking is a tad on the pricey side , Very central location overlooking a beautiful church very cosy and atmospheric inn comfortable room with all amenities 
132878,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, If I had to be critical a small fridge would be useful Coming from Australia we are used to this item in most hotel motels , The room was spacious and there was ample hot water We particularly enjoyed the breakfast Beautiful period building 
132879,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Minor things lighting fixed shower head hot water bit quirky Logging into wifi, Central location fridge in room quiet on top floor TV and Internet worked well 
132880,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, Staff are absolutely excellent The location was better than we expected within very easy walking distance of the Observatory and Cutty Sark Parking was easy but limited at a nearby hotel within just 2 to 3 minutes walk 
132881,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Our only complaint was that the floorboards creaked very loudly and there was a big gap under the bedroom door Fortunately we weren t near any other rooms but would imagine noise from the lift and other doors would be a nuisance in other rooms Breakfast was rather uninspiring , Everything e g museums planetarium Cutty Sark shops theatre cinema other restaurants and public transport was right on the doorstop Staff were really helpful and cheerful The beds were very comfortable We asked for the heating to be put on which in our room required attention to the bathroom radiator and this was dealt with very swiftly The croissants were marvellous but the rest of the breakfast was mediocre All in all value for money accommodation 
132882,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, Very convenient location for sightseeing and visiting the 02 Staff were very helpful and they provided a very adequate breakfast room was very clean and comfortable 
132883,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The included breakfast was nothing special so I only had it once Room was good but not luxury , Fulfilled all expectations Good location clean rooms friendly staff decent price 
132884,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, A bit noisy I had a corner room and the roads outside are quite busy and loud , Great location near public transportation shops restaurants etc Lovely old building and a spacious room Nice and warm I had a nice stay 
132885,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Food was ok for what we paid but nothing special , Large comfortable room Everything we needed Friendly and helpful staff Very close to station Value for money 
132886,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Nothing bad but the light over the mirror in bathroom didn t work Mattress was a bit hard for us but that s a very tricky thing to get right for everyone , The staff were lovely friendly and very informative about things to do and see The room was comfortable and spotless and the bathroom was great with a fantastic shower It was a very relaxed atmosphere and easy for us to come and go as we pleased 
132887,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Not really much of a problem but the water pressure in our room 304 could have been a little stronger but this is a lovely place to stay excellent value for money and would definitely stay again , Stayed here to see Madonna at O2 December 2015 All staff were incredibly friendly and helpful during our 3 night stay This is a great location and it was easy to get to and from the heart of London The delights of Greenwich were on the doorstep The Mitre was very clean our room was very quiet and the beds were superbly comfortable Breakfast was delightful and the food from the bar was superb and excellent value for money Good free WiFi connection Generally a lovely place to stay bags of character clean friendly convenient and excellent value for money 
132888,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Poor Wifi for visitors you were asked to use O2 free wifi but not an easy process for non UK residences hotel did not have its own wifi Room clean but toilet not flushed upon arrival Left hotel at 2pm next day asked for room to be cleaned was told it would be and it was not , Location in Greenwich was good and staff were very nice
132889,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, front bedroom a touch noisy with traffic however on a high street this is expected would use again a very helpful staff suggested a few quiet rooms that are not overlooking the busy high street, Ample continental breakfast public transport boat and bus ideal for O2 event
132890,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, Great location centre of Greenwich handy for shops and sights and a short walk from the DLR buses and River Boats Easy to get to from O2 too via RB1 River Boat or 129 or 188 buses Staff were friendly good food and beer and a pub full of character Room a tad small but comfortable Great breakfast too with a cooked breakfast available extra cost should you want one 
132891,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The continental breakfast lacked choice Surprising in this day and age only white bread , Ideally situated for getting around The room was well equipped and clean and comfortable 
132892,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The room we were in had only 2 electric sockets behind the TV and the kettle lead was to short to reach unless balanced on the mugs, It was in good location for the O2 and within walking distances for restaurants
132893,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Not a dislike but all Inkeepers Lodges do poor breakfasts even by continental standards I know you can get a fry up for extra but the inclduded breakfast could be much better, Well placed for anything in Greenwich and a lovely pub downstairs
132894,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Some bar staff were not very attentive Not a lot of choice at breakfast unless you paid extra Bar prices were expensive even compared to other places, Great location Bar downstairs was very nice good atmosphere Clean and comfortable Good price
132895,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Room very warm but could not have the window open because of the traffic noice most of the night, Convenient for the tube and bus for the O2 lots to see and do near by 
132896,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, I did think that there was a lot of traffic noise , The Proprietor was excellent he couldn t do enough for us The room was clean and the bedding excellent The breakfast was fine we had plenty of choice One of the nicest things was the back patio were you could sit and relax We will go again and would recommend it 
132897,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, More fruit options and perhaps a boiled egg at breakfast would have been good I believe but wasn t offered a full english breakfast was available on request , ideal location in the centre of GREENWICH close to the O2 arena
132898,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, Excellent location spacious top floor room extremely comfortable bed buffet breakfast was lovely Great staff beer and food in the bar was also excellent
132899,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Noisy in the evenings noisy in the mornings Not ideal for either an early night or a lie in Breakfast was limited unless you wanted to pay extra for the cooked options , Great location in the heart of Greenwich The pub downstairs had a fair selection of beers and wines 
132900,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The only things I can comment on is that we had a room towards the street and if you can t sleep with noise ask for a room facing the garden The rooms have single layer windows and it sounds like the window is open but it s closed Didn t bother us that much Also the carpets might need refreshing , The location was very good for O2 visit as we wanted to avoid public transport and walk We also found the river bus an excellent option to get to the center and O2 since the Cutty Sark stop was very near The room was nice our reception excellent and they even accommodated my very special request for a welcoming surprise A cosy place to stay Thank you 
132901,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, Location excellent for local amenities Some traffic noise due to the location however it was tolerable New carpets were being laid in the corridors which gave a looked after feel The breakfast though of continental style was more than adequate due to the choices available
132902,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Bar staff on arrival took a while to check us in Not clear where reception was Noisy traffic as next to main road but it was excellent location being centre of greenwhich , Clean and comfortable stay in the middle of Greenwich
132903,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, Firstly the location was ideal both the DLR station and River Bus Pier were within easy walking distance The hotel was also close enough to London City which was easily and quickly accessible We were attending a concert at the O2 and the river bus before and after took only 7 minutes The Hotel itself is 200 years old but well maintained and comfortable The room was clean tidy and modern but retained some of the old features The staff were extremely nice and helpful
132904,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, Great location despite DLR on strike excellent bus connection Central location within Greenwich lots to see and do within easy walking Loved breakfast in the conservatory 
132905,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Shower not working toilet didn t flush fan didn t work until I mended it but wouldn t rotate nail sticking out of carpet no tv Was only advised about the shower before checking in ,No Positive
132906,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Shabby stairways corridoors and lift Noisey no gluten free alternatives at breakfast and lack of fruit variety , The location of the hotel clean room nice wines 
132907,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The corridors and carpets were in need of up grading The bar area was both vibrant and good fun but the noise was an issue for some of our group with young children They could have been better placed in the hotel , Location atmosphere and friendly staff The room was comfortable and the bathroom very good
132908,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Bathroom was very small and couldn t keep window open has no catches do do so when room was very hot in night, Nice hotel staff very friendly enjoy our stay there and would stay again
132909,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Disappointing accommodation based on the number of stars and the cost The room and en suite bathroom might best be described as functional fine if you just want somewhere to lay your head and do not expect your accommodation to contribute to the overall experience of staying in Greenwich , Greenwich on the doorstep 
132910,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Guests stairway dirty and stained on busy road so noisy at night, The location very close to everything Nice pub and staff Let us have an umbrella when we set offf on very rainy morning Lovely modern clean shower room 
132911,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Old windows you can t close them very well so you feel the wind and you hear the noises outside Very poor breakfast, Very friendly staff and very professional Very good access to station Very good location in the heat of Greenwhich
132912,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Pub prices a bit high competition cheaper No maps available Name change confused us , Great room but old elevator and too many stairs if it s busy Pub downstairs so some noisy bits Fabulous breakfast and very wonderful staff So close to market and restaurants 
132913,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The entrance to the hotel and pup setting underneath No air conditioning would not try it in the summer Wifi was dodgy too , The room was surprisingly clean and isolated the noise of the pup downstairs and location has local stores and close to a DLR station
132914,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The loft room stank of drains beyond belief the smell took your breath as i entered the room i cannot believe the room was let out as it was there was a mouse trap under the bed the sash window had rotted allowing the noise of the city directly into the room Had I not been up for for the last 17 5 hours needing to be up again in the next 7 I would have checked out, The reception staff bar area was nice
132915,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The staff were ok a little rude and didn t make us feel very welcome on arrival the man who checked us in was more like a robot more like a practice speech and not very personal told us when breakfast was served during in the week and weekend as were only staying one night at the weekend we didn t really need to hear the rest of the week the same was said about closing etc We came back to the pub quite late and decided to have a few drinks before bed we heard the last orders bell so sent my partner back in to get a final round but were rudely told by the same Man that had checked us in that they had stopped serving The bell had literally just been rung didn t make sense perhaps they had forgotten to ring the bell earlier But still annoying Weatherspoons just down the road open till 1 cheaper drinks and much more welcoming place to be The room was ridiculously hot We had the fan on all night and windows open but still it was impossible to sleep Not what I would class as 4 star there was only decaff coffee in the room and it was Nescaf a poor mans coffee in my opinion And the service a breakfast was appaluling not one person asked if we had slept well or even took our breakfast order The continental breakfast was adequate but not having yogurts on top of ice big mistake Warm yogurt poorly stomach All in all pleasant enough place for the money but the staff could do with training in manners and service skill , The location is great Greenwich is lovely friendly people and some good pubs and bars to go to 
132916,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Not really Innkeeper s fault but the rooms are above a pub and we weren t able to sleep from the noise of drunk people out on the street Not the place to be if you want an early night great if you want to be up partying yourself , Clean and comfortable room Close to the tube 
132917,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich,No Negative, Very friendly barman checked me in Ideal location in central Greenwich a stone s throw from the Cutty Sark Maritime Museum and Greenwich Park Great to arrive by river on a Thames Clipper service Lovely cheerful irish lady presiding over breakfast Different experience to have breakfast in a pub great ambience 
132918,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Bed was too soft and couldn t connect to the wifi , Lovely location based in the heart of Greenwich The innkeepers lodge was quirky and fantastic Bedroom clean and tidy 
132919,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, confusing name the pub is called the Mitre Only the notepaper has Innkeepers lodge on it Parking is in the Ibis hotel and is 17 a day , location friendly staff lovely rooms I quite liked the warren s of it but very confusing Try finding room 302 from labels 
132920,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Price high although this is valid for London in general We found a burnt bulb in the bathroom on arrival They promised to replace it the same day a matter of a couple of hours a special bulb They didn t until the end of our stay four days The flooring in the lift is completely worn out and with a bad smell Astonishing as it would cost next to nothing to replace it We don t mind paying on arrival But we dislike being asked to do it with an explanation this is the hotel s policy Especially when there is a two month prior reservation and credit card pre authorization The place is advertised as offering free wi fi It doesn t You are instructed to follow a procedure entering a mobile phone number in your phone tablet etc In the end it turns out your own operator is charging you from somewhere in the world The name Innkeeper s Lodge as given on the reservation sheet does not appear on the front of the building and there is no warning in the reservation on the building you see The Mitre instead We had to walk to and fro around the building for ten minutes to find out it was the same place , Great location in the center of Greenwich Some minutes walk to the museums the Royal Observatory Cutty Sark the Underground Clean room and bathroom sheets etc changed every day Quiet at least on the third floor Third floor is the highest one and there is a lift There is a note in front saying this is a historic building and even some mention is made of UNESCO But we failed to understand what exactly the case was it would be nice to have more and better information A good pub on the first floor where they offer you continental breakfast in the morning acceptable Staff polite but not too enthusiastic 
132921,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, Shower was weedy and took a while to get hot water on top floor so probably had a way to go Lift small and shaky Room very noisy with window open , Great location just a couple of minutes from everything Room OK very clean Bar great atmosphere and good food Staff very friendly 
132922,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, check in chap not very friendly Cloud wifi very annoying Previous guests hair and squashed fly in shower Water pressure poor Noise from the street No hairdryer in the room, Great Location quick check out Morning staff much nicer Clean sheets and room Tea facilities
132923,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, The double bed was a bit too narrow and there was no air conditioning in the room Windows were poorly sound proofed and the noise from the traffic was a bit disturbing in the night time The complimentary breakfast practically consisted of carbs only The free WiFi was complicated to use and required registering , Unique little hotel with great staff Nice restaurants and DLR station nearby the pub downstairs was also nice The rooms were cleaned very well every day A good choice for someone looking for an option to chain like hotels 
132924,Innkeeper s Lodge London Greenwich, They refuse to heat food for babies young children So if you have a baby this really is not the place for you In fact they openly admit that all they can do in their kitchens is re heat ready made meals hardly a recommendation , good location
