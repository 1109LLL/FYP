33703,11 Cadogan Gardens, Thought the prise of drinks at the bar a little excessive , We were particularly impressed by the very warm welcome we received a lovely hotel in a superb location good size room with excellent bathroom We will come back and already have recommended it to friends and relatives 
33704,11 Cadogan Gardens, Nothing in particular just the usual problems in staying in a very old building far outweighed by the charm of the property and the staff , The atmosphere and staff were excellent just what you would expect from a small luxury hotel Breakfast and restaurant food delicious and reasonably priced 
33705,11 Cadogan Gardens, I found the floors in the corridors to be a bit too squeaky can t do much about that as it s such an old building Bathroom was small but as I was on my own no problem there , Bed was amazingly comfortable The building is Full of character and class The staff where excellent and most helpful I really enjoyed staying there and would stay again Didn t get the opportunity to enjoy the breakfast maybe another time 
33706,11 Cadogan Gardens, I thought I had booked the refundable rate but found out I had not and I couldn t change it around I blame Booking com for the confusion not the hotel, Lovely hotel
33707,11 Cadogan Gardens, Room was far too small for 2 No shelves drawers to store clothes just a few hangers Cluttered room and tiny bathroom made this room lack comfort We had to live out of our suitcase which had to be stored upright as no space for it , Concierge service excellent Bed very comfortable and lux Lounges and bar very comfortable and elegantly furnished Location perfect 
33708,11 Cadogan Gardens,No Negative, Customer service was above and beyond from all staff Richie Long is attentive and nothing was too much trouble in fact all the staff were amazing shout out to Richie Emerson and Christian
33709,11 Cadogan Gardens,No Negative, Everything Most comfortable bed Extremely Clen Great Bathroom Staff beyond accommodating Very Posh Fantastic location close to everything Expensive but worth every penny Ordered room service Delicious food Oustanding overall 
33710,11 Cadogan Gardens, Room size and outlook very disappointing Bathroom basin taps antiquated, Egg white omelette for breakfast Concierge very helpful Different sitting areas Decor
33711,11 Cadogan Gardens, There was nothing to dislike , The bed was spacious and very comfy Loads of hangers in the wardrobe The staff were extremely polite and attentive Breakfast was a real treat This is a perfect hotel if you want a special treat 
33712,11 Cadogan Gardens,No Negative, slightly older property but still very quaint staff were very attentive without being pushy perfect location for RHS Chelsea flower show also close to Hyde Park and if you desire the best designer shops
33713,11 Cadogan Gardens, Room was not cleaned and bed not made as bathroom not cleaned on the second day we left the room at 9 30and came back at 3 30 and room in a mess Had to call down to reception to get it cleaned ,No Positive
33714,11 Cadogan Gardens, The bathroom of this particular suite was small and cramped , The location so close to Sloane Square was excellent for us The bedroom was very comfortable and the staff most attentive and obliging The breakfast was also very good
33715,11 Cadogan Gardens, We upgraded to a superior room and was expecting something better than we had Bathroom tiny and bath itself only really suitable for a very small person, Staff friendly and professional
33716,11 Cadogan Gardens, Hated the stuffy hot airless breakfast room which was in the basement it had a horrible atmosphere of pompousness and a unpleasant arrogant bad tempered French waiter who slammed things down on the table and abrasive loud syncopated jazz music Which he refused to turn down or change it felt claustrophobic and I could not hear myself think we all decide we would never go back because of that room and that waiter We had breakfast at Pret the rest of our stay , the suite the location nearly all of the staff
33717,11 Cadogan Gardens, The room was too small No minibar My room on the 2nd floor was next door to a school It was quite noisy and a lot of traffic just before 8am when the parents dropped off their kids Something to keep in mind for those who are here on vacation , The omelet was superb The gym was small but the equipment and treadmill worked well Very service minded staff who recommended me some delicious Italian restaurants within walking distance of the hotel 
33718,11 Cadogan Gardens,No Negative, So glad we chose 11 Cadogan Gardens for a very quick trip to London The staff were wonderful and nothing was ever too much trouble Very importantly our bed was a true king size and extremely comfortable The bathroom was a tad on the squeezy side but that is England We got used to it and found it charming The location is perfect walking distance to Sloane Square tube station and lots of fantastic restaurants nearby I really couldn t fault it and would highly recommend 
33719,11 Cadogan Gardens, Bathroom in our room was very small but well appointed , Personal attention from all staff was exceptional Extremely well located for shopping and transport
33720,11 Cadogan Gardens, There was a party across the road playing blasting music until early hours of Sunday morning I had no sleep it was a nightmare The alternative room offered was freezing and had no curtains so I couldn t undress or sleep I was very distressed totally unacceptable I complained no one called the direct noise abatement police line This is an exclusive neighbourhood totally unexpected Their marketing says peace and quiet Far from it , Nothing
33721,11 Cadogan Gardens, Electrical outlets were a little difficult to find none near the bed if you plan on using your phone as an alarm , Location from which all the sights are walkable or easily approached via public transport or cheaply accessed via cab Excellent and luxurious amenities in room Professional and overwhelmingly friendly staff 
33722,11 Cadogan Gardens, The room was quite chilly and the bathroom was realy cold Without the free slippers it would have been torture , Really good service A very nice accomodation
33723,11 Cadogan Gardens,No Negative, The hotel staff were so friendly and helpful Nothing was too much trouble It was my little boys birthday and they went out of their way to spoil him The building was beautiful wish we could have stayed longer 
33724,11 Cadogan Gardens, Very small room offered in first instance but staff very happy to help and offered us chance to swap rooms , Staff fantastic bed extremely comfy and sheets just gorgeous 
33725,11 Cadogan Gardens, 1 service at the bar was poor We had champagne but were not served any nuts olives and even though we were only one of two tables the waiter never came to top up our glasses which at GBP 100 a bottle was unacceptable When we then asked for more drinks none arrived and the barman disappeared completely Very poor service 2 The room was too hot until we found a way to turn off the heating completely 3 we had room 206 which has a small bathroom even though my colleague s in room 2016 was a standard size This was disappointing , Very good welcome and nice property The location is also perfect Will stay again if the price at the time of booking is right 
33726,11 Cadogan Gardens, Hold up at reception as not enough staff to deal with morning check outs Breakfast very expensive and not included in price , Great location extremely comfortable room wonderful staff who couldn t do enough for you 
33727,11 Cadogan Gardens, I like room service breakfast and the healthy option had limited choices, I chose the hotel due this the location The coziness of the hotel and l personal service were very agreeable The room was small but confortable
33728,11 Cadogan Gardens, small room with extremely disappointing view into the inside of a very dirty light well Whilst i understand that there are always going to be rooms in locations like this I really feel that one should be amply forwarned, Pleasant staff We particularly like the location in this quiet backwater but still in the heart of things 
33729,11 Cadogan Gardens, It really is a SMALL place Everything is tight and tough to navigate thru by a sizeable person Hot room small window facing the backyard chiller , Location is great Old place with history and charm 
33730,11 Cadogan Gardens, There were only coffee making facilities in the room no tea This was brought when we asked It said free newspapers but it was only the Times which is free and we ordered the Telegraph It would have been nice to have that explained Other than that everything was great ,No Positive
33731,11 Cadogan Gardens, The bed was comfortable but the frame was too big for the mattress making it a little difficult to get out The bathroom was a little cramped but well appointed , The staff couldn t have been more helpful friendly and smiling The food was very good especially the fillet of beef which was melt in the mouth 
33732,11 Cadogan Gardens, I was upgraded but the room was still tiny and crowded though elegantly decorated There is apparently no escaping London s cramped hotel quarters even when paying nearly 200 pounds a night without breakfast , The hotel is in a lovely 19th century red brick building in the up scale neighborhood near Cadogan Square on the edge of Knightsbridge The atmosphere is nice and the staff our outstanding The location is conveniently located for the underground and buses and Buckingham Palace is about a nice 20 minute walk from the hotel I was able to use a lovely hotel common area for a working brunch with a colleague with nice food at reasonable price
33733,11 Cadogan Gardens, Our room was dark and dingey It was stiflingly hot with no a c The room was old with an ancient dark wood bed frame with chips and scuffs in the woodwork The hotel itself was ratty with torn paintings and paint falling off the woodwork Getting a snack after 11 pm was greeted with hostility in spite of their boasting 24 hour service We paid over 350 a night for substandard service and accommodation I recommend the Milestone , The concierge Richie and the breakfast Manger were delightful and welcoming The location was perfect 
33734,11 Cadogan Gardens,No Negative, Everything about this small luxury hotel meets and surpasses expectations staff very friendly and especially attentive to returning guests Room bed amenities very comfortable and top notch Food delicious Ambiance is romantic classic and modern all at the same time Can t wait to go back 
33735,11 Cadogan Gardens,No Negative, Upgraded to a suite on arrival having not stayed before followed up with excellent standards throughout service was first rate definitely will be visiting again Having travelled repeatedly to London through work previously and never been a big fan the hotel has improved my outlook on the capital immensely great times We will certainly be returning 
33736,11 Cadogan Gardens, Room and furniture a bit old No mini bar Room a bit stuffy Air conditioning could be improved , Bed is comfortable Breakfast is good Service is excellent from bar tender to concierge 
33737,11 Cadogan Gardens, Bed could have been more comfortable pillows were good An elliptical in the gym would have been nice , Staff were fantastic room was generously sized gorgeous quiet and secluded location
33738,11 Cadogan Gardens, Not much to do in the vicinity at night You will need to take public transit or a taxi if you want to go for a drink The hotel bar is fantastic but was too quiet for us on a Saturday night , The bed was out of this world comfortable and the staff at the door were all fantastic Really tremendous service from those guys The hotel design in spectacular and will really amaze you everything is impeccably done up 
33739,11 Cadogan Gardens, Had to wait for the bartender several times but he was good upon arrival , Very comfortable room You might consider better lighter in the bathroom or a magnifying mirror that lights up Front staff was amazing 
33740,11 Cadogan Gardens, The hotel is located next to a school and you can hear the bells every morning and the music class as well I stayed in room 401 I don t know if the other rooms are quieter though , Jhony and the rest of the staff are really friendly They do not mind greeting you a 100 times per day 3
33741,11 Cadogan Gardens, Overpriced may be seasonal, Amazing staff homy atmosphere great location Complimentary high speed wifi Stayed at kings suite amd really liked it
33742,11 Cadogan Gardens, Sadly the day of my presentation the woman on the front desk wasn t with it and didn t let me know that my notes had not arrived in her inbox for printing I had an uber driver waiting and had to run out without them That caused a lot of hassle later on but overall the rest of the staff was fantastic , The room and location were absolutely brilliant And the staff went out of their way to be helpful Also I m a bit of a bathroom snob and I have to say it was pretty fantastic Small touches like umbrellas in the room turn down service with chocolate mint and the old cage elevator added to the charm 
33743,11 Cadogan Gardens,No Negative, Very nice location nice room nice staff nice food Just a very welcoming and comfortable hotel Check in was lovely with red roses for my wife and some sweets on the room A rare treatment in times were many 5 hotels mostly value their profits rather than their guests We had a splendid stay 
33744,11 Cadogan Gardens, There was no eye window that allows you to see who knocks the door , This boutique hotel is located in a very good location close to Knightsbridge and very close to Sloane square so in a walking distance to Harrods However it is hidden in a calm street so you are away from crowds and noise The interiors were comfy luxury and classy 
33745,11 Cadogan Gardens, We had to use the stairs so being on the 3rd floor is tough for people over 70 Lack of knowledge of hotel facilities was very inconvenient Some staff associated with bar and restaurant services were slow and inattentive, We really appreciated the welcome and the very comfortable room The location is quiet and very pleasant and convenient We were jvery impressed with members of staff who were attentive and good their personal efforts we appreciate very much 
33746,11 Cadogan Gardens, I believe they are renovating the whole hotel the common stairs need a bit of the magic they ve dome with the rooms , Fantastic location in the heart of Chelsea but on the quietest street A small group of houses converted to a non stuffy 5 star hotel I was given a very large completely renovated room and think I scored a great price here Espresso maker in the room beautiful bath Spotless Thick towels turn down service quiet Great decor It was warm in London and the air conditioning was awesome cool quiet and didn t freeze you out Short walk to the tube Never used the common rooms or restaurant bar etc but they all looked cozy and high tea looked delicious from what I could tell Very friendly staff Will stay here again 
33747,11 Cadogan Gardens, Can t fault it , From the second we stepped through the door to leaving 2 days later we felt nothing but pleasure staying here from the impeccable service to the interior of the building and the location It was a perfect 30th birthday trip 
33748,11 Cadogan Gardens, Having no Tea or Coffee making facilities in our bedroom dust was visible on surfaces in the dinning room when we had breakfast , The bed was very comfortable Staff helpful friendly 
33749,11 Cadogan Gardens, Can t think of any negatives , Traveling with 2 kids was made especially easy by friendly and helpful staff Terrific food after sight seeing most of the day we ordered room service for dinner 3 nights in a row and were never disappointed Breakfast was also a real treat Great neighborhood All around a super experience 
33750,11 Cadogan Gardens, That we had to leave , Attention to details staff were remarkable shout out to Sara riche paul not forgetting everyone else who made our stay fabulous This is my new home next time I visit London Location is perfect and very convenient 
33751,11 Cadogan Gardens, Felt interior was a little dark and twin bedded room wasn t terribly spacious However it was comfortable and we did enjoy our stay , Found our experience generally good with helpful friendly staff Liked having the bar downstairs so that when we returned in the evening could have a drink 
33752,11 Cadogan Gardens, The configuration of the room was really odd long and skinny with the rooms ie hallway bedroom and bathroom up and down different sets of small stairs Room quite compact Wifi didn t work in the room at all the whole stay which was really annoying considering that they sent someone to try and fix it apparently Didn t do anything to compensate that which I thought was poor, Very helpful staff willing to assist which always makes the difference For the busy location the room was quiet and comfy The lovely wallpaper is a standout giving the room an eclectic feel Appreciated the complimentary drinking water but that only appeared the 2nd night of my 3 night stay Comfy bed and excellent choice of pillows 
33753,11 Cadogan Gardens, We liked everything , The location is superb The staff is extremely friendly and helpful The hotel is gorgous and the room we stayed in is spacious and just fantastic overall We were very happy to find this hotel in London and plan to stay again next time we are in town We will be recommending it to everyone 
33754,11 Cadogan Gardens, Room was very small and stuffy with very little natural light Overpriced for the room we received , Hotel design was lovely with great period features Great location in the heart of the city 
33755,11 Cadogan Gardens, Nothing, Everything about this boutique hotel was just right from the moment I booked Attention to details and the service was out of this world My new hangout in London
33756,11 Cadogan Gardens,No Negative, This is a classic old style English boutique hotel with a chic and modern update at least in the public spaces The service was impeccable the concierges were all so charming extra helpful and informed They knew what they were doing what we as tourists might need to know to go where we wanted to go how to make us feel extra comfortable 
33757,11 Cadogan Gardens, The room was quite small although that was because of the architecture of the building There was a distinct lack of warmth from some staff particularly at reception , Very comfortable like an old club
33758,11 Cadogan Gardens, Had a minor issue with the shower , Lovely stay in a comfortable and cosy room The room was a little smaller than used to as had two large suitcases but beautiful otherwise Only stayed for two nights and didn t really explore the rest of the hotel until checking out Wish I had done this earlier as a beautiful establishment Concierge was extremely helpful and friendly 
33759,11 Cadogan Gardens, Nothing, Stayed here for one night last month Fantastic location and beautiful building There was a minor maintenence issue which occurred during our stay and it was dealt with promptly and professionally by the lovely staff The concierge was also so friendly and nice to my son Would definitely recommend this hotel 
33760,11 Cadogan Gardens, Bathroom was a little small but nice marble work , Such a stunning small hotel we were greeted by porter luggage taken straight to our room The deluxe king upgrade was a surprise room was spacious lovely decor high ceilings and quiet from street view Beautifully renovated in the traditional English antique style nothing left well designed interior Breakfasts in restaurant were scrumptious especially the tasty sausages with full cooked English Fresh fruits and great selection of salmon pastries cheese al a carte menu options Wimbledon was setup for viewing in terrace bar nice area to chillax and e hoy a well deserved cocktail or bubbles I would totally recommend this hotel close to Kings rd for shopping in middle of Chelsea stunning part of London Heading back again in September with friends 
33761,11 Cadogan Gardens, Weird decor entire room black including the ceiling Poor climate control Very loud room next to the terrace bar Service very mediocre overall , Great location great bathroom 
33762,11 Cadogan Gardens,No Negative, The staff is very welcoming and very nice I forgot my telephone they went to look for it advised that they had found my amex card as well and kept them for me to collect it later I like the look of the house so British and so far from those big palaces 
33763,11 Cadogan Gardens,No Negative, The whole experience from start to finish was exceptional The service is second to none beautiful room and a fantastic breakfast You made my 30th birthday truly memorable a big thank you to all the team 
33764,11 Cadogan Gardens, Can t think of a single thing i d change , Service was amazing staff were helpful friendly and couldn t do enough for us The rooms were beautiful and the hotel was just lovely 
33765,11 Cadogan Gardens, having a lift , Large apartment very well equipped with traditional old British furniture Very convenient location nice bar in house and a good restaurant Really great place 
33766,11 Cadogan Gardens, We HATED the dark decor EVERYWHERE have never stayed in such a tiny room with an even tinier bathroom although it was comfortable , Excellent comfortable bed Staff exceptionally good helpful 
33767,11 Cadogan Gardens,No Negative, Unbelievable I have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world but and this was right up there with the best of them I could not fault anything nor did I want to 
33768,11 Cadogan Gardens, Totally impractical room The bathroom had no space at all for toiletries There was nowhere in front of a mirror apart from sitting on the floor to dry your hair The bed was too big for space so you constantly bumped into it And this was one we paid to upgrade to , Fabulous location and exceptionally pleasant staff
33769,11 Cadogan Gardens, Still under renovation so building noise still a problem and the whole outside is covered in scaffolding , Breakfast amazing location perfect for west end Kings road area 
33770,11 Cadogan Gardens, The Hotel was being renovated inside and outside There were workers all over the place It wasn t mentioned when I made my reservation It wasn t restful I was very disappointed The hotel very dark inside , the staff was friendly
33771,11 Cadogan Gardens, The radiator in the room was a bit noisy but the staff were so kind and helpful even reserving another room for us they even refunded us some of our money because of this, Stayed in presidential suite Amazing room So big and beautifully decorated Very friendly staff Amazing service and a brilliant time Will be returning highly recommended
33772,11 Cadogan Gardens, The plug sockets in the room where not near a mirror so made it a little difficult to style our hair The lighting wasn t very good to apply make up very important to women, The hotel was unique the staff where friendly very approachable and couldn t do enough to make sure our stay was enjoyable and memorable
33773,11 Cadogan Gardens, The renovations were still on going and I thought that they might have almost finished in December They had started in January 2015 We were woken up to sound of heavy drilling and banging at 8 15am We received complimentary breakfast on our last day which was very kind of hotel manager The view from the window was of heating and ventilation equipment and we were unable to get fresh air into the room My friend struggled with that enormously There was no daylight getting into the room We couldn t see outside at all from our room Room not up to par as other 5 hotels we have stayed in in London We come to London 3 4 times a year , Staff amazing very helpful and couldn t have done more for us
33774,11 Cadogan Gardens, I expected scaffolding on the outside but not the disruption inside Looked at 3 rooms but all tired No desk dressing table or refrigerator Very noisy in the morning due to builders on the floors above , The staff were as helpful as they could be under the circumstances
33775,11 Cadogan Gardens, The entire hotel is undergoing a significant renovation which I was unaware of at time of booking As such there was a very limited number of suites The suite I was given was tired and the bathroom was extremely small with a shower crammed into a small area beside the toilet Not at all appropriate for what is suppose to be a 5 star hotel Although clear t, Location is very good 
33776,11 Cadogan Gardens, A lot of building work going on as part of refurbishments lots of scaffolding around and lots of construction noise , I loved that it was unique sumptuous and full of character very comfortable bed and pillows magnificent breakfast and very helpful friendly staff 
33777,11 Cadogan Gardens, Just because I m a naturally hot person I found the room and hotel too hot BUT that s just me my husband thought it was cosy ha, We stayed in a junior suite for 2 nights the room on arrival was absolutely amazing The second night was our wedding night and when we got back to the room after the wedding it was absolutely beautifully decorated with rose petals slippers either side of the bed and on the table they d placed champagne on ice AMAZING Also the cooked breakfast was delicious 
33778,11 Cadogan Gardens, That we were not informed that is was being refurbished, They upgraded us to an incredible suite which was an amazing surprise after arriving there and feeling a little disappointed that we had not been told that it was in the process of being refurbished Think that maybe for the price of that hotel guests should be informed 
33779,11 Cadogan Gardens, breakfast closed at 11 15 on a SATURDAY MORNING DESPITE INFO FROM MANAGER IT WAS OPEN TILL 11 30 WE WERE THEREFORE DENIED B FAST NO BAR NO BATHROOM STORAGE SPACE NO HAIRDRYING LOCATION UNLESS SITTING ON BED, FOOD WAS GOOD AND SERVICE
