327305,Hotel Well and Come, The room was rather small The breakfast was ok but not special , The hotel was comfortable and new Situated just outside the busy centre meant we could find on road parking for our hire car which is free overnight and we paid just a few euros for morning parking 
327306,Hotel Well and Come, More light in bathroom would be welcomed, Very modern and comfortable hotel Breakfast offers a good choice coffee is excellent Convenient location close to subway Noise from street quite high is fully blocked by windows if closed Wi Fi of good quality Note Hotel is not suitable for biz trip No table in the room 
327307,Hotel Well and Come,No Negative, Second stay and we would stay here again and again Centrally located near the Sagrada Familia Gracia and the L Eixample areas Fantastic food within walking distance Close to buses and trains And the roof top dipping pool is a nice way to cool off after exploring all day Wonderful hotel 
327308,Hotel Well and Come,No Negative, Perfect for business trips very comfortable and wifi in the rooms Is located at the same door of the metro and next to buses so is at the perfect place and has great connections to get to the main train station It has a very well equipped gym 
327309,Hotel Well and Come, Only reason I wouldn t return to this hotel is location it s around 15min walks to the main shopping area and its 20 25min cab from the beach front where It s very buzzy down near the beach with loads of restaurants etc there isn t anywhere walking distance from the hotel we kept getting lost so ended up getting taxis everywhere Next time I will stay along the beach front as you have a lot more around you won t need to get as many taxis , I loved the hotel We enjoyed staying at this hotel It was very clean and modern small boutique hotel I like the d cor and the roof top pool was a great touch rooms cleaned everyday fresh towels Staff very helpful and friendly 
327310,Hotel Well and Come,No Negative, The staff was exceptionally helpful and kind The room was clean and comfortable and the hotel very clean in general Rooftop poolside beyond expectation day and night 
327311,Hotel Well and Come, The Terrace was nice but was next to three solid walls to flats so no view so we didn t really use it Most of the time you had to go down stairs from the pool to order a drink to then come back up again Occasionally the staff would take your order Would recommend re installing their pool bar or supply a phone to call down for drinks No information in the room about the hotel or what to do around Barcelona which is disappointing for us new comers No dressing table so everything had to be done in the bathroom for a mirror No milk for tea Please change the music every so often around the pool , We both loved the room and especially the comfortable bed The room was both modern and well air conditioned Bathroom shower was superb Staff were superb and will give you the best advice for getting around Pool was just enough to cool down with a nice enough view Drinks are served to the pool area Breakfast catered enough variety for both of us The free mini bar was great No alcohol though Hotel staff advised us to get the T10 ticket for the Metro Best thing we bought for getting around for a few euros We loved the modern boutique feel to this hotel and felt very welcomed every time we set foot in the building Highly recommended 
327312,Hotel Well and Come,No Negative, Very good hotel for visitors of Barcelona in Business in area with taxis and underground trains next to it at the central barcelona street without noise The airport shuttle is very quick but you can also go to hotel with taxi from Airport Barcelona the service is very good we have cafe at the rooms and drinks in a fridge with no costing money I like hotel to come back 
327313,Hotel Well and Come, I know this place is called a boutique hotel but I do expect the shower to be equipped with illumination Poncy design is one thing being able to see while performing ablutions is essential , The staff were extremely helpful
327314,Hotel Well and Come, Lack of information given at check in Didn t know what time the facilities opened e g the pool No information booklet in the room, Great choice of breakfast Lovely clean room Nice comfy bed
327315,Hotel Well and Come, It is very unfortunate that our bag with money passport and other items was stolen by 2 professional robbers as we sat in the lounge of the hotel This spoilt our stay as we had to spend time getting passport renewed and reporting it to the police Very lax security should not have happened inside the hotel , The hotel is small friendly and the pool on the rooftop is a really good place to chill out The rooms are compact but spotlessly clean and Gracia is on the doorstep 
327316,Hotel Well and Come, This is not a four star hotel, Room was very small had only one small mirror in the bath Not good at all for ladies dressing and make up View of the room is to a wall 
327317,Hotel Well and Come, Very slow with room service and not helpful with information or booking things locally Told me to just look online , Hotel is nicely designed and it has a great roof with pool 
327318,Hotel Well and Come, However the cleaning staff was terrible We had our room serviced twice during our stay the first time was OK The second the sheets were never changed they still had my make up on them They never gave us fresh cups it looked as though they just wiped or rinsed them out you could tell because there were still coffee remnants from the morning before in all the cups We had wine glasses that needed to be taken away and they were just left there They only refreshed some of the toiletries It was so obvious the little amount of effort that went into cleaning the room I was actually offended and insulted It also took all day Our room wasn t cleaned till almost 5pm When I expressed my concern and ask for clean cups I wasn t once offered an apology just told they would bring them in the morning with a very rude and curt response , the front desk staff was amazing they were so kind and helpful The pool is small but cute and the deck is nice 
327319,Hotel Well and Come, Ordered large bed but had 2 singles put together that we kept falling through This was our first trip away in 13 years following my Dads passing on two months ago so very special for us It was so dissapointing Especially as I called ahead 3 times to confirm and paid extra Room was small and paid extra for balcony that was overlooked by flats dogs barked throughout night View was two brick walls Horrible don t pay for balcony there is no point Swimming pool is catorgorised incorrectly It s more of a sitting pool , Hotel decoration modern and pleasant Clean and nice area 
327320,Hotel Well and Come, While the staff was very friendly receptive to questions and requests for help they made reservations for Guell Park and Familia Sagrada for which we were appreciative However the company with whom they deal was not known or listed with the park and we had to wait at least ten minutes for the tickets to be recognized For the cathedral a different staff member did not tell us that this agency doesn t offer the opportunity for an audioguide or guide and we couldn t access the second level closed to those with no specialized ticket This was extremely frustrating and disappointing Otherwise they were sensitive to our needs Our room was comfortable the cleaning staff very flexible and thorough We had a terrace which faced a another building so no real view Members of our family spent time on the rooftop where a pool is situated and the bar on the ground level It s a clean hotel and located in a great neighborhood We recommend a stay An aside there was a taxi strike countrywide so we had to take the metro to the train session pulling 2 suitcases each up and down stairs Many people helped us out however on the escalator to the train station two young men who in retrospect were likely watching us helped us with our luggage While doing so they opened my purse and stole my new wallet which contained many euros and dollars thus they made a haul I wouldn t have been aware except a man yelled that I d been robbed Unfortunately our timing was such that I couldn t report it to the police at the entrance of the line for train travel which was also frustrating and discouraging Luckily my passport was in a zippered pouch as I had and have no other identification necessitating much hassle back home needing to reapply and replace much needed information ,No Positive
327321,Hotel Well and Come, First room was crap We opened the window and faced a wall We complained and were given a better room at front of hotel Internet went down on first night and was down for about a half day That was annoying in this day and age We booked a 5 night stay with breakfasts included At checkout they told us we only booked the 5 nights so we were shocked and they gave us 50 off meals I blame the meals confusion on booking com The hotel and meals deal was conveyed in an incredibly misleading manner The only reason we booked this particular Hotel was because the deal said breakfasts came with it The breakfast issue spoiled the next leg of our journey Also when we checked in they did not appear to be able to find out reservation from booking com The pool was tiny It was merely a dipping pool You couldn t swim in it , Overall the Hotel s staff were excellent and the Hotel itself was clean and well served by all staff Location wise the place was well situated near the Diagonal main street cutting through Barca Still a small hike to a lot of the touristy stuff but close enough 10min walk to La Pedrera and from there one can get the round city touring bus 
327322,Hotel Well and Come, There is a fitness room but it is rather small and lacks some basic equipment , Boutique hotel located in a good area Spacious rooms with balcony My room offered free water and drinks from the mini bar 
327323,Hotel Well and Come,No Negative, Out of the ordinary hotel with a small swimming pool at the roof just refreshing and a small gym with all state of the art machines one of each training machines plus free water and towels round the corner from the metro tube station 2 streets away from the main street Paseg Gracia with all the offices if you are here to work and all the tourist attractions such as the Gaudi houses if you are in as a visitor Great spot as the location gives easy access to both local restaurants if you look for the taste of real home made They have fast track check in at the hotel and the level of service is out of the ordinary to make you feel at home even if it s the first time you just pop in There are free drinks and coffee maker a coffee maker rather than a kettle at the room and the beds are really comfortable This is now my preferred spot in Barcelona 
327324,Hotel Well and Come,No Negative, The hotel is in located at the very heart of Barcelona business area with but just in a very quiet corner were I walked on my own and felt completely safe the area is vibrant with local cafes restaurants de catalonia local ones and I am just so pleased to have discovered this nice corner of the city thanks to the hotel All reception staff are locals and are extremely helpful with directions and recommendations on the best places to go visiting or eating which may just be every single place around I did initially not book breakfast but I must recommend having breakfast at the place as they have plenty of fairtrade products local produce hadmade bread and pastry which was delicious and is worth to have and avoid the hassle of shopping around The hotel is all made of wooden and stone and is a really clean place indeed the level of cleanliness if outstanding and really makes a difference they have coffee machines in the rooms and a free mini bar they look at every detail so it s worth every penny paid 
327325,Hotel Well and Come, No chairs and table chaise lounge i stead weak and intermittent wifi, Staff very helpful neat and classy environment tasty breakfast and a great location
327326,Hotel Well and Come, The property is more expensive than most of the four stars hotels in Barcelona and therefore we expected better services facilities but we were slightly disappointed The cleaning ladies were opening the door of the room without knocking more than one time every day The rooms do not have the Do Not Disturb sign and doors can t be locked The breakfast was Ok When we asked we were told that the breakfast stays until 11 In the last day of my trip I woke up late jogged around the hotel then entered to have a light breakfast at around 10 30 The lady told me that they closed the buffet and I was only allowed to make coffee The rooms are VERY close to each other You can easily hear people s talks from the other rooms It happened at least three times that we woke up when our neighbors entered or left their rooms , The location of the property was the most important thing about it 
327327,Hotel Well and Come,No Negative, I would stay again and again at this hotel It s the perfect location near public transport and in walking distance to many attractions bars restaurants shopping opportunities etc but in a not touristy street The rooms are exactly what you need for a stay in the city clean very comfortable bed tasteful design The staff was super friendly and always ready to help And a very nice bonus is the rooftop terrace with a small pool where you can relax after a busy day of sightseeing Perfect stay 
327328,Hotel Well and Come, The hotel didn t take American Express to pay for the accommodations even though I made the reservation on Booking com with the same card Had I not had my Visa card my entire trip could have been ruined In terms of the room the bathroom has unusual low lighting If you have poor vision in the dark the shower area might be a problem given the lighting The cab ride from the airport will be about 50 , The hotel had a rooftop with a pool I also liked that it was located in a very nice walkable neighborhood 
327329,Hotel Well and Come, Small bar and communal areas Would have been nice to have a coffee or drink on the rooftop but I went off exploring tje city instead, Nice decoration Very clean Lovely rooftop pool Staff very friendly and helpful
327330,Hotel Well and Come, There were ants in several areas of the room I suggest they take care of that issue because otherwise it is a great hotel , Friendly staff good location and comfortable room 
327331,Hotel Well and Come, Shower bathroom layout is a bit awkward the shower is great however there is no ventilation or door to the shower so the toilet area tends to get really wet because it is in the same space and the entire room fogs up We had to open the main room window to let all the steam out, Service was lovely especially the guy who checked us in We had some problems with our Australian credit card and he was nothing but friendly and patient throughout The room was beautiful even though it was small it had everything we needed The bed was incredibly comfy Loved the ambience of the lobby and the afternoon tea Would definitely stay again if we are back in Barcelona Location might be a little out depending on what you are there to do but we found it fine especially as the Verdaguer metro station exit is about 50m away 
327332,Hotel Well and Come, I was rather disappointed by the size of the hotel room given the fact how much we paid per night the room was very small just enough space for the beds , Breakfast was really good everything very fresh and tasty re filled often The hotel lobby is very well designed and decorated really cosy and welcoming Staff friendly and with good English 
327333,Hotel Well and Come, Room was a tad small , Lovely hotel with a great bathroom comfortable bed friendly staff and a nice pool which we couldnt use because of the cool weather Location is great 
327334,Hotel Well and Come, The shower did not have an overhead light It was like taking a shower in a cave The toilet shower had only a strip of lighting floor to ceiling which was not enough We could not turn on the light in the toilet shower without also turning on the light over the sink Because there wasn t a wall between the sink area and the bed area just open shelving we could not have a night light The view was nothing to write about just laundry hanging from the apartment balconies and windows around the hotel But we weren t in the room that much so that really didn t matter , The staff seemed to be able to accommodate guests in what ever language they spoke I heard staff speaking English French German Spanish Catalan They probably could speak more They gave us great recommendations for restaurants every night Breakfast was great The hotel was a short taxi ride or bus ride away from the cathedral and Gruell Park which is what I wanted to see We were also able to walk to see an apartment building designed by Gaudi The bed was comfortable The room was not spacious but it was comfortable 
327335,Hotel Well and Come, Nothing, The staff was really friendly and helpful The room was nice with the rainshower and the mini bar with snacks and drinks free of charge was a nice treat 
327336,Hotel Well and Come, I actually cannot think of anything that they could improve, Upon arrival the staff were so friendly They gave us a map and showed us all of the best tapas restaurants and places to go and visit Nothing was ever too much trouble for them They were always very friendly and polite The hotel was beautifully designed and looked exactly like the photos on the website The cleanliness and over layout was lovely and the rooms were so perfect The beds are actually so comfortable I would definitely come back to this hotel and recommend it to others 
327337,Hotel Well and Come, Maybe the room could have been a little bigger but for a 3 night city stay it was absolutely fine Breakfast was a bit expensive and so we wandered out and ate in one of the many cafe s nearby , Great boutique hotel that was a delight to stay in Brilliant location only 50m from Verdgauer metro stop and 10 mins walk from La Sagrada Familia Roof terrace and plunge pool was a real bonus 
327338,Hotel Well and Come, Breakfast was nice but slightly overpriced at 14 , Fantastic hotel Clean new and great facilities Staff were friendly helpful and went the extra mile Bedrooms were a good size and the rainfall shower was brilliant Excellent location Couldn t recommend it enough 
327339,Hotel Well and Come, Some English language tv channels , Really comfortable beds lovely roof terrace complimentary drinks and snacks and very quiet room despite being only metres from main roads and a metro station The staff were very friendly and helpful too 
327340,Hotel Well and Come, Bathroom smelt of drains cleaning staff not consistent when replacing drinks and toiletries Only 2 coffee pods supplied one decaf the other normal coffee Not enough for room Bought our own I the end reception lady didn t really see the problem just told me we would have to pay for more Not good enough , Reception staff foyer pool comfortable beds 
327341,Hotel Well and Come, There s nothing we didn t like , I thought the fact that we had free mini bar was really sweet We were also kindly invited to a welcome drink so it was great 
327342,Hotel Well and Come, The room is not huge and as such not ideal for a longer stay or big shoppers A couple drawers or even baskets in the shelves would be nice in order to be able unpack our suitcases The desk which folds up from the wall is OK to write postcards or check emails but may be too small for a business traveller who must work in the room , A fresh modern design a well equipped if very compact room with a comfortable bed Great location very quiet on the courtyard side very friendly and helpful staff Internet worked perfectly and had the bandwidth to cover 3 devices at one time in our room There is a a mall but adequate fitness room A nice lobby bar is great for a last drink before bed We did not have breakfast in the hotel but it smelled great in the morning 
327343,Hotel Well and Come,No Negative, Great choice for a 4 night City Break in good location just 50 metre from Metro so easy access to all the sights This fresh Boutique Hotel offered super amenities and extras including welcome drink afternoon tea comfy beds super showers lovely roof terrace and fridge stocked with free soft drinks daily
327344,Hotel Well and Come, Standard rooms are adequate but with no view at all unless you like walls The pricing structure seemed to change every day We paid 144 per night for a standard room WITHOUT breakfast Checking on booking com whilst trying to resolve a problem with the costs we thought we d paid the extra for breakfast the same room was available WITH breakfast for 98 and a delux room 132 WITH breakfast This may be a problem with booking com and not the hotel but the staff couldn t resolve this to our satisfaction All they could offer was a reduction in breakfast cost of 2 Was difficult to locate the hotel as we forgot to take the street number with us , Location was very good with the metro just minutes away There were several small Bodegas restaurants very near but even better ones just 10 minutes walk away The staff were very helpful and friendly and allowed us to stay in a Delux room for one of our 3 nights Breakfast was plentiful but sometimes the hot selections were only warm 
327345,Hotel Well and Come, The hotel is on the outskirts of the tourist area but is very close to the metro which will take you directly to the gothic quarter , The bed was super comfy and the room quiet at night The free stocked minibar non alcoholic was a great touch The staff were excellent and very helpful The hotel had a chilled atmosphere
327346,Hotel Well and Come, I expected to see more of a view from the window and the roof but they were still good features , Very well looked after easy check in great value for money 
327347,Hotel Well and Come,No Negative, The hotel lobby was beautifully decorated with a great atmosphere The staff were all incredibly helpful and polite The hotel is in a fantastic location being a 2min walk away from the Verdaguer Metro stop 8 min walk from main shopping strip Passeig de Gracia as well as many other major sites within walking distance 
327348,Hotel Well and Come,No Negative, Fantastic hotel right in the center of all the major sights of Barcelona Easy to get to from the Airport via the Metro about 45 minutes Rooms were spacious I had originally booked a room with a Terrace but found it a little too dark so moved to another room that faced the street with a balcony Beautiful room with an amazing shower and facilities The welcome drink was much appreciated and the cost of drinks at the bar was very reasonable 
327349,Hotel Well and Come, Breakfast is all the same for days Would be better to make small changes everyday , Staff was helpful The welcome drink is a happy surprise Good location Close to Sagrada Familia very close to subway station 
327350,Hotel Well and Come,No Negative, The staff was amazing they helped me to prepare a wine tasting I had with my client Also they recommended me the places to eat etc The hotel is new and beautiful great views from the roof my room was quiet and comfortable Cannot ask for more and totally recommend for everybody 
327351,Hotel Well and Come,No Negative, Great location Walking distance to La Sagrada Familia Casa Batllo was exceptional Very helpful gentlemen that checked us in he gave us the best tips to get around town and where to eat Rooftop has a pool with lounge chairs to have a drink and unwind after a long day walking 
327352,Hotel Well and Come, Unfortunately we had some issue with the shower drainpipe and the heating in the room The first night was impossible to sleep On the following morning my boyfriend told the receptionist the issue about the drainpipe and the heating but when we returned at the hotel nothing had changed I had to complain with the night staff he offered us to sleep in a different room It was better but on the following day we had to change again the room So we slept in 3 different rooms in 3 nights We got free breakfast as compensation for the issues , Perfect location close to metro station The bed was very comfortable Nice decor Thumbs up for Carlos O the night staff he was very helpful 
327353,Hotel Well and Come, The room was pretty small and badly soundproofed There was free Nespresso coffee but you were only given 2 pods a day and no milk No bathtub shower only , Clean and friendly staff 
327354,Hotel Well and Come, The rain shower did not work only the hand shower Also the day bed upholstery did not look terribly clean , The location is excellent the lobby is nicely decorated and the breakfast was decent 
327355,Hotel Well and Come, I didn t liked my room view it was at the back side of the hotel , Great botique hotel was served a free welcome drink The reception i extremely nice helped about everything Very close to the metro 1 minute walk 
327356,Hotel Well and Come, The rooms are quite noisy in the morning , Great staff nice modern hotel nice roof top swimming pool free snacks in the room coffee machine in the room free welcome drinks
327357,Hotel Well and Come,No Negative, The staff were SO accommodating to us a young group which was reassuring as some staff can be hostile to teenagers but they were so friendly helpful chatty funny and absolutely made the hotel for us 
327358,Hotel Well and Come, It was perfect Everything perfect , Everything perfect stay Hotel was clean stuff were helpful it was truly the perfect stay Will stay again 100 and recommend to everyone traveling to Barcelona

327360,Hotel Well and Come, Nothing much really only as a new hotel you can smell a bit from it which is fine for me , Fantastic service crew front desk and bartender welcome you warmly and make you feel like home Also everyone is very helpful and reliable 
327361,Hotel Well and Come, Literally the only thing that could have been a bit better was the 3rd bed we had in the room could have been a bit more comfy The two main beds were great but the 3rd was a foam mattress rather than an actual spring mattress , Staff absolutely lovely welcoming and very helpful Room was very nice and shower was great Rooftop was a lovely place to sit and the breakfast offered a wide variety of options Overall an brilliant place to stay and would definitely stay again Absolutely recommend 
327362,Hotel Well and Come, The swim pool is only in the roof and cool during winter , The hotel has a fire chimeney in the recepcion and has very comfortable beds The reception persons help with a taxi for the airport and taxi for the office and taxi for the restaurant 
327363,Hotel Well and Come, Room was quite small but made up for by great central location of hotel, Really nice to be given a welcome voucher for one free drink each even champagne if you want it 
327364,Hotel Well and Come, Staff could be a bit nicer didn t feel really welcomed The lady that cleans the rooms was very rude on multiple occasions, Room is big and clean Location is good
327365,Hotel Well and Come,No Negative, Elegant clean and modern furniture I always look after the details and i was amazed when i saw GROHE collection in the bathroom Such detailed thing gives you a message on their level of care I would also like to mention the staff hospitality the smile is drawn in their faces all the time Special thanks to the receptionist Victor who was supportive all the time The location is superb where the hotel is surrounded by lots of cafe s decent restaurants bakeries groceries and pharmacies All of the above is provided with affordable price 
327366,Hotel Well and Come, There was a strange drain smell in the bathroom in the evenings sometimes which was odd but it sort of came and went so we could never quite work it out and thought complaining would be pointless , Free kit kat everyday Free tea and Nespresso coffee pods in the room Free welcome cava Room was larger than we had expected It was very comfortable and also quiet for a city centre location Staff were completely amazing and friendly they helped us with lots of queries recommendations and booking tickets the same price as booking yourself but better because the hotel can print and guarantee them They even let us have a late check out on the last day when I was very unwell Location was excellent We walked everywhere except Guell Park and Mount Tibidabo which are too far for walking really The roof terrace was lovely It was calm and peaceful with comfortable sun loungers and a view of mount Tibidabo One night we decided to watch netflix on the roof wifi was excellent in our pyjamas the lovely reception lady brought us wine and a duvet it was my favourite night in Barcelona We didn t try the breakfast as the booking com price was too expensive but if you book directly with the hotel it was half the price so worth remembering for another time There is a bakery next door which was super cheap 
327367,Hotel Well and Come, It was most inconvenient to find the room has no desk but only a low bench next to the bed The room was quite small and narrow Fortunately the hotel added a simple desk in our room after our request The hotel needs to replace the low bench with a proper desk which would not cost much I saw a few of the low benches in the corridor and assumed that other guests had made similar requests The internet in our room on the 3rd floor did not work for three days and apparently fixed it in the last day of our 4 day stay It would have been helpful if the hotel website provides a few lines of detailed information to guide first time visitors more easily find the location including that from the airport It was confusing when we arrived at the Verdaguer Metro Station which has multiple exists We ended up spending 20 min to find the hotel after getting off the Metro The Gym in the basement has poor ventilation and smelled bad , Hotel Well and Come is in an excellent location with 2 min walk out of Girona Exit of the Verdaguer Metro Station where you can easily get on Metro L4 the Yellow and L5 the Blue lines It took us 5 min walk to the main street Passig De Gracia and about 10 min to the Casa Mila The hotel provides a rich breakfast and free drinks in the mini bar Our room was very quiet with sound proof double layered windows The bed is very comfortable and the room was warm for the cold winter days during our visit to Barcelona The hotel reception staff were very friendly and responsive to our requests for a desk in the room and to make available two single beds instead of one double bed I used the free gym everyday 
327368,Hotel Well and Come, Really desappointed with A we could clearly hear our neighbour walking and speaking in the nearby room B we left in the room a samsung charger a pyjama trouser a special new bottle of shampoo and when we came back at the front desk of the hotel in the afternoon after themorning check out we were told that nothing was found left in the room and that we do not agree , Wine glass offered at arrival Personnel at the entrance is young nice and helpfull Warm and modern decoration Nescafe and amenities free in the room Not in the touristic center but not far walking Small and cosy not too big

327379,Hotel Well and Come, The rooms lack of a place for working no table No working place in the lobby neither only low tables The washbasin area isn t separated from the rest of the room a couple would lack of privacy for shaving hair drying or making up for instance The rooms have sometimes sewage odour in the shower area The breakfast is good but a bit too expensive for what is given , Excellent location Next to many good restaurants metro and shopping area The fitness centre gym is small but quite complete It has weights machines and cardio machines The lobby is cozy with a fireplace The rooms are big and the bed is comfortable Electrical plugs everywhere The wifi is fast consistent and you have to enter the codes only once

327486,Hotel Well and Come, Just one small problem in room 406 it had a common wall with the other building and you could hear everything from the local neighbours people with children who usually wake up at 07 30 go to work etc So I wouldn t necessarily recommend it I am sure other rooms are much more quiet , The standard room was ok 160 cm wide bed the minibar was daily renewed mineral water cola cola zero fanta orange and lemon espresso tea Location was good pretty central and close to the Sagrada Familia around 10 min by foot There is a subway station 50 meters from the hotel Verdaguer The staff was very nice and customer oriented my best regards to them The owner of the hotel was also very nice and friendly
