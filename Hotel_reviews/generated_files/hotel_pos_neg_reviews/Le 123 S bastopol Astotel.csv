41518,Le 123 S bastopol Astotel,No Negative, My best friend and I had a fantastic stay at Le 123 Sebastopol The theater theme is really fun as there is so much to take in so definitely tour the hotel when you arrive There is even a private movie theater downstairs along with a cute private patio out back We traveled overnight and were exhausted so they checked us in early to catch a nap which was so appreciated The room was adorably decorated Very girly and perfect for us Plus we had a quaint little balcony where we sipped our wine and watched the streets below The area is a little less congested than others but easy to walk or metro to many attractions The best reason to stay at the hotel is definitely the staff They are warm and accommodating My favorite was the late night crew as we were often coming back after hours Serge and Xavier are wonderful and made our stay one we will always remember If you are unsure where to go we absolutely recommend Le 123 Sebastopol 
41519,Le 123 S bastopol Astotel, The size of the rooms was much smaller than expected the view was dull the breakfast had to be purchased , Very stylish decorated with flair and definitely unique The afternoon spread featuring coffee water juices and a variety of pastries which was not only free of charge in the hotel but in any of the hotels that are part of the same Paris chain a nice touch I thought The L Occitane en Provence toiletries in the bathroom were also nice 
41520,Le 123 S bastopol Astotel,No Negative, This was mysecond stay at this hotel which in itself should tell you what I think of it The staff at the hotel are wonderful and could not be more helpful They clearly enjoy working there Amazingly they remembered me from my visit three months ago When we left they waived my breakfast charges 
41521,Le 123 S bastopol Astotel,No Negative, Location was great Rooms were really large for that area Air conditioning was fantastic Shower was nice Great recommendations from staff on local cafes 
41522,Le 123 S bastopol Astotel, bathrooms a little cramped, Staff were excellent which is a pleasant surprise in Paris Quirky and fresh d cor very pleasing Complimentary afternoon tea and snacks a nice and unusual touch
41523,Le 123 S bastopol Astotel, Breakfast table and seating very uncomfortable Small very low tables and narrow squeezing chairs But I guess it s typical for Paris Not sure why but we did not have any wardrobe in our room Just a bar with 5 hangers , Friendly staff The hotel is perfectly located just next to a Metro entrance Clean rooms We really liked it 
41524,Le 123 S bastopol Astotel, All was good , Very good hotel in Paris Good breakfast and afternoon snack Free minibar non alcoholic Nice rooms and very good shower Nice staff 
41525,Le 123 S bastopol Astotel, , Very cool theme cinema the private cinema room is a nice extra but I haven t tried it hotel staff was very nice and paid lots of attention free mini bar nice breakfast with lots of choice nice bathroom amenities
41526,Le 123 S bastopol Astotel,No Negative, The room was great The was very comfortable and the bathroom was spotless The shower head was wide and had several adjustments for the spray of the water and the height They even provided a safe in the room There were several electrical outlets by the desk which was awesome We would definitely stay here again 
41527,Le 123 S bastopol Astotel, I don t have anything significant but there could have been a second pillow in the room Maybe they had some on demand I didn t ask so don t know nothing that alters my overall impression of the hotel though , This is really an excellent hotel The staff is very friendly and service minded Breakfast was great and the atmosphere of the hotel is also very nice There is also free afternoon tea included which was a nice little surprise 
41528,Le 123 S bastopol Astotel, The buffet was not worth the 14 euros and if you know what good french croissants and coffee taste like you will be disappointed The breakfast selections seemed to cater more for travelers who might not care There are a few cafes nearby who do a better job The neighborhood is decent during the day very commercial at night it s a little transient but if you re used to big cities it won t bother you The decor is a bit odd kind of kitschy but it s mostly clean and bright Hooks in the bathroom for towels and robes would be nice This is not a place to go if you want a classic french experience it has more of a Tokyo vibe However I would go back again the staff make the experience excellent , The staff was absolutely superb warm extremely helpful and funny with only one or two exceptions The location is excellent for getting around Paris easily The rooms were clean and modern a very unique hotel surprisingly quiet and restful 
41529,Le 123 S bastopol Astotel, I can t think of any thing , Starting from the front desk to the house keeping all and all perfect Top class hospitality cleanness room comfort etc Breakfast one of the best hotel breakfast I ve ever had Afternoon complimentary drinks desserts mini bar with offerings on the house and the TV with free movie options are bonus

41533,Le 123 S bastopol Astotel, For Paris standards the room size is ok In general is small Small bathroom Do not choose the Superior Room Almost the same size of other rooms not a good value I was traveling with family and friends 7 people When I arrived I had the feeling that the manager was not happy with all those people in the front desk I did not feel comfortable with that That was not my first time in this hotel and the last time my experience was much better , Breakfast was good Location is not perfect but not bad also Staff was very kind and helpful comfortable beds Free mini bar Child friendly

41551,Le 123 S bastopol Astotel, Not their problem actually But for someone like myself who was using the hop in hop off buses to see Paris the nearest bus stop was a good 30 minutes walk away No way of coming back to the hotel for a quick refresh as the place is slightly away from the major tourist areas ,No Positive
41552,Le 123 S bastopol Astotel, Although the location is great close to the subway it gets worse quite soon if you walk a few blocks north, Outstanding breakfast room was nice and romantic very comfortable bed great cocktail bar in the evenings free snacks during the day cinema downstairs
41553,Le 123 S bastopol Astotel, The floors were dirty especially by the night tables which may have been a result of a late check out before us and a rushed cleaning job There were also stains on the headboard and on the cover at the foot of the bed that made me question the overall cleanliness of the hotel , Staff was super friendly and helpful allowing us to check in early leave our luggage in a secure spot til the room was ready and directing us to nearest metro etc Great restaurant suggestions as well We really liked the convenience of breakfast and being able to grab a snack mid day more fruit would be good Shower was amazing big and it drained very well Products supplied by the hotel shampoo conditioner body gel and hand soap were awesome Didn t get to use the gym facilities but it looked pretty good and was very clean 
41554,Le 123 S bastopol Astotel, Two maintenance guys stormed into my room at 8 am while I was asleep which scared me half to death I couldn t believe how fast they opened my locked door Like I said though the manager was very apologetic and I was refunded for this incident Very important how businesses handle complaints and this one aced it , The location is perfect for my work I love the breakfast and also the buffet of free cakes cookies and coffee available all afternoon Great to relax until my room was being prepared Very friendly and helpful staff I had an unfortunate experience one morning which they immediately recognized took responsibility and refunded me for the inconvenience Great customer service
