476205,Windsor Hotel Milano, I did lose my blouse in the room it could have been taken away with hotel linen but it was not found in the end , good location near the tube station and central station also next to savoi hotel where you can have good meal in a luxurious atmosphere 
476206,Windsor Hotel Milano, dirty towels unhelpful staff at breakfast full breakfast wasn t available until 30mins into sitting Double bed was two single bed put together with separate sheets Construction noise in neighboring rooms started at 8am at weekend no notice of this was given, bed was very comfortable
476207,Windsor Hotel Milano, It seems churlish to find fault with The Windsor Hotel but the only thing that i can think of is the lack of a computer for the guests to use Oh and a perennial complaint from a british perspective the lack of tea making facilities in the room Both things that will only apply to a tiny fraction of the hotel s guests i m sure , Superb breakfast in the hotel restaurant The staff were helpful the room was clean and comfortable we had a really great stay We travelled around Italy using the railways and the hotel is in a handy location between the two main stations There was a metro station a few yards away so any trip around the city was a piece of cake 
476208,Windsor Hotel Milano, The room they provided was close to the tram line so noise up until about 12pm at night , Very nice standard room which included a generous continental breakfast Staff very helpful and friendly 
476209,Windsor Hotel Milano, The tram noise The refrigerator was not cooling Not best location for tourists , Nice clean hotel good breakfast very nice staff Metro and tram stops nearby Good air conditioning very good value for price 
476210,Windsor Hotel Milano, A little bit of noise from trams outside but didnt really bother us , Lovely big rooms huge bathroom huge comfy beds a cracking breakfast and great staff A good location a short walk for access to city sights transport and restaurants 
476211,Windsor Hotel Milano, I want to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the service I received during my stay in Windsor Hotel Although it s a four star hotel the things that they allow themselves to do towards their guests are absolutely disrespectful They don t deserve even a one star I was woken up early in the morning 8 40 a m by the sound of a hammer and then a heavy drill What a wonderful beginning of the day being on vocation At the reception desk I was informed that there was nothing to complain about they are sorry but there was just a complete reconstruction of 5 rooms in their hotel and this persistent sound would continue from 8 40 a m till 4 00 p m I was offered a room on the upper floor but does it make sense The sound was everywhere since it was not like changing a picture from one place to another one it was a complete reconstruction Is it fair to your guests being put in front of the fact of waking up every morning at 8 40 with such a pleasant sound of the knocking hammer and the drill leaving no other options If it was possible on Booking com I would attach the video with this terrible sound so you could feel it They asked me to give them my credit card for a guarantee when I was checking in and having no idea what I m going to deal with In such cases I would like to take the credit card of Windsor Hotel and ask them to compensate my spoiled holiday and their unbearable service Luckily my bad experience in this hotel lasted for 2 days but I felt so sorry for people who had a longer stay or guests with small children I saw a couple of other guests at the reception desk who were interested in what was going on To my mind respectful hotels which do care about their reputation will never force their guests to go through this stress and sufferings on vocation These respectful hotels do close for a period of reconstruction in order not to disturb their clients and open again when everything is ready ,No Positive
476212,Windsor Hotel Milano, The single room was probably the smallest hotel room I ve ever seen in my life They are not renovated and the bathroom utilities were outdated Would never consider for a long stay , Location walking distance from Porta Nuova and Corso Como
476213,Windsor Hotel Milano, Building work happening in hotel and lots of banging from really early in the morning plus water not available from 11 4 on one particular day Not good , Room lovely and clean
476214,Windsor Hotel Milano, Not the best type of hotel for a leisure trip more for a business stay , Lovely breakfast and best scrambled egg ever Close to the subway and restaurants and supermarket

476218,Windsor Hotel Milano, We ate twice at the adjacent restaurant Clothilde once for lunch and once for breakfast We found the staff arrogant and unhelpful We arrived at noon and took a seat at the front window and ordered from the menu on the table After our order was placed a different server informed us the eggs could not be cooked anymore and said I should order from the lunch menu and handed me one I asked if I could order another muesli and yogurt instead since that order was accepted already and a coffee He said okay and left After some time only one order of Muesli and one coffee was served We told our 1st waiter that we had ordered two of each and he left Some minutes later he returned with a smaller bowl with a tiny amount a yogurt and a pile of cornflakes no muesli At that point we gave up finished our coffees paid the bill and left Our second experience was at the breakfast buffet provided to hotel guests between 7 am to 10 am In general the buffet offering was satisfactory to good The one complaint we had was the coffee served from an thermal dispenser was scorched and virtually undrinkable Though we did not complain about the coffee once again we found the staff aloof and arrogant not warm and welcoming Our Booking com reservation indicated a welcome drink upon arrival We arrived a 10 am after an international flight and the front desk asked us to wait until 2 30 pm Fortunately the hotel as able to provide a room by 12 30 pm but never offered or informed us about the beverage on arrival Lastly we found Rm 135 was somewhat dark It had a view over the lobby roof looking across to hotel rooms on the other wing Even with the blinds drawn during the daytime there was little direct sun exposure , Great central location 100 meters to Republica Metro Station or a 15 minute walk to Milan Centrale Station The value for money is good It has most the amenities one would expect for hotel of this caliber and price Front desk staff were helpful The room was nicely appointed clean and well maintained A coffee maker would be a nice addition 
476219,Windsor Hotel Milano, Walls are pretty thin so sometimes you can hear your neighbours But it depends on them and really doesn t bother you much , Very comfortable cozy and chic hotel Quiet and in a good location about 15 20 minutes walk to the center Near it is a good supermarket To use elevator you need your room key that makes you feel more secure during your stay Rooms are beautiful and in luxury colors Room service every day Inside you ll find everything you need for a comfortable stay Breakfasts are rich with delicious coffee and croissants eggs in differents variations porridge cheese meat fruits sweets juices water and so on Just wake up and enjoy your Italian morning I would highly recommend this wonderful hotel for all the travelers

476254,Windsor Hotel Milano, Breakfast wasn t delivered to the room even when the selection menu was hung on the door before 11pm the night before as said on the leaflet It meant I then had to ring reception in the morning ask where it was then speak to the kitchen to order again and I was nearly late for an interview When I wanted room service the night before it was even worse I had to go down to the restaurant and wait to order Bizarre The whole point was that I wanted to relax in my room with dinner and not go down to the very busy restaurant in my tracksuit bottoms and trainers it was ridiculous It should DEFINITELY not say room service on list of amenities Heating was not turned off when I rang reception I had to ring again because it became so hot in the room , Location good near metro

476260,Windsor Hotel Milano, The room comes with the bare essentials No TV minimum in room amenities not even a pen and pad Also not having any fitness facilities is a big minus in my opinion The staff was generally friendly but limited in number hence at times they seemed a bit overwhelmed The interiors could also do with a more modern design , Its location was very good not in the historic centre but still very central safe and well connected area The breakfast was of good variety and quantity WiFi speed was good Generally very clean and tidy

476274,Windsor Hotel Milano, stress your attention talking about hotel which rated with 4 stars first of all staff asks to present your credit card and makes copy of that without any notification people on reception desk are rude and do not care about guests comfort my attempt to explain issues with my door locker was absolutely ignored breakfast is fair waiters are indifferent issue even get cup of coffee , good location near by city center good cleaning service

476281,Windsor Hotel Milano, Front desk staff a bit brusque questions asked seemed to be a bit of a bother Other than that hotel was fine and I highly recommend it , Fabulous breakfast friendly wait staff Hotel central and close to metro trains restaurants Clean comfortable However request a room away from the front where the trolley goes by We were fortunate our friend not so 
476282,Windsor Hotel Milano, The WiFi connection wasn t great, I really enjoyed our stay here Good breakfast big and clean room very close to central Milan All in all a great hotel
476283,Windsor Hotel Milano, This hotel was a huge disappointment from the beginning The receptionist during our check in gave us the worst welcome that we could get Seriously he is by far the worst receptionist I ve ever seen The first thing that he asked was a credit card for guarantee and when I told him that I do not have a credit card with me but I was prepared to pay everything he wished by cash immediately he told me by quote that without a credit card it was not possible to do the check in seriously Then he realized probably his mistake after we get mad and he told us that suddenly everything was ok and that we can pay on the check out I have to mentioned that during our 2 nights stay none of the receptionist gave us a single hello or a goodnight when we passed in front of them It was the first time we felt so unwanted and unwelcome The other thing that I have to mention is that the room that they gave us Room 430 had such a disgusting smelly and dirty carpet that it was not possible to walk without shoes And I wonder why a 4 star hotel can not change this awful carpet , The location was very good The staff that works at the brasserie at night is very pleasant and professional The towels and the sheets were wonderful Really good quality 
476284,Windsor Hotel Milano, Would have liked tea coffee making facilities in the room , Very good staff on reception Comfortable rooms very comfortable beds Complimentary mini bar was a nice extra Provided take away breakfast as we had early train Location was good for our one night stay in Milan right near the train station

476288,Windsor Hotel Milano, Rooms facing the tram lines are pretty noisy with trams turning right in front of the hotel Staff is professional but not particularly friendly or helpful , The lobby and caf are very elegant and comfortable Good breakfast Room is clean with limited but welcome complimentary minibar

476291,Windsor Hotel Milano, Overheated room was only complaint when we first arrived Soon sorted once we fiddled with temperature controls and opened up the room , The Bed was really comfortable The room was very overheated The staff on the front desk where very polite and helpful Breakfast was lovely Would have liked to have stayed longer in Milan however we were travelling on to Barcelona next day Walking distance to train station was an advantage 
476292,Windsor Hotel Milano, I live in NYC so I m used to outside noise but this was ridiculous The room faced the street and the tram bus was very noisy passing and stopping every few minutes The sound of metal screeching and doors opening and closing It only stopped running from about 12am 5am The rooms do not look like what is advertised on Booking com Either booking com or the hotel is not marketing well The hotel website is deceiving too I was disappointed to see my room It was old and very small but it was for only one night so I went with it The shower was clean but tiny I m 5 1 and I bumped my elbow on the door trying to wash my hair Another con was that there was only 1 outlet No outlets in the bathroom The 1 outlet that was there was broken because it was not the correct size It we obvious people had tried to plug in their devices and it busted Maybe the other rooms are nicer but my experience indicated a 3 star hotel at best , The breakfast was good It was clean The location was ok for Milan could be better could be worse I walk pretty fast and it took me 20 25 min to reach center and Cathedral The day manager attempted to correct the wrong but what could he do with a bad hotel 
476293,Windsor Hotel Milano, Noise of the tram is heard through the night , Llocation of the hotel is excellent Tram stop is just on the front And metro is very near Rooms are large enough 
476294,Windsor Hotel Milano,No Negative, Everything was perfect it was actually the first hotel i have ever been that looks better in real life than the pictures I consider it better than the most 5 stars hotel i have visited Very good value for money 
476295,Windsor Hotel Milano, The street noise as our room was on the first floor on the street side , The size and furnishing of the room the free use of the mini bar items the welcome drink vouchers the breakfast quality and the the helpful staff The hotel is a very convenient short tram ride 9 from the train station and bus stand to the airport if one has heavy bags If travelling light it is an easy walk from Central Station 
476296,Windsor Hotel Milano, Probably the only negative was that breakfast seemed a little chaotic, Very tasty included breakfast Very handy for metro and trams and also waking to center about 15mins to duomo 
476297,Windsor Hotel Milano, Only downfall was it being a 30min walk to the centre There is a Metro stop right outside so not a massive problem , Great room excellent breakfast and happy staff 
476298,Windsor Hotel Milano, Maybe the air conditioning should be set on a higher temperature as it is already October We caught a cold because of that during the night Not too fancy for a 4 star but definitely a good choice compared to some others selling at similar prices , Very good location a short walk to the train station Porta Nuova Corso Como and even la Scala and Duomo Breakfast is served in a nice cafe that also serves locals for the morning espresso and the place turns into a nice dinner place in the evening 
476299,Windsor Hotel Milano, Nothing really I had stayed here before I think on the 6th floor and the room were bigger this time we were on the 4th floor but all good , Not far from the train station and only 15 minutes walk to the Dumo and the center of Milan The Hotel has a good breakfast and the drinks and nibbles at night are also good Not far to walk to anything

476305,Windsor Hotel Milano, Boring aria at night old rooms needs to be renovated, The newly renovated rooms rich breakfast hotel restaurant Wifi staff attitude clean reachable to all transportation options
476306,Windsor Hotel Milano, There was still some junk under one of the beds Also the rooms are relatively small they are high though and somewhat outdated The bathroom could use an upgrade perhaps there was some damage here and there and the bath didn t had an overflow thing Lastly the incheck procedure could be better I know that it s law to copy the ID cards of every tourist but at least put COPY on it with a pen or something ID fraud is a very serious matter , Small room good beds with possibility to ask for different pillows The complementary drinks in the mini bar are a nice extra The room was not completely silent but it was silent enough for sleeping Curtains block out the light completely allowing for an undisturbed night The location is good public transport is very well organised and the hotel is within walking distance of both the centre and the stations both with their own atmosphere A good choice for a few days in Milan 
476307,Windsor Hotel Milano, Not much to point out very good experience, Great value for money The room was very neat spacious and it had a very comfortable bed to rest after wandering around Milan They kindly reception you with a welcome drink and i got surprised by the rich breakfast buffet way better than we would expect at these rates Definitely a place to come back when in Milan

476311,Windsor Hotel Milano, Staffs were very unfriendly and rude They really need a training to learn how to respect and treat a customer of ah hotel The receptionist of hotel insisted to copy my debit card while I has paid the hotel fee 1 month in advance and when I asked for reason she said you might damage the facilities of our hotel , Location of hotel and cleanness and size of room were superb Bar and breakfast were fabulous 
476312,Windsor Hotel Milano, Restaurant Bar of the hotel closes at 10PM would have been better if they would have kept open for longer , Clean new and nice rooms Location is perfect Very friendly staff Price performance is very good We ll definitely stay here again next time when we re in Milano

476320,Windsor Hotel Milano, The grapes at breakfast had dry stems which indicated that they weren t fresh It s better not to serve fruit if it s not fresh , Central location but still quiet Staff was efficient and attentive Breakfast was generous and of mostly of good quality Our luggage was well looked after

476323,Windsor Hotel Milano, Noisy noisy noisy Our room was in major city road all night trams police ambo sirens motorbikes then street cleaners Might as well have slept in train station Perhaps there are quieter rooms make sure you ask for one Had early checkin noon confirmed by email from Booking com but surly front desk said you can ask but you do not get so not a great start Had to wait 2 5 hours to checkin Hotels need to be reminded their first contact can determine the tone for your whole stay , leaving
476324,Windsor Hotel Milano,No Negative, Very comfortable and friendly staff the breakfast was superb and the waiters were extra helpful and nice we would stay again for sure we loved our stay
476325,Windsor Hotel Milano, Can t think of anything, Location daily breakfast easy access to train station subway station Front desk staff proximity to site of international design expo daily rates were most affordable and not a huge impersonal hotel 
476326,Windsor Hotel Milano, Bad staff I check in at 20 30 the staff gave me room card but did not tell us we had to use the card for the lift let us try and arror at last a guest help us Later we ask for two glasses another staff told us get it in the restaurant by myself Four star hotel I wonder The room is on the first floor just outside is a tram stop from early morning to midnight every 5 10 minutes a tram stop Again this is a special price room that means we cannot sleep well the pay is expensive ,No Positive

476331,Windsor Hotel Milano, The room lacks of a number of amenities in hotels going for the same price Although the fridge contents are free and replenished daily I still miss my hot water kettle The shower cubical is a bit tight and no shampoo is provided and when asked from housekeeping they informed the bath wash doubles up as shampoo Also Milan trams start operating early and run late into the night which is audible in most rooms , Friendly and helpful staff 
476332,Windsor Hotel Milano, Front desk staff were unnecessarily moody and dismissive when we needed help with our bags on arrival Then again when my friend had to go back to the room to get the kettle we d borrowed because she couldn t carry everything in one trip when we vacated the room They did not offer any help , The room was good and clean and in particular they provide a great a luscious breakfast 
476333,Windsor Hotel Milano, The bed was too hard for me however this would probably be perfect for others , Loved how it was close to the metro which we could take directly to the Duomo The reception staff were lovely and helpful and the breakfast was amazing

476340,Windsor Hotel Milano, Selection on dinner menu A larger variety of food is needed Especially for those that are vegetarian and pescatarian Also not many other restaurants near by and those that were were closed on Sunday , Absolutely lovely location with excellent travel links Having a free soft drink minibar was great too The decoration of the hotel was absolutely gorgeous I would recommend anyone to go stay at this hotel 
476341,Windsor Hotel Milano, Location was slightly out of the way and took a 10 15 minute walk to restaurants or underground to get into the city centre We relied on taxis for the majority of our trip , Staff were lovely and happy to help The fresh croissants for breakfast were lovely and tasty Beautiful entrance way and look to the hotel on initial viewing but let down by the dated interior of the rooms and bathrooms

476347,Windsor Hotel Milano, The fact that it is right in front of some of the busiest streets in Milan makes it so noisy Even worse every 5 minutes the tram goes by and make it impossible to sleep relax etc Especially if you are given a room on the lowest floors it is definitely going to be a hell for you , Breakfast was fantastic Clotitlde bistrot is one of the cuttest places you could ever visit to take your breakfast Generally the hotel is so beautiful classy and clean I also loved the location which is really close to the city center Such a good area Close to the Milano Centrale station too

476352,Windsor Hotel Milano, The young waiter at the restaurant is rude and impolite Very rude He thinks he is making us clients a favor The old man waiter is a very nice educated man he gave us an excellent excellent service I would fire the young male morning waiter and keep the old man , The location
476353,Windsor Hotel Milano, We tried to use the bistrot on several occasions but we re not made to feel welcome at all When we went for dinner staff were rude and we left without eating Also in a 4 star property we expected glassware but only received plastic tumblers , Junior suite comfortable and nicely appointed Nice selection of food for breakfast 
476354,Windsor Hotel Milano, The room could be bigger for a 4 stars hotel The restaurant for dinner is too expensive 10 Euros for one soup , Very good value for money hotel Price very reasonable for a 4 stars hotel Good location using the tube 1 station from Milan central station and 3 stations from Il Duomo

476358,Windsor Hotel Milano, My only issue with the hotel was that the rooms windows are kept locked under key due to safety laws so it s understandable and if you want them opened closed you have to contact somebody at the reception each time Also the trams outside are very easy to be heard from inside the rooms, The place is very nice very clean has good quality decor helpful and polite personnel very wide and huge buffet breakfast

476361,Windsor Hotel Milano, Unfortunately the parking was 25 euros for an overnight stay which I thought was a bit steep It was also a little confusing as we had to drive to a separate car park across the road which is affiliated with the hotel and leave the car keys with the guys there this wasn t explained and we didn t feel terribly comfortable doing this The hotel assured me this was ok On picking up the car it had damage a scuff to the right passenger side bumper Luckily we saved ourselves a headache by having full insurance with the hire company but I d be cautious of letting them Park my car again , The hotel room was beautiful clean and had a lovely king size bed Very clean and finished well The staff were friendly and helpful It was a 25 minute walk to the Duomo main square so was a great location for us The hotel does have parking as well

476366,Windsor Hotel Milano, Whenever you came from outside to the hotel the corridor and the room had a disgusting smell and it made me dizzy The staff in the reception was polite but didn t give me a welcome feeling He only showed his kindness when we checked out It seems that the hotel has a manpower management issue I hardly see smile faces in both reception and cafeteria area I would say the room rate is 4 stars hotel price but not the services , The cleaning staff did a great job The room was cleaned and the bed was made on daily basis 
476367,Windsor Hotel Milano, Breakfast The service at breakfast nobody offered coffee two days in a row The food in the restaurant was not so good , Location Very close to the Metro Walking distance to Milano Centrale Internet included in the price Minibar included in the price not a big selection but still a good thing Good service in reception
