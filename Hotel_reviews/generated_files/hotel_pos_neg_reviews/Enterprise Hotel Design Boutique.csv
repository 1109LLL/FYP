305162,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Staff is nice but slow often there are guests waiting in line to check in or out , Hotel is elegantly decorated beautiful lobby with lots of seating area Room is comfortable and clean Location is good within walking distance to various restaurants and supermarket Right next to tram line too 
305163,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique,No Negative, Excellent hotel worth a lot more than I paid late July 2017 must have been low season Friendly and efficient staff excellent decor and well appointed rooms ultra fast wi fi everything you need for a great stay This was my first time at this hotel but it won t be the last It s in the north west part of Milan about 10 minutes by taxi to the Central Station 
305164,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Only slight issue not even an issue is its location About a 50 min walk to the centre of town Bur who doesn t need that to work off all the food one eats in Italy , Property was absolutely amazing One of the best hotel experiences of my life Cannot recommend this place enough
305165,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, don t use the spa its not worth the money especially they say there is a solarium and there isn t but we got the money back for the entry, very nice hotel good breakfast nice staff nice rooms very friendly staff when we complained about the spa 
305166,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, It s slightly away from the centre though not a disadvantage as the tram stop is just down the street, Fabulous hotel very modern and new The breakfast was 15 euro but was fantastic Would definitely stay again plus we got it at such a good rate 
305167,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, The staff at the check in is not very kind nor make you feel welcome I stayed already 2 times and by far is the only thing to improve, Very nice hotel with great rooms
305168,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique,No Negative, Everything i stay in this hotel for business as well and I loved it The staff is wonderful and really helpful When I mentioned that I stayed longer on a personal title they Giuseppe upgraded my room for free That is what I call service 
305169,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Nothing , I have stayed here several times and I love the hotel All facilities are there and their breakfast is beyond wonderful Room are clean and the bathroom is big enough 
305170,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Shower floods bathroom, Great staff cool lobby courtyard area bar Rooms are average but perfectly adequate for a city break without breaking the bank Tram outside takes 15 mins to central Milan We stayed to watch Cold Play in concert Very easy access to San Siro Stadium via close by Metro 
305171,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Nothing, The whole experience of the hotel was superb from the room comforts to the superb fresh omelettes made at breakfast and the relaxed atmosphere in the hotel Finally Daniel on reception is a credit to the hotel as we were there for our 25th anniversary and he could not do enough He recommended a couple of restaurants for us to visit and they were superb Overall a wonderful experience 
305172,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, The room I initially received was a mess I cannot explain much because I stayed there only two minutes and then I asked for an upgrade I guess the rooms are ranked from 2 stars up to 4 and it depends on how lucky you are or how much they want to impress you as a guest , The breakfast was nice Well positioned close to many good restaurants and quite close to downtown 
305173,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Just one guy at the reception when I found out I was given a dynamic price instead of the flat rate I reserved He basically just said that s it and made me feel like I was an idiot Very poor behavior , Staff at the restaurant was especially nice always smiling excellent approach clean fast and always used great care 
305174,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, The furniture in the room was a little bit old style but in good conditions , Friendly and helpful staff with good kitchen breakfast and dinner as well Close to Malpensa airport it was only 30 40 mins on Friday morning so the location is quite good It is easy to reach other locations 
305175,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Had a triple room but didn t get the linen and cups for the third person Had to ask for them each time Attention to basic details wasn t there in the room A triple room consisted of a single stretcher bed hard up against the double bed not appropriate in my opinion , The staff were very accommodating 
305176,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique,No Negative, Staff was extremely friendly They were very helpful with restaurant suggestions and took care of reservations and taxi rides They even provided a mobile router to use around the city Room was beautiful very clean with lots of added extras such as slippers bathrobes and wonderful toiletries Upscale bar was great for a nightcap ending a wonderful day Would definitely recommend The Enterprise Hotel 
305177,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique,No Negative, The bed and pillows were the softest I experienced during my entire Italy trip The staff was great attentive The Hotel was beautiful Many sitting areas to enjoy 
305178,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, 1 Staff I had emailed on issues during my stay however no one answered so far to this issue This is very bad customer services 2 Location Very far from train station It is not ideal for business and holidays for short stay , Hotel lobby was well decorated 
305179,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Waited for a long time to use the jacuzzi Allocating 30minute slots would give everyone a chance especially when it s a busy period , The pictures were accurate if not more Lovely hotel The breakfast was amazing 
305180,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique,No Negative, The hotel lobby is well decorated the bed was huge and the staff was very friendly and professional We ordered some food from the restaurant through the room service and it was delicious The on site parking is really nice 
305181,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, a bit far from centre , the hotel is nice staff friendly and helpful the location is not so ideal one needs a tram or bus to go to the center and other places worth visiting on booking shows as genius member one can check out 2 hours later but hotels says they havent got the info dont know how it works 
305182,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Access from the city center to the hotel by tram when return after midnight is rather unlikely so you need to take a taxi that costs around 12 13 euros and has to be considered , A nice designed reception comfort beds well equipped rooms very helpful and polite reception staff easily access to the center by tram the stop of which is almost outside the hotel for easy access to the center tickets available at the reception or the caf in the corner next to the hotel 
305183,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, More seating area outside in the spa would have been good , Staff were so helpful Free snacks around the hotel Free wine on arrival Free coffee the morning we left Nice little spa good restaurant Beautiful decor
305184,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique,No Negative, This is my third time at the hotel and once again met my expectations friendly staff clean rooms very nice breakfast and very central I ll be back 
305185,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, It is difficult to find a shop to buy water around the hotel The shower in our room was very old and it needs an update , The lobby is very inviting The tram station is just outside the hotel The metro station is at a resonable distance about 2 tram stations you can walk there You can also walk to Sempione Park and the Castle The breakfast was very good There are some restaurants close to the hotel Likewise it is close to Chinese quarter where you may find lots of restaurants 
305186,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Nothing, The location of the hotel for Milano Fiera City is perfectly 10 minutes walk comfortable double bed clean room amazing breakfast staff really helpful and polite 
305187,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, The internet in our room was not working properly at times Sunday because our room was very far from the rest , The place was good value for money The service was very good They upgraded us to a more spacious room just because Maybe because my wife is pregnant I don t know but the room was big and very nice 
305188,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, The only issue I guess was the location but there were loads of public transport links around for us to get about , Loved everything about the hotel We booked a couple of nights stay with breakfast and spa access Worth every penny The rooms were lovely and clean the staff were brilliant and made sure we were comfortable and well looked after The spa was also great Overall a great experience and will definitely return 
305189,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, If I were to nitpick rooms would be a bit snug , The candies and water that they offer in the lobby is a nice touch Staff are pleasant and attentive to your needs concerns On site parking could not have been any easier 
305190,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Not very central although the tram stop is literally outside the hotel and the metro stop less than 10 minute walk we did spend a lot of time on the Metro , A beautifully furnished hotel with friendly and informative staff The choice at breakfast was the best I have ever seen Lots of attention to detail and little extras a glass of fizz on arrival late check out the use of a GHD hairdryer in addition to one in the room etc
305191,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Sick soundproof all the noice in the corridor and nearest rooms is clear The furniture looks more shabby comparing to the pictures and it s quite dark due to the relatively small window No bathrobe in the superior rooms but it s mention in the description Rooms are much more simple comparing to the lobby design By tram it s 30 mins to duomo and tram strikes happens Taxi costs around 12 15 eur to the center so for me it s not a great location, Wonderful staff Clean room All required things for the bath conditioner tooth kit Nice design in the lobby
305192,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, It was a bit far from the centre of Milan not a problem for us but public transport was really close and easy , The room was great The staff very helpful and the spa Would definitely go back 
305193,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, The older man at the reception is unfriendly and unpersonal while all the others are very friendly and personal, Amazing breakfast Very friendly and helpful staff when we arrived in the evening we asked for a typical italian restaurant to eat We got very good advice and they called immediately to reserve a table 
305194,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Noisy from the trams outside and could hear people in the corridor really easily Shower temperature kept fluctuating and water pressure was quite low , Nice design and good location Comfy beds 
305195,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Nothing everything was absolutely GREAT , The room was much bigger than I anticipated and their beds are absolutely comfortable The cherry on the cake was the free mifi portale wifi that you can carry around the city a definite delighter The staff were amazing responsive and helpful we really enjoyed our trip and I ll definitely stay here again 
305196,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, the windows in our room were very odd it only started from 1 5m up so we basically did not have a view , the lovely sweets and snacks at reception and the super cool and spacious reception area
305197,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Our concierge was a little standoffish at check in and it s a trek to the heart of Milan s nightlife a half hour cab at least , The room was spotless and the bathroom facilities were lovely 
305198,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Surveys I was repeatedly being bothered after my stay via email to fill out the hotel s survey w o recalling to have given my consent leave me alone Bed A double bed was understood as 2 single beds next to each other not convenient Location Metro stop Domodossola is a bit remote, Room Clean amenities Wlan Rather fast multiple devices can be connected Staff Friendly
305199,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, The room was very small The furniture was old and not at all like the stylish hotel lobby Inside the room there were stairs from the door the the bed area which made the already small room a bit more uncomfortable The window was small and very high up which made the room seem like it was under ground The Spa access was included in our room rate but we had to ask twice until we got Information on how to use it overall the hotel staff seemed a bit arrogant Spa area was beautiful but small , Nice hotel lobby and nice spa facilities Great breakfast 
305200,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique,No Negative, This is a good hotel pretty much a business orientated facility with a twist Breakfast stands out and the restaurant is uncommonly interesting for a hotel restaurant Staff is helpful on average and sometimes they even smile 
305201,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, the park garage next to the lofts is a bit noisy at moments but not that dramatic, everything was awesome great location hip hotel nice staff to me 
305202,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique,No Negative, Hotel had the most comfortable beds I ve ever experienced Also breakfast was out of bounds The spa was nice although it didn t open until 5 pm but a nice touch The whole property has a hip vibe and is green so I like that 
305203,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, The staff brought us to stay in one of their apartment which is kind of in the basement and garage by saying the deluxe room which we booked via booking com is full in the main building We claimed that it s not the room we booked less than 1 minute we got the room as we booked Didn t like the way they tried it s not very honest We won t recommend this hotel The lobby is nice but the rest of hotel is just a ok quality one not the real design boutique hotel , The quality of breakfast is not bad if you are into variety of selection we ve seen better ones 
305204,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique,No Negative, I had an amazing experience with the staff of Enterprise even before I arrived thanks to Mrs Elisa and everyone involved we were able to prepare a surprise for our friends who arrived earlier than us If I travel to Milan again I will book a room at Enterprise for sure The hotel is not far away from the centre easy to reach by tram and not so expensive by taxi either The bed was great clean sheets clean room and bathroom overall a 4 experience 
305205,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Very small thing but the masseuse is not resident to the hotel and is not always available Apart from that we can t fault the hotel , The restaurant was fantastic The spa was small but intimate with a lovely view of the city Perfect location outside of the city with a short tram ride to the city centre The rooms were clean large and comfortable and there was complimentary water each day 
305206,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique,No Negative, The staff was very polite My wife got a flu during our holidays and the woman in charge of the breakfast Signora Leipzig without asking brought us for take away in our room fresh lemon ginger and honey to help her become well Very tooching Thank you again beautifull boutique hotel 
305207,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, 1 Soundproofing you can hear a the tram under the windows starting 5 am b snoring neighbor If stay next to lift no sleep 2 Staff has little knowledge on how to release the guarantee ammount from the credit card That created delays at checkout Have some cash if in a hurry 3 SPA is rather fancy stuff than real SPA zone , 1 Hotel concept atmosphere 2 Breakfast 3 Staff
305208,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, There was no parking space for my car during this visit so had to park elsewhere , I love the hotel s internal design its central location its room comfort and set up It s my number 1 choice so far in Milan whenever I come for a visit 
305209,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Reception is strange not easy to recognise as such They stand at a circular bar and will ask you to sign for a large payment guarantee upon arrival Shower inconsistent Air conditioning not easy to fathom got too warm sometimes cold , Very nice hotel unusual good deal for room only Great breakfast but adds 38 euros per night for a couple Very good restaurant with fire Located quite far out but we like to walk and found a couple of other good places to eat nearby Quite handy for station for Malpensa Walked on duomo roof saw Last Supper Armani store walked to canals and lots more great 
305210,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, We had pleasant stay in hotel just location is just a little bit far from the city center There is good connection to center by tram though which stops right outside of Hotel And if you dont have breakfast included in your reservation then there are not many options for breakfast in the area around hotel , Hotel in general is nice We booked room for 3 persons but room we got was not really suitable for 3 people Luckily personnel found solution and we could change the room into more spacious Apartment which was perfect for us Apartment was very quite and had all amentities one needs 
305211,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Staff The group of people arrived in the middle of night making a lot of noise in the corridor playing loud music in their room We called reception they said that will send smn 15 mins later nothing happened I called reception again he said that did not see anybody in corridor He came again and nocked our door asking which room is making a noise I was surprised i asked him if he does not hear the music in corridor he says i hear loud music but dont know which room and asked me to join him in searching noisy room to warn these people Bath shower are not really clean , Close to tram and metro
305212,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Nothing , Handy for access to Milan Centre by Tram 1 23min Friendly staff Free Wifi 4G card for the duration of stay Don t forget to give it back Very nice reception lounging area Top breakfast selection with great omelettes Food in restaurant excellent Sightseeing Bus Stop across the street 
305213,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Wish we could have taken advantage of the spa facilities and didn t realize the spa area was limited to 8 people at a time and required a reservation , Lovely hotel with a nice bar area and sitting area downstairs with fireplaces 
305214,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Everything felt like a struggle There were queues to get a table for breakfast in the morning We called 3 times to use the spa only to be told that it was full When finally they agreed we went there and it was empty , The room was very comfortable 
305215,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, On arrival receptionist promised that restaurant will be open every evening so we can have dinner near the fireplace Actually in one evening restaurant was closed for special event and all the guests were served in the bar that is far less nice less spacious and and less comfortable They knew it in advance but did not tell us No wine or whiskey in the minibar only beverages and some beer No additional services are offered like ordering flowers but there was a flower shop 100 m from the hotel Lobby bar is pricey You are not allowed to bring a bottle of wine and glasses from he bar to the room yourself Instead you should request this from a room service and they will charge you 9 EUR per each request , Just a tip when using Metro line 5 exit on Domodossola station and go on foot approx 10 minutes or take any for 2 stops This is far more convenient then exiting on the Gerusalemmo metro station Also a 15 minutes ride with tram 1 or 19 from Cadorna possible Spa is nice but always check how many people are inside We were lucky to be alone but hotel permits up to 8 visitors This is too much To my opinion this spa accommodates 4 or 6 people maximum Hotel offers really delicious breakfast and good dinner Rich alcohol selection in the bar Almost every evening there were some sweeties or sparkling wine offered in the lobby Together with quite large library full of Taschen books comfortable reading zone and possibility to print your selfies for free it makes reasonable to spend one evening just in the hotel lobby If you visit spa hotel gives you extra slippers and bathrobe included in the price You can get public transport ticket from the reception just pay in cash ATM is 100 m away in the next building 
305216,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique,No Negative, Decor is really different from other hotels so very refreshing and fun Service was excellent Our room was a little too hot and we couldn t work the controller but were silly enough not to ask Shame on us not them as they could have adjusted centrally The window did open though While a little out of centre the area is lovely and surrounding shops not geared for tourists so better value Also the tram from outside the door takes you straight to town Would definitely stay and recommend 
305217,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Be careful 20 for breakfast for 1 person total exaduration, Very very nice hotel with great rooms and design Very good price We had 80 per night From center a bus 10 min AMazing amazing breakfast But sooooo overpriced
305218,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique,No Negative, The hotel is very nice and clean The breakfast is very rich and delicious Even tho it is not located in the center 20 25min by tram I recommend the hotel to everyone 
305219,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, when i do the check in the hold the whole amount from my mastercard i asked the reception and he told me it well be back within 24 hours when i checking out there was a very rude lady and she asked for my mastercard to detect the whole amount again and the first hold amount didnt return back to my account untill this moment she but me in a huge trouble beside she was asking me to solve my problem in a rude way when i was contacts my bank nothing good in this hotel for me having a friendly stuff in the hotel is the most thing tourist looking for and i want my hold money back , when we do the check in they was so friendly and do everything smooth tow of the reception staff trait us kindly other wasn t that helpful 
305220,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, The location is not very close to the center Parking is expensive but it s quite common in all hotels in Milan , The room was very clean big and comfortable The hotel is decorated beautifully 
305221,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Staff at the reception table could speak better English , Very nice breakfast Comfortable bed nice clean room Location is also nice very close to tram station 
305222,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, The elevator had problems, Modern Hotel design very comfort hu room clean the shower excellent breakfast parking 20euro location by metro to San Siro 
305223,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Reception staff could have been more pleasant We didn t like the reception layout , Easy to get tram to the centre Tea and coffee in room Comfortable bed 
305224,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, The service from the front desk could have been better and more friendly , Fantastic breakfast and very friendly staff in the restaurant The hotel is also very beautiful 
305225,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Advertised as child friendly No where does it mention that children aren t allowed in the hot tub All I wanted to do was have a soak on my last day in Italy looking at the gorgeous view Couldn t do that because my son wasn t allowed in and it closes at 9 so I couldn t even sneak out after he was asleep Son is 10 and well behaved Very disappointing Could have said something at check in when they gave me the spa key wouldn t have got him all dressed for a swim , Nice lobby Nice room 
305226,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique,No Negative, I stayed in The Enterprise Hotel with my sister we were in Milan to attend the opera at La Scala The hotel is in an excellent location a residential area 20 minutes on the tram from the city centre The trams are a very iconic part of the transport system in Milan and the journeys are so enjoyable The Hotel has every facility and the reception staff are quite outstanding in their level of attention and they also provide informative and accurate information An added bonus is being able to buy your tram ticket at the hotel The hotel also has a very efficient taxi booking service The room was very comfortable bathroom an ample size and tea coffee making facilities are in the room I requested an iron and it was brought to the room complete with ironing board in less than 5 minutes very impressive It was wonderful to be able to stay in a hotel in Milan that was in a very quiet area but also within such easy reach of the city centre I can recommend the Enterprise Hotel to all travellers and I would stay there if I visit Milan again 
305227,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, The hotel location is just far from almost everything I regret booking it as a tourist visiting the city and being far from everything The nearest attraction is the San Siro stadium which is 30 min walking Further the hotel staff are not friendly and not welcoming specially those working in the front desk When I was trying to check in the guy there asked me in a very rode way to park my car in the hotel garage before checking in even though my car was in a proper parking Further as a four star hotel they didn t send me anyone to help with my bags I had to ask for it and never receiving it Also when I asked them about the late check out option that was one of they main reasons in booking the hotel where that was provided to me through Booking they refused then they gave me 2 hrs only in a way where they said it is a favor they are giving to me , The hotel is very clean and might and deserve 5 star hotel level as a facility Their breakfast is great 
305228,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Not so much going on in the immediate area but maybe that s because we are not interested in top night clubs D, Great breakfast 5 mins on tram to Arco Della Pace and 20 mins to Duomo Beautiful reception and great staff
305229,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique,No Negative, Friendly staff hotel style decorations variety of breakfast we stayed in apartments no 4 instead of hotel room for 3 person it was good choice I recommend for a bigger places 
305230,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, I spend the day at Micam Came to hotel to have diner Restaurent was quite empty Chose a table Have been told it is reserved rudely Nobody offered another table nearby or explained despite there was no sign on the table Table was after one hour still not occupied Investigation after with the waiter he claimed table is always reserved for a specific guest whether he shows or not Maybe you should invest in a reserved sign and friendly staff Breakfast team however treats guests as guests Warm welcome Nice smile ,No Positive
305231,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Nothing , This hotel was wonderful From the outside it doesn t look like much but inside it is just delightful The staff were friendly and couldn t do enough for us Although the hotel is a short walk to everything it is in a more residential area and so more relaxed and less hectic Would stay here again and again 
305232,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Fridge space in the room it s full of mini bar goodies but no space to chill a bottle of wine, Excellent breakfast friendly helpful staff especially Svetlana
305233,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, The rooms are a little small but it s typical of most European hotels Nothing much to not like , The staff are extremely friendly Wow what a service from the check in desk to the restaurant Really happy This is my second time at the hotel Will definitely go back there again Very convenient the tram stop is right outside Couldn t ask for more I liked that you can get a wifi dongle if they are available Was helpful as we used it for Google maps and general searches There are wel
305234,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Breakfast good but need to pay attention on the drinks The milk on the buffet was rotten , Reception staff super friendly and very helpfull with any need and sharing knowledge of the city 
305235,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Expensive for car parking in the hotel Cheaper to park in the street at less than half the cost and we did not have a problem with safety , Upon entry to the hotel snacks and drinks are available which is very welcoming The room was on the small side but very comfortable Nice firm bed SKY TV was a plus and also a gym Staff very pleasant Hotel is situated close to the centre of the city a comfortable walk of 30 minutes 
305236,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, About 30 45 min walk into central Milan , Amazing reception and common areas We were in a superior twin single beds would have been nice to have had doubles Everything is tip top quality 
305237,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique,No Negative, The staff was very friendly and helpful always willing to resolve any problems should they occur There is a big choose of food at the breakfast which satisfies any taste Waiters can make you coffee on request 
305238,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique,No Negative, Breakfast is delicious Evening restaurant is very cosy Rooms are comfortable and have a small balcony Location is superb with close connection of public transport to visit Milan Parking is available and very convenient in Milan Staff is very friendly and helpful WIFI connection is superb I liked very much the style of this hotel 
305239,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Breakfast was great but could do with a change of the hot cooked items after 3 days , Great service and rooms were excellent They were able to accommodate the early check in and late check out requests Good location as well 
305240,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Located at a tram metro ride from city centre Not ideal for the airport you need to take a taxi to Bovisa station where Malpensa express stops and trains stopping there are not very frequent , Apart from location the hotel is very nice comfortable and beautifully designed The staff is very helpful Rooms could be a bit bigger though 
305241,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique,No Negative, Very helpful and friendly staff the hotel it self is gorgeous and the photos do not do it justice The location of the hotel is great just a short tram ride into the center of Milan and also very close to some amazing restaurants and bars The perfect place to have had a hen party 
305242,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Not safe My colleague s room was robbed by someone with key access We attended a conference and two others were also robbed of laptops and ipad in same way The staff even suggested it was fraud on the guest s part , Otherwise clean hotel quality restaurant and good location 
305243,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Location is OK but you will need to pay for taxi if returning from a late night out and this is about 13 18 euros depending on where you are Also the air conditioning in our room was not working But when I rang the reception they sent within 5 minutes a technician and when it was confirmed that works needed to be done we were offered the option to change to another room and in fact they said that they would the move for us We were happy with the room temperature but what a nice customer care , Super extra helpful staff you get 5 star service paying for a 4 star hotel They welcome you with a glass of Prosecco and nibbles as well as water But apparently you can help yourself anytime you like The reception is really a very modern concept and it is in fact open 24 7 they even sell metro tram bus tickets it is the one for all actually and they loan out portable wifi hotspots for free We stayed in a superior double and every aspect of it was great Our rooms were cleaned and tidied up every day and our complimentary bottle of water was always replaced The breakfast can feel expensive at 15 euros but it is really worth it really good quality ingredients Very beautiful smoking area in the internal garden protected by the elements They also organise beautiful aperitivo nights on Thursdays Also you should try the nice aperitivo places in Corso Sempione close to the arch I tried Disaronno and it was really good Do not try the kebab shops round the corner There is a good size supermarket within 5 10 minutes walking distance A tip there is a bus service 5 10 minute walking from the hotel that goes directly to Malpensa Airport And I think that there is a drop off point on the way from Malpensa This is very convenient as you avoid the city centre traffic and it is much closer than other regions 
305244,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Nothing really bad about the place but they could have informed about the spa entrance that was included in the stay , Very nice restaurant don t miss it Very nice breakfast 
305245,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Even though No1 tram is right out front it s still a good 25 minutes ride to get to Duomo , This boutique hotel is modern nice and clean The room was very comfortable If your destination is the convention centre it s with in a erasable walking distance Breakfast was great No 1 tram stop is a few steps away from the hotel A few great restaurants near by 
305246,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Nothing really We had a nice offer for the room not sure if the full price would have been too much for us , Awesome location for visiting the city center There s a tram stop just outside our you can even walk there We stayed in one of the apartments it was really great comfortable bed good bathroom well equipped kitchen We ll definitely look at it again if we return to the city 
305247,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, The location was a little out of the way to get to local restaurants The tram service is good but it is a little far from the main centre of Milan only a small inconvenience and the hotel was still very good , Stylish clean and friendly Service was very good and the rooms were comfortable and pleasant The style is creative and with lots of little touches that make the stay welcoming 
305248,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, The furniture could be better , It s closed to the shopping area and restaurants they have nice housekeepers and staff and the breakfast was good with warm welcoming 
305249,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique,No Negative, The best hotel we stayed so far in Milano Excellent space cleanliness location with many great restaurants within 500m radius one of the best breakfast buffets with vegetarian gluten free options and custom omelet and next to tram station in a green neighborhood 
305250,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Paying extra for breakfast Also the checking in out desk could be more user friendly when we were leaving there was some disorganisation due to a circular desk with no signage , The breakfast options were excellent Super helpful staff 
305251,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, The electronic checking in is a bit cumbersome and fiddly but it s only a small point , The provision of drinks and snacks on arrival Staff so helpful and pleasant Comfortable bed huge TV easy wifi connection made for a great stay Trams for the centre run from the street outside and tickets are available at the desk which is a big help a feature more hotels should copy Classy boutique feel very relaxed 
305252,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Should I really say something here Okok small nightstands , Everything Not easy to get this quality in a city like Milan We will definitely go back 
305253,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, , The breakfast was absolutely amazing The staff were extremely accommodating and knowledgeable to our needs Travel around the city from the hotel was consistent and inexpensive for a day travel card refreshments on arrival and sweets decorated the reception area lovely 
305254,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, We were in one of the apt rooms and getting to our room was a little confusing , Everyone was very friendly and helpful Liked bar area and snacks that came with our drinks 
305255,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, The neighborhood is quiet and rather residential There are not many shops or restaurants close to the hotel It takes about ten minutes to walk to the next metro station , The Enterprise Hotel is modern and stylish Our room was very clean and comfortable Moreover the staff is friendly and helpful My personal highlight was the breakfast It is super delicious and offers a great variety of fresh food 
305256,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Room on the first floor Labors were doing construction works during night at the lobby What a noice Had to switch rooms at 1 30 am at night Restaurant rather expensive Staff could be friendlier Rooms are noisy , Breakfast is good 
305257,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Throwing a party that lasts until 1 00 am is ridiculous to say the least My room was right above the party and even the floor was shaking Absolutely impossible to sleep At reception been told that party wld finish at 10 30 11 00 pm At 11 00 pm ask again and told wld finish at 00 00 At 00 00 that just few more minutes and music stopped at 1 00 am Truly was credited that night which was a proper financial compensation BUT sleeping that was my goal proven to be impossible One thing more the hotel has two spaces for a bar On the night of the party closed one of the bars leaving open only the party bar If you re plan is to find an hotel where you can also work think twice before booking Enterprise Hotel or ask prior if there will be a party ,No Positive
305258,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, The room was so hot I couldn t sleep Air conditioning unit wasn t working , Easy check in and excellent staff Staff helped with any questions about how to get around the city and ordered us taxis Waiters in the restaurant were very accommodating and gave excellent recommendations of dishes 
305259,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Additional paymernt for SPA , Rather quite place not far from the center with good restaurants around Luxury breakfast in the hotel for reasonable price 
305260,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, The staff at the reception were not super nice but they were not rude either , It s a lovely hotel with good food and close to the city via tram number 1 
305261,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, We choose it because of the SPA but have no chance to use It opens at 17 00 and closing at 22 00 or 23 00 We arrived at 22 30 for one night , comfortable beds stylish lobby and rooms good public transport connections

305265,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Was a bit dissapointed there was no Antipasti Party on the Thursday night we arrived I was looking forward to it Wish the hotel has advised us so that we could have come on an alternative weekend Apart from that our stay was great as usual and there was no other complaint This did not take anything away from our stay , I liked everything about the hotel Breakfast was fantastic There is soo much variety Definitely worth it The room was spacious and clean The staff was friendly and made us feel welcome Special thanks to Giovani This is my 5th stay in this hotel and would not consider any other hotel when visiting Milan

305273,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, Location Although there are plenty of excellent restaurant close to the hotel special mention for Osteria Canova in via Cenisio excellent sardinian reataurant the hotel is OK for people visiting the Fiera but is not very close to Milan center Brera Duomo shopping streets , Excellent breakfast with real fruit juices and plenty of good products served by nice and smiling people 
305274,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique, One staff advised us to go to a larger supermarket when we wanted somewhere to buy cheese but she neglected to tell us how far a walk it was Looks close on map but it was at least 25min walk and it was dark She should have known better and advised us to take a cab , Breakfast especially the eggs station and the coffee Well done 
305275,Enterprise Hotel Design Boutique,No Negative, We had booked a smaller room originally knowing it was just my husband myself and 11 year old daughter but realized it wouldn t work when we arrived and so for 20 Euro more a night we ended up in one of the Apartments with a washing machine mini kitchen living room and master upstairs It worked out great for us You can catch the trolley for 1 50 each way to the Duomo and back it s about a 15 minute ride Great Sushi restaurants in the area
