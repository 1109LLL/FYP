440645,Zenit Barcelona, Fairly small selection of standard continental breakfast fare A bit of a walk to the Metro and 3km from the gothic quarter , Very courteous and helpful staff I don t normally bother hotel staff but for one reason or another I needed their help on four occasions and all four different staff members met my requirements without hesitation or fuss The best meals we had in Barcelona were all within 5 minutes walk of the restaurant Great bus links Park up the car and get the T10 public transport travel cards 
440646,Zenit Barcelona, Nothing, Staff very helpful and professional Rooms spacious clean and with good facilities We found it to be a 12 15 minute walk from the nearest Metro 
440647,Zenit Barcelona, The room was tiny well below expectations given the price I paid for it and the hotel s category There are better options for this price in Barcelona definitely ,No Positive
440648,Zenit Barcelona, Had to upgrade room Could not manage to pack clothes away Or walk around , Had to upgrade the room as it was very small Pretty quite hotel good location with plenty of places to eat and drink Only had one day in for breakfast and this was very good 
440649,Zenit Barcelona, Breakfast not included I would prefer placemats without grooves or table cloths in a dining area , Nice and modern hotel Modern and clean room with double bed Good AC clean bathroom great bed great pillows Every day clean towel Enough space for 1 person 2 suitcases would be too crowded i m o Nice breakfast Quiet area Friendly and helpful staff 
440650,Zenit Barcelona, Breakfast could have been improved with better quality bread and croissants etc The room was noisy above the kitchens so we asked to be moved which we did without problem The next room was fine for one night and then on the following two evenings it seemed to have running water going all night No coffee tea making facilities which we found odd for a four star hotel , The hotel was in a great area for us although a little bit of a walk to the tourist streets Near an excellent selection of shops and restaurants then there were smaller cafes and bars Nice roof area with gym Very pleasant walking area in which you felt very safe 
440651,Zenit Barcelona, The room was a little smaller than I had expected and a kettle with tea and coffee would have been a great help as we were there for a week, The staff were very friendly and helpful and the place was so quiet sleep came easy
440652,Zenit Barcelona, The pillows were quite uncomfortable , The location in the more residential part of Barcelona was very nice It gave a different feel from being crammed into the Gothic quarter with a million other tourists There is a bus stop directly outside the front door of the hotel The gym was small but adequate for general fitness 
440653,Zenit Barcelona, Arrived at 1pm stated check in time delayed our arrival so that we could check in and shoot straight back out Told room wasn t ready had to wait over an hour for room , Comfortable beds large balcony great location to explore barcelona 
440654,Zenit Barcelona, Would have liked Tea and coffee making facilities in the room Thought this was standard for a 4star hotel , Nice location Located just North of Diagonal Avenue in what is a well to do area Quiet pleasant neighbourhood with plenty of shops for those who have cash to burn Good restaurants in the area too Not far to walk to the Gracia neighbourhood which is always pleasant and great for a night out Hotel was very comfortable and staff were professional without being overly friendly Bed was great and we had a nice balcony which allowed us to enjoy a bit of sun in the afternoon Bathroom was clean and in good working condition Would definetly stay again 
440655,Zenit Barcelona, I didn t like anything about the hotel it s dreadful , We stayed in Barcelona for four nights in a different hotel over Christmas then we went to Valencia for 4 nights and for New Years I booked this place It was terrible absolutely terrible Far away from everything The room was smaller than any other room we ve ever stayed in Our window was overlooking a wall It s just a dreadful place absolutely not worth the price they charge The hotel we stayed in in Barcelona before we went to Valencia was a hundred times better I truly regretted booking this place 
440656,Zenit Barcelona, Limited coffee and tea facilities None in the room and couldn t get anything late Sunday night to drink in the hotel Room service and any drink services non existent at the weekend No ironing board in the room , Staff were really helpful and friendly The gym was good 
440657,Zenit Barcelona, Very slow check in Only 1 on the desk constantly interrupted by phone and rude guests who didn t want to wait to get a taxi Not worth 4 s Barely a 3 from our experiences as frequent travellers ,No Positive
440658,Zenit Barcelona, We didn t have shelves or drawers in the bedroom so had to keep half our clothes in our suitcases Ok for one night but not 4 Despite asking there was no handrail bathmat for safety in the bathroom either The hotel was not close to the centre so it involved lots of taxis and extra time and money travelling which we did not realise , Cleanliness of our room 
440659,Zenit Barcelona, 7th hotel i m staying at barcelona in last 2 years stayed at 8th floor room with terrace the noise isolation in walls are unbelievably bad every time someone got in or out one of the other rooms the noise was unbearable the terrace is different than the one on the photos at the 8th floor there are few things in room and shower that might need some attention bath handle doesn t have caps shower sink has stains pictures in room are placed very badly terrace is not getting cleaned breakfast was ok not enough variety no boiled eggs which is basic to my concern did not liked the bed at all felt very cheap hotel staff is slightly colder at this hotel specifically , The design of the hotel very nice 
440660,Zenit Barcelona, Bed was a bit hard and room wasn t massive but value for the price that we paid , Great location very friendly and helpful staff room cleaned and fresh towels daily Beautiful roof terrace which is a real asset Located close to the one of the main streets on the city Avinguda Diagonal and near to lots of shops and restaurants and bars Also close to the bus turistic is you want to do a bus tour 
440661,Zenit Barcelona, We had to upgrade our room for an extra 49 as the first room standard double was very small, The air conditioning in the room was fantastic The rooftop terrace very stylish and relaxing Always extremely clean and the buffet breakfast was tasty and good value for money
440662,Zenit Barcelona, The hotel is a bit far from any underground station but we enjoyed the beauty while walking to them , The hotel is in a posh area of Barcelona elegant stores and restaurants are around The hotel is very elegant it almost feels like a small 5 starred hotel and it s prices are very affordable it s restaurant especially The food was also delicious The staff were frienly and professional We liked the night waitress so much 
440663,Zenit Barcelona, Room descriptions in Booking com Our first room was small but there was no way to know that from the description on line Fortunately we were able to upgrade without a great price change , They tried very hard with a nearly full hotel and were able to get us a bigger room 
440664,Zenit Barcelona, There were no coffee making facilities and definitely no view from window , The bathroom was modern and clean The bed comfortable There was a free safe in the wardrobe 
440665,Zenit Barcelona,No Negative, Really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel The staff were great and it s in a really nice area It s a little way out of the centre but really close to public transport so this isn t a problem Would definitely stay again 
440666,Zenit Barcelona, We had an upgrade on the room and was quoted the price but when we came to pay the price was increased supposedly because of local taxes It would have been more honest to give the right price when we were offered the upgrade , The hotel was on a good bus route for the centre The room was comfortable and well appointed It was reasonably quiet The room was very clean
440667,Zenit Barcelona, Nothing really Great value, Excellent service Was my sons 7th birthday the day we arrived and I had phoned ahead to ask for cake and balloons Arrived early room was ready and the look on my sons face when we got to the room said it all Thanks to all involved 
440668,Zenit Barcelona, Warning Do not book this hotel if you want to stay for more than couple of days We stayed for 9 days in this hotel For 2 days there was no cleaning of the hotel room Furthermore at the end of our stay we were given a bill of 140 euros under EXTRA charge The mini bar items coca cola and small water bottle are over priced around 3 euro each , location is good friendly helpful staff

440671,Zenit Barcelona, The only minor comment would be the pillows as they were flat and hard , Great location in an upscale area of Barcelona Really quiet rooms at the back of the hotel Friendly staff 
440672,Zenit Barcelona, Despite it being advertised as being sound proof it was not at all and I could hear people coming in and out shouting The exact reason why I wanted a sound proofed room There was only one front staff and they were not there a lot of the time The room was a bit on the small side , It is a nice looking hotel with good amenities 
440673,Zenit Barcelona, The Wifi is too slow The room a little tiny for a 4 star hotel There should be complementary waterboiler with coffee alongside , I just love this area second time i ve been in this neighborhood Loved it The hotel is cute and well located The staff was always friendly and helpfull The rooms are renovated and the bathrooms look good 
440674,Zenit Barcelona,No Negative, People are very friendly and helpful with a high level of service If I had chance to come to Barcelona I will stay in this zenit hotel Thanks for all support
440675,Zenit Barcelona, 1 kilometer walk from the nearest metro station If you want to visit your room in the day to change clothes drop some stuff it s a lot of way to walk The room was clean but the towels smelt really bad I ve been to many hotels but I ve never seen something like this I requested an extra towel at night not at a late hour and the receptionist said I had to come to reception and get the towel myself I wasn t feeling very well but I had to put on all my clothes back and went to reception I think it was rude It wasn t a twin bed It was just two single beds united , Good neighbourhood Hotel looks luxurious compared to the price 
440676,Zenit Barcelona, air conditioner failed on two days of my stay although repairman responded quickly to fix it closet space is tight it would be challenging for two occupants In fact there are no drawers a bit inconvenient for long stays I think a bit of upgrade in furniture design to use available vertical space can solve this , Close to public transportation and shopping tourist points of interest Well designed bathroom spacious Room safe is very helpful Staff is very friendly and helpful You don t have to leave the hotel to sample great local cuisine at reasonable price
