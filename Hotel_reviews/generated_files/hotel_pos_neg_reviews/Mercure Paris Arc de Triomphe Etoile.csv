127003,Mercure Paris Arc de Triomphe Etoile, The reception girl of the afternoon evening was absolutely not suit for her job I arrived in the hotel there was no other client she was on the phone arguing with some potential client in a terrible English and she did not even acklnowledge my presence When finally interrupted a totally useless conversation in which she kept telling somebody that she did not understand she greeted me very abruptedly The personal in the morning was much nicer but when I got back to get the luggage in the evening she was there again screaming with somebody else on the phone and totally ignored me again and I had to wait 10 minutes to get my bag with the taxi waiting for me outside and charging me for it The escalator is terribly small and suffocating The hall is not up to the standards of such hotel In the room there is a transparent glass closing up a small bow window on which there is no sign and in the early morning I hit on it , Part of the hotel has been just renovated The room was just redone Very nice and spacious which for Paris is an exception 
127004,Mercure Paris Arc de Triomphe Etoile, Lift slow and small , Great location Justvhad a reverb so smelling of paint a bit but good Reverb not top quality workmanship but hotel presents very well 
127005,Mercure Paris Arc de Triomphe Etoile,No Negative, I noticed after I left that the hotel charged me the amount of 1435 68 instead of 1396 00 for two rooms 4 nights per room including tax and this is more than the agreed price the difference 39 68 
127006,Mercure Paris Arc de Triomphe Etoile, Cleaning of the room is not taking place early I would have preferred that cleaning be done in the morning , The location is perfect in a nice avenue where stores and cafe are around We can also do the Champs Elysees by walking
