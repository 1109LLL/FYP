473050,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Floors in a room were not cleaned properly every day In breakfast room glasses for water juice were dirty It would be nice to have bedside table or smth on both side of double bed If you are there for a longer period and have a lot of clothes there may be not enough space for these In our opinion the ordered mojito was the worst we ve ever tried but maybe we were just unlucky If you have a light sleep you wake easily because of different sounds you should use earplugs as trains and neighbours sounds are easily heard , Personnel Breakfast was good and varied Possibility to order food and drinks in the evening 
473051,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Breakfast was poor and not tasty unfortunately Only 1 waitress could not manage cleaning and serving on time so we had to wait for food and cutlery about 15 min , It s okay when you travel by car but too far from the nearest metro station Probably there s another way to reach the city center but the receptionist suggested us to go by metro Taxi from Navigli where we had aperitivo cost us 20 euros so I guess would be the same if we booked something in Navigli and just got paid parking there 
473052,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The breakfast room got very crowded in the late mornings so that it was a bit hard to find a seat and we sometimes had to wait for this and that item but the staff worked very hard to accommodate everyone , The staff was very friendly and helpful and the room was very clean and quiet I don t think it is necessary to change towels every day but they did The breakfast has lots of different stuff to choose from The area was very quiet and friendly and easy to get downtown by public transportation

473054,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, mosquitos and poor internet poor breakfast lack of fruit, Nice comfortable hotel responses its price personnel is polite and useful intelligent Internet was so so The main disadvantage lots of mosquitos outside and even in room perhaps just of summer months Summer terrace and bar was nice bus 81 43 to metro sondria or 15 min on foot nice restaurants close to hotel generally satisfied with husband 
473055,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Unfortunately the breakfast was dissapointing for a 4star hotel The metro station sondrio it s not near so you need a bus to get there fortunately the bus station is near to the hotel, Good and cozy hotel in a peaceful area of Milan The staff were very kind Good price

473058,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The restaurant bar wasn t amazing not a big variety of food there also didn t seem to be a huge amount of restaurants open around the area When our room was cleaned one morning dirty dishes weren t removed and were left all day which didn t leave the best smell in the room Would be good to have a few more brochures around about tours to do etc , It was close to Central Milan station and also had a supermarket close by however a little further out from other things The staff did help with what public transport to take its easy and takes you to a lot of main areas you can get a ticket for 1 50 for 90 mins or 4 50 for the day We asked for late check out at the last minute and were able to which was a big added bonus

473062,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, internet access can get slow during peak times , Breakfast and overall price comparing with equivalent properties in Milan Location is not central so if you re visiting Milan be aware of some minutes traveling to reach the city center which may include bus and metro Ideal for business trips and you can park your car around 1 2 Km from the nearest metro station and 450 m to the nearest bus station

473069,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The reception staff was not very friendly at the check in 30 minutes waiting to check in is a lot of time when 5 people are at the reception The cleaning staff actually ignore our do not disturb sign and entered the room anyway The hairdryer was quite poor for an mordernized hotel with loads of good equipment , The room is very good value for money A lot of space and the bed is comfortable Spacious bathroom and very clean Easy to park the car on the 1 floor and the parking is free The breakfast is quite good as well with a lot of variety The breakfast staff was very kind and helpful The location is actually good as you can walk 10 minutes to a bus or 20 to M2 subway station Good restaurants around from sushi to grilled fish

473073,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, when we get to milano i wanted to change the hotel to stay to the smart hotel because that was near to the train station but this was inpossible The SMART and the IDEA hotel belong to the same company The receptionist of the smart hotel has said to us wrong informations for the bus and we came to the hotel IDEA after 3 hours , i like the hospitality the room the brekfast all 
473074,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Maid took an item of my clothing in the laundry and staff refused to get it back for me Terrible WiFi chaos at breakfast and incompetent staff , Rooms were great value for money
473075,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The bed was uncomfortable and the room was not very clean with a lot of stains from previous clients For sure not what I expected from a 4 star hotel At breakfast the tables were cleaned with a lot of noise from the dishes and the coffee machine kept on breaking down from doing a bad coffee anyway I think they have a lot to improve , I like that the staff was responsive at all my demands or questions 
473076,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The bathroom mainly the shower area could do with being upgraded as needed a new shower head and tiles a bit grubby looking, Basic room but fine for a short stay About an hours walk to the Duomo and about 20 minutes walk from the central train station 
473077,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, A 4 stars hotel placed near the railroad Balconies exist for each room but cannot be accessed One computer for the entire hotel and even a 486 pc would have worked faster WiFi exists you need to connect with your own facebook or something similar and works only when you don t need it Breakfast room was not sufficient people had no place to stay and eat Staff was unprepared for breakfast they did not add food although it was going out fast coffee machine was working 5 minutes and for the next 15 it was leaking milk and water somebody had to come and repair every 10 15 minutes for a room full of people let s say 50 we had only one bottle of water less than 1 liter that was being refilled every 15 minutes , Clean hotel with the staff being responsive in general to your needs The neighborhood was nice and quiet 
473078,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, I did not like the location as it is not very close to the city center you need to take the bus and after the metro , I liked the breakfast it was rich and it has a wide range of deserts The room was tidy and not very big considering they accommodate 4 persons in a 2 person room 
473079,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Everything was very fine except the receptionists that were cold and uninterested and the location that was very very far from the center Don t event think to stay here if you are going to Milano by summer because you will be exposed to horrible efforts to go back from the city to the hotel There is no bus station near the metro station on your way back and if you mannage to go to the first one you will be horribly exausted cause all of the bus stations are at the sunny part of the street with no any protection above your head Definately bad location , Breakfast was quite ok The rooms are quet and cosy 
473080,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Not a center location like it was described not close to metro have to change a few buses to get to the central part We chose to take a taxi which ended up increasing the total price of our stay No nearby restaurants The bar was always closed even at 8 9 at night We had an early flight and had asked the staff to prepare us a couple of cups of coffee for 6 a m because there was no other place close by they politely said yes but ended up not doing it At the end we paid our rooms and they blocked the deposit amount for over 1 month I called to ask why they are holding my money for so long and if everything was alright they said that nothing is broken or missing but just in case they will hold the deposit for 1 month , Clean rooms
473081,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Most people will be mmming and ahhhing about the location You can walk to the main train station in about 30 minutes The nearest metro station is about 15 minutes walk Line 5 which is the newest line and is on the same line as the San Siro For me location wasn t an issue , I arrived way earlier than check in started and was greeted by a very friendly woman at reception who managed to check me in and give me the keys straight away which was so welcome after a night s sleep at an airport The hotel is much bigger than I expected and everything was clean Breakfast was good and there is a supermarket just at the end of the same street as the hotel 
473082,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Internet was slow and unresponsive at times , Parking garage was convenient and secure the staff accommodating and the breakfast a superb deal Internet was weak and spotty All in all a good deal for the location and price 
473083,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Our room s window in yard of hotel all nigh may be ventilation machine did nonstop noise To aoid it ask room with windows outside this yard 4 stars hotel always have electric kettle to make tea ot coffy but no one in this room In fact its 3 stars Far from center and enough far from train station not 1 5 km as its written U really need car to reach train, Beautiful hall of hotel easy safe free parking excellent breakfast Clean room
473084,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Shower tray did not drain quickly so had to stop water in middle of showering to ensure shower tray did not overflow Coffee cups were very small and there was always a long line for it A little bit out of the way and not close to the nearest metro station Would highly suggest getting a travel card to catch the bus to the station otherwise it s a 15 20min walk No good restaurants nearby Big supermarket offered fresh pasta and the like but no microwave or other facilities to heat up food Would have liked the hotel to have a restaurant as the location to the nearest food isn t so good or have communal facilities like a kitchen etc to heat up food from supermarket Wall near my bed had dents in which was off putting Mini fridge was not cold didn t even freeze the ice for the 3 days we were there , Staff were helpful and spoke great English so didn t have an issue communicating as previously expected Near a huge supermarket U2 which was useful for water bottles and other groceries like fruit No kettle in the room but available on request from the reception Breakfast was refilled quickly and often with variety yoghurt bread cakes roasted vegetables boiled and scrambled egg ham cheese On ground floor but did not hear any sounds from outside road or neighbouring rooms 
473085,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The breakfast was poor I was waiting for half an hour for greasy oily bacon The choices were underwhelming Food cutlery wasn t replenished you had to ask several times to get staff to bring out new stuff The wifi is poor in the hotel The staff are rude and dismissive There was no information or welcome pack when we arrived Although it said it was a 4 star hotel I beg to differ They couldn t give us any recommendations of place to go which I found very odd Overall I wouldn t stay there again , The hotel was very clean and smelt very nice The beds were comfortable 
473086,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The shower drain was a little clogged , Great breakfast selection Very organized renovated modern and it smelled freshly clean Helpfull staff with an efficient check in and check out services 
473087,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, For us the biggest disappointment was breakfast or more lack thereof When we arrived all the tables were full and all the food was pretty much consumed already by our fellow travelers Staff looked overwhelmed and confused as well I managed to snatch last coffee cup and I also scored a piece of sponge cake My friends were not that lucky though one of them hung around until new batch of boiled eggs arrived To our astonishment we found out quickly enough that the eggs had skipped the boiling process and arrived raw , Your basic hotel Not much missing not much extra 
473088,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Noyce in the morning from outdoor is a little bit annoying just across the street is a building site , Breakfast was good cappuccino and late and espresso just great Typically Italian 
473089,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The hotel is a good 15 minute walk from the nearest metro station which is a little far to be convenient We stayed with children in the room and there was no space to get around with luggage and beds taking up all floor space We had breakfast on three days at three different times the food was always cold , The air con in the first room didn t work the staff where very helpful and moved us to another room The room was quite quiet and I could very rarely hear anybody else once the door was shut 
473090,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The staff in the reception were extremely rude The Wi fi connection was more then terrible The location of the hotel is in a very complicated district of Milano When it comes to room conditions the bed was terrible hair dryer was not working and bathroom was very small and uncomfortable , I did not like anything
473091,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Located near railway and some old building Quit far from city center need to take public transport , Nice and clean hotel Good breakfast Room was a little bit small as for four people 
473092,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Breakfast wasn t much good and always missing something from tableware butter juice Hotel really really far from metro station , Comfort room
473093,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, not satisfactory English knowledge of some receptionists maybe the overall setup of the hotel was too simple considering its 4 ranking occasionally hot water did not work in the bathroom, comfortable bed wide time window for breakfast
473094,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The hotel was in a rough neighbor hood about 25 minute walk from the train station The staff were really rude and not helpful at all they seemed to really dislike English people, The hotel was very modern and was clean inside
473095,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Although the hotel has 4 stars I liked it much less than the 3star Milan hotel I stayed in Although I was convinced we booked a double room we got a twin bed room with two separate beds Although the facility in general was in fine state there was a small rip in our room curtain that I reported since I didn t want to get charged for it Personnel apologized so it was fine but it does set the overall property as used There is no closeby subway stop which was the mode of transport we generally used next to walking so the long walk 10 15mins to the hotel from central it got a bit annoying at the end of long sightseeing days Do have to say that there is a parking garage of the hotel so presumably it is good if you are travelling by car as parking in the centre seemed quite an issue In general the professional but impersonal approach put me off a bit Since the wifi is really slow I wanted to use the only pc in the internet room It didn t seem connected to internet so I asked at the front desk and the man literally replied what can I do rather than solving the problem Luckily his colleague was more helpful the next day and explained me that this pc also needs to connect to wifi rather than network cable so it was sorted fast Also during breakfast I felt sorry for the people that worked there because they felt understaffed or under organised to deal with it in a huge rush slamming new plates and cutlery on the table after guests left to make place for new running around to refresh food platters etc The people were polite but seemed under pressure Also I missed tea coffee facilities in our room leaving you to use vending machines in the corridor which I didn t use , I think the price quality ratio was good it was good value for money Of course IH is a chain which sets a standard for the services and facilities Therefore I would choose this for business trips or trips with larger groups as the facilities are suited that The room was clean had a large window and fine mattresses on the beds Also the bathroom was quite large and the shower worked fine The breakfast is industrial but fine there are standard bread slices baked off croissants alhtough only a few plain ones the rest was with chocolat and jam 2 or 3 cheeses scrambled egg saucages salads and some sweet cakes 
473096,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The bathroom was a bit uncomfortable and noisy at night The location of the hotel is not the best 10 blocks to the nearest subway station It s in front on train tracks and not many restaurants in the surroundings , The hotel is comfortable the rooms are OK We got a room with cigarette smell and when we told the check in clerk they immediately relocated us Breakfast is good and abundandt

473098,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Maybe faster internet , A supermarket near by at first we had two separeted beds but on the second day the stuff was kind to combine them in one big bed many thanks for that clean room quiet neighborhood Perfect for our stay 
473099,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The Breakfast service is really bad the room is way too small for the amount of people rooms Some had to wait more than 10 mins to get seated there is one coffee machine only so there was a queue of 5 10 people constantly Food ran out very quickly and there wasn t enough staff to bring on the new ones Location is actually really bad far away from anything the closest Metro station is 25 mins walk away They sold a triple room for a normal double room with a camping bed , The staff was nice the hotel inside was nice Breakfast content was okay

473116,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Wi fi was most of the time unusable On top of that you had to login each day and sometimes it triggered an error The walls I could hear every sound from the next room including their conversations shower water or TV The pillows were a little bit unconfortable , Good breakfast plenty of things to choose from Very clean room and it was kept clean by the everyday room service Big bathroom Close to bus station that will take you to right to Milano Centrale Close to a U2 supermarket All in all I was happy with this hotel and I would recommend it 
473117,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, I couldn t find anything not to like It was great , We really loved the hotel Excellent staff breakfast and also location Pretty close to public transportation and a quiet area It was really easy to find it leaving from Milan Centrale 
473118,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Our room was very hot and the air conditioning didn t work Bad breakfast service nice food but dirty tables we had to clean our table when we took a place Slow replacing of clean cutlery and empty plates of the self service, Good bed and quiet rooms The room was very clean every day Good breakfast and kind staff 
473119,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The hotel is not very close to the center of the town the wi fi was not in good quality for breakfast after 9 30h there were left some pieces, The towels were changed every day the place is quiet
473120,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, We did not spend much time in hotel itself or in it s surroundings we came for touristic trip so we did have time to see any major flaws Shower door could had been cleaner there was a layer of limestone Breakfast was excellent but for coffee there was a machine for Nescafe At check out the receptionist asked my friend to pay the city tax we paid it at check in he should have looked in his records before making this request , The hotel is nice and in a quiet location From the other reviews I was afraid of the location to be put away but bus stop is near 81 takes you to the Central train station and 43 to the Arco de Pace almost center From metro station Sondrio you can continue to Duomo it takes only 15 minutes to walk there or you can take any of the 2 buses to the metro station It is therefore an excellent location to start to explore the city by public transport Breakfast starts at 6 45 what is a wonderful benefit as we needed to check out early in the morning Breakfast is excellent and tasty abundant selection of hams yogurts some vegetables and plenty of fruits The room is nice and comfortable beds are comfortable 
473121,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Air conditioning was out of order 2017 March 3rd to 5th so the temperature in the room during the night was really uncomfortable and because of the noisy railway nearby is impossible to have the window opened the whole night The breakfast staff didn t manage the buffet refilling Moreover there is not much seats in the breakfast room some people can wait to be seated There is no mention of length of the extra bed on the webside it was only about 180 cm long And some trivialities missing tea Coffee maker it s 4 hotel hairdryer in the bedroom not in the bathroom city tax of 5 00 per person per night is pretty high , Comfortable beds breakfast buffet included in the price 
473122,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, We booked a double room and they gave us a twin room and told us there aren t any double rooms available In my opinion this is a major problem considering the fact that it s a four star hotel you can t just change the room without notifying the client and you can t just decide which client gets which room basing on the country he she is from However when asked for an explanation they joined beds in about ten minutes so why couldn t they do this from the beginning Secondly they charged my card with 53 euro in advance although the cancellation of the room was free Even if this is the hotel policy this is not what they sold on booking , The staff was very nice and helpful the breakfast was good The hotel is situated near a bus station aprox 10 minutes walk 
473123,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Wi fi was really poor one day just stopped working I advise you to get up earlier for breakfast , Everything was ok for 4 hotel really good breakfast but too overcrouded lack of foods during overcrouding in late hours 9 10 h Location is not so far from city center and metro station is 4 5 bus stops away Quite big supermarket is nearby The hotel is in quiet neighborhood

473133,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The breakfast was a little bit poor than I expected and some of the food was tasteless The juice machine was constantly remaining without juice and the coffee was horrible If you want you can order good coffee from the guys that take care of the tables and they will bring you the goodies from the back Also we had to wait for cutlery because there weren t enough and some of them were dirty , The room was clean and nice but didn t felt like a 4 star hotel room

473158,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Surroundings were not be the best on the way to metro station which is relatively close 10 15 min walk Some noisy and messy guests from Asia at breakfast service but that s not a hotel s fault , Even though they offer a payed parking in hotel s territory there is a free public parking in the street right in front of the hotel Breakfast with scrambled eggs bacon cheese and ham and a good selection of sweet pastries and warm croissants Coffee machine with cappuccino latte and so on Free WiFi Room was ok a normal hotel room with a fridge

473165,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The bed was narrow it is not a queen size bed it is rather her step daighter s It is not a cosy hotel felt like you are in a big empty box personal feeling But once more for one night was fine , Nice big hotel in a suburb area around 20 euros to get to the center by taxi It was for one night so it was fine 
473166,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Just a little too far out of the city we needed a metro and a dodgy walk through the suburbs to get anywhere, Clean friendly staff and a smart hotel Good breakfast
473167,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The hotel is a bit far from the center 1 metro station 4 bus stops from the central station 5 10 min by step But there s good direct bus number 81 from the central station , Very good hotel I d recommend it Clean room Good breakfast with good espresso Good prices for 4 star hotel Large supermarket in 5 10 min by walk from the hotel

473171,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Breakfast wasn t great but for the price was absolutely fine We requested a quiet room I suggest people do the same as one side of the hotel is next to a trainline Check in was 2pm but room wasn t ready on arrival , This was a real gem of a find for the price you can t go wrong Good size room clean comfortable modern I decent size bathroom with a good shower again nice clean Fridge in the room was useful Aircon worked was easy to use Area around the hotel was fairly safe only a 10 min walk to the nearest metro stop We only really used the hotel as a base write out all day but it was a nice comfortable room to come back to Most of the staff were very friendly helpful It is only a little way from the city centre we walked it several times or the metro will take you easily around the city location was again great for the price We were so happy to have found this fabulous hotel for this price 
473172,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, We asked for two rooms one for four persons and one for three Got a small room for the four tiny room and another one with mold and no water running Changed room but got one that was far away The beds are horrific my back hurts after two nights Breakfast is not good Juice is finished with no renewal eggs the same , Parking is free 
473173,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, A little bir dirty exept rooms specially corridors Needs renovation , Perfect place it is very close to port and bar streets Room is big There is good restaurant cheap 12 euro per person for dinner Staff smiling all time Parking place is enought 
473174,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Hotel looking tired shower hopeless hard and Small bed grumpy reception staff get what you pay for I suppose, Parking was easy bus stop just a short walk 4 50 euro for day s travel ticket bus and metro
473175,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The hotel is a little bit far from the public transport stations especially if you would like to go there after 9PM or in the early morning The wifi didn t work well , The room was clean and quiet We could check before the official checking time The breakfast was pretty good 
473176,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Breakfast is terrible It is one of the poorest breakfast I had in Italy Juice from syrup the cheapest one and the coffee is extremely bad from a Nescafe machine This hotel should be 3 stars instead of 4 but probably they know as well so that s why they offer you so low price Do not expect too much so then it is OK otherwise it is far away from a 4 star quality , Location kind iof ok 20 minutes walk to the metro station and parking was free No need to worry about the signs at the front of the hotel you can park completely free The question is why it is not mentioned at the hotel s information in booking com 
473177,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Air conditioning is not reli working wud be hot at first but wud get a bit better later on Not a 4 stars hotel in definitely Staff is not helpful as well Location is bad , There s a big supermarket nearby wif around 3 4 mins walk
473178,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Is this really a 4star hotel It feels like they are lying to you The wifi was appalling the staff just shrugged everything off I got badly bitten by mosquitoes the staff had NO medical first aid supplies whatsoever On Saturday when I began to complain it became clear that there was only ONE member of staff in the WHOLE hotel The restaurant is only open in the mornings for breakfast there is absolutely no access to food or drinks at any other time how can that be 4 star There was only one sheet over the mattress with blood stains showing through disgusting And I had 4 nights of terrible sleep coaches seem to arrive every night from 1 3 A M all these passengers check into the hotel and the noise is horrendous as they walk down the corridors along the bedrooms For some reason there is extremely high turnover of hotel guests perhaps connected to the coaches on one night stops On one night someone kept trying to open my bedroom door at around 2am I rang reception but noone answered When I checked into my room they had put me in one with connecting doors So for 5 nights I had new arrivees in that room fiddling with the door trying to open it Overall I d NEVER book this hotel again It s more like a 2 3star This is NOT what I expect when booking a place that is supposed to be 4star ,No Positive
473179,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, some staff are not that helpful I stayed there 2 nights the first night I got a better room with a better shower hot water control then I went to hiking in France and Switzerland I got a similar room the second night but the shower hot water control is a bit out of control , overall the hotel provided a comfortable stay breakfast is good some staff are helpful 
473180,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The location of this hotel is really not good I dont mind staying a little bit out of town as long as there is a Metro station near by The nearest metro station Istria is about 1 5 km away but I whould not suggest walking from there late at night or with a big suitcase Another metro station Sondrio is about 1 6 or 1 7 km away and you can take a bus for about half of the distance Ok for one night if you dont mind a little extra walking , The staff was really kind room was big and clean My favourite part of this hotel was the breakfast which was really amazing 
473181,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, no coffee heater water boiler little far from the city, parking outside and under gournd Good Breakfast very friendly staff Clean and up todate
473182,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The hotel offers no room service It does not even have its own restaurant but sends guests to a restaurant around the corner Breakfast is a battlefield In our room the shower rail was broken the shower head was dirty the curtains were ripped and the table lamp was dangerously hanging off the wall This is not what I expect from a 4 star hotel , The staff was polite and efficient 
473183,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Room cleanliness to be improved The whole hotel even if apparently new gave the impression of lack of care of details and maintenance The access to the parking was on both days a challenge intercom seems not working properly or nobody answering I had to call the receptionist by using my mobile phone or leave the car in front of the parking entrance and walk to the reception to get the door opened , Parking availability relatively central location by car fair breakfast
473184,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Feels more like a 3 star hotel Wouldn t recommend long stays , Great value stay with cheap parking and good breakfast Perfect for short stays or business 
473185,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Comfort and equipment is rather as a hotel than a hotel We were recommended a restaurant near by whose advertising lay at the room but it was not worth the money we spend , Okey breakfast Okey staff
473186,IH Hotels Milano Gioia,No Negative, From the welcome to the checkout they did a great job The room was spacious and the bed perfect for an overnight stay The restaurant they recommended for dinner was lovely
473187,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The air con in our room was not working the receptionist was a little grumpy and not so helpful kinda far from center but can t expect for more coz price was cheap compared to other hotels, Buffet breakfast was very good the price of the hotel room was cheap for 4
473188,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, the front desk staff needs to observe the 5 10 rule acknowledge your guests from 10 feet away with a smile greet them from 5 feet away which they do not and if they are helping another guest as you approach the desk you are ignored until it is your turn having worked in hospitality for 8 years I find this extremely rude a simple I ll be right with you makes all the difference other than that the only other issue was that the wifi is spotty and will kick you off rather frequently , great value for money extremely reasonable prices for the all inclusive nature of the property decent breakfast wifi included 
473189,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The location At first at google maps it seemed close to the train station but it is not 15 20 minutes walk to the nearest metro stop 25 30 to the train station through all sorts of neighborhoods from ok to not ok The room was clean but not as clean as we would expect from a 4 star hotel , The breakfast was impressive There was a large variety of sweet and salty food to choose from There were also juices fruits a coffee machine with american coffee cappuccino latte etc The room was small but had everything someone could hope for There was also a safe which nowadays is rather important The wifi had good signal and good speed The matresses were excellent 
473190,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The location of the hotel isn t so far from the centre but to get the centre you should take the metro which is needed to walk 25 mins So you get tired from the beginning of your trip I do not recommend you this hotel unless you have a car , Cleanliness is the only thing that i can say
473191,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Relatively good 3 hotel Location room size breakfast etc were ok for 3 Who and why added forth star is inexplicable Wifi was very slow and you have to enter code every 3 5 min But biggest problem is breakfast Kitchen definitely is unable to service everybody in time so getting spoons forks cups and food itself is a challenge You have to ask staff about it all the time please bring forks please bring eggs etc Really annoying ,No Positive
473192,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Breakfast is a bit of a free for all No bus stops or train tram without a bit of a walk Think I booked when price was higher , Clean rooms OK location Nice entrance and parking if you need it 
473193,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Location is not really good you need to walk 5 minutes then take a bus to get the metro station It is not comfortable if you want to stay in the city late night And there is no restaurants bars nearby I think it is more comfortable for families, hotel is nice comfortable breakfast is very reach and good staff is friendly 
473194,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Not near any transport Staff told us to catch bus but you need a ticket and there is nowhere near to buy them Staff had no details on tours No nice restaurants near by to eat at ,No Positive
473195,IH Hotels Milano Gioia,No Negative, Breakfast was very good lots of choice and self service Good quality bedroom and bathroom We were allocated two double rooms when we arrived and asked to change to twins which was done immediately 
473196,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, far frome metro station refrigitor and air condition doesnt work very well 5 euro tax per person per night, cleaning breakfast comfortable super market close
473197,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, A little bit irritating was the fact that the mobile devices needed to log on to the wifi every time anew if they had switched off or been off the perimeter But that is the only complaint , This standard of service and flexibility for that price very impressive Staff very helpful and pretty good in English flexible in helping us find the arrangement we were looking for Even after reserving and cancelling and then reserving and changing a bit they were friendly and cooperative Well done and thank you 
473198,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Wi fi was really bad throughout our stay Breakfast was underwhelming especially for a 4 star hotel Closest metro station is nearly 15 mins away, Rooms were clean and spacious staff was friendly there is free wifi in the room nice and quiet location regardless of the fact it is located near train tracks there is also a supermarket about 5 mins away 
473199,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, In my opinion it s not the 4 Hotel We had stayed in other European cities in Italy as well in 4 hotels before and we had bigger and cleaner rooms and much more variety for breakfast Thus in average IH Hotels Milano Gioia is not bad at all but it s rather 3 Hotel For instance you almost do not get any vegetables for breakfast and do not have fresh juice at all The room was not that clean for example we had some small garbage in the garbage pin But in average you get the adequate service for the money you pay , The Staff was friendly and helpful the location is not that bad let s say 20 25 minutes by walk from the Central train station and may be 45 minutes 1 hour from the Duomo di Milano the price is not that high for the service you get comparing with other hotels in Milan 
473200,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, No AC Omg it was tooo hot to sleep We were there in may n they said we cant turn it on unless it is its seasons Breakfast was v crowded u have to wait in line to get in, Huge hotel
473201,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, little distance from central station you have take a bus to go there or walk if you like to do some walking but not with your languages please , I like their breakfast was everything there fruit all kind cake all kind of tea and cafes viola was very helpful she asked me if I would like her to make for me special cup caffe Omar was very friendly with big smile in his face when we arrived to hotel good price for the hotel make me feel I m at home
473202,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Not a 4 star hotel at all 1 didn t clean the room 2 too far from the subway 3 breakfast wasn t really good not a good choice 4 wifi was loosing the signal every 15 min Was very expensive for such hotel, Nice stuff
473203,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The organization of breakfast is poor the coffee machine generates a huge queue as it is in a corner Staff at the front desk is quite not friendly or knowledgeble asked for advice regarding open shop for cigarettes but they failed to know any location in the neighborhood Be prepared for groups and go to have breakfast as early as possible otherwise like us have to line for enter for breakfast The breakfast is very understaffed only two ladies were doing their very best but they could not cope with 100 guests at the same time , Good value for the money close to bus stop general store some restaurants The Central Station is in a good walking distance Breakfast was quite sufficient 
473204,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, very slow check in and inadequate staff unprepared for a huge event champions league there was only one staff member at the reception at 15 00 where 15 00 is the pick time for check in in my opinion and they asked for 10 more euros as a town tax also there wasn t anyone at the bar and we couldn t even have a coffee or anyrhing to drink rather than to buy from a vending machine it shouldn t be a 4 star hotel but a hostel, Nice rooms and comfortable beds
473205,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, There was no ketlltle to make hot drinks I could not drink anything I had to buy everything The directions were poor it took me hours to locate it The fridge in the room was not working The breakfast was basic and if any item finished it was not replaced so if any guest came later most food stuffs were finished The staff had poor English language content so communication was a challenge I had chosen a twin room and was offered a double room and had to explain to them In the whole I would not stay there again and would not recommend it to anyone, The bedding was clean
473206,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, We should have had access to court yard all the time but it was very secure which I liked The registration could be better We had to wait an hour to drop our luggage , The size of the rooms were great Close to supermarket It was super clean and very modern 
473207,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The breakfast was very simple a lot of cakes but very little notmal food I had a feeling that the boiled eggs were min 1 week old The room was very small and the conditioner was very loud during the night Besides of that there was a door in the room leading to the neighbour room You could hear everything happening behind that door This hotel is definitely not worth that price ,No Positive
473208,IH Hotels Milano Gioia,No Negative, The staff at IH Milan Gioia were truly wonderful polite and accommodating However we stayed later at IH Hotel Milano Watt 13 which had the rudest receptionist we had ever come across so hopefully this hotel chain does not share swap staff between its branches 
473209,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, If you switch on the light near the door the other light beside the bed is on too Bitter ACE juice , Lovely breakfast cakes in the morning Good air conditioning system Spacious and comfortable double room Pretty close to central station 
473210,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The hotel is located in an area that looks derelict with abandoned grafitti covered buildings It is about 20 minutes from the closest underground station and the walk to it is bad looking Although the hotel sports 4 stars it actually felt more like a 3 star accomodation Of course the price too is 3 star so no complaint on that The staff is not particularly helpful or welcoming We sometimes had the impression we were inconveniencing them The whole hotel gives the impression that it has known better times It is perfectly clean but there are things that do not work and that have not been repaired e g noisy climatisation clogged shower bassin stained carpet toilet button not working etc It feels like they are struggling for money and cannot afford to repair such minor things , Good value for money 
473211,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Staff were rather unhelpful At one point at breakfast they accused me of not booking breakfast even though i had and made me wait out in reception only to be carted off to different staff members I was not offered an apology for the inconvenience ,No Positive
473212,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The room was filthy indecently dirty flagged carpet with curtains broken and dirty so as the toilette and the room walls The room keys card sticky and dirty of old glue coming from older stickers bearing the wrong room number Direction inside the hotel incorrect Breakfast very poor for the hotel stars Staff unprofessional and the trainee particularly arrogant and aggressive LA STANZA INDECENTE CON TENA STRAPPATA E SPORCA MOQUETTE MACCHIATA DA TEMPO E DISGUSTOSAMENTE SPORCA ANCHE I COPRI LAMPADE ALONATI E MACCHIATI CON, Relatively quite location despite noisy at the side of railway Posizione relativamente tra quilla nonostante rumorosa sul lato della ferrovia
473213,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The appliances in the bathroom were quite old and not working properly it would be nice to have complimentary coffee in the room, The space of the room and of the bathroom
473214,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Location is terrible When you go out in the night is like some horror move No light only dark Staff is disaster you feel like in some prisoners Nobody dont wanna say hello They give you one key from room if you with sombody in the room cant saperate when you go out If you come back alone you cant came into the room no chance for second key For brekfast time not enough space then you must way your turn Also for brekafast time you can came without key from room This rules i hear first time in my life Like this you must be all time together with Elevetor from garage dont work like this you must use stairs with all bags to came to lobby This is first and last time i go in this hotel , Nothing 
473215,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Room was slightly smaller than expected for 4 but manageable Bear in mind there is 20 minute walk to the nearest Metro station , Staff are very accommodating and helpful Hotel is very nice Breakfast is excellent quality and wide variety to satisfy all tastes including children If you are after a quite location then this is a great place for you 
473216,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The service could be better when we called to ask for an extra pillow at 11 30PM the receptionist told us to come down to the reception to get one We ask several times to fix one of the lights in our room it was still not working when we left after 3 days , Reasonable breakfast quite location
473217,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, It has one star more The bed was small without extra pillow The hotel is far from public transports , It can be a good choice if there is a good discount 
473218,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, we booked for 3 persons but they gave us things for 2 persons only internet are slow blower is not working and we are expecting room on the upper part of the hotel not at the 0 floor , the breakfast are awesome we love it 
473219,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, I asked for cappuccino at the breakfast and the lady in charge was telling me that it was not ok Weather it is offered for free or charged onced it is offered the waiter should promptly serve you not argue with the clients,No Positive
473220,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Not quite close to the bus station from which you can get on the subway to go downtown Bad internet connection in the room , Daily cleaning linen towels toiletries Nice breakfast Large bed Comfortable bathroom 
473221,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, It was quite a bit off the metro 13 min walk Near the train rails which might make some people lose some sleep didn t happen to me or my friends but I could see it happening to a real light sleeper , It was clean and the stuff was helpful That s all we needed 
473222,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The rooms were obviously being cleaned often but the mold persisted between the tiles of the bathroom and other corners and the water spots were either scrubbed away by a very hard working cleaning staff along with the chrome finishing or were just persisting in lack of proper cleaning substance A lot of spots on the floor Chair covered in extensive spots of sweat and other bodily liquids The toast served for breakfast had a moldy smell throughout the 3 occasions we were there for breakfast The towels were smelly like they were being just dried rather than washed The management is definitely cutting costs from every angle , There was nothing to impress us even though our expectations were low 
473223,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Nothing to mention, Everything was wonderful the breakfast was delicious and had a lot of pastry the cleaning service was impeccable and the room was really nice 
473224,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Dirty room and bathroom Restorant is full at the breakfast and it is necessary to wait for a table Internet connection was not good , Good breakfast Good location in quaet area Parking for 5 EUR per day 
473225,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Poorly organized in many ways Internet did not work at all one whole day a disaster for a business traveler Always a line at reception sometimes a long one with only one person serving customers while two or three did something else this scene repeated several times during my stay Staff failed to order a taxi as requested Location very desolate although not far from everything Coffee machine not working at breakfast and it serves only instant coffee anyway No restaurant but there is a very good and inexpensive trattoria nearby , Amazing table of pastries at breakfast Obviously trying to make this their signature and in fact it really was good although breakfast in other respects rather poor Good value for money 
473226,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, A little bit far from subway and most of locations It is OK if you do not need come back to the hotel several times per day Sometimes railway nereby makes noise but not often Wifi password needed to be inserted after every few minutes of idle state , Very clean and modern hotel with excellent breakfast for small money I ve got more than I expected for my business trip in Milan
473227,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The personnel has poor English skills they gave us a room for disabled people and we had already paid for a double room with queen bed They changed the room but not with the one I paid for and saw on Booking saying that the pictures were old and rooms don t look like that anymore The room was small without a wardrobe and no slippers The wi fi can be accessed with a code but it would disconnect every 5 minutes which was unpleasant , We stayed here during 14 18 of March 2016 The hotel is located at 3 bus station from Sondrio metro station which is at 4 stops from Duomo The breakfast was ok and also the cleaning service towels were changed on a daily basis Coffee was very good at the reception 
473228,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The breakfast was very simple more deserts It wasn t even tomatoes or cucumbers only one kind of cheese and two kinds of salami At all it was ok, I
473229,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, It was a bit far from the metro station Sondrio like 15 minutes on foot but you could take the 81 line bus to go to milano centrale which was close enough, Very nice Breakfast Clean and cozy room and great price for it s quality
473230,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Staff at the breakfast I asked for 2 cappuccino and the lady was argueing that I should not ask for more Not nice, Good value for money nice staff at reception 
473231,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, To make the room perfect it would have been nice to have a kettle but that was the only down side, Breakfast was amazing great location helpful staff room was good size for the money the metro was close by which was great loads of nice places to eat outside the hotel would recommend De Marchi Whole stay was very pleasurable
473232,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The location It was about 20 25 minutes from Centrale Station or a 10 euro taxi ride Also buses ran every 15 minutes from the end of the street so although it s a little out the way it s easily accessible , The hotel was very clean modern and exactly what we needed for the weekend Somewhere to sleep and shower 
473233,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The staff rood and unpleasant They give as a special room for person with disabilities and when I request to change it with a normal one they was rood and did not understand that is not comfortable to stay in this type of room They gave us the only room free with twin bed and with a horrible smell of cigarettes it smell bad even in the shower Horror I paid for a double room and request a king size bed in the option before check in the hotel Not a quiet place Far from the metro station 15minute distance with the bus not a walking distance, The breakfast was fine 
473234,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, 4 Persons rooms was 2 2 No additional towels in the bathroom We had to ask two times to have them brought TV set not working For me max 2 stars for this hotel ,No Positive
473235,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Pillows could have been better the floor carpet could have been cleaner The rest was perfect , Breakfast was very good staff was helpful with our demands they even included us a small breakfast pack on the day we left at 3 am decent size room daily cleaning for the room location close to the metro to San Siro or city center quiet location good free Wi Fi good value for prices in Milano 
473236,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, had to change rooms as the first one had a lot of rust in the bathroom and the shower curtain was old and improperly cleaned employees were painting the hotel lobby in the middle of the day very noisy as the rail tracks are across the hotel broken lamp and leaking faucet in second room reception staff rude when requested to change the room, great breakfast close to public transport decent WiFi however each 24 hours you have to request a new access code breakfast area staff very helpful and polite
473237,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Hotel is in quite a desolate run down area Although breakfast range was good the dining room staff utensils were perhaps not enough to accommodate all guests during busy periods For instance bowls forks and mugs all ran out at some point requiring guests to request more and or wait until more were provided, Comfortable room friendly staff buffet breakfast with decent range OK location about 15 minutes from a metro stop five stops away from Duomo 
473238,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Limited facilities no resturant Breakfast is average hardly any vegetarian options No kettle and tea in the room But what do you expect for the money bit far out , Price was good
473239,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, A bit far from the city centre and the location was near a railway there was practically nothing in the room slippers glasses for water everything was given on demand at the reception for a 4 hotel it would not be expected Not much attention paid to details water leaking in the bathroom heating turning off over night, Liked the breakfast and the staff The hotel was clean
473240,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, extremely loud rooms facing railways We asked for the quiet one but get the worst The heating thermostat was broken we couldn t get lower temperature than 25 degrees Few things was broken and there was only one lamp in the room and two working in bathroom it was very dark , great breakfast kind service Clean towels every day 
473241,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, i have been in so many hotels around Europe but i haven t seen such a worst staff First i don t know who gave 4 stars to this hotel but for sure is NOT There is no concierge Porter The reception staff is answering to any questions and people are in que I needed to wait 20 min They don t know basic stuffs like direction busses We went there after the football game and my girlfriend asked the reception for a bowl with hot milk They told us that everything is closed and they dont have even a bowl So they gave us 4 small coffee take away cups Total no more than 100 ml milk and charge us 8 euros for less than 100 ml milk Bathroom was very dirty the shower cabin is 1x1 meter Very small The shower rose is full limestone The water canal was blocked so takes 10 min to leek I have been i 3 stars hotels in Milan which are way better than this 4 star hotel So if you want proper hotel for this money choose something else WiFi is terrible They give you 24 hours code and you need to enter this code every time when you want to connect If you are not using you device for even a minute the WiFi automatically disconnect you device , Location Is close to supermarket bus station going to central station This things you need to figure out by Google maps because staff will send you to underground station which is 20 min by walk 
473242,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The room I was placed inn along that corridor the hotel was being renovated and I was left there to chock on the residue of the renovation, It was central for me 
473243,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, the reception staff not so nice a bit far from city and train station the bathroom needs renovation Internet was awful small bed, the room was clean Breakfast was great buffet staff in the breakfast area was very polite
473244,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Showerhead was very dirty pressure was poor and the water cold We did not have a good shower for the duration of our stay The room temperature dial was a mystery It was boiling hot for the first 24 hours You need to get a new wifi code every 48 hours from the front desk Good selection of food but the quality was poor and I would advise sticking to the croissants and fruit , Bed was a very good size Good transport links Overall you get what you pay for It s a good hotel for the money you are paying 
473245,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, far away from the city center it s definitelly not a 4 stars hotel bathroom in our room need renovation, nice breakfast buffe comfortable beds clean rooms
473246,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, I didn t like the fact that the shower was like broken although it could be used The internet connection was not the best one I ve ever seen , I liked how the room looked The the bed was comfortable enough 
473247,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The room wasn t cleaned properly not hoovered under children bed there was a 2 feet in diameter dark grey mouldy stain on the ceiling in the bathroom Also the carpets were all stained During the breakfast they kept running out of cups eggs cakes juice and it took then ages to replenish those The key card didnt work had to go up and down two times then asked for different room ,No Positive
473248,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The hotel had mold basically everywhere We have changed room three times for the first time because of dirty bathroom and lack of tv set second time because of the mold which still persisted in the third room but the conditions did not change When I saw that in the third room we stayed there was a mold over our head I completely lost patience I wanted to talk to the booking manager and ask for refund Unfortunately during three days we stayed there the manager was not in the office On the second day we woke up because of the water dropping from the ceiling We contacted hotel via email provided at the reception and via complaint email received by booking com but after 10 days there is still no sign from IH Hotels Milano Gioia The conditions are not acceptable for any sort of hotel This is four star hotel but neither the conditions nor the service is of 4 We recommend you to stay out and choose another hotel,No Positive
473249,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Transports to the hotel Should have a bar open at night and a restaurant service because there s only one restaurant nearby , The breakfast is awesome rooms are good and the staff is helpfull 
473250,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Distance from city center is not one of it s virtues Without a car it not so easy and fast to reach the center , Everything was great Comfort super price not ideal but very nice breakfast buffet more then enough per person There is a park space on the street in front of the hotel safe und quiet environment 
473251,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Internet was awful very slow it takes 5 minute to load gmail there were no free shuttle to Milano central station they wanted to give us different room as was booked, breakfast
473252,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The rooms were a bit overheated and we had a broken door knob, We arrived with a car no problem finding the place with gps and stayed in the hotel for two nights Even though hotel has private parking 10 euros per day we used free public parking space as it is in front of the hotel and area is quite safe Staff was helpful with directing us to the center and public transportation but we searched this before coming to the hotel as well There are usefull metro bus and city apps that all work offline so it is not bad to check them before going to the city Room was nice and tidy with good shower and ok bed Breakfast was excellent especcialy as we are talking about italian breakfast that are not very various and rich with offer from my past experiances All kinds of different salami cheese delicious cakes fruit All in all this is ok place for Milano stay if you don t have troubles with walking metros and buses and if you don t need for hotel to be the IT factor of your stay 
473253,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, We experienced a multitude of events which led to us not enjoying our stay our first room was okay but noisy Due to the location of the hotel near train tracks and presumably industrial sights there were often loud banging noises and train noises that disrupted us Other than that it was okay but on the 2nd night we returned to our room to find the pipe under the sink had broken off and due to a dripping tap the bathroom floor had started pooling water This is when our trouble started when we approached the staff to have the situation sorted out we were made to feel like we were inconveniencing them making us uncomfortable As a whole the reception staff were rude in our second room there was no toilet seat the lamp was hanging out of the wall socket and electrocuted me Also the hot water in the shower was malfunctioning When we returned to the desk to ask if there were any other rooms available all we were told was no even though we later checked the booking com app and saw that rooms were available for booking on the sight Also 2 facilities that were advertised on the booking com listing were non existent These were Laundry and shuttle bus The breakfast was expansive but the quality especially of the coffee and hot food was not great in general the facility was not what you d expect of a 4 star hotel stained carpets and walls one wall of a corridor outside our first room covered in mould the location itself made you feel like you were in a ghetto with abandoned buildings and dark streets However it wasn t too inconvenient to get to the city centre if you don t mind walking and waiting for public transport All in all we did not enjoy our stay and will not return to the hotel however we did love Milan , bed was comfortable and large expansive breakfast
473254,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, NO HOT water in the shower problem claimed but not solved by the hotel no discount etc lamp was broken rubbish bin was broken floor was dirty breakfast was not rich only wheat bread dirty cups and glasses staff in the breakfast area was very unpolite, staff was able to help possibilty to keep luggage

473256,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, Hotel was horribly maintained somewhat dirty Rooms are extremely dark walls are dirty and some lamps in the room didn t work , Excellent price for last minute booking 
473257,IH Hotels Milano Gioia, The most problematic aspect was the position at the end of a dark street not very close to all the transport means Metro is about 15mins walking but at 5 mins walking there are busses that connect to the very centre of the city It is just a matter of studying public transport around the area the indications from the reception were not really helpful I also noticed some small details the licking tap in the toilette repaired the last night the toilet paper holder was broken small things but I would not expect to see them in a 4 stars hotel , The hotel was very comfortable and very good Personnel was friendly and breakfast was rich with a lot of wonderful cakes fruit continental and italian choices This was a very good value for money
