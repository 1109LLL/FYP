227932,Mercure Tour Eiffel Grenelle, Nothing everything I experienced at the hotel was perfect, Everything about the room was great shower was lovely bed was comfy and view of the Eiffel Tower from the window was beautiful Only 22 from Gare Du Nord to the hotel and 18 for the return about 5 10min walk to Eiffel Tower and 15mins to a large shopping centre Room was always clean and staff would always be there to help Supermarket 5 mins away bars and restaurants surrounding and patisserie round the corner Everything you could need 
227933,Mercure Tour Eiffel Grenelle,No Negative, Perfect location only 10 minutes walk to Eiffel tower The metro station is just apposite Many shops around fruits phamacies coffee restaurants and even laundry service I will choose this hotel again when back to Paris 
227934,Mercure Tour Eiffel Grenelle, Careful of scammers from metro Walking distance to Eiffel tower but metro needed for other sites, The metro access was great Walking distance to hotel 
227935,Mercure Tour Eiffel Grenelle, Location was only ok I paid 30 extra for a view of the Eiffel Tower without this the hotel wouldn t have been worth the money , Comfy but small room Really liked the birch box and soft comfy dressing gown
227936,Mercure Tour Eiffel Grenelle,No Negative, Perfect location for sight seeing and had a view of the tower from the room I was concerned to see a metro line right in front of the hotel but the sound proofing was excellent Combined with the comfortable bed we had a very good night sleep 
227937,Mercure Tour Eiffel Grenelle, The room was on the small side , The location of the property was excellent Nearest metro stop was yards away with links to all of the main attractions Eiffel Tower was within walking distance 
227938,Mercure Tour Eiffel Grenelle, The facilities in the bathroom and also 1 mineral water perday as we were traveling together, The location is near tram station supermarket and restaurant and also Eiffel Tower 
227939,Mercure Tour Eiffel Grenelle, Everything was perfect apart from on our last morning I noticed that the air conditioning system leaked into our wardrobe and onto our clean clothes We told reception and they were not too concerned or bothered This was quite disappointing because they had been fabulous up to this point and we loved everything , The room view and the staff up to the last morning 
227940,Mercure Tour Eiffel Grenelle, We chose not to eat breakfast at the hotel The price 19 euros seemed far too steep Perhaps the breakfast is copious we didn t look but we were happy to spend a few euros in a local caf for caf au lait and croissants , The staff were very friendly and helpful The bed was large and very comfortable The surrounding neighbourhood upper 15e is not touristy When we had coffee and croissants in a caf in the morning or dinner at a local bistrot in the evening most of the patrons were locals There is a m tro station Dupleix on the doorstep The neighbourhood is wonderful for strolling and there is a magnificent food market on Boul de Grenelle on Sunday mornings 
227941,Mercure Tour Eiffel Grenelle, The air conditioning was broken in the room and the staff made a bunch of excuses rather than fixing it or moving us to another room , The facility was clean and in an excellent location 
227942,Mercure Tour Eiffel Grenelle, The breakfast room was abominable at 7 15 am the room was drowned in a very loud and unbearable muzak of no musical or other value The staff were allegedly unable to turn the volume down or shut it as the controls were in the basement and they had to wait for 8 am for the manager to arrive at 8 am nothing happened though It ruined the breakfast and was so unpleasant I recommend avoiding this hotel and will personally never return there , The breakfast was very good gastronomically unfortunately the muzak was so loud it was impossible to enjoy it The bed was very comfortable 
227943,Mercure Tour Eiffel Grenelle, The cost the hotel is good I ve been to Paris twice stayed in a different hotel last time which wasn t as expensive And then this time payed much much more But didn t see the difference in paying the much more Felt like the cheaper hotel I stayed in was just as good The extra money wasn t justified But it s a nice hotel , Good area of Paris not far from the Eiffel Tower
227944,Mercure Tour Eiffel Grenelle, The hotel looks demoded on the outside but the rooms have been renovated recently, Great value for money in Paris close to metro decent bed and showers
227945,Mercure Tour Eiffel Grenelle, Basic services are lacking Elevator is not working so we had to climb daily 5 floors room air conditioning was not working yet the people argued daily that it was even though I was sweating Also they refused to refill the in room coffee and milk powder on a daily basis Basic amenities and services must be provided no matter what , Receptionist was very sweet
227946,Mercure Tour Eiffel Grenelle, I found the staff more friendly and helpful last time , Our 2nd time staying here the refurb has really improved the property it s now lovely and modern Great location as it s a short walk to Seine and Eiffel Tower Cafes and supermarkets just up the street 
227947,Mercure Tour Eiffel Grenelle, More signage showing where bar restaurant is Lift very busy, Man on reception very nice and polite Very clean and fresh room Didn t have breakfast
227948,Mercure Tour Eiffel Grenelle, The fact that I asked for a room with a view on Eiffel Tower and didn t get one I also didn t understand the need to pay extra city tax upon arrival , The room was very nicely decorated modern look and very fancy The bed was extra comfortable with 3 sets of pillows Perfect rooms for people who sleep a lot as the curtains kept all of the daylight out 
227949,Mercure Tour Eiffel Grenelle, There was construction works happening at the time When I booked I didn t know this was happening and it was not indicated , Close to the Eiffel Towet
227950,Mercure Tour Eiffel Grenelle, Was under major renovations Air conditioning wasnt working in room Morning supervisor was nt in any rush to accomodate me for the hot steamy night before He lied and said that its the same all over the hotel and told me to open the window I dont undersatnd how thats possible when the hall way had AC A Night time female employee didnt get her name very polite black girl with glasses made accomodations for me to move to a different area of the hotel with ac , Was under major renovations Air conditioning wasnt working in room Morning supervisor was nt in any rush to accomodate me for the hot steamy night before He lied and said that its the same all over the hotel and told me to open the window I dont undersatnd how thats possible when the hall way had AC A Night time female employee didnt get her name very polite black girl with glasses made accomodations for me to move to a different area of the hotel with ac 
227951,Mercure Tour Eiffel Grenelle, to be honest I don t really have any the only thing and I m literally pulling hairs is the fact the hotel bar was under construction, Fantastic room very clean and comfortable staff are always happy to help Ideal location plenty of bars and restaurants near by the metro station is literally In front of the hotel so it s fab if your using it to get around
