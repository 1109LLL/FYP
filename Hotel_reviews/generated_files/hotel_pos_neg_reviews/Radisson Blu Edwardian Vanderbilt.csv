230436,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Not suitable for someone with knees problems the shower was in the tube and the tube was to high for my knees lots of ways and turns to go from the entrance to the room , The staff was really very nice and helpful 
230437,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, See above, TV broken room small could open bathroom door more than half way cannot sit on toilet without knees touching wall Squeeze around toilet to get to shower hairdryer lead too short to reach mirror which was tucked in alchove Chaos at breakfast glad to leave Terrible hotel
230438,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room was a bit crowded because sofa was turned into second bed There isn t much shelf space in the bathroom During our stay there was twice false fire alarm in the morning I was told that those occurred because someone had taken too long hot shower Hmmm On those mornings breakfast was crowded since every customer had woken up at the same time , Perfect location excellent underground connection to Heathrow Nice quiet room first floor facing street Very good breakfast yogurt fresh fruit and berries fruit juice coffee tea croissants eggs bacon beans sausages grilled mushrooms and tomatoes various seeds etc Excellent helpful personnel cheers Eva Lee and Yustyna It was nice to read and relax at bar with free drinks on each evening apparently this offer depends on what room you have extra points for that The museums are near as are several restaurants 
230439,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room was tiny you could not swing a cat the smallest bathroom I have ever seen The hot food on the buffet table was cold and over cooked, Plenty of choice for breakfast off the cold table
230440,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, I booked breakfast using Booking com but it was not on my booking Room was fine but smelled musty the first night On the second night it smelled as if a drain were blocked I was very tired so did not ask to change Room was a good size and bed was comfortable Hotel was understaffed or so the staff said Staff seemed to have difficulty understanding requests in a English ,No Positive
230441,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, If you have a standard room as our friends had the rooms can be exceedingly small some of the smallest I have seen even though you could be paying up to 220 pounds a night The prices in the bar and restaurant were high so I would eat and breakfast at one of the places around the corner or take the train from Gloucester road station and go elsewhere As we had a deluxe room we took the option of paying an extra 15 each for breakfast at the hotel restaurant but the breakfast was a bit ordinary for the price so next time we would breakfast at a local cafe , On first arrival the reception staff were very helpful and allowed us to access a room early after a very long flight We were very grateful However when we returned after a few days elsewhere the front desk staff were unhelpful about getting any access and a bit officious so message is it depends on who you encounter The building the hotel is in is very beautiful with rooms down narrow winding corridors We had a very nice room both times of decent size and quiet and comfortable but we paid for a deluxe room The location of this hotel is excellent if you want to do the V A museum and natural history museum which is straight up the road 
230442,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Bathroom a little tired, Comfy bed big room Great breakfasts plenty of choice Initial problem with room allocation resolved promptly and professionally thanks Adam 
230443,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room was dated and needed a bit of a facelift to match the rest of the hotel and it was supposed to have been a deluxe room , Staff excellent great stay 
230444,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, We booked double room but was not available but upgraded us to two superior single rooms So no real complaints And rooms were next door to each other , Bed was super comfy staff very friendly and available at all times for any questions we had Made to feel very welcome and the service was lovely 
230445,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, My single room 148 was advertised as having a fridge and B O TV it had neither Room service did provide a large ice bucket on request The 24 TV s HDMI sockets were locked out so I couldn t use my PS4 It is best to describe the wardrobe as a hanging space basically a shelf mounted to the wall with a hanging rack under it Other than reaching the very high shelf there is nowhere for smaller items The room was VERY small indeed despite the ensuite bathroom having a full sized bath with shower overhead you couldn t close the bathroom door it caught on the bottom of the bed Ok for sleeping in but that s about it Nothing much of a view out of the window I d pay a little more for a better room next time I assume the more expensive rooms do have a fridge and a better TV Still 150 for a room in that part of town wasn t awful considering it included breakfast which was 20 if paid for separately , Nicely presented and clean Staff were friendly breakfast was very good and it was quiet In a good location only 2 3 minutes walk from Gloucester Road tube with lots of shops supermarkets and restaurants nearby The air conditioning was a bit 1980 s no auto temperature hold but it kept the room at a reasonable temperature considering it was 30C outside Room had an iron ironing board and a safe Reasonable number of power sockets There are a bunch of hotel movie services at fairly reasonable prices about 4 to rent a film It is like a rabbit warren to find your room but does have a lot more character than many hotels Make sure you check the fire escape route as it was not that obvious 
230446,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, We always have a great time here Excellent location and great service management The hotel might be better suited for a bit older kids rather than toddlers We went to patisserie Paul every morning just around the corner for the best breakfast croissants and coffee The hotel breakfast is quite good too but not worth the money to be honest Bonus they have great fish n chips in the hotel restaurant The cutest area for evening strolls is South Kensington a 5 7 min slow walk or 2 stops with the bus where you can find good restaurants and great ice cream open late When reserving a room ask for a newly refurbished executive room they are great 
230447,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, When we arrived the staff was unable to give us a room with two beds as we had requested with our reservation Instead they offered two single rooms next to each other and included breakfast at no extra charge Although the offer was okay one of the two rooms was so so small There was no closet or armoire nowhere to place the suitcase and only one available electrical outlet Although the staff subsequently offered a replacement room upon request the tiny room should not have been offered in the first place , Location is excellent 
230448,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Stuffy rabbits warren hellish to get to my room with luggage My room was the smallest I have had in London and stuffy Dark wallpaper made the place sombre My towel rack was designed so that all my towels would fall and slip into the toilet below it It took 3 calls and 2 hours to get more towels Would not stay here again , The staff were very friendly and very courteous 
230449,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room needs redecorating Lifts awful slow and small and we were on the 4th floor Loo did not flush properly The pressure in the shower was a joke, Breakfast excellent Public spaces are lovely and very comfortable
230450,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room was cramped and the property is served by only 2 small lifts which meant lots of time wasted waiting on them being free as these were for use by customers and service staff , Location great bed really comfortable and bathroom fine 
230451,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Breakfast no one greeted me had to seat myself then someone came over and asked me to move without greeting Bit of a scrum to get some food with basic breakfast foods like eggs and bacon all taken and only slowly replenished Too many people and not enough staff it seems like to serve the guests For the price that is quote poor and I expected better Small room too , Good location
230452,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room service each day very poor as had to complain daily that room not cleaned up to 4 00 despite leaving clean me sign on outside of door I did complain each time but made little difference , Good room after we were upgraded from that which we were originally given as too small and fridge did not work
230453,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The lift and the need to use a card to get to the floors even though you had already come through a serurity system , Breakfast excellent and freshly cooked all the cerals were attractively displayed 
230454,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room good size but very tired look The remote control for the TV was so dirty that I needed a tissue to pick it up , Lovely and very helpful staff Excellent location Good and varied breakfast buffet
230455,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Check in was a little slow , Comfortable place to stay and decent breakfast handy for underground and pleasant stroll to Olympia if you like to walk that is and it s not raining Room was quiet and well equipped with decent curtains that cut out the light 
230456,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, We had an evening meal in the restaurant After placing our order it took 55 minutes for the food to arrive It was very early evening and the restaurant wasn t busy when we arrived at 5pm The food when it did arrive was over cooked and disappointing , Breakfast was good ample selection
230457,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, All good but single rooms could be a little bigger Made up with a larger single bed Facilities great otherwise , Central location close to tube and Kensington high street and museums
230458,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Wish we could stay longer, Staff were really helpful friendly and polite Even when we turned up at 2am after a late delayed flight The bed was SUPER COMFORTABLE 
230459,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, My twin room was comfortable but looked just like any standard room I have stayed in Very over priced , Good breakfast Great location for museums and close to tube station 
230460,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, small room even the upgraded one Small bed, Excellent location in South Kensington next to the station of District line that has direct connection to LHR
230461,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, There was lack of communication between shifts We ask for transportation to the airport and valets to pick up our luggage fom the afternoon staff and the morning staff knew nothing about these arrangements The transportation arrived 15 or more minutes late don t know because we left with a hailled taxi on our own For the amount that Radisson charges for a room service should be spot on and it wasn t It was friendly and accommodating but then the requests weren t carried out The rooms are small One more minor complaint was that my tv kept going off line I was watching a good movie that I never got to watch to the end The front desk did send someone up to rebout it but 10 minutes later it went off again I then just went to bed , Location
230462,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, One of the concierge was very unhelpful He was no knowledgeable at all and not very friendly Another concierge was extremely helpful So there was no consistency of service there , The location was exceptional It was half a block away from the tube restaurants coffee shops grocery stores It is on the Piccadilly line which takes you directly to Heathrow in 45 min for a few pounds The room was well appointed and clean They changed our towels every day which was a bonus because with 4 in our room there s no place to hang up all the towel to get dried 
230463,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Nothing to say bad had a very good experience, A really nice hotel in a great location in Kensington Right next to the tube Breakfast buffet was excellent
230464,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, They could charge for the room correctly We were charged twice The breakfast is terrible cindered bacon and everything else was cold There was a noisy duct outside our room that went boom every now and then The beds were uncomfortable Booked a double and got twin The check in was chaos The staff are arrogant when we told them about the error on charging the credit card we were told that was good , They serve nice beer
230465,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, This property is located perfectly for a London vacation The tube stops groceries and restaurants are within a pleasant 5 minutes walk The neighborhood is upscale clean and safe I would be happy to return 
230466,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, My room was perfect in every way but just a little too small but this did not bother me too much as everything else was so nice , The location is near to many of my favorite museums the Vicoria Albert Museum There are many special shops like Egg which are not far from the Hotel Staff is very friendly qnd helpful 
230467,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room was incredibly noisy It seemed like there was some kind of plant room right next door so the wall against which the bed was placed was literally humming all night long It was like sleeping in an engine room When we told the reception staff about this upon check out we were basically told that it was our fault for not reporting it and asking to be moved Get real it was after midnight when we got to our room Did they really think that two very tired travellers would be ready to jump out of bed get dressed and race around the hotel to look for another room , Nothing We had such an awful night in a noisy room that I honestly could not find anything to like about this hotel 
230468,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The noise from the peoples activities in the corridor which was as if they would have had it right in my room, Location cleanliness facilities decor style very good Nice flavoured water with pieces of fresh watermelon or lemon in the lobby
230469,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The lift No one would believe the time we had to wait for the ONLY lift to our 4th floor room TWO members of staff told us how busy they were err hellooo I am your customer notmyproblem However having waited TWELVE minutes for a lift we did complain at reception were allocated a ground floor windowless room Would NOT ever stay again Would NOT recommend Attitude of some staff very poor , Bar restaurant was nice 
230470,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Loads of corridors and stairs to my room that I had no staff help me carry my bags Single female with 30 kgs of luggage was difficult up front stairs and up 2 stair cases to my room Not sure why they put me in a room which was up stairs , Nice clean comfy room
230471,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Not having a window with a view, Great location and easy to get to from Paddington via tube which is minutes from hotel Our room was ok very clean tidy and comfortable However as it was on the ground floor we had a frosted glass window with no view which made the room feel a bit claustraphobic in my opinion Breakfast was also good if manic but plenty of choice
230472,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, I was very disappointed as the twin bed room did not look like what was shown on the website and its size and facilities were unacceptable Had to make a major complaint before being moved to what was called a business room and was only marginally better hardly any storage room minuscule bathroom and broken mini fridge Made was what supposed to be a treat into an upsetting experience, Breakfast great range of food including organic juices
230473,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, I was moved twice related to the unavailability of a room with a bath for the duration of my stay Victorian winding narrow carpeted passageways with endless closed doors and in some areas the occasional stair or two were very confusing and tiresome to negotiate with luggage There were staff available to assist with same The final upgraded room was clean despite stained carpeting weak air conditioning and no functioning window during the years warmest heat wave The bed was very firm I asked for a topper that made small difference to the rock hard surface Lastly half the lights in the bathroom winked out during a prolonged stay there The glass half partition on the bath was not firmly attached in position and would swing out from the wall during use in both bath rooms I was given and used , Friendly courteous staff Conveniently located close to a moderately priced selection of restaurants The Tube station and Bus Tours stops on the corner 
230474,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room was poor standard considering it was an executive arrived at 16 20 to find room still not ready despite booking at least 3 months in advance Prices for room service and drinks were astronomical Food in Scoff and Banter apart from starter was of poor quality especially the burger that stated it came with Lancashire Bomb cheese when in fact it was a square of processed cheese we come from the North of England where Lancashire Bomb is a delicacy The booking stated 15 towards drinks food etc as we booked an Executive room that is 45 that was never offered Having stayed in at least 6 Radisson Blu hotels and have always been very satisfied this one was by far the worst and a great disappointment it was no better than a budget hotel at a ridiculous price The one good comment was the concierge who was on duty when we arrived and Thursday and Friday daytimes as well he was helpful pleasant and a credit to the hotel , Not a lot
230475,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Sharing room 336 with a friend we found it very small and the bathroom was tiny To access the room we had to open eight doors mostly fire doors We found this unacceptable Together with the small room bathroom I would not book this hotel again nor would I recommend it , The decor etc was pleasant 
230476,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The smallest hotel room that we have ever been provided in 40 years of travel Measured of room including a bath room closet and entryway was 10 6 by 11 Would never stay there again because of cramped space , Excellent location very nice attentive staff 
230477,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The cleaners started very early and were quite noisy outside my room , Comfortable room hotel was very close to the underground staff were very accommodating 
230478,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room 442 avoid like the proverbial plague Right opposite the noisy lift and couldn t sleep from 7 30 am onwards due to very loud Americans going down to breakfast and discussing their trips so far If you stay don t stay in this room dreadful And please tell housekeeping that 8 50 is a little too early to be banging on the door to find out if anyone was still in there , Great location and even though on the busy Cromwell Road the rooms were well sound proofed Excellent helpful and welcoming staff Would stay again but 
230479,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Booked a single and got upgraded to double beautiful room The breakfast was included and is excellent with many choices including smoked salmon Nice wifi great location staff They have a concierge that seemed really helpful to others though I didn t ask for specific help 
230480,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Only double bed in room although this was as advertised Very few front of house staff on duty at breakfast time for the number of guests leading to delays in table clearing provision of hot drinks etc Our part of the hotel was served by one very slow lift and this caused delays particularly at check out We stayed on floor 4 top floor and as well as slow lift not all levels of the stairs had a handrail, Very friendly professional staff Outside view on side street and not over busy main Cromwell road was appreciated Clean rooms
230481,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, As is common with buffet breakfast it wasn t always very hot We also couldn t get any bar snacks after 10 30 when we were a little peckish having had an early dinner before going to a show, Croissants were served in a little wooden box with an apricot conserve which was delicious
230482,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Very long wait at reception to check in technical problem meant room key couldn t be issued so had to collect later Member of staff on reception when key collected needs to develop his social skills very poor representative of hotel ,No Positive
230483,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, If you have a stroller you need a hand because the entrance has stairs There is no hand shower in the baths so it is a bit difficult to bath your kids , The hotel is very close to the Glocester Road Tube station and 5 minutes walking distance to South Kensington Tube station You can easily walk to National Museum and Science Museum There are plenty of good restaurants near the hotel and hotels own restaurant is also good It has a nice bar for the evenings The rooms are big enough for families The staff is very helpful and friendly There is a free candy bar and lemon strawberry water stand near the entrance 
230484,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The tiny bathroom especially for a couple and its shower facility was the only thing that was uncomfortable It was cramped and the shower stream was problematic to adjust , The bed was extremely comfy Breakfast menu was especially tasty with a wide variety of choices The staff was very helpful with maximum efforts to be helpful and efficient We were pleasantly surprised and appreciative of the wine in the ice cold bucket and the complementary rose petal decor and towel swanlike sculpture on the bed along with the lovely welcoming card celebrating our wedding anniversary stay at the hotel As well the complementary box of sweets was a lovely delightful additional touch 
230485,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, a bit of inside noise as my room was situated beside a set fire doors that inevitably banged whenever someone went through , I chose this hotel for the location near metro station Hyde Park museums etc Despite being situated on a very busy road the room was quiet thanks to double glazing I had a single room that was small but comfortable I chose the option without breakfast as there are so many nearby eating places so cannot comment on breakfast or coffee The conceriage really assisted me with urgent photocopying and sending message that was greatly appreciated 
230486,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, It was not value for money at all The room was very small The bathroom was extremely small the door could not be left open while you re in the bathroom The toilet seat was broken and the shower leaked The breakfast for 20 pounds was a rip off the worst cup of tea in London , The bed and pillows were very comfortable 
230487,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Selection on offer at breakfast really good however most of the hot buffet food was cold which was quite disappointing I wouldn t trust a lukewarm sausage My husband asked for a couple of fried eggs unfortunately they arrived 10 minutes later when he d finished his tepid meal This spoilt our stay , bed was pristine staff helpful service good
230488,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room was very small and the bathroom tiny No Bedside tables or drawers etc Not value of 230 per night Room very dusty and in need of a full clean , Bed was very comfy
230489,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, No complaints, My room in the rear was nice quiet Big bath Nice sized wardrobe Friendly staff Good breakfast included in price of room Tea making facilities really appreciated 
230490,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The Dining room for breakfast was a mad house Long lines lousy service not enough staff or space way overcrowded and impossible to get a breakfast Very disappointing, friendly staff other than dining room
230491,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Toilet too small Room little small Too many d ors to open to walk to the room with luggage, Best ever Breakfast Best ever blankets and bed also hotel British style
230492,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, I can honestly say I have nothing to say as the hotel was really great , My family and myself liked everything about this hotel Great location very clean great food 
230493,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The bathroom towels are dirty with paint the stuff doesn t really respond when I complained about this Air con from other room are noisy and the noise is on and off the whole time which is even more annoying , Good location Some staff are friendly but some just couldn t care your problem as the room fee is paid on the first day 
230494,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room is SUPER TINY as compared to all neighborhood hotels whereby even offer cheaper price The breakfast has the SAME menu every single day throughout our 7 days stay The Housekeeper s cleaniliness quality is poor The Bathroom is so small yet the chair is freaking heavy to move around that tiny area There is no bottle opener for guest to enjoy our own purchased wine nor beer guest has to bring the bottle down to open worse facility than 1 star hotel , Free wifi location is great
230495,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Bathrooms are small and awkward soap dispenser didn t work tv was not great and only worked some of the time , Fabulous staff complimentary water and coffee great location close to public transportation 
230496,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Very small single room comparatively spacious wardrobe but no place at all to put small things like t shirts socks etc Please add just a tiny set of shelves in the wardrobe , Very helpful and kind staff all over Lovely breakfast Good location and surroundings very close to the tube 
230497,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room wasn t ready at check in despite arriving at after 7pm which we had flagged at reservation stage Check in also took nearly 30mins which is really too long I was also asked to pay for the rooms separately instead of on one charge to my card even though these were booked together Check out also took too long given I d already paid my bill in full and just required a receipt , Superior single room was very spacious for London as was the bathroom Location was excellent as was the breakfast and the restaurant staff 
230498,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, I wasnt fond of the lifts in the hotel quite small can only fit a maximum of 2 people in there along with their bags at a push 3 I also didnt like the shower it was quite disappointing i was expecting a modern shower it also had 2 showerheads in the shower cubicle Room i stayed in was 117 , Little touches they did to the room to make it more personalised a little card on the dressing table with my name in and a little welcoming message along with a pack of complimentary gummy bears which was really tasty 
230499,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room and bathroom were very tired and in need of some updating , The location near a tube station and close to the Albert hall The reception staff were helpful and welcoming 
230500,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, One of the best hotels I have ever visited The room was tiny but neat and a great bathroom with a tub my first in Europe I booked a tiny room as it was all I could afford but the staff treated me very first class They were incredibly accommodating the restaurant is excellent and inexpensive the breakfast over the top 
230501,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, We were kept waiting 70 minutes after advertised check in time because the room wasn t ready We were not even offered a cup of tea whilst we waited Room was clean but very small and bathroom was tiny Wouldn t stay again, Location
230502,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Small bathroom very small lifts lengthy check in due to computer problems, Very comfy bed lovely white fluffy towels very good breakfast selection friendly helpful staff only 3 min walk from tube station
230503,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Coffee never arrived at breakfast and I was in a rush so just left without coffee, Eggs cooked to perfection Gina guest services was extremely helpful and polite and a great ambassador for the hotel 
230504,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Nothing really I had a problem of reaching up to get the hand and bath towels in the bathroom as I am short and they are located above the toilet But apart from that all was great , The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful 
230505,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room was too small i asked the the guy at the reception and he said the rooms in the forth floor are the biggest when i visited my friends in other rooms there rooms were big and comfy ,No Positive
230506,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The service in the bar was a little strange The staff didn t seem to understand what a splash meant in the whisky so my husband didn t get any water added to his whisky and we had to remind them that we needed to pay The service at breakfast was very poor I asked for tea but whilst I was away from the table selecting my breakfast the tea was delivered to the table When I returned I found that there was no milk I went in search but found nothing My husband asked a member of staff and they said they would bring it I had almost finished my breakfast when I fetched some orange juice as I was now desperate for a drink My husband asked for a SECOND time and eventually milk was delivered to the table This was such a shame as the food and everything else about the hotel was very good but this spoilt the overall experience as it was the last impression we had of the hotel as we left , The staff were generally very friendly and helpful The room was comfortable and clean The food for breakfast was very good with a good selection Good location for the Royal Albert Hall only a 10 minute walk away 
230507,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The only down side was that the bed was very hard , The staff are very friendly and efficient at this hotel The included breakfast is pretty extensive The location was ideal for me near the underground and a short walk to the Royal Albert Hall
230508,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, As I did not take any cooked breakfast the remainder of the breakfast choice was good , Room was very satisfactory Cooked breakfast did not look very appertising Staff very helpful 
230509,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Our Room 105 was adjacent to the hotel s main electric generator whose noise kept us awake all night We asked for a change which we got and adequate compensation for the noise The room we were moved to was quiet but very small ,No Positive
230510,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, It s a big hotel with so many rooms and my room happened to be in an area you need to go up and down the stairs for about 10minutes from the reception area I think you just have to enjoy this little adventure , Their system lets you choose the room you like very limited choice though one room per floor a couple of days in advance so you can check in before you actually arrive My selected room was ready and the notification came before 6AM so when I arrived at the hotel around 10 30AM I could pick up the key and enter the room right away which was great Check out is also done online so no waiting in the queue I think this works well for a hotel with so many rooms 
230511,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room was quite small I would have liked more room for the money we spent staying there , Staff were extremely helpful lots of little extras for the children such as a teddy on arrival and sweeties in the foyer Close proximity to the family museums and the Albert hall 
230512,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Not winning the lottery whilst I was there , I had a single room small by U S standards but nicely appointed and clean My bath was luxurious with a deep tub and rain shower My view was the mews in the rear which was fine for me as I requested a quiet room No traffic back there But thinking even a front room would be fine as street is pretty and not heavily traveled in the evening The concierge helped me plan an overnight trip to Devon for a genealogy excursion that was spot on Had never traveled by train and this was the way to go All stuff is extremely helpful and pleasant My last morning there a car had been arranged to Heathrow Also a nice breakfast bag was made for me to have at the airport Must say that location and safety was a huge factor n booking with this hotel as I am a single senior woman 
230513,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The only real downside was that the front door was on Cromwell Road so no tranquility on the doorstep you had to walk to find space , The hotel was friendly and easy to live in 
230514,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Original room given smelled very strongly of smoke incredible given the no smoking policy of the hotel which you are made to sign on arrival The room re allocated had a shower SO SMALL it was very uncomfortable and difficult to shower in As we had booked a De Luxe room we expected a much better standard of room The Hot food on the breakfast buffet was COLD on the two mornings we had breakfast ridiculous given the price of the room no fried eggs at breakfast Also had to keep waiting for the food to be replenished as there was insufficient out to cater for the guests Only one choice of draught beer on offer Peroni no choice is very poor for a hotel of this standard The service charge that applies to every purchase at the bar regardless needs to be clearly explained at check in and not just appear on your bar statement Overall a very disappointing stay at a central London hotel, The Location and not much else 
230515,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, All towels changed daily despite being left on the hot rail which was supposed to signify that they would not need changing Same for the cup changed daily Not environmentally friendly in my opinion The shower was also overheating There was no possibility of regulating the water temperature , Location customer service breakfast online check out virtual assistance comfortable bed 
230516,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, The hotel was clean and comfortable with plenty of paid extra services available to the guests The free wi fi signal was strong and accessible from all parts of the hotel The location was fabulous just 2 minutes walk for the Natural History museum The staff were welcoming and friendly and the check in out process was efficient and painless 
230517,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, There was no remote control for the TV which made it a bit fiddly , Warm welcome modern bathroom fantastic breakfast with the best marmalade I have ever tasted
230518,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Corridors are very narrow and you have to go through a number of doors to get to your room I wouldn t recommend this hotel if you have special accessibility needs, Very close to the tube station in a good part of London for sightseeing 
230519,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, better lift access to top floor bathrooms a little squeezy, Great location on the Piccadilly Line so easy access to central London and LHR all the staff were very friendly great light food available after a long day exploring comfy room
230520,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, There was a huge mass of hair in the bath plughole gross only found because the plughole was blocked I did mention this to the concierge upon our checkout but the gentleman merely shrugged and said sorry but offered nothing by way of compensation The distance to the room was extremely long and we shown a further access route with suitcases wasn t greatly appreciated , The bed was amazing and the room was lovely didn t bother keeping the dressing gowns at 90 each a little bit extortionate Loved the breakfast gorgeous 
230521,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room was uncomfortably tiny and did not even have a bedside table and lamp The water flow of the shower was also rather pathetic , The staff were lovely and the choice for breakfast was impressive 
230522,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Nothing to mention , Very nice hotel excellent location very nice building and interior decorated with good taste Nice breakfast Very helpful personnel I would be more than glad to stay there again 
230523,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Bed very hard children s sofa beds very squeaky which disturbed everyone in the night Decor of the hotel very dark which makes it feel oppressive as the corridors are so narrow Bedroom decor very dated for the price of room I expect a higher standard , good selection at breakfast 
230524,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Only one small gripe as the bar didn t have either sherry or port, Excellent location for Royal Albert Hall Could have easily walked but taxis are plentiful and can be picked up right outside the hotel Cost for a taxi to and from Waterloo was 17 each way Bed was extremely comfortable Staff were very helpful and welcoming Prices for dinner were reasonable Breakfast was particularly good great selection and all very fresh Would definitely return and would recommend to friends 
230525,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, I was unable to take a shower at 6 30am as the water was cold By 7 am it was fine The single room was really too small It was difficult to move freely , The shepherd s pie with red wine sauce was very good The staff were co operative and pleasant Breakfast was excellent

230530,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, The room was really comfortable especially bet mat I slept really well It is also equipped with a fridge and an electric kettle The staff was kind 
230531,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The noise of the airco in the rooms which could not be switched off Although the staff reacted accurately to the complaint the problem could not be solved which resulted in two sleepless nights , Location breakfast and style of the hotel are excellent
230532,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Decor on entry beautiful staff very helpful food excellent Room was lovely front view so that was lovely Location excellent Great hotel great experience 
230533,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Our shower went from boiling hot to freezing cold constantly Was not what we expected for the standard of the hotel and i didnt find the staff very bothered when we told them And there was also a shaving blade left in there by the previous visitor so cleaning hadnt been done very well either, The restaurant was outstanding We had dinner and breakfast and were very impressed
230534,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, We were disappointed with the cleanliness of the room The room was also quite tired and a little small , Location was great as we were seeing a concert at the Royal Albert Hall which was within easy walking distance and close to the tube as well 
230535,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Couldn t sleep in the bed which was two singles pushed together to make a double resulting in a dip in the middle Made for an uncomfortable night s sleep , Location friendly staff 
230536,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The breakfast was too expensive so had to eat out However plenty of local shops to get from WiFi was very poor , Comfortable big family deluxe room Nice surprise of getting a 15 daily credit at the bar and welcome chocolate strawberries in our room 
230537,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Can t fault anything on our visit from our point of view , Excellent room quiet friendly staff wonderful breakfast that was fresh appetising with non greasy bacon Perfect location at a fair price 
230538,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, We were in late for breakfast no bacon available Croissants were dry so ordered Eggs Benedict and poached eggs were hard So everything else about hotel was good except breakfast Should be same whether you go in at 7 30 or 9 30 , location room helpful staff Overall a good value hotel in a great location I would consider coming again
230539,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The bathrooms are dated and smaller than what I would have expected compared to the size of the room , Great location as we went to see a show at the Royal Albert Hall which was only a 10 15 minute walk Staff were pleasant and polite and the business class room was an excellent size We were on the ground floor but very little noise from the road We ve previously stayed in the deluxe king room which is quite small for deluxe but all amenities are there 
230540,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Small lift meant a wait at busy times Bathroom was small and room was not as clean as I would have expected carpet needed replacing or a deep clean , Bed and pillows were very comfortable Staff were helpful Good location for museums and Royal Albert Hall 
230541,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Personnel wasn t aware of the price of hotel taxi , Breakfast was versatile and good Personnel was kind and helpful Rooms were spacious and it was kind gesture from personnel to offer complimentary mineral water bottles for each day The situation of the hotel was near to underground and Natural History Museum as well as some quality restaurants 
230542,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Replenishment of complimentary tea coffee could have been better Small bedroom and bathroom , Very friendly and helpful staff Nice quality breakfast 
230543,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Unfortunately our experience was ruined by the fact that I left my make up bag full of rather expensive make up and my watch on the bathroom shelf and by the time I realised this when I got home that evening they were mysteriously nowhere to be found Very bad taste as I know that I left them there and they were not handed into lost property by the cleaning staff , This hotel is in a great location and although rooms were rather small it s what you d expect from an average hotel in London so was pretty good value for the price we paid 
230544,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, First room was by some noisy air con units staff very helpful and changed the room Unfortunately the second room also had similar units outside but not quite as noisy Have stayed there several times may look elsewhere in the future , Excellent breakfast selection 
230545,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Nothing, The location is great 2 min walk to the tube station Very easy to take tube a few stops to sites Staff very welcoming and helpful with dinner recommendations and tips for shopping Very clean and I felt super safe traveling alone there Would stay again 
230546,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Very long corridors I need to open 9 doors to reach my room If you have kids you can ask for a room closer to lifts , Location was great It is very close to the Gloucester Road station It is also very convenient and cheap to reach the hotel from Heathrow airport via Piccadilly line I also recommend to include breakfast It was great 
230547,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room was fine for 1 night bathroom was clean but tired and shabby in places Lighting in room was very bright no lamps, Location was great Good choice at breakfast Easy to check in and out on line Good toiletries
230548,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Single room felt small and ventilation fan was relatively intrusive , Comfortable bed and quality bed linen Great breakfast choices Bathroom great compared to those in single rooms of other hotels 
230549,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The Shower needed updating but adequate enough, Everything The hotel was amazing The staff so helpful and friendly the location for the underground fantastic The breakfast loads to choose from and eat as much as you like We asked for something for the room and it was replaced within five minutes They even left a bottle of wine in our room when I told them it was my birthday Great place to stay We asked for and got a quiet room Loved it Good location for shops and restaurents
230550,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room had a poor layout the shower did not maintain constant temperatures and there were no biscuits with the tea coffee facilities which I would expect at the bare minimum for this quality and price, Breakfast was good quality of the linen was very good and staff were very friendly and helpful
230551,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Coffee cups at breakfast were stuck to the saucers need drying up properly , Lovely staff I was attending the BAFTAs and forgot my cuff links When I enquired if I could buy some the member of staff Julia took off her own and lent them to me What extraordinary service

230554,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, We were greeted by the head concierge Jubril who was wonderful he was so welcoming full of information and very helpful couldn t have asked for better The hotel is located just 5min walk from The Natural History Museum Harrods was within walking distance too lovely place to stay Thank you 
230555,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, There is no shuttle service from or to the airport I had to pay around 45 for one way Taxi service I requested for a wake up call on the day I was traveling back which I never received The hotel prearranged Taxi service did not show up on time on the day i was traveling back , The hotel staff was very nice and helpful Breakfast was good and breakfast service staff was so helpful and jolly The hotel is very near from Hop On Hop Off bus stop and from the Underground station Many restaurants are near the hotel A museum is within the walking distance 
230556,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, service charge at the bar was steep and the breakfast was a free for all the food was great but the service needs looking at 20 minutes for coffee untidy tables , the hotel location is brilliant checking in and out staff were helpful and cheery room was good but the bathroom was a little snug 
230557,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Hotel had amazingly little to offer in the room no water boiler coffee tea no night lamp beside the bedside and the sewage was not functioning well and the room was cold I was not impressed and the hotel really wasn t up to the standards of 4 stars , Good location near to the underground Friendly staff 
230558,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, We had a much bigger room last visit after complaining about the tiny split level room we had during first stay we have paid the same amount each time for three completely different rooms , Location
230559,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Part of the charm of the hotel is its age but having to travel up and down several flights of stairs and corridors to get to our room was a bit of a pain, Staff were very helpful cheerful and friendly and the location was perfect
230560,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Pull out sofa bed was uncomfortable for my teenagers squeeky Only bad thing as everything else was fantastic, Decor of hotel room 15 off after checking in Cosy feel lighting seating areas bar area Food was outstanding plenty to choose from Staff were helpful welcoming Great location Considering it was on a busy road as are most hotels it was very quiet inside allowing for a peaceful nights sleep Also a nice touch was having complimentary toiletries towels robes slippers even an umbrella to borrow 
230561,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, 1 Mini bar in room not clean really dirty on arrival and not working We had to ask 4 times to have it fixed after 2 days 2 House keeping coming to our room during breakfast and throwing our medication from the night table but not cleaning anything I was thinking I got crazy before the cleaning lady gave me back my medication pills She took it back for the hotel general garbage Waouhhh 3 Mattress too soft for us 4 Toilet inside not really clean Please use chlorine , 1 Good breakfast 2 Nice staff 3 Good location
230562,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room wasn t clean upon checking in the room size and layout wasn t as described on the site with the room layout being smaller The facilities shower leaked onto the floor as the shower guard wasn t sealed or placed properly , Location and breakfast
230563,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The rooms were shabby and need of a refurb the reception and restaurant were nicely decorated but as soon as you used the lift to the rooms the standard dropped very disappointing, The breakfast was excellent and friendly serving staff
230564,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, That annoying low handle on the door to the right after the main second entrance I m short so imagine the tall people , Stayed for a night for my interview the next day Single bed comfortable more than enough pillows Small table with one chair a single cupboard TV had enough channels Other facilities include hairdyer iron ironing board Toilet new and clean With more than enough toiletries Wifi great Ready and printed on welcome card Breakfast full English breakfast with choices of pastries fruits and salads Location 2 3minutes away from Gloucester Road Staff service excellent even though they seemed perpetually busy 
230565,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room bed size was very small and room tired Much better options in the area if you book in advance I also had rung earlier in the day to request an earlier check in and they confirmed it would we were running late and room wasn t even ready at 3pm the actual check in time , Location is good
230566,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The restaurant was a disappointment My husband was served a very burnt pie and the waiter said just ignore that it would take too long to make you another one We aren t fussy about food and he was happy to eat the pie it would ve been nice if it had come with an apology or a little off the bill Our cutlery wasn t changed in between courses but other tables were our drinks order was incorrect and we waited over an hour for dinner About 9pm on Saturday night a cleaner knocked on our door for no particular reason They ended up getting us some more milk which was wonderful but we were allready in bed at that stage and it seemed a little strange and intrusive Around 11pm we were woken up by what I think was a fire alarm going off in the building We were given numerous passes to our room 5 in total but only 1 worked the whole time Having said that the hotel staff were always willing and happy to help , The room was lovely and the staff were very helpful it was great have a later checkout We really appreciated that
230567,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The hotel isn t child friendly Only 1 small lift and plenty of doors to go through to get to our room Our double bed was 2 beds pushed together so there was a clear dip in the middle Our friendly staff gave us the wrong directions to an alternative local tube station , Quite conveniently located near to tube station and a variety of shops and restaurants The staff were friendly 
230568,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, this hotel is NOT suitable for wheelchair users the contraption for access is juddery and unsteady I ended up shuffling up the steps myself The stay was a gift and had been booked by my parents on their credit card but it was collected against mine despite instructions not to do this , the bed was comfortable and the breakfast good 
230569,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, We were upgraded to a deluxe twin room on check in which was really nice but I was surprised that this room was very cramped with a tiny bathroom which required updating , All the staff we met right from front desk and everywhere else in the hotel were just lovely The free wifi was excellent Breakfast was very good and the dining room was light and airy which made for a very nice start to the day Cleanliness was very good Our hotel room was very quiet and the hotel location is perfect for South Kensington and all surrounding amenities and very convenient to get to from Heathrow 
230570,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room was extremely cold when we arrived and it took ages to heat up The bathroom was a huge disappointment as we were told it was a upgraded room It was so small you could barely sit on the toilet This room could have certainly done with refurbishment , The historic era of the building had been kept well All the staff were pleasant and helpful Great location for our needs 
230571,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, For some reason I did not find the bed very comfortable but I was the only one complaining in the room , well maintained clean and cosy Great location 
230572,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room was very small and cold Twin beds were put together so they slanted towards middle mattress was too hard bathroom tiny and dated Shower gel dispenser was broken I did not enjoy my stay there at all , Location
230573,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, There were cooked to order options for Breakfast but I did not realise as I was directed to the Buffet breakfast by staff and did not see the menu until after I had started eating Scambled egg was cold , Upgraded to a double room with a MASSIVE bed Requested early check in and got that too Very friendly helpful staff on Reception in the restaurant at Breakfast and the team doing the rooms in the morning Fab location just steps away from Gloucester Road tube 
230574,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Poor room with bathroom down steps Very small bathroom and not particularly clean We were given an upgrade to a family room but could see no benefit in this , Staff were very welcoming 
230575,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, The person who served me Nuno I think was his name was absolutely excellent he even spoke the same language as me definitely helped me and my girlfriend feel settled and welcomed
230576,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The restaurant service for our New Year s Eve dinner was deplorable although a manager partially salvaged the occasion with free cocktails , The lobby was tastefully done 
230577,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, the staff was welcoming their smiles and fast checking in after a long flight was great I asked them to upgrade the roome and within less than 5 min I was in the new one 
230578,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Only my preference a softer pillow , Great location just a few yards from the tube station and then just a few stop from major tourist areas staffs customer service excellent It is a Warren of corridors but the room we found to be fine high ceilings lovely fittings We were able to leave our luggage until we were ready to leave London 
230579,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Great location within easy walking distance of museums and the Royal Albert Hall which we were visiting on this occasion The buffet breakfast was particularly good fresh varied and a welcome inclusion 
230580,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Would have liked a bath Afternoon tea could have been better especially considering the price , Bedroom and hotel was great and you felt very secure Great location staff very accommodating 
230581,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Our evening meal in Scoff and Banter was a little disappointing but breakfast was brilliant , Upon arrival I mentioned it was my husbands birthday we received a free upgrade and then later a bottle of white wine with birthday card from the manager was delivered to our room totally unexpected but a lovely touch and much appreciated 
230582,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Being woken up by housekeeping at 9 15 We were not due to leave til 11 Have never experienced this in other hotels before, Very friendly staff especially Arrab the waiter in the restaurant
230583,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Breakfast was cold The room was far too hot even with air con on Staff didn t seem to care even when we complained 3 times about hot room and cold breakfast Bathroom was dated and dirty, Location was good
230584,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Internal layout slightly awkward you have to walk through a narrow maze to get to your room The room has excellent facilities but it is on the small side for what it contains , Extremely friendly and effective personnel very beautiful building equipped to a high standard 
230585,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, why do they hide away the tea coffee and kettle in draws why not just leave it on the desk can hear the traffic through the windows if at front of hotel, nice room and bed
230586,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Nice staffs taking care of you all the time I m travelling solo but lucky to got upgrade to a twin room to have more space and window view comfortable bedding Yummy inclusive breakfast delicate English Breakfast and more Simply warm and cozy hotel 
230587,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Due to option searches I thought there was an airport shuttle here and there wasn t , Because my room wasn t ready when I arrived and I was absolutely exhausted so they put me as priority and even upgraded my room so I could get in as soon as possible Staff was so nice and accomadating 
230588,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Single room was a little small but enough There was also a fire alarm at 3am which was annoying but nobody s fault really , Amazing breakfasts and lovely lobby Perfect location 
230589,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The first room was a shock compared to the high standard of the public areas and looked nothing like the photos on the website Not what I expected of a 4 star hotel despite getting a good deal Tiny room for the twin bed booking with a floor that creaked and moved at every step and a somewhat poorly cleaned toilet Complained and was moved to another room and given complimentary breakfast Much bigger comfortable room and better however shame about the outdated dark wood furniture horrible d cor and carpet Bathroom was tiny but manageable and ok if you are big you may not fit same with the lift However again the toilet needed industrial cleaner or replacing Disappointed by both rooms as I deliberately booked a 4 star as I normally stay in 2 3 star hotels and hostels which have had nicer rooms , Location of this hotel is excellent as easy walk to Hyde Park Buckingham Palace Harrods and the museums and nice shops Very impressed by the breakfast choice and excellent quality and liked the bar and cocktails Staff provide good service and were accommodating when I complained about the room and changed it and offered us complimentary breakfast which then made the stay value for money taking into account its location Good size room with potential for improvement Liked the toiletries provided in the bathroom and useful room facilities provided although my son complained about no socket for his mobile phone by the bed 
230590,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Hope there will be a kettle in each room then customer can boil hot water by themselves The pillow is not really comfortable too soft for me Some plastic bags in bin might be helpful but this is not a big deal , Breakfast is amazing so great staff are very enthusiastic the size for single room for solo travelers is perfect and the location is good as well
230591,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Being told I needed move to another hotel despite having a valid booking after a word with the manager I was given possilbly the smallest room I have ever paid 180 for , Good breakfast
230592,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Somewhat old fashioned with carpets everywhere but nice and clean , Breakfast was OK Had everything you need including egg bacon sausages etc 
230593,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Amazing customer service I notified the hotel that I was booking this for my father s 80th birthday and they went well above and beyond my expectations room upgrade bottle of champagne and a surprise dessert with their evening meal Thank you very much 
230594,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, staff gave me an upgrade which i appreciated I was travelling alone and that was my second visit to this hotel staff remembered me and was very nice and helpful
230595,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, first meal in restaurant I found the menu limited dull mostly fried food menu overpriced and my partner pulled a 300 mm blonde hair from her mouth while eating her meal so we ate elsewhere from then , staff were very good and efficient
230596,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The bathroom was small for the size of the room but not sure much can be done about that And also the shower head could be bigger Giving the standard of the room the shower head could use an upgrade Also downstairs slamming of doors was a bit annoying and the loud music from the restaurant could be heard in our room These are all small things that were noticed but nothing too major to disrupt the stay , We were in a newly renovated room and it was lovely Decor was lush bed and pillows was super comfy and the room itself was more than accommodating Room service was delicious and the presentation of the food was fantastic This hotel goes above and beyond to accommodate I have stayed at other hotels in the area and payed more and they don t compare to this hotel Special thanks to Alexander for taking care of us The entire staff is superb 
230597,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Everything was great However we order a taxi from the airport through the hotel The taxi driver charge us 65 instead of 60 as said by the hotel Plus we order the same taxi driver for the way back and we agreed on 100 to get to Gatwick The taxi driver agreed and when he dropped us off he asked how many are you going to give me so I replied 100 as we said and he replied I would be very happy if you could give me 110 I reply that we agreed on 100 and that we just had that much money in cash He said that we could give him 100 10 I said no as we agreed on the amount before and the driver left us quite angry I thought he was not very honest and left us on a bad impression before taking our plane , The staff was very nice Plus the fact that they were flexible and allowed us to have a late check out without any additional fees We also had a problem with the electricity I signaled it to the staff that immediately sent a technician It was very appreciated Also on December 24th we asked to have dinner at the hotel however it was completely full We were very surprised as nobody told us upon reservation and neither on check in that it was recommended to book the restaurant Finally as I said that we had planned to have dinner there and we were staying at the hotel the restaurant found availability and we could have a great dinner at the hotel Thank you 
230598,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room was too small I could barely fit my suit case in Only have one elevator and too small No one did help with the luggage It s my worst experience in hotels world wild, Staff were quit good the location is good
230599,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, There is not much luxe in a Deluxe room the room is quite small Bathroom is extremely small Chairs are completely worn out you have to use one of the pillows of the bed on the chair to sit decently Lifts are very small and very slow , Location close to tube station Wifi is free and works fast Airco heating works properly 
230600,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The wifi reception was absolutely comprehensively atrocious Supposedly it was free of charge In actuality it was simply nonexistent , The appearance of the Hotel That was about it It was NOT a good value for the money I expended 
230601,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, We had a blocked sink in our room which was the only negative aspect of an otherwise lovely overnight stay , Staff were excellent throughout from greeting on arrival to departure Room was a good size and very comfortable 
230602,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, elevator was on the small size so difficult to manage with a baby buggy stairs to each floor also just not very spacious corridors , very friendly staff at breakfast lovely clean room staff at reception I found to be very helpful Location very good to get to bus and tube station across the road v nice restaurants around the area I would stay here again 
230603,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Asked for an early check in but didn t call us , Everything Beds and pillows amazing X staff fab and nothing too much trouble Breakfast was so nicely presented and so fresh 
230604,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Beds weren t very comfortable No bath in family room Not much room to walk between bed sofa bed when sofa bed was down No plug near mirror for use of hair straighters Very narrow gap between sink wall as step out of shower , Staff were very helpful Nice welcome on arrival option for late checkout Lovely breakfast good choice Bottles of water in room Very clean hotel 
230605,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, the bedroom was very noisy with a metallic grating sound from a large extractor fan outside the bedroom window room 11 , the reception staff were very friendly and helpful 
230606,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, I had specifically asked during booking that a lactose free breakfast would be available Other than a jug of soya milk there was nothing I was given gluten free bread and all cereal etc contained milk Also no bedside table or lamp Very tired furnishings Would not recommend to anyone , Staff were very friendly
230607,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, not changing the hotel 9 mths after we had paid for it it is quite obvious that you sold our reservation to the highest bidder sorry I am very displeased the way you behaved, the fact that you changed our hotel to mercer st one day before we were scheduled to arrive despite the fact that we had already paid for the room 9 month s earlier and this cost us 18 for a taxi to the royal Albert Hall whereas with previously booked radisson we would have been able to walk so not very pleased with the radisson blu company at all and will not be using you again Brgds MR Richard Rawlinson
230608,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Breakfast was a bit of nightmare I was not greeted or given a table there was no instructions on how to use the facilities ie please queue for a table I didn t like the baked beans they were bigger than I m used to and spicy not really baked beans at all no choice of eggs not keen on scrambled it wasn t hot either , Gorgeous Room comfy bed and glorious bathroom with fridge and other facilities if the price was right I d definitely stay again
230609,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Uncomfortable dining chairs and very small shower room for single use Had to go into bedroom to finish off drying , Location for where I wanted to be and close to underground station
230610,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, I found that after asking for a quiet room we were situated at the back and there were either air conditioning or heating facilities under our window which disturbed my sleep quite badly and I didn t feel this was a good choice especially after requesting a quiet location Sadly I did not discover the cause of the noise until the next morning when we were checking out , The breakfast was excellent in choice and the staff despite being so busy were very helpful 
230611,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room was cramped and poorly appointed Some of the lights were not working There was no bedside light or table Poor water flow from the shower head Very poor value for money ,No Positive
230612,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, i felt it was very very average for a Radisson Blu that happens to be in such a great location photos not indicative at all of a double room and the facilities listed were not available very disappointed as it was supposed to be a romantic night in town and the double room did not feel as luxurious as the information photos indicated there were no bathrobes no mini bar no iPod dock and the room felt very below average for the price paid, Concierge Staff were exceptional having stayed at a Radisson Blu before i love the way they greet their guests offer you a glass of water and show you to your room the room was at the back of the hotel so it was lovely and quiet having a bath in the bathroom was very nice 
230613,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room was very small with a bathroom door which only opened a third as the washbowl stopped it There was no bedside table on one side of of the bed as there was no room and where does one put a drink book and glasses We asked for a change after one night and although the room was still small it was a little better The single beds were uncomfortable and sloped so it was difficult to lie in a comfortable position and at aged 80 and 78 this was difficult We felt the hotel was tired and needed up grading We would not stay there again although the staff were very pleasant ,No Positive
230614,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Nothing to complain about , Staff were so accommodating on arrival our room wasn t quite ready but we only waited 5 10 minutes until one was available A bottle of wine in an ice bucket was delivered complimentary to our room as we were celebrating our anniversary We also asked for a late check out expecting a charge we were informed it was free 
230615,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Bathroom dirty and poorly designed Towels hung over toilet nowhere to hang hand towel for sink Bath had hairs in on arrival waste pipe behind which could be clearly seen when showering very thick with dust Shower too close to wall and head not removable Like something out of the 80 s , Food in restaurant very good also good breakfast Location of hotel Room size 
230616,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, D cor seemed somewhat tired Pillows too high two were too much but one not enough , Loved the breakfast choice Nothing was too much trouble for the staff Comfy bed 
230617,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The hotel has spent money on all the public areas but the bedroom we stayed in was looking very tired decor wise but the bathroom really needs upgrading the bath had been repaired at some point and the plastic coating was pealing off the grouting on the marble was very stained and the all the bathroom sealant on the taps soap holders etc was very messy and therefore makes the bathrooms harder to keep clean The toilet flush was not working properly The phone next to the bed was broken which was reported to reception So when I ordered room service at the bar the waiting staff were not familiar with the room menus As we were only staying for the night and leaving very early the next day these things were just annoyances but if I was staying for any length of time I would have asked for another room , The position on the hotel was excellent as we were visiting the Royal Albert Hall for a concert so it was easy to walk to The beds and pillows in the hotel room were excellent The person who delivered the room service was very pleasant 
230618,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room in front of the elevator quite noisy And as I had a single room it was quite tiny , Nice staff always ready to help and with genuine smile Great location Excellent breakfast
230619,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Too many doors to go through in order to get my room which was located at the farthest corner of the hotel especially when you re lugging heavy suitcases However I understand that this is a old building so it s not a big issue for me , Location just 5 minutes walk to the tube which is great Breakfast spread is moderate but for me is more than enough to fill me up However on a particular Saturday service staff were too slow in replenishing the empty trays leaving my guests standing by the buffet table waiting 
230620,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Size of the room and brightness There was no view as it was at the back of the building and no natural light could get into the room , Excellent location and staff were fantastic 
230621,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, All in all it felt outdated especially the bathroom But it certainly has the English Charme I am more a scandivanian design person , Perfect Breakfast and conference Lunch Good location for Albert Hall and Kensington Gardens Close to Pubs and restaurants
230622,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, arrived to check in told I think you at wrong hotel X but soon rectified but not in family room we booked and had to be separated on different floors, Bed comfy Breakfast que to long a wait
230623,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Arrived having prebooked Rooms 16 and 17 to be told that of those two only Room 17 would be available We were told that the hotel was overbooked Our friends therefore went into Room 29 There was also confusion about whether the rooms had both been charged to my card apparently one Room had been and the other had not been so one was charged again I will be checking my bank account this week to make sure that I haven t paid for more than two rooms Both rooms were cold problems with air conditioning units , Good location especially for the museums and the Royal Albert Hall Good evening meal and good breakfast Staff worked very hard and the service was good Beds very comfortable 
230624,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room was nothing like the image v small and cramped family accommodation Bed settee for the children was so uncomfortable they both slept on the floor When we went down for breakfast nobody to greet so wondered through the breakfast area and got shouted at by a member of staff to come out as not any room Lack of food prepared and had to wait for a considerable amount of time for food to be brought out the toaster was a domestic one which had seen better days and basically took an eternity to toast the bread so just gave up Poor quality and very over priced , Only good thing was the pleasant receptionist when we arrived
230625,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, No fridge in my single room and no mirror near where I could plug in the hair dryer so made styling hair difficult Asked for room near my son and daughter in laws room but this didn t happen , This was a return visit this time with family Staff were lovely and helpful breakfast good but not as good as two years ago Location is excellent Would stay again and recommend to friends 
230626,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Thought breakfast was a little expensive at 18 per head so opted to eat out , Proximity to tube station Hyde Park and museums Quiet room was good size and easy to find Reception staff were first class and maid service was very good 
230627,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Rooms are really old carpet of the room very dirty The rooms of this hotel need some renovation Our first room was really poor with blinded windows After a complain we got another room and this was a bit better but the rooms really need an update Curtains also very dirty , Lobby of the hotel is nice and modern There is a nice bar and the location is perfect 
230628,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Very small beds and room but comfortable, Great location perfect if you are visiting the Royal Alber Hall Natural History Museum The food in the restaurant was great 
230629,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Halls are very narrow My extra large luggage had problems going through the doorways The stairs in the business suite were small and slippery with carpet on them , Great location 2 minute walk from the Piccadilly tube Great and friendly staff 
230630,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Ordered room service and the price quoted on the info in the room was different to what we where charged in your favour, Staff very helpful on reception
230631,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Our room was right above a row of fans of some sort We could hear these even through the secondary double glazing , Friendly helpful staff and a fantastic breakfast with a vast choice of quality food changed frequently for freshness Ideal location for the Royal Albert Hall 10 minute walk as well as various museums a few minutes away 
230632,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Biscuits in the room with the tea making facilities would have been a welcome touch , The location and the wonderful breakfast with the best sausages ever 
230633,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The floor of my bathroom was badly stained and smelt especially around the toilet disgusting sums it up The housemaid occupied the one very slow lift and did not give way to an elderly guest Unable to open the window and the room was hot , Check in staff were friendly
230634,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The bedroom must have been in close proximity to the boiler plant room as every time the boilers pumps started the vibration and noise was felt through the bed Yes a vibrating bed not good So whilst the bed was comfortable the nights sleep was not , The bed the breakfast the staff
230635,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room a bit chilly and draft by window Turned on heating got too hot and a bit noisy , Staff were extremely helpful and friendly Made very welcome from moment entered foyer 
230636,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room service took AGES Despite ringing down twice However when the club sandwich finally arrived it was delicious my complaint was sorted out very efficiently see above , Great room for a single the bed was comfy the room quiet A great location 2 mins walk from the tube station and less than 10 minutes from the Natural History museum and the V A Harrods 20 min walk and Hyde Park 10 mins The bar area was nice if minimal for evening drinks not too busy and the breakfast was really good with lots of choice We had the full English buffet followed by mini pain au chocolate and all was lovely I d definitely stay here and would recommend it BTW when I complained about the long delay with room service I was dealt with by Danielle who was very apologetic and sorted things out efficiently and courteously thank you 
230637,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Bacon was a little cold from being in the servers dishes too long , pillows were fantastic staff very helpfull and a nice sitting area to meet friends 
230638,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Being taken to a back lift and having to walk a very long way to my room when there was a lift close to it Odd, The staff were excellent Very friendly and helpful Loved the restaurant Had the best shepherds pie 
230639,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Lack of gluten free bread was an inconvenience as we had been told it would be available Barman did not know what sherry was and offered me port until I persuaded him to look more carefully at which he found the Bristol Cream , Very comfortable bed excellent cooked breakfast
230640,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The first night we got a so called update of our room but it was a room without heating ice cold no view at all We called the housekeeper at 11 p m The whole part of the hotel in which was our room was non heated in november in London When we asked them to check the heating the only proposal was to give us a portable heating for the night So we asked to change the room next morning and then we got finally a nice room , Great location nice neighbourhood very comfortable 
230641,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Only 1 lift very very slow mostly used by housekeeping If you have heavy luggage you might need extra 15 minutes for checkout just because of the lift Very low quality baby accessories cot high chair in restaurant In terms of baby friendliness they are still in the 90 s , Friendly staff nice bar decor Convenient location if you re into museums 
230642,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Bedroom 428 was a little tired decor wise carpet grime looking bed too firm pillows too big sink partially blocked Breakfast much too expensive , Friendly helpful staff nice reception bar and restaurant areas Great location 
230643,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room was a little compact and as it was on the ground floor there was no opportunity for getting any fresh air My partner is quite tall and the bed was small for him also the bathroom was a little cramped and you had to sit on the toilet sideways to fit your legs in , Breakfast was really good value for money and the hostess booking us in was such a warm person as were the reception staff The location was fabulous for our stay close to the Royal Albert Hall museums South Kensington etc and such easy access to the tube to get anywhere else you wanted to go 
230644,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Very small room could almost not walk around the bed no furniture beside the bed to put some night things Very small bathroom no space to put for 2 person toilletries had to use the toilet cover to put things down , Great location 
230645,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Value was good for Kensington but the single room was very small , The staff were unfailingly courteous The buffet breakfast was excellent 
230646,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Water collected in the bath while I was showering and the plug hole looked a little rusted I wasn t quite sure how to empty it There were a great many people to cater for in the restaurant in the evening Friday night so this meant the staff were under pressure and therefore a little slow , Very good choice at breakfast Staff were very helpful upgraded my room at no extra cost Very comfortable large bed Couldn t hear anyone else near me which was good Room with a fridge an extra bonus Ease of checkout could have checked in or out online Couldn t see the prices on the a la carte menu but the food was excellent I loved the whitebait 
230647,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Bit noisy as our room was on road Double room was small, Paid to Upgrade to a better room as our initial room was small and uninviting Staff pleasant and good location
230648,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Fabulous room as always Massive bed Soo comfortable Always feels very special staying here Staff are VERY smart and courteous Food is just wonderful Every meal I ve had here is better than I imagined it would be A lovely hotel in a great location 
230649,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, One room was a tiny single but OK The double room was basically a single room with a double bed squeezed in at double the cost and this ploy was made all the more blatant by a small table only one chair and only one bedside table and lamp and one had to climb over the bed to get to the other side This is why I gave the lowest score for value for money Also the room to room phone service did not work and was not fixed despite alerting the staff and two room cards failed and had to be replaced The TV is rather complicated and it might be easy accidentally to incur extra charges , good location friendly staff decent if expensive breakfast
230650,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Hairs of all kinds in the bath was a bit of a shock , The staff was wonderful throughout the hotel The feel and scent when you arrived in the lobby was beautiful The bed and pillows were the best I ve ever had in a London hotel 
230651,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Couldn t get a cup of tea after 11 30 pm but not a real problem otherwise no complaints at all , Bed was very comfortable and the breakfast really very good Staff were charming 
230652,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The tiny bathroom with low down washbasin and difficult to access bath ought to have been made into a shower room The easy chairs were completely worn out needed re upholstering The lack of space generally for a luxury room was very disappointing , The bed was clean and comfy and the hotel was situated where we wanted to be 
230653,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room was very dated and tired It looked nothing like the ones shown on the website The shower was either scalding or freezing Not the standard I expect at a Raddisson Blu, The checkout app
230654,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, When I booked I requested gluten free food and it was in capital letters on the booking form When booking in at reception I enquired about the gluten free bread at breakfast and was told that there would be some The first morning was fine but on Sunday we went to breakfast at 9 30 ordered gluten free toast the waiter said after 10 mins when I enquired that it was on its way but after 20 mins he came back to say there wasn t any but did I want any other sort of bread I AM A COELIAC AND CANNOT EAT ANY OTHER SORT OF BREAD Breakfast finishes at 11am so the catering for gluten free was very poor and after all I had requested at the time of booking , We did get discounted for the lack of gluten free but I feel I should point it out as I am very ill if I eat gluten The reception people were exceptional with taxis etc 
230655,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Prices in the bar are very expensive , The reception staff were excellent phoned us to say room was ready left our bags earlier in the day these were in our room ready for us staff suggested places to go Room was comfy 
230656,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Drinks and coffee at bar were very expensive and we were charged 98p service charge to have coffee at the bar , Location was perfect Staff were very helpful Breakfast was good Room was small but well equipped 
230657,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Nothing all good , I traveled shortly after surgery to my hand and was somewhat apprehensive as to how I would manage with my arm in a sling I needn t have worried all of the staff were very helpful and friendly making my stay very comfortable and enjoyable 
230658,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Some kind of drawers or shelves for clothing would be very helpful Water pressure in the shower could be stronger , Staff were very friendly and helpful The location is wonderful 
230659,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Breakfast on last day monday was poor compared to previous days, Staff very friendly and helpful Room spacious superior Great for tube and museums 
230660,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Location is good not too far from Heathrow Airport and a few minutes walk to exibitions and Hyde Park Staffs are helpful We left early on the departture day and we got breakfast box 
230661,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, An issue with one of the rooms on arrival was sorted out quickly and to our satisfaction , Ideal location for our needs good breakfast buffet clean and comfortable room 
230662,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Needed to use machine to get wheelchair up the steps didn t realise there was no street entry ramp or ordinary access This took time and made us feel rather trapped Bathroom completely unsuitable and Ill equipped Impossible to use shower needs an accessible fixed seat Request for a chair produced no result or answer Did ask on booking form for shower which could be used with a wheelchair and no indication of building access difficulty, Pierre very helpful moving the wheelchair onto the machine to go up the steps into the hotel All staff willing and helpful
230663,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, I cannot think of anything that could have been done better , I was particularly impressed by the courtesy of the staff and the comfort of the room and hotel generally 
230664,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Bathroom is a touch small for such a large room but it s an older building of course it s London and still totally functional It would be nice if the door did not have glass and was solid as it lights the room in the morning Just a personal opinion of course Not something to deter staying here , Staff especially nice and helpful just what you would expect Style decor and location are excellent Breakfast was really delicious buffet and service and the restaurant staff was very helpful Room was very large and quiet even though in the front of the hotel Really a great experience Would recommend highly 
230665,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The building is nice and in a good location for our trip but the experience as a whole was very disappointing For the amount of money we paid we definitely expected at better level of service and facilities Breakfast and dinner were very poor we ve paid the same amount of money else where and got better service and a bigger room A premier inn would have been better value for money this time round ,No Positive
230666,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Standard room was rather small and if you sat on the toilet in the cramped bathroom your knees touched the sink, Excellent breakfast waiting staff friendly and helpful despite it being very busy Good location close to tube and museums
230667,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Great location BUT my single room s width was exactly the same length as a single bed No room to swing a cat It was like sleeping in a cupboard Although the room was clean the furnishings were very tired Breakfast food not restocked well enough So at 200 night this all seemed pretty poor value , Friendly staff Quality yoghurts at breakfast 
230668,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, room service very bad and lazy corridor very narrow, close to Gloster tube station good rich breakfast with fruit and vegetable stuff very helpful 
230669,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The outlook The mirrors were too much for our taste , Pretty quiet with a comfortable sitting space in the room We turned up early prepared to drop our bags and check in later but the room was ready ahead of the scheduled check in time
230670,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room was small given the price and the bathroom was not particularly user friendly Overall the hotel felt a bit tired , The bed was comfortable and the breakfast was good value
230671,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room size was a bit small for price , Short walk from Gloucester Rd station One of greatest breakfast I ve had in the uk Friendly staff The room was comfortable and clean 
230672,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Tiny elevator ill informed staff and price was much too high I was traveling with a business partner that wasn t an option above The building is very tiny and cramped so I don t feel the lofty price was warranted Very deceptive online photos that appeared to be expansive rooms with old world grandeur Also a very scary man stalked me while I was there He saw me in the bar and followed me for the entire evening I was terrified I stay in Radissons in US , Bed was wonderful 
230673,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The hallways and bathrooms are tight and small making them hard to mauvauer For a London Hotel you expect to pay high prices but you also expect a certain level of professionalism That was lacking Overall the hotel was comfortable but totally forgettable For the same price I d choose a different hotel, Breakfast provided variety in a buffet style and the room bathroom and bed provide the comfort you d expect from the price and loction
230674,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Bathroom tiny not much room to manoeuvre , Prime location within easy walk of several family attractions Breakfast and restaurant food good quality
230675,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The bedroom was small and dark The bathroom could not have been smaller We were put in a twin room having requested a double We were advised to book with the hotel directly next time rather than online The welcome note on the desk in the room was addressed to a different client Not a good experience for a weekend break , The location was alright 
230676,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, There was a short circuit in the room when my wife plugged in her hair dryer We had never experienced such poor facility in any other hotel before Rooms are extremely small and walls were stained Lift was too small Would accommodate 3 people at max I would not recommend this to anyone , Location was convenient and close to Royal Albert hall
230677,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The only thing I could fault was the cold plates Cold plates with hot food do no mix It s a small complaint and easily rectified , Very clean and tidy Lots of friendly helpful staff
230678,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Our room was on the road and Cromwell road is very busy the traffic is constant so the noise was a factor when trying to sleep our stay was only three nights don t think we had more than a couple of hours sleep the first two The shower was running hot and cold not such a big deal but could be annoying slow service in the restaurant , The bed was comfortable staff were so friendly and helpful could not fault them great breakfast to set you up for the day and the location was great we could walk to most of the attractions we wanted to visit the tube station was a short walk away for everything else I liked the don t clean my room today feature meant housekeeping weren t knocking on the door and money was being donated to charity great idea 
230679,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Comfortable family room for 2 adults and 2 children in central and family friendly London location close to Hyde Park Princess Diana Memorial Playground Natural history museum and Picadilly tube line to Covent Garden for shows Gloucester Rd tube stop just across the street 
230680,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room is too small bathroom tiny it was hard to get to the tank it is very small Bathroom equipment is very old The hotel is like a labyrinth with narrow halls, Breakfast and location
230681,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, We were booked for twin beds got a double Very small room with dirty old carpets and an extremely small bathroom with stained toilet Breakfast was chaotic not enough tables a long cue and the cooked food was not hot The staff were nice and doing their best BUT Not an impressive place to stay Upstairs it needs to be completely refurbished I would rate the lifts and passageways upstairs as a bad hazard in case of emergency Overall I would try and find somewhere else to visit, The staff were kind and helpful
230682,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, As someone from the US I would have liked colder AC but keep in mind we were there on the hottest days in Sept in 111years , The restaurant was lovely we had the included breakfast a lunch and a dinner there all were top notch Afternoon sweets in the lobby were a pleasant surprise touch Staff was very kind 
230683,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Narrow long dark hallways can make you feel claustrophic if you are prone to that and the rooms are incredibly small albeit very nice and the bathroom was modern and nice so all you really need , Great hotel clean comfortable delicious breakfast in a wonderful open airy room Close walk to tube 
230684,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Initially the TV was out of order but it was repaired by the time we returned from the theatre , The breakfast was excellent and the staff most courteous 
230685,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room smallish and no storage space We were upgrade to a bios was class room which was pleasant but total lack of storage for more than one pair of underpants and a couple of shirts in the wardrobe, The location is very conve
230686,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Rooms are small , Location takes 1 minute to the underground Near Hyde Park staff are helpful the hotel is surrounded by many resturants and coffee shops 
230687,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, At this price I expected a a good sized room it was small and pokey b attention to detail some parts of the room needed repainting repair , Breakfast was excellent The Scoff Banter was a pleasant environment in which to eat Manageress was helpful
230688,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Vent in bedroom dripped water and the bathtub was a death trap no bathmat and difficult to get into nearly fell twice getting in and out Hairs found on the bedsheets When I came back to my room one evening at 9pm the housekeeper was standing in the middle of the room looking surprised That was truly odd Staff held my luggage the day I checked out and when I returned to retrieve it they couldn t find it and asked me where it was How on earth should I know You re the ones who took it Room was near the lift and was EXTREMELY loud at all hours of day and night with drunk guests coming in and shouting down the corridor and no sound proofing it would seem Great location and decor in the corridors stay let down by oddly behaved staff wayward hairs and a dripping vent Wouldn t return and FWIW this is the last time I ll choose a Radisson Blu They always seem to be a bit odd , Location near the Underground was nice and great walking distance to Kensington museums etc Free bottled water in the room 
230689,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, I asked for extension of stay and they confirmed it but next day they called me when I was in University and asked me to leave the room immediately as their colleague made a mistake in extending my room and rooms are now occupied I had to cut my class and come back to hotel in the afternoon to check out ,No Positive
230690,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Twin room far too small There was no where to put luggage or a tray to put a room service order Tv very poor quality Bathroom so small it was dangerous getting out of the bath shower The most disappointing room that we have ever stayed in So bad that one person had to stay in bed whilst the others person manovered around the room ,No Positive
230691,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, While the bed was very comfy the comforter was way too hot for the summer weather, The staff was amazing Very friendly and very willing to meet any need we had 
230692,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Staff recognized me and were always helpful and interactive Good breakfast selection and fresh food This was my Second Stay and I felt relaxed looked after and special 
230693,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, See above comments, Good location and room had tea and coffee Room was small and had no bedside tables Hairdryer was in a drawer with the wire connected so very difficult to use as it only stretched a short way Bathroom was clean and had good facilities but both our room and my daughters had a big black ring in the toilets so that let the room down a bit Nice big fluffy towels Only one small lift which only fitted 3 people and very dark corridors it just seemed a maze of corridors and stairs Probably wouldn t stay there again 
230694,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room was slightly crowded due to small size however can t complain as it was a lovely stay the room was very lovely overall , Very friendly member of staff who greeted me and my boyfriend upon arrival unfortunately I didn t catch his name Lovely hotel which smelled so fresh as soon as you walked in the door Very nice room also with air con which was a great bonus as the weather was so hot Short walk to Gloucester Road underground station and situated in a stunning area Will definitely be back to stay at this hotel and see what more it has to offer 
230695,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, There was no spa facility such as a sauna or steam room which isn t the biggest of issues but would be a nice addition to the gym they have , The overall stay was enjoyable staff were friendly The location is superb 
230696,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Wifi variable Bedroom and bathroom very small no room for bedside tables or drawers air conditioning barely adequate poor for a 4 star hotel , Good location Comfortable bed and quiet night Staff tried hard 
230697,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Nothing cannot fault the hotel , The service was warm and friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them The room was clean and one of the most comfortable beds that I have ever slept in The decor was very tasteful and yet contemporary 
230698,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, there was not any room to walk around to the closet I would recommend a queen size bed and smaller chairs We were in room 226 , Close to museums subway helpful and friendly staff 
230699,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The pillows were no good for me so soft they swallowed my head I never realised you could ask for different pillows though A view would have been nice too but the room facing back meant there was no street noise , There s a reason a lot of reviews mention the breakfast It was fantastic The staff were very friendly and helpful which was important for a weary traveler The building was awesome it had an old building feel while still keeping up with modernity 
230700,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Nothing , Excellent location comfortable bed nicely decorated clean rooms I had read reviews that the standard single rooms were too small however I found mine was more than enough for what I needed 
230701,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, After seeing lovely pictures on the web I was a little disappointed with the room Although perfectly well equipped clean and comfy it was no more glamorous than a Premier Inn , Beds were comfy Room was clean On request the staff dealt with an issue that we had with noisy neighbours 
230702,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Rooms were a little small , Great location within 5 min walk of Natural History museum and V A Very friendly helpful staff Great choice of breakfast in lovely bright airy room 
230703,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, the location was the best next to the little treats in my room for my birthday it made my weekend Also the sweet treats in the lobby Such a lovely touch Keep it up 
230704,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Nothing we enjoyed a lovely short stay , Great London hotel excellent staff and good facilities Close to trains buses and in walking distance to Harrods and other retail 
230705,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The TV system was a little sluggish moving between channels and sometimes the AC system left the room with an odd smell but it wasn t really noticeable and turning off the AC for a time sorted the problem , The breakfast is excellent and the staff are very helpful The location is also excellent There is a room with 3 internet connected macs connected to a printer so you can print off your boarding pass I would stay here again 
230706,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Carrying luggage up 25 stairs from the tube to the street was a real challenge yet we were willing to strain ourselves for the proximity of the station The only other negative is we couldn t stay longer than our 3 night stay , What a beautiful jewel of a boutique hotel From the moment we arrived we knew we were staying in a very special place The staff was attentive helpful and made sure we were happy with our room which was bright spacious and a most comfortable king sized bed The rooms are classic and understated with soothing colors The linens towels and soap were of the highest quality I could imagine the Vanderbilts gathering around the marble fireplace in the waiting area adjacent to the front desks The charming fresco ceiling enhanced the feeling of a bygone era We were able to take the Tube directly from Heathrow to Gloucestor Station which was less than a block from the hotel and very convenient as we used the Tube often Very centrally located we were able to easily walk to Royal Albert Hall the Victoria and Albert Museum and the hop on hop off buses Breakfast is served in a lovely dining room and was generously appointed with many options from a simple continental breakfast to full English breakfast with everything in between like fresh juicy strawberries to several types of yogurt Truly this hotel exceeded our expectations We felt very lucky to have discovered it 
230707,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Rooms would have been too small if staying lomger Staff forgot to replace tea cups and water glasses , Very stylish and boutique Restaurant food and bar good Staff helpful
230708,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Wonderfully quiet Hotel with comfort put first and foremost would reccomend to all to stay here We will be returning again hopefully not too distant future 
230709,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Although very clean I feel that the sheer curtains in our room are due to a dry clean Room 428 , The staff were very helpful and attentive I would commend the Duty Manager who was on duty Thursday 11 August I m sorry but can t remember her name She was extremely helpful with some property we had left behind and I am very grateful 
230710,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Rooms are compact but comfortable It is a maze to get to your room and lifts very small and not very useable, Easy access for location to city and other areas Check in was not easy as error on room but fixed quickly Staff friendly and left you alone or helped as required which was nice as they were in background and not in your face
230711,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, A couple of little things 1 We were in out of our room which seemed to cause some confusion around getting our room serviced if staff were requested to come back a little later 2 It wasn t until the last day when it was explained the cups glasses taken from our room weren t replaced until after 4pm Both could be resolved by better staff communication , Excellent welcome and support from the front desk including in booking shows etc Very good buffet breakfast and a reasonable range of wines and other drinks in the bar Outstanding location near the Gloucester Road tube restaurants and pubs and museums parks Our room was a good size comfortable although the shower in the bath in a tight ish bathroom might be a little difficult for some personally I d replace the baths with just showers A little quirky adventure navigating to our room the hotel grew from joining a number of prior apartment buildings but great character 
230712,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The rooms are very small especially for families Not A family friendly hotel rooms were not deeply Cleaned full of dust Not enough storage in rooms , Location of the hotel People working at the reception
230713,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, We arrived at the hotel at 11pm and we were greeted by a friendly receptionist who gave us the key to our room Upon entering the room I spotted T shirts on the bed and thought how lovely to receive complimentary nightwear Looking round the room I then spot slippers and a toilet bag and realized to my astonishment that we were in someone else s room Needless to say we vacated that room very quickly Luckily no one was in the room We proceeded to go back to reception and explained the situation He was very apologetic and gave us the key to our room The room we were given was a single superior but we were so tired by now that we couldn t face going back down again I had actually booked a double room My husband had an uncomfortable night I m sure had we had the right size bed it would have been fine , I would stay there again but next time I would make sure I get the right room 
230714,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, A C didn t really cool the room and the window didn t open room was hot and stuffy, Staff really friendly and helpful and great location close to Gloucester Road tube station Comfortable although small room 
230715,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, While the room was clean nonsmoking it was actually quite smoky needed to be aired out Otherwise a very clean room, Breakfast service was excellent staff was very attentive friendly Room was comfortable well equipped 
230716,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The lift elevator is tiny and can barely take more than 3 people The stairs are badly signposted which doesn t help Heard people talking in the next room early in the morning though they may just have been loud , I stayed in this hotel previously in 2009 my single room was so small it felt like a wardrobe So this time I booked a superior single Worth the extra Room was a good size and nicely furnished It was facing not the road but wasn t at all noisy Staff were incredible helpful I didn t dine there so can t offer an opinion on that 
230717,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Continental breakfast not the best Had room service coffee cold Reception seating area a little small , Restaurant excellent Nice atmosphere Good mixture of old and new 
230718,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, they have different room size some are very small and this not shown when you booking, the staff specially Mr Stefano Paganelli like to thank him for his help
230719,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Hotel is a bit challenging to navigate b c of narrow hallways and multiple random staircases it is several old buildings connected into one long row hotel Room was a little small but we also had large suitcases so all in all totally manageable , Everyone was awesome from the lovely concierge Jubril to the building services staff we really enjoyed our stay Had a crib for the room great bath products and very clean Great location super accessible by several train lines Gloucester being the closest lots of restaurants and museums a stone s throw away and of course the lovely hyde park Great part of town to be in great hotel Would recommend and would return 
230720,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Small bathroom but it didn t really matter , Best hotel bed ever Great pillows Dark when curtains shut for a really good sleep Great decor Lovely bar where you can actually get a drink that is not prosecco 
230721,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, My television didn t have the best reception and kept turning off but was fine since I was happy just taking in the views , Comfy bed pillows were so so so fab staff were incredible accomodating and friendly Clean and tidy fantastic view Just loved it
230722,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Arrived back to the hotel after 4pm after a long day and looking forward to a rest before going to dinner and theatre only to find the room hadn t been serviced The sign was on the door requesting the room be cleaned A complaint was made to the front desk who were right on it but we couldn t rest in case the cleaner arrived She did arrive just before we were leaving for dinner about 5pm As this fault couldn t be fixed in time we believe we shouldn t have been charged for that day Otherwise we enjoyed our stay and would very likely return again when in London , The bed was very comfortable Nice and quiet Nice staff
230723,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, We were disappointed that when we arrived after the check in time of 3pm we had to wait to access our room as it wasn t ready , The staff were helpful and friendly and attentive but not to much The decor and ambiance was perfect 
230724,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Lifts could be a little bigger a bit tight with four people and four small suit cases , Comfy beds extremely attentive staff members Especially breakfast time the waitress Cecila was bubbly friendly and nothing was too much trouble also the same goes to the chef So much choice for breakfast absolutely delicious thank you very much for a pleasant stay Definately would stop there again 
230725,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The fact the room wasn t ready when we arrived we were put on the 2nd floor as far away as possible from the lift I m sure considering we requested a ground floor room I was traveling with my mum who will be 84 this month and can t walk too far in one go We only stayed 2 nights but had 2 rooms we were moved to the ground foot for the second night but still quite a way to walk I don t like having to swap rooms once I m checked in because you don t seem to get chance to relax properly Breakfast was cold on the first morning but at least they cooked some fresh for me I think they had started to turn things off because it wasn t very busy, Location we have stayed in that area before but don t rate this hotel not a patch on other Raddisson Blu hotels we have stayed in previously There was one particular member of staff Daniell was her name I think she was very helpful but a shame some of the other staff let her and the hotel down
230726,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The only downside was my bed the room I was in NEEDS a new bed it was so wore that you got in and rolled to the edge it was only a single room bed so didn t really have anywhere to move to This was very uncomfortable and didn t sleep too well , Location is brilliant just over the road from Gloucester Road Tube station Staff are very helpful especially the restaurant staff I was travelling alone and had breakfast by myself each morning there was a lady working there Celia I think her name was she made me feel so welcome and always come over for a chat Breakfast was amazing would go back just for that eggs benedict each morning as well as Danish pastries the choices were endless Room was clean big enough for me bathroom was spotless 
230727,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, To reach the room with heavy bags was like going through a maze size of room too small and toilets ridiculously small poorly designed , location staff check out time breakfast
230728,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, We booked a cab to the airport via the hotel they told us it would be 45 pound but it ended up being a private driver which cost 65 pound we weren t pleased , Bed was comfortable and the room was great Good location Gloucester Road tube station is only a couple of minutes walk away 
230729,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The standard single room could easily be classified as a large cupboard Absolutely tiny And with some noise from the busy street outside But for 109 I knew there would be a catch and it provided what I needed , For 109 including a great buffet breakfast its hard to complain about a hotel close to the museums in South Kensington Good for a one night stop where you just need a bed and some breakfast in the morning 
230730,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Our room was located on top of three flights of stairs and beyond several fire doors that were hard to open yet nobody offered us help with the luggage , The breakfast spread was excellent especially the fresh strawberries 
230731,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room small Impossible to sit on toilet as installed next to bathroom wall , Staff excellent Bag store very useful Location ideal for tube and eating out 
230732,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, nothing to criticise , Lovely friendly staff who go out their way to be of assistance especially Daniella and the breakfast staff Food was varied and excellent quality Would highly recommend this hotel 
230733,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The size of the room It was extremely small to accommodate 2 single beds There was no space for two people to move around , The location was excellent and the staff were very welcoming 
230734,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Nothing , All the staff were extremely helpful and courteous The room was small but the bed was bigger than a single which was more important There was a very good choice for breakfast plenty of fresh fruit as well as the usual hot fare Better still it was included in the price Trouble free check in and out The location was great for the V and A and the Royal Albert Hall 
230735,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Very warm welcome from a nice Indian man Got an upgrade for business At check out Daniela was very nice It was worth it First time in Edwardian hotel but not the last 
230736,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Comfy beds and pillows Cool air conditioning Quiet rooms Tea and coffee facilities and a fridge make this an excellent choice of hotel Walking distance to lots of attractions 
230737,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Way too expensive for the sizes of the rooms Rooms were tiny in the 1 person room the door could not even open fully because it hit the bed already way too small Does not meet the Radisson Blu quality hotel facilities also outdated stuck in the early 2000s does not even have the universal sockets in the rooms Definitely should not be using the Radisson Blu name , Location was very good tube station close by with 3 lines 
230738,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The rooms were tiny even the bathrooms were miniature for a family room it was lucky we have young children The Staff numbers were probably a little low for maintaining the service expected in this standard of hotel which made service very slow waiting 15 minutes for delivery of order , The renovations in the ground floor reception bar and restaurant area look great The breakfast was very adequate but expensive if not included The staff were all very helpful and pleasant 
230739,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Asked at reception 3 times if the window could be opened as per notice in room due to heat this was never done, Staff were very good breakfasts had plenty of choice bar was good didn t have tonic water one night so the gin and tonics lost out Good central location 
230740,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Age of building means restrictive access down very narrow corridors and like a rabbit warren Hotel has to adhere to restrains due to being a listed building which is fair enough , Somewhat tired 
230741,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Service charge at the bar Service charge in restaurant acceptable but for 2 drinks whilst sitting at the bar not so , Staff very friendly and helpful We were made most welcome 
230742,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, That my stay was only 1 night , Very helpful and pleasant staff Quiet room with extras e g a fridge The breakfast was superb cooked to perfection I would return just for the breakfast 
230743,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Anyone speaking in the hall ca be clearly heard in the room But overall it did not happen often , The attitude of the staff The breakfast was super The safe in the room was very convenient The way you need a card to access the entrance to the room area and the elevator But again the staff were all helpful and couldn t do enough for you Thanks for a great stay 
230744,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, small room with no opening window or obvious ventilation is very claustrophobic Smelly stairwell and corridor , breakfast great beds comfy liked complimentary water
230745,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The double room was slightly on the small side However the room had a balcony really great plus and the bathroom was spacious shower very powerful and complementary toiletries also an added bonus , Very close to the nearest tube station Staff very friendly Hotel also sends a text message service about anything else they can do to help Bar area is very nice 
230746,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Rooms are a little small and cramped and ours was narrow and tricky to negotiate Although clean and functional, We loved the service staff and wonderful bar and restaurant great food service atmosphere and value for money
230747,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The single room was tiny as was the lift hence traffic jams all the time , The Hotel is central and easy to locate Kind and attentive staff at breakfast 
230748,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Our room was very dated the tv didn t work and the in bath shower had very low pressure and kept changing temperature Also our breakfast was cold as if it had been sat out for quite a while however the quality was superb and still tasted delicious , The hotel itself was well presented and in a great location
230749,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, I had a single room which was only slightly cheaper than my friends double room all booked together The room door opened onto a narrow set of stairs to another door and the room which was so tiny that the single bed took all the space with no room for a small suitcase I had to leave my suitcase at the bottom of the stairs and squeeze past it to go in and out While quaint it definitely was not comfortable , The staff were friendly and helpful They went out of their way to accomodate any request made Convenient for travel to sightseeing and both Heathrow and London City airports I had an early departure so the hotel made up an excellent breakfast bag to take with me 
230750,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Many things Unacceptably loud music in dining room Very lax and unprofessional service at dinner One and half hour wait on point of leaving Shower and television not working No choice of pillows on bed had neck injury and pillows like mountains No Earl Grey tea or milk on second day There were other things wrong but these were major faults and I think The Management should address such problems Our stay was ruined by constantlyhaving to find fault , Food acceptable croissants and espresso excellent 
230751,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room did not have an external outlook however apart from sleeping we did not spend much time there so it was not a problem, The location of the hotel was excellent for our requirements near to the Albert Hall and within 2 mins walk of tube station The staff were exceptionally obliging and helpful We were allowed an early check in and late check out which was very helpful
230752,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, I had a single room it was a bit of a marathon to get there many corridors and doors It was also just about adequate in terms of space , Reception staff are welcoming and helpful as are the staff who serve breakfast 
230753,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, no small table in room nosurfaces shelves in bathroom to put down washbags Room service sandwich was enormous and came with masses of chips Too much to be called a sandwich , very pleasant staff food very good inrestaurant
230754,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Nothing, Breakfast buffet was lovely staff were attentive Hotel entrance was eye catching The location was perfect near Gloucester Road tube station Near restaurants and shops Definitely will visit again 
230755,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, I hope my room was not located at the far most area of the floor It feels like a labyrinth of hallway and doors before reaching my room , I love the breakfast buffet and the staff welcoming and assisting during breakfast the guest officer who checked me out was also nice and attentive to the comments provide The location is great and the overall ambiance of the hotel is fantastic 
230756,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Bar was shut when I got back at 1am and when paying 200 for a small single room I would expect the facility to buy a drink as a resident Was told bar was shut and that was that , Overall nice clean good quality hotel in excellent location 
230757,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, First room was noisy coming from pipes moved to another room which although it wasn t immediately apparent had exactly the same noise problem as the initial room As a result I had very little sleep , Breakfast was excellent
230758,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Extra small room I ve never been to a hotel with such small rooms The distance from wall to wall could fit only one bed and if you wanted to go across you had to jump through the bed Naturally the bathroom pretty clean was also small but had a bath tub So thumbs up for that The mini fridge with no mini bar was stored in the wardrobe along with hair drier iron and some other stuff so no place for clothes Extremely small and old TV The corridors were very narrow and dark I would have expected more for 170 pounds night , The location is very good There are lots of things to visit nearby if you want to do that Museums Imperial College Royal Albert Hall and Kensington Gardens plus it s very well connected to public transport Very good Wi fi connection Noise from the street wasn t a problem 
230759,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The staff were rude did not help at all seen me struggle with luggage breakfast was cold found hair in fried eggs room was dirty when complaind no one got back to us window did not shut so very noisy all night and early morning never again will I stay with this hotle, I was very disappointed very rude staff and room was dirty
230760,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room was a little bland and needed a little more character Perhaps a bit of colour , The location was excellent for The Royal Albert Hall Very comfortable bed and bedding 
230761,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Being very picky but the window seats in the restaurant could be higher , Very helpful staff extremely good location very relaxed atmosphere made our stay very special Highly recommended 
230762,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Day staff were fantastic however night staff were horrendous we booked a second night and they could only offer us a double and two singles we had booked two doubles and they couldn t understand why I might want to actually share a room with my husband It took 3 hours to sort out and in the end we were put in a taxi and taken to a different hotel who were very rude and unhelpful also a Radisson It was very frustrating to constantly be told that the new hotel was doing us a favour Extremely poor customer service We were hoping to end our weekend with a few drinks in the bar however it was 1 45am by the time we were actually checked in We wished we had found somewhere on our own but it was too late , The breakfast was great and the bar area was nice 
230763,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, This is the second time I have stayed at this splendidly located property in South Kensington The ambience and the service is impeccable and the full English breakfast is scrumptious 
230764,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Wasn t offered to register card facilities at point of check in so was unable to start a tab in the bar without revisiting reception Hair dryer supplied was very poor had to hold button in continually to activate got very hot very quickly and wasn t very effective over all , Bedroom was beautiful very modern and clean
230765,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Shower in bathroom was not good it would have been better to stand in the rain Rooms are a little small, Location was perfect for what we needed and staff extremely polite and helpful
230766,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Family rooms could have been bigger Not much room for walking around the beds , Lovely food staff really friendly excellent location close to tube station fabulous restaurant 
230767,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, A silly thing really but a decorative picture in the room would have been nice as the room was small it would have added a little something , The breakfast was super we really enjoyed it and the dining room was just perfect we had a very relaxing breakfast in lovely surroundings 
230768,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The rooms were not large but this did not impact our enjoyment of the venue , The location was exactly what we wanted The staff were freiendly helpful and efficient The rooms were spotlessly clean Breakfast was fresh and tasty The bar had a good athmosphere late in the evening we weren t there earlier The property was quiet for a city centre venue 
230769,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Toilet cleanliness Confusion over reservation price Waiting for a room to check in at 4 30 No shoes returned overnight and no paper as reserved , Comfortable bed Breakfast Newspaper given complimentary Friendly staff 
230770,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, The staff were so polite and helpful and yes the beds were brilliant Enjoyed the overall ambiance of the hotel and very convenient for Kensington and the Albert Hall 
230771,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The decor is very dark in corridors and stairways and feels claustrophobic when eye sight not so good Not able to open windows as and when without relying on staff , Excellent breakfast even when late 10 00am Lovely staff Very comfortable bed 
230772,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Nothing, The room was perfect the bed was extremely comfortable the restaurant was well managed and the staff went out of their way to help you A real treat and pleasure 
230773,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, The staff were AMAZING everyone was so kind and helpful from the first employee who checked me in a very nice Italian young lady at the reception to the lovely staff in the dining room a young man from Manchester also the young lady from Spain who checked me out My room was sparkling clean even though it was small if was so cozy with coffee and tea a small fridge and a great selection on the flat screen The breakfast was delicious with a large selection of hot and cold items Also I loved the location of the hotel so convenient from Heathrow restaurants and to museums I normally don t like to stay in the same hotels but I definitely will stay at this establishment on my next trip to London 
230774,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The bathroom was particularly small which caused some issues as the bath screen jutted out which just further impacted on the small space , Chose the hotel because of its location and proximity to Royal Albert Hall Good breakfast pleasant staff 
230775,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The fact that we were only staying one night , Excellent location and lovely friendly staff Room was great and the beds were really comfortable Lovely breakfast Lots of lovely fresh food and happy staff 
230776,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Excellent stay with you Staff gave attention to detail were friendly and helpful at all time Food good value in taste and money will definitely stay again
230777,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Some minor niggles large bedroom window completely frosted couldn t even see sky to judge the weather without going outside Too few surfaces to put anything on in bedroom or bathroom had to boil kettle on floor , Brilliant location ideal base for flitting round London in different directions Quiet Fast reliable free WIFI Very comfy bed Good breakfast
230778,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Some noise in the night from working equipment perhaps but not sure what it was the air conditioning , Extremely helpful staff Very good restaurant inc buffet breakfast Central location close to tube Clean 
230779,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The only thing was that the breakfast was a buffet style but it was still good, What was their not to like the staff where wonderful and Hotle its self was very stylish big thumbs up but by far the restaurant staff Emma was great
230780,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Bed wasn t comfy Too hard Shame If bed was comfy would come back often , Staff were lovely and helpful Customer service is of a very high standard Breakfast was fantastic 
230781,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Corridor carpet and walls are ugly lots of brown I would have liked miniture toilettries instead of big bottles affixed to wall Shower did go very hot then cold room 446 , Clean room I did the finger run along the pictures not a speck of dust Room was pitch black when curtains closed and quiet even on road side Good choice of buffet breakfast Smart looking resturant and bar Staff kind Octavio was particully helpful 
230782,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Bed mattress was a little bit too hard for me no bedside tables Breakfast was a little poor , The staff were fantastic could not be more helpful Gave us an early check in Air conditioned room was adequate and comfortable Gym and treatments available 
230783,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Super friendly staff small but well designed comfortable rooms marvellous breakfast perfect location very central and convenient but in calm corner 
230784,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Hairs in room notice mentioning another guest in the room No remote control for the tv Still awaiting my invoice to be emailed through to me, The staff at check in was very polite
230785,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The front desk staff left a lot to be desired Very unprofessional The bathtub is deep and narrow making it very dangerous to get in and out of Be very careful Had a friend drop off something for us and was never notified and I email and asked to have it sent on to us but never received a response Typical I must say the location was great making this hotel worth dealing with ,No Positive
230786,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Another lift would be good but I know it s not so easy in these older buildings Toothbrush package should be standard IMO , I asked if an earlier check in would be possible and this was done for me It made a huge difference to my stay as I had an event to attend Thanks Excellent check in from Iria Very close to Tube 40 mins from Heathrow 
230787,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, the bathroom had a terrible smell the room was shabby no bedside table waited 10 minutes to get into the lift it is totally inadequate traffic noise The window in 207 does not shut properly the hot breakfast items were cold, very friendly and helpful staff great location good choice at breakfast Comfortable bed Very nice communal areas 
230788,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room was very small the double bed is suitable for one person max and the water pressure in the shower was so lousy it was really disappointing , Great location very nice d cor inside of the hotel lobby rooms etc 
230789,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Rooms too small Lift access a pain having to use room key Hotel like a maze Would not be wheelchair friendly , Staff were excellent other than maid not seen going by room service 
230790,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, It s out of date and old not a nice bathroom Got upgraded which only makes me wonder what the roomwe should have was like a cupboard maybe, Ok hotel good location pleasant stas
230791,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Friendly staff and very helpful Comfortable stay at a very good location Loved the small details like the late afternoon complimentary sweets at the lobby and drinks and the early morning take away coffee at the lobby Please keep it up 
230792,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Nothing that I can think of , Although I had a single room I did not feel closed in There was plenty of room for the one night An addition was the opening window so that fresh air could circulate the room instead of using the air conditioning There was no noise during the night and I slept very well The breakfast was lovely 
230793,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, We cannot think of anything we did not like about the hotel , We were upgraded and had a lovely large comfy bed We were shown to our room not heard of The room was at back of hotel and very quiet Also we had a extra hour to check out Very satisfied 
230794,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, No complaints at all I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and hope to return soon , The staff were excellent every employee I saw was professional knowledgeable and cheerful My room was cosy and quiet with good quality furnishings and linen I enjoyed the breakfast selection and the location was fantastic too 
230795,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, See above And bathroom had some kind of blockage that made dirty water gurgle in the sink It was also rather smelly , No plugs near the bed Bin in the bathroom ridic small TV could be mounted Room size was rather smaller than expected 
230796,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Small room with little natural light Room not cleaned until 1630 and only when we asked Television did not work properly , The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff 
230797,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room was very hot at night as it was the warmest weekend of the year so mustn t complain too much Air con made no difference, Small but perfect room
230798,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Were not able to offer us a twin as we had booked Did their best to sort this out but I had to sleep on a sofa bed Bar very expensive 12 5 service on everything making a cup of tea over 4 , Really friendly and helpful staff Great location near to all museums Good restaurant 
230799,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The receptionist when we got there was unhelpful wouldn t let us check in and had trouble finding our booking after travelling for half the day with young children really its the last thing you need especially with the price of the hotel and having requested an early check in The carpet could do with a good cleaning also , the location of this property 
230800,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Our Deluxe room looked like that of a premier inn when we complained that the amount of money we were spending on staying in that room was not proportionate we were told that was their best deluxe room We were moved to one of their newly renovated rooms and it was far superior to what we were given initially For a start the room was twice the size and so was the bathroom Our new room also had a settee in it Another thing we were not too pleased about was that whilst waiting for our new room to be ready we had to wait over an hour we decided to have a drink in the bar 2 pints of Peroni came to 14 as it included a service charge For them to pass the glasses over the bar To us And an hours wait for my sandwich from room service when I was told it would be 20 minutes , our bags were held for us until our room was ready Problems were sorted out quickly Very close to Gloucester Road tube station Room was beautiful
230801,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Our room was tiny it had a small window that you could not see out off on ground floor Check in too far too long waited for one couple to check in before us then our own check in seemed to take an age We were told we would have ground floor room as no others were available , Hotel is well finnished and great location 
230802,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room had a shower that leaked very badly all over the bathroom floor Couldn t open windows When turning the ac up it sounded like the underground Room either too hot or too cold And worst of all they had over booked rooms , Location excellent 
230803,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The young french guy at the desk reservation the only one not very friendly The room was far too small I didn t like the energy in it , very helpful friendly and very professional staff Great food and I am French so fussy about food I loved the music it created a great atmosphere in the main entrance 
230804,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The hotel is like a maze Very difficult to get in and out especially if your room is on higher floors and away from the lift , The staff was extremely helpful and polite 
230805,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Some of the reception staff were rude and unfriendly Even though we had a do not disturb sign on our door someone walked into our room on two separate occasions On checkout we were also overcharged on our bill which took too long to resolve ,No Positive
230806,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Very small bed for two Hardly any room to store our luggage Shower never got really hot medium warm water , The staff was very friendly and helpful Breakfast was great and plenty Within walking distance to museums and shopping Near subway station so very convenient 
230807,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Layout like a labyrinth not in a quirky sense and lifts in odd places Could do with reviewing signs with someone unfamiliar with hotel layout , Efficient staff nice public rooms room functional and comfortable 
230808,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Very comfortable room excellent service very friendly staff and the breakfast offered an enormous choice of well presented and freshly cooked food Good location with Gloucester Road tube station just across the road Couple of good caf s and patisseries close by 
230809,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Reception staff extremely friendly and couldn t do enough to help mentioned was my husbands birthday and they delivered a cake to the room which was a very nice touch Would use this hotel again when going to the Royal Albert Hall 
230810,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Breakfast time a little chaotic Had to wait a while for parts of buffet to be replenished a couple of staff were a bit terse , Well maintained tastefully decorated Good breakfast Friendly helpful staff Good access to public transport the Royal Albert Hall 
230811,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, When we left we asked the front desk in the lobby to order a taxi for us When I order a taxi in London I expect it to be a London Cab or at least a cab from a recognized regulated and above board Company This didn t happen When it turned up it was a private car not marked as a taxi no meter or anything that normally comes with a taxi And at least the staff in the lobby should have asked me if it was OK to order a non taxi I could of course have rejected it but was a bit pushed for time and therefore the weak part in this When we arrived at Victoria the driver asked an exorbitant 35 When we arrived in London on Monday the same trip from Victoria to Cromwell Road cost 12 And taxi trip calculators for London gives the Price for that trip at 11 12 poungs So this non taxi driver charged three time the going rate There is no other way to describe this as a totally unacceptable rip off Even though the hotel is well located the staff is friendly etc the incident described above Means that I will never return to that hotel or any other hotel in the same chain I hope you will post this on your website so that other customers are warned off this hotel , The staff was very friendly and helpful with as it turned out one important exception
230812,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, We paid for business class room which was larger than standard It was a decent sized room but if this is considered large room then I suspect the standard rooms are quite small Air con not great but we were able to leave the window open , Comfortable large bed Well positioned hotel handy for tube station Breakfast was very good food was hot and of a great standard Plenty to choose from Staff helpful and friendly 
230813,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Bathroom was so small you had to reverse to sit on the toilet The bath was dangerous to get out of if you were old you would not have been able to use it My sister stayed in adjoining room and hers was the same Apparently we had been upgraded The cleaner knocked and just walked into our room at 8 30am Not happy, Great service front of desk brilliant breakfast and restaurant Able to extend checkout till 2 with no extra cost and they kept luggage secure with no extra cost until 6 
230814,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Drinks at the bar were expensive and when I went to the bar myself for drinks while we waiting to leave I was charged 12 1 2 service charge Making a G T and a cappuccino 15 50 Other than that a great hotel and I would certainly use it again , Easy walk to the Albert Hall Underground across the road makes everywhere else very accessible Waitrose and Tesco across the road and great choice of restaurants and bars Beds really comfy and great breakfast Staff were all so friendly and attentive 
230815,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Shower temperature very inconsistent either it was cold or scolding hot Had issues with our first room as well it was supposed to be a nicer room Deluxe but could hardly squeeze into the bed given the walls that stuck out and the bathroom was very narrow and small Upgraded to a much nicer suite but again the bathroom was very narrow and again the water was inconsistent , Location excellent breakfast good 
230816,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, While I appreciate there was a gym it us a little small There were two of us there at the time and it was a little cramped, The bathroom so well equipped

230821,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The bed wasn t amazing but I think beds are personal preference It was tucked too much and a little hard for my taste The TV also kept trying to sell me premium content when all I wanted was to watch terrestrial television it wasn t very clear how to get out of the menu and I m a game developer I know my way around a gui P s we live in the day and age of Netflix and free streaming content so the little extras are well off , The staff were super helpful and all credit goes to them and there hospitality The breakfast was nice

230824,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room 424 NO bed side tables NO bedside lamps Have to turn lights off by the room door then have to find way back in the dark To use the shower effectively you have to squash yourself up against the taps , The location for museums and Royal Albert hall is super Easy to get to by tube and local area has good eateries and pubs The hotel is quite ornate and very clean The staff were friendly and polite 
230825,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Would have preferred a double bed as opposed to 2 singles Realize this was o ly a request but it would have made my stay just that bit more e njoyable Member of staff did offer a change for 2nd and subsequent night but just too weary to want to change , Near lots of amenities
230826,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Complicated layout of the building A lot of doors and steps to tackle until reaching the lift but I assume is the same for all Georgian buildings in the area Small room Cleaning of bathroom was sloppily done , Staff was very friendly Elegant building in a good location Comfortable bed 
230827,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Really liked the service breakfast and room Staff was very lovely and helpful Really went the extra mile We had to check out by 11 but only had a train to catch at 3 so wanted a last little walk around London before we left and staff were happy to keep all our luggage so we could enjoy our last morning 
230828,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Nothing really , Great location nice bedroom with pull out beds for the children welcoming staff breakfast was excellent Everything was very clean My daughter hurt her elbow while in London and the staff was very helpful Overall very happy 
230829,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Having to pay extra for accompaniments to my meal The card machine in the restaurant also caused some problems running out of power going off line etc Lets hope I haven t been charged twice , Good customer service friendly staff great breakfast good food in Scoff Banter although I dislike having to pay extra for accompaniments to my meal the staff however are very prompt at pointing this out to save the embarrassment of you ending up with a steak and absolutely nothing else 
230830,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The fire alarm went off false while I was there and although I asked a member of staff downstairs in the reception area about it there was no information apology etc only that we could return to rooms The room double was fine for me as a single but would have been too small if travelling with my husband one chair single desk space The coffee served in the morning was cold , Good location the room was comfortable and warm The reception staff was very good polite and helpful a good start to the stay 
230831,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, My single room was very small but having said that the most had been made of the space and it was nicely furnished and equipped A bit far out of town but ideal for the museums on the Cromwell Road , Delightful slightly quirky layout in a building full of character Very friendly helpful staff both on reception and in the restaurant
230832,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, There was some queuing at breakfast maybe due to too few staff clearing tables after guests left , Very helpful staff Reception staff offered to buy my wife tights from the staff supply when she discovered at the last minute she had forgotten to pack some and needed them for a dinner Above and beyond normal duties Breakfast was excellent Good range and presented well 
230833,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Nothing , I paid for an upgrade via booking com but the hotel hadn t had the update and so despite paying extra they could not refund or provide the room booked but this is an issue with booking com not the hotel

230836,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Deeply disappointed after staying in a Radison blu hotel in Glasgow twice We found toe nail clippings on the bedroom floor We found a housekeeper to vacuum them up but that should not have been needed Lady booking us in forgot to tell us what time breakfast was and where it was located Room generally tired with very little natural day light I do wonder if the booking was made via bookiing com if we were given an inferior room, Location for access to The Albert Hall 
230837,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Nothing , The location was ideal for adventures we had planned trip to see world cup rugby at Twickenham Art exhibition at the Royal Academy The food and the service were excellent

230844,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Pillows were quite uncomfortable and there was no decaf tea available at breakfast Decaf coffee was also just by the cup not a cafetiere, The staff were fantastic
230845,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Small bathroom a bit tricky for a family Chef s choice menu should change daily , Great breakfast buffet Hotel is in a lovely area with very close access to a main tube line Good value restaurant We booked a family room for 4 people and were really pleased with the size 
230846,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Attention to detail Directed to wrong lift by staff Two 3 4 empty toilet rolls one dressing gown lids on buffet breakfast hot food repeatedly left up and staff did not close This left the quality food stone cold seating in restaurant more suitable to park picnic, location room very comfy and large staff very friendly and helpful

230849,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, First day we were sat down down quickly and staff were helpful The second day they were rushed off their feet and we were left standing 10min to be sat at a table It wasnt until i got fed up with waiting and sat my family down myself did they come over to say the table id chosen wasnt suitable and moved us It was then that i noticed the breakfast menu which wasnt on the table on our first day so we werent aware that there was alternatives to the buffet I asked for 2 poached eggs and 15min later had to ask again by which time my family had finished As for the buffet it had been emptied and we had to wait for that to be replenished as well Not good ,No Positive
230850,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Lift was extremely small and meant we had to wait a while for an empty lift on the morning of check out to fit our family luggage , Ideal location for touring London access to tube station Personal touch for the kids on arrival with sweet treats and a joke about the football teams they supported which continued throughout our stay 
230851,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Very small bathroom room 132 was a bit small in general Noise insulation between the rooms could be a lot better not so funny to wake up by your neighbours alarm at 5h30 and thinking it s your own , Good bed great breakfast great price quality ratio for London very close to Gloucester Road Underground Station Natural History Museum Imperial College Royal Albert Hall National Geographical Society and Harrod s 
230852,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, We ordered from the daily set menu We met reasonably early and so would have expected everything on that menu to be available I was a little disappointed that the mushrooms were not available that said the small quiches I ordered instead were delicious , I had a standard single last week this time I had a larger single room and was soooo impressed More space somewhere I could work slightly larger bed I was very pleased Well worth the few extra pounds I needed to get some work done during the afternoon so being able to check in soon after 1pm and then spend the afternoon in the hotel s business centre was a real bonus A colleague joined me for dinner in the hotel s restaurant We had a great meal it wasn t over busy so we could talk without feeling nearby tables were so close they might share in our conversation
230853,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, When booking 3 months in advance I specifically requested to not be near a lift due to noise When checking in I again asked that it was a quiet room not near a lift which was confirmed The room provided was right next to the lift which when raised with reception led to being shown another room next to the lift and a twin room There were no other options available so we had to stay in the room and put up with noise from customers and staff chatting when entering and exiting the lift ,No Positive
230854,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Nothing , We had stayed here before and everything was perfect we were treated exceptional by all the staff so we decided to book again for our sons 16th birthday The manager promised that we would be looked after On our return we were not expecting to be upgraded to the suite which was outstanding Thank you to all the staff at the Radisson Blu our son had the most amazing weekend See you all next time we are in London 
230855,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, In the busy morning the lift was occupied by cleaner staff and their trollies My room was in the second floor and I waited for the lift on the ground floor for a while but they used from the basement The lift was seemingly only one to use for customers and staff , All members of staff were friendly approachable The single room was compact but neat and clean It was nice enough for one night for single person The morning buffet had a wide range of fresh fruits breads juice for British and Continental I think I ll use this hotel at the next visit as well 
230856,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Rooms were ridiculously small loud and dirty The bathroom was so small that you could close the door fully due to a towel rack Shower so small I am glad that I was thin , Staff
230857,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, A standard room was too small There was no space to even unzip a suitcase Hardly found a place to unfold an ironing board which made moving around the room impossible The bathroom was even worse size wise felt more like a mine shaft ,No Positive

230864,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Staff where not that friendly or helpfull Couldn t open the toilet door because the sink was in the way for 258 for two nights room facilities where pretty poor The slope from bathroom to bedroom was stupid I d stay in the area again but not that hotel Poor for the price , Location was good right near station
230865,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, When I arrived at my hotel the staff member proceeded to take my card payment then afterwards told me the hotel was over booked and the couldn t give my the double twin room I had booked and now paid for But he was delighted to tell me I can have a room with one bed and a foldout bed squeezed in the room When I aid this wasn t acceptable tonne her told me to find another hotel Staff where unhelpful be couldn t careless, Nothing really
230866,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, It would have been a little better to have had a room not so close to the lift , The bed was very comfortable The room was a little cold when I got there but the staff worked hard to make it right 
230867,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, To start with the room was tiny I literally had to crawl over my husband if I needed to use the bathroom at night There obviously are problems with hot water and water pressure The bathroom was as tiny as in a 3 star Parisian hotel We also didn t like the service there was supposed to be a concierge service but even reaching the reception by telephone was a pain Night receptionists were far from being helpful we even failed to send a postcard as were advised to go to the post office and do it by ourselves think it s kind of mean taking into account the hotel is supposed to be luxurious , Breakfast especially the freshly squeezed orange juice Also the computer room is really well equipped and printing out isn t an issue
230868,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room had not been cleaned properly before our arrival Previous guest s items which I wld not like to detail not removed from our room Reception staff not very helpful ,No Positive

230874,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The bed linen were not properly clean and the bath too cold , COnvenient position close to gloucester road tube station The receptionist Daniela was very kind and helpful and speaking italian Thank you 
230875,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The hotel was like a maze and really not for those who like to have easy access to the room One must have patience if one is walking from the reception and to the hotel room and vice versa Terrible maze The room was a little cold as the window did not shut properly and one could hear the noise from outside as the hotel is located on a busy road , Location was just next to the tube station Staff was really friendly 
230876,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Standard rooms are tiny as well as the table in the room approx 30 40cm diam so it feels rather tight Not a hostel capsule bed only room of course No shower curtain there is glass for a half of the bath s length shelf above the sink is hanged low no comfortable way to bend and put face near the tap , Still water is available in the room complimentary as well as shampoo soap shaving mirror WiFi and air conditioning work in the rooms you can regulate the temperature There is post office and Zone 1 underground station nearby literally two minute walk and you don t have to pay extra for going across zones to city center You can ask receptionist for travel adapter and they ll provide it free of charge there is five pounds fine for loss though You have bath in the room and shower head is fixed pretty high I m 1 8m and there was some space between my head and shower head Tap is not separate It was pretty quiet during my stay no noises heard Oh and bed sheets and towels are available free of charge there was a mistake on Booking com Buffet breakfast is good tea apple orange juice etc bacon eggs fruits watermelons as well potatos 
230877,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Our stay at hotel was unfortunately spoiled by early wake up call on Saturday We were staying at 4th floor and at 8am we have been woken up by very loud noises coming from the loft I think maintenance personnel had a clear out or something because it s sounded like a building site It didn t stop for an hour Except that incident hotel is very good , N A
230878,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, We couldn t have the breakfast at the hotel Came down on Sunday just after 10 breakfast until 10 30 on Sunday s and were confronted by a massive queue of people waiting for a table From what we could see and smell the breakfast must have been real good unfortunate there was no seating for the guests that night So we went out and had breakfast at a little cafe near the tube station , The bed was brilliant We actually pulled the bed cover to see the brand name for the mattress and we will buy it for at home 
230879,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Slightly small room than expected Lotion pump didn t work Not a big deal , Breakfast was lovely Bathroom clean and nice Bed comfy Temperature in room good 
230880,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, very slow service in restaurant at dinner waited a long time to order drinks and food At breakfast our table both times was dirty with used pre opened jams in the dish and used milk jugs Reception staff not great at understanding english or simple requests Was given a double room when my booking was for a twin a request I re iterated when checking in , very comfortable beds Fantastic location for tube museums shops etc

230882,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, When I came to pay they had already debited the full balance from my card even though I had only authorised 50 the night before I was on the 4th floor the small lift was a long walk through a dozen doors from reception it took an age to arrive and indeed move from floor to floor Not great , I arrived at midnight the night staff booked me in with no fuss 
230883,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Overall it was a lovely hotel to stay at however the bathroom looked slightly dated but nothing to complain about really, Beautiful hotel great decor room was lovely bed was so comfortable and great breakfast selection
230884,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, bathroom is far too small Bedrooms are very small beds too small if you book a standard double Expensive bar prices watch out for service charge on everything , Breakfast cleanliness of the room extra toiletries friendly staff location 
230885,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Language barrier with staff Had a problem with shower bath that we reported but due to poor communication the issue was not solved when stated Also asked for more pillows and these failed to arrive to our room When someone came to sort our issue it was nearly time for us to check out , Good location easily accommodated transport for attractions we wished to visit 
230886,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, We specifically asked for a double and was allocated a twin We were moved to a double but the two single mattresses kept drifting apart and we would fall between the gap There was a 15 min wait for breakfast at 9 40 No bacon Dirty tables all around Lift pass ran out at 10 30 rather than 11despite breakfast being served til 11 Resulting in having to queue at checkout to get an updated pass ,No Positive

230889,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The restaurant produced standard food which maybe could be turned up a notch in keeping with the hotel generally , The staff in the hotel went the extra mile to be accommodating of my daughter and husband who recently married and had a room makeover beyond the call of duty The general atmosphere of the hotel was also welcoming 
230890,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room temperature was too low even with heating on full power , Exceptional service from all staff members really welcoming and friendly Great sized room very comfortable Excellent breakfast selection 
230891,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Breakfast was very good The food was of good quality and the buffet was replenished regularly no hanging around waiting for things to be brought out of the kitchen

230895,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Only one thing the bacon was cold but concidering the amount of people at the time trying to get breakfast that can happen with the lids left open, Best stay ever

230897,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room 23 could have been better constant vibration from underneath the floor all night should have asked to change room really Also drinks at bar could have been cheaper but you are in London , Breakfast I
230898,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Double bed was two singles pushed together with a great lump down the middle Very small basic room with the biggest letdown being a lack of bedside cabinets We actually moved a chair to act as a bedside cabinet Breakfast was a real let down excellent choice but the full English breakfast was almost stone cold very disappointing, Good location and very friendly staff

230912,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The arrangement of rooms is odd Having to go up 2 floors by lift to then walk down stairs to get to my room after walking through five closed doors to get there was a struggle The restaurant had a field mouse running around There was also bedding from another room put directly on the stairs making it dangerous and not the sight you want to see The long island ice tea ordered at the bar was dilute poorly mixed and one of the most expensive I ve ever had , The location was good for my meeting

230917,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Bed was a little hard for me although I am used to a supersoft bed, Staff we re exceptional wish i could remember Filipa the manager and Nano I think must apologise you were all so helpful I could list all the great things with these but literally everyone the manager the guys at front desk and even the lady in the breakfast area went out of her way to be polite and helpful the area was really nice too and some great spots to eat although the hotel food was good x
230918,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Breakfast room was a little too warm temperature would have liked more hooks in the bathroom to hang towels These are very minor quibbles , Great room at a great price in a great location The staff were friendly the breakfast was expansive Overall a great place to stay and I would do so again

230922,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, I chose Radisson for ensuring the service standard Unfortunately that was what I hadn t experienced during my entire stay The housekeeper started to wake up the guests at 8 00 a m by knocking their doors and asking whether they need housekeeping service The hotel refused to extend the breakfast time on 1st of January resulted in the guests queuing in the corridor waiting for an cleaned table Inevitably it is no longer an enjoyable experience as all the staffs were overwhelmed , Location is good and the room size is surprisely big compares to European standard 
230923,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Friendly helpful staff Greeted very well minimum of fuss quickly to room Hotel completely refurbished to a high standard Quiet spacious de luxe room 
230924,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Delivery of our food order in the restaurant was slower than would have expected Staff were nice though, Friendly staff Nice welcome and reasonably priced
230925,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room was very small and there were no drawers or shelves Where are you supposed to put underwear jumpers etc And considering it was such a small room was there really a need for a freestanding glass and chrome desk taking up valuable space , The location of the hotel was great Close to a tube which didn t take long to get to any of the main sites in London and with a lot of cafes bars and restaurants nearby Breakfast was fabulous 
230926,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Parking in the area is an issue during the weekdays but is free in the weekend Saturday after 13 30 , The location was excellent just beside the underground station Breakfast was really nice and in convenient hours 
230927,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Hotel d cor amazing A little far out by taxi from London city centre but very well presented hotel and would recommend Staff friendly and bar area breakfast dining room and food perfect

230930,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Nice room but had no bedside lighting Hairdryer in drawer at opposite end of room to mirror , Good location close to Royal Albert Hall where we were going to see a show Friendly and helpful staff Good food and service Bathroom well equiped 
230931,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, We had a deluxe room which was fine however the bathroom was far too small This didn t have a significant effect on our stay but it is something to consider if you are of a large build , We stayed for two nights and the location was spot on for our visit requirements The staff were very friendly and helpful making us feel very welcome Our room was very clean and spacious The bed was extremely comfortable and we both slept well The room was well sound proofed Even the rush hour traffic during the morning was reduced to a whisper Breakfast was very good with a fair selection of hot and cold dishes Bar was cosy with a good selection of drinks Expect to pay London hotel prices though I would recommend this hotel and will stay here again if we are in this part of London for a visit 
230932,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The only thing was the room was very cold at night and in the morning It was a cold night but the heater blower didn t seem to work , Tour reception staff were fabulous especially a lady called Phippa Very accommodating and only too happy to help
230933,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Our room was TINY There was hardly any room for my partner and i to move let alone get changed and eat breakfast The mini bar was totally empty there was no bin no bedside tables and no soft lighting just spotlights on the ceiling Really disappointing I think I requested a quiet room so perhaps the rooms at the back of the hotel are smaller than all the others , The location the shower in our bathroom and the full english breakfast 
230934,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, The room 205 was great spacious and comfortable Staff were very helpful lovely breakfast with fresh healthy ingredients Wonderful location handy for museums buses and stations short walk to Hyde Park Good value 
230935,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, It s a bit of a rabbit warren and heard people with their cases go by in there morning But it s a hundred years old and it didn t really bother us at all , Classic welcoming hotel 2 min walk from Gloucester Road tube Several French patisserie for breakfast or a Byron for a quick burger Waitrose for some vital shopping Plenty of cabs down the Cromwell road A4 Nice cocktails in the hotel bar too Room spacious and comfy Staff a delight We d stay here again and recommend it

230937,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room configurations are a bit strange Decent size this time but bed stuck in an alcove so no way to get in and out of bed except by climbing on and off the end No space for any bedside table , Friendly staff especially in the restaurant Location Convenient for the tube Enjoyed the meal I had in the restaurant and breakfast is always good 
230938,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, It was hard to travel on the lift sometimes as the cleaning staff also needed to use it and there was limited space Unable to find movies on demand on my tv, Beautiful building and spotlessly clean Staff were courteous and helpful Breakfast was delicious with a good variety of food Bed was very comfortable
230939,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Air con not working in upgrade room which actually wasn t that big Therefore on cold day no warmth but maintenance guy v apologetic and he brought up additional heater straight away , Good location near V A tube and Kensington Nice bar and restaurant Staff helpful

230942,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, There was a problem with our booking for the first night of our stay and we had to spent one night In a small dark room which was very disappointing Fortunately the room was changed the following day and the hotel offered a complimentary meal The hotel arranged a taxi to take us to Heathrow with a 70 Fixed Charge which seemed far too expensive as the journey wasn t longer than 20 minutes , Excellent location Very comfortable hotel spacious room and a nice view at the front of the hotel The breakfast was delicious fresh products every day and the staff were very attentive I d recommend some complimentary sparkling wine to add to the buffet We stayed during the Christmas period and the hotels festive atmosphere and decorations added a special feel to our stay 
230943,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Booked double room got twin Hotel was full but bed changed to double quickly and efficiently Room could be a bit small if weather not good or longer stay than our 2 nights , Staff service location breakfast
230944,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The breakfast produce wasn t the greatest but edible , Lovely hotel well located in central London Single room was a bit small but more than adequate for one nights stay If I was staying longer I wouldn t chose a single room again 
230945,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, I do not like the rooms set around the corner of stairs just this not feel very good, Location is very good facilities is clean and fine and staff is patient and helpful 
230946,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The booking out at 11am was a bit early staff actually opened the door at the first time knock around 9am when the person in the other twin bed was asleep and then knocked a second time before it was time for us to vacate the room at 11am , The staff were very helpful and polite at reception when booking me in My twin room was near the lift Nice and comfortable room I had a good nights sleep I would visit the Radisson Blu Hotel again and would also recommend the hotel to others Good transport links 
230947,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Windows were loose and banged in the wind Unable to sleep There was no hesitation by staff to move me to another room the next day , Staff were excellent
230948,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Poor customer service in bar and at breakfast Housekeeping tried to access room at 8 50 am to clean despite us not having checked out, Great location and choice of rooms offered

230950,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Bathroom was a bit cramped Bar was very expensive 2 drinks were 20 which i thought a bit much , Staff were pleasant Room was great Very clean Very security conscious Breakfast was great 
230951,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, I ve been in cooler saunas than your bedrooms Do your guests a favour and save some energy Your hotel was so hot I would hesitate before choosing another of your chains hotels It also goes without saying that I will never stay in that particular one again , Location
230952,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Windows rattle and bang all night Bed was two singles pushed together not double as requested Took over a hour to have some tea bags delivered to the room Extractor fan in bathroom didn t work , Location good
230953,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Being honest the minestrone was the worst soup I ve ever tried in my entire live You shouldn t offer that in your menu If I had known its quality and taste I wouldn t have paid for it Too expensive ,No Positive
230954,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, One of my room is single glazed window which means it will be noise hope to replaced them , Great Location very close to local amenities restaurants Harrods etc and tube stations Heathrow is not far away as well Staff are both very polite and nice and knowledgeable very clean hotel This hotel has gym well equipped just unfortunately i don t have time to enjoy it during my stay 
230955,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, I would probably only stay in a single room as long as I didn t expect to be working from the hotel room as the single room was a bit small the bathroom is actually pretty good relative to the size of the room , Easy location perfect for museums around exhibition road or South Kensington area Tube entrance is right across the street Fluid process easy stay Good firm bed Reasonable sound insulation from the busy Cromwell Road especially once the heavy curtains are shut 
230956,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Over priced for the room expected better for 211 per night, Staff were very attentive and polite made us feel very welcome Perfect location for tube station to get to all London attraction
230957,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Our first room allocated had a noise problem air cond and was very small for a standard double No drawers for storing clothes and wardrobe had a mini fridge so blouses shirts trousers did not hang properly Staff were gracious checked out noise problem and subsequently moved us to another standard double room which was much more spacious and to our expectations for a 4 star Hope the 1st room is not allocated again as a double more like a single Thought the idea of having to pay extra for a second thimble full of gravy at dinner was unbelievable , Location excellent for museums and underground which was a short walk away for short ride to centre of London Staff very pleasant and helpful Breakfast excellent Hats off to cleaning staff who kept our room spic and span 
230958,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Only issue I found were the seats in the dining area A number of uneven tables chairs didn t make for the most comfortable eating experience , The staff were very friendly and helpful Facilities were clean
230959,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, My single room was quite compact I had asked for a quiet room and although I was not disturbed by other guests the generator was quite noisy all night , The staff the location the hotel generally
230960,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Beds are quite short and the mattresses a little too hard for my taste Road in front of the hotel is busy and can get quite noisy at certain times Not a very spacious room but that s London , Friendly and helpful staff Nice location especially if you re in to museums Good breakfast
230961,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, A very small part of the handle cap in the shower fell on my toe Would be nice to make sure that everything is safe and sound , Friendly staff great location and nice rooms 
230962,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The shower in my room was so small it was hard to wash properly , Vanderbilt is a good hotel at a convenient though not great location in London Great breakfast that was included The gym is not big but you can still get a decent workout 
230963,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room was roo small bathroom tiny and a bit jaded Looked at two rooms and chose one without a window Mattress was very uncomfortable , Nice bar area close to tube station Breakfast was a reasonable spread
230964,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Long waits to be served in the bar and restaurant Long queue for breakfast to only find virtually everything run out A hotel of this standard should surely be taking breakfast orders from the seated guest , A doable distance walking to The Royal Albert Hall
230965,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The only criticism was the bath took about 15 mins to empty not good when husband is waiting for a shower , Location was great for the venue we were going to Every thing was as expected service was fine 
230966,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, One of the best value hotels I ve stayed in Solo travellers often get a raw deal but booked a couple of months ahead and gave not much more than basic budget hotels Superb location short walk to V A Harrods etc Minutes from tube Lovely room and dining facilities Will stay here every time I am in London Look out for offers 
230967,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room was small No slippers and bathrobe , Very close to Gloucester Road Station Picadilly line goes to Heathrow terminals Close to Science Museum and Natural History Museum 
230968,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Bathroom so tiny my fianc struggled to be in there without having the door open to use the Toilet or to get dry Smallest bathroom I have ever seen and that was with a king size room Horrendous ques for breakfast 20 People deep Not what I expect from this hotel chain Excellent head waiter through meal then sadly he disappeared and we Got forgotten after our evening meal waited 30 mins even for any eye contact from a staff member I ordered 2x coffees and the bill only to be told another 10 mins later that the coffee machines were now shut down Sorry coffee was not available It was only 11 30 pm Dissapointing, Location great for royal Albert hall comfy bed spacious bedroom Tasty and plentiful breakfast once you could get seated Excellent reception service 
230969,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, breakfast was awful room was little more than a cupboard had to walk sideways into bathroom as door didn t open fully towel rail high above toilet and couldn t reach to replace towels Tiny shower cubicle Impressed that we were given a free drinks voucher until we saw the rooms 2 singles and realised why , Good Location friendly staff
230970,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Everyone was very welcoming A nice gesture was a birthday greeting and piece of cake for my husband s birthday Ashley assistant head waiter was very pleasant and helpful 
230971,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Friendly staff good clean room with safe and fridge I like real milk in my tea so the fridge was a bonus I booked at the winter rate so a free breakfast was included plenty to choose from and helpful serving staff Will stay there again 
230972,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room was terrible Outdated dirty carpet thw room is the smallest I ha e ever stayed in I could nearly touch both walls with the span or my arms The ensuitr toilet was barely usable due to the space confinement, Great Service when I checked in
230973,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Very dark room felt very enclosed with no view of anything not even a brick wall we had room service and the food was poor and room service did not answer the phone , Friendly staff
230974,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, On the day of our arrival the room wasn t ready at 3 pm as we had anticipated Admittedly it wasn t long after that but we had a busy schedule that day Insufficient space for clothes with no bedside tables to utilise , The location was very close to Gloucester Road Tube Station which allowed us a number of travel options Pleasant choice of breakfast options There was a maze of corridors and stairs which was a change from convention 
230975,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The lift was a squeeze especially with luggage and as we were on the fourth floor the waiting for the lift was irritating , Great location Very friendly and helpful staff Very good food in the restaurant 
230976,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Somehow inexperienced staff I did not like the fact that the person who checked us in pretended to upgrade us to a deluxe room for free and then said he would need to charge us 30 for the baby cot I had requested Meanwhile I had received an email from booking com informing me that upgrades to deluxe rooms were available for 30 Not very nice trying to trick your guests And so bluntly ,No Positive
230977,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Excellent customer relations We arrived early and asked to leave our luggage but we were told a room was available and we could check in immediately Also had a room upgrade 
230978,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The room was a little small , The staff were excellent Very helpful Very close to Gloucester Road tube station easy to get to and from Heathrow A breakfast on the go great if getting an early flight 
230979,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Bar staff was stressed and did not want to encourage people to stay Bathroom ridiculously small , Comfy room and bed Concierge staff very helpful 
230980,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Entering into the hotel lobby it looked fine but after that our experience was very poor particularly that this hotel is rated as four star no way We had booked two separate rooms but the reception staff tried to fob us off with a twin room Both of the rooms allocated were red hot and we were unable to open the windows of either room to let some fresh air in Reception were contacted to try and rectify the problem one room had the heating adjusted down the other remained red hot despite reception being notified again and asked to attend to it while we were at our evening meeting so a sleepless night in oven like conditions The rooms were dusty so cleanliness not of the best standard and very small in size so much so it was a squeeze along the side of the bed to close the curtains as the mattress was plonked onto a wooden box base The reception staff had a take it or leave it attitude You would be best looking elsewhere for a better service Premier Inn is a better stay and the rooms are cheaper I have stayed at Radisson Blu hotels before the last time in Norway and the service was excellent Avoid this one go elsewhere just as we will be , The hotel was close to our venue 
230981,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Tried to eat in the hotel on one occasion but told restaurant closed for a large party Prior notification would have been helpful the restaurant sign was still outside even though no one was being seated However staff on reception gave helpful suggestions as to where to eat out , Friendly helpful staff Everyone said hello Breakfast staff very efficient Single rooms small but well equipped Air con very effective Not as disturbed by traffic noise as I expected to be 
230982,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Bad experience with three clowns working behind the bar on 23rd Slow service sorry very slow no peanuts available or tidbits one staff member said we had seen another staff member put a large plastic container with peanuts under the bar Eventually we were served peanuts Bar started closing at 10 55 as a resident in a hotel in the UK I would expect alcohol to be served somewhat later than that After some discussion with the barman we eventually got another round about 11 15pm Second night 24th same problem with peanuts my friend called the restaurant manager a very tall gentleman who immediately solved the problem I was then served a pint of Picotini lager withe about 30mm of froth on top I politelye asked could it be topped up to be told it was to the line On another empty glass the barman was unbale to show me a line he then topped up the glass and slammed it on the bar and disappeared This night there was no notice of times up all bar staff simply disappeared about 11 00 pm leaving 40 plus rugby supporters devoid of drink Frankly if those three young men don t like working behind a bar or being in the service industry then they should get out out of it Their attitude reflects badly on the hotel , the restaurant food the check in staff the restaurant staff room 08
230983,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, I gave up trying to find news channels on the tv in my room , 2 minutes walk from Gloucester Road tube lovely bedroom bathroom comfortable seating in reception area bar very attentive polite friendly and approachable staff 
230984,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Tidy polite and quaint A quintessential positive English experience Fantastic breakfast and lovely atmosphere Updated yet true to authentic roots I hope to come back with my family 
230985,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Staff where really helpful and nothing was to much trouble if you need directions maps they will print them out The location was brilliant close to underground bus stops shops food outlets Plenty of choice for breakfast which helps when travelling with children 
230986,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, I only had issue with bar staff when they try to overcharge me for drinks but was resolved, location was perfect breakfast was good and reception staff was efficient
230987,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The drinks in the bar are very pricey which really annoyed me , Room was lovely very quiet very comfortable The breakfast was excellent loads of choice and attentive waiting staff 
230988,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, A hand towel rail near the sink would be desirable Didn t like the bright overhead bedside light would have preferred a lamp , Conveniently located welcoming staff well appointed room everywhere very clean good dinner excellent breakfast 
230989,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Windows could not open Curtains were frayed one bed had a double quilt folded over double in a double size quilt cover which made it hot and uncomfortable , The staff were excellent friendly polite and helpful Food was lovely 
230990,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The hotel seemed more interested in welcoming me on the television screen rather than giving me access to the television and radio channels , It was a well equipped room for a single traveller and I really appreciated that it had a bath as well as a shower Staff were very friendly and professional
230991,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room tired in need of a refurb Bathroom nice but not as clean as it should have been Despite having credit card authorised to include extras at check in I was initially refused breakfast unless I paid cash I was told I didn t have any credit left on my room account , Staff helpful polite good location just 2 mins from Gloucester Rd tube station Free Wi Fi was appreciated 
230992,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, By comparison to other Radisson hotels at which we have stayed in Europe this was disappointing The cost of hotel accommodation in London has become ridiculously expensive and quality of service and accommodation at this hotel would not make me want to rush back Other Radisson hotels are less expensive and better eg D sseldorf Milan Dublin Sligo etc , The brevity of the stay The location 
230993,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Confusion over the 15 credit for the restaurant being taken off the bill Food Service on Saturday the 10th in the restaurant was unbelievably slow , Restaurant Food was amazing when it arrived eventually 
230994,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Only down point breakfast was a buffet and Luke warm but by no means did that detract Room was a little small but well appointed and had all things needed, The hotel was lovely staff all helpful esp given my mum and medical needs nothing was to much effort Breakfast was a wide variety of all things Fab 
230995,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Friendly front of house knowledgeable and polite Delicious breakfast good choice full English along with choice of cereals fruit etc Gluten free bread available on request I asked for a quiet room and it was really quiet The hotel has a homely feel to it definitely a pleasant experience 
230996,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The only thing I didn t like was it seemed the double bed was two single mattresses, The hotel was friendly clean and welcoming The staff were very accommodating too
230997,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, The room was so small I could literally not get the suitcase between the end of the bed and the wall I had to push it over the bed and I had to squeeze through sideways Absolutely tiny and not worth the money even for central London 
230998,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Excellent location for Royal Albert Hall History Museum and Science Museum Lovely hotel with helpful staff Room was spacious and clean although the bathroom was a bit of a squeeze Good facilities in the room including tea and coffee fridge and water although a few complimentary biscuits would have been nice for the price I paid Food from the bar was also very nice although drinks were a bit pricey 
230999,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room service was poor on the first morning I tried to telephone for about forty minutes nobody answered the phone Eventually reception rang to tell me they had tried to ring our room for about half an hour which was a blatant lie We got our breakfast eventually The TV reception was poor the shower temperature was poor as soon as somebody flushed the toilet etc the water was either cold or boiling In my opinion it was not value for money but I must say that the staff were kind and friendly If you run a busy hotel like that please make sure the toilets are working please make sure you have enough staff No I would not go again , I liked the friendliness of the staff 
231000,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room was a broom closet The bed was obviously meant for a child and was so narrow I had trouble sleeping When I finally did get to sleep I was woken up three hours later by the continuous slamming of the fire door in the hallway , Good location for my needs Breakfast was decent 
231001,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room 28 specifically was foistered upon my 82 year old mother It is to be blunt a cupboard tidy clean but tiny Also the bar manager was over officious we paid cash for overpriced drinks 4 50 for a tiny bottle of lemonade The bar manager upon our exit asked if we would like to pay for our drinks via our room bill we had already paid cash he needs to sharpen up before hurling accusations in a crowded bar Also when a guinness pump exists I expect draught guinness not tinned , location and a good breakfast 
231002,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, I was disappointed to note that 12 5 gratuity was added to drinks at the bar that myself and my 13 year old son had in the evening we had the same drinks in the day and no gratuity was added The bar staff didn t do anything extra in the evening to earn it Leave gratuity off bar bills unless its for a large group or you are taking the drinks to the table Just a small point but it did frustrate a bit , The hotel was very well positioned for The Royal Albert Hall and the staff were excellent overall a great experience
231003,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Great location all hotel staff lovely Clara on reception was fantastic couldn t do enough for you Breakfast was fantastic was everything you need or wanted Overall fantastic relaxed hotel in central London 
231004,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room was a little basic but fair for the price , Really close to the tube station Breakfast was very good quality Good shower Not too much traffic noise at night 
231005,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The customer service is really poor except for the staff serving breakfast While the hotel claims to offer room service there was no response to telephone calls after 11pm for room service After 45 minutes when someone answered my call they said it s nearly 12 and as such we cannot offer you any food It runs contrary to the information they provide which says that room service and a menu is available from 11pm to 5am The toilet area was incredibly small and there was a really foul smell in the bathroom , The location is excellent The rooms are clean and have all the necessary amenities 
231006,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, The breakfast buffet has shrunk a bit in terms of choice and space in the dining area since my last visit but was still adaquate for my needs on this visit , Upgraded to a deluxe single room on the ground floor which was spacious and quiet with a good sized bathroom Felt safe and cozy as I was travelling on my own The front desk staff were very quick and helpful at check in when I needed help with my bags and getting a taxi on departure 
231007,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Hotel is without handicapped access and has 2 foot high tubs over which a handicapped person has to climb , Staff was most helpful to my handicapped husband Restaurant is excellent Hotel is historic and recently renovated It is very clean and the mattresses are excellent 
231008,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Room smaller than expected and in need of updating carpet a bit grubby Bed smaller than a double I would think Traffic noise prohibited a good night s sleep , Really friendly and helpful staff The bar restaurant and other shared facilities were very stylish and clean Breakfast was amazing Nice large en suite bathroom to room with lovely toiletries 
231009,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, My room I booked should have had a trouser press and tea and coffee making facilities and a better tv than what I had but had none of these, Restaurant was nice good selection of food breakfast was very nice
231010,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt,No Negative, Kindness and concern of staff I thought I had lost my passport and found a guiet corner to search my case My friend and I have stayed with you before andwill aagain 
231011,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Bed was lopsided and uncomfortable Was told my room had been upgraded and if so would hate to see the room I would have been given , Waitresses in restaurant were very friendly and kind 
231012,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, We asked for a room at the front but were given a room at the back there was a very large and noisy generator which went all night and it was very hard to sleep The room was not as nice as last year but cost 200 more , The location the friendly staff the clean room and the bottles of water every day 
231013,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Lift was inconveniently far from lobby and very slow but minor problem for other than the disabled , The willing help provided by Pierre and other staff to resolve problems encountered 
231014,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, Carpet in room badly stained and loose door on cupboard spoilt an otherwise good impression , Very good location for the Royal Albert Hall friendly helpful staff Generally high standard of decor Convenient bar and restaurant
231015,Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, We made our booking about 2 months prior to our stay We booked a twin room We arrived at around 4pm 1 hour after check in time and our room was not ready We were offered 2 single rooms which I thought was a pretty ludicrous offer considering we had booked a twin room oh and they were so kind to advice that this was at no extra cost When we were finally given a room we then discovered that there was no iron We reported this to reception and the housekeeper had to check our room to see that there was no iron it was obvious to see that there wasn t an iron anywhere before she then fetched an iron , Not far from the underground with quite a few bars and restuarants nearby
