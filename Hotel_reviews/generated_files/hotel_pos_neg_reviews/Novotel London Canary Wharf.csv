179477,Novotel London Canary Wharf, There wasn t anything I didn t like during our stay I m not sure that I would stay over in Canary Wharf if I didn t need to be on that side of London for something in particular That has more to do with the area than the hotel though I generally prefer to stay more central , The hotel is easy to get to by clipper or by tube DLR It is really clean and classy and the staff are brilliant Super efficient and helpful The facilities on offer are very good and the rooms and bar restaurant have excellent views of London I have never stayed in such a quiet room before and the bed was very very comfortable Unfortunately we were there for Ride London 100 so didn t have time to use the pool and had to leave very early in the morning 5 45am so didn t get to make the most of what the hotel had to offer Our room rate didn t include breakfast but the hotel put on a complimentary breakfast for people taking part in the event which I thought was a really nice touch They also have an outdoor store for bikes which was invaluable to us 
179478,Novotel London Canary Wharf, The breakfast the staff were not attentive when items ran out and the seats were not comfortable as it was part of the bar area, Rooftop bar for drinks in the eve
179479,Novotel London Canary Wharf, I don t really want to say anything negative because we really enjoyed our time at the hotel but if I can offer a suggestion I think there should be robes and slippers in the room or perhaps available on request also a shower cap in the room especially having waterfall showers I would have appreciated that But overall We loved our stay , I loved the breakfasts such a variety and quality ingredients this made me very happy in the morning plus the view in the restaurants are spectacular and a warm wake up in the morning Thumbs up we were treated very well staff very courteous and the Interior design very stimulating to look at very well put together another thumbs up 
179480,Novotel London Canary Wharf, Sauna was not working Not information given about hotel much Food horrible I don t recommend anyone stay at this hotel I am so disappointed , View
179481,Novotel London Canary Wharf, double room only has one toothbrush and one slipper Shower is slippery and reminder is not easy to see Also I used debit card as deposit and staff said two or three hours I can receive refund But after two days I still not receive my refund , breakfast good beautiful view from room 
179482,Novotel London Canary Wharf, A man that was in the entrance of the roof terrace didn t let us get in the terrace saying that it was was fully booked We went inside to find a place but we couldn t find anything so we went back to the terrace as I had seen there were many empty tables There was a nice lady who saw the card of the room and told us we are their guests so we can enter Maybe the man should ask if we stay in the hotel or not and let us enter so not ruin our experience Receptionists were really nice , Brand new hotel nice view
179483,Novotel London Canary Wharf, I honestly don t know I guess the only thing I didn t like was having to leave at the end because I had to go and am not made of money haha, What didn t I like it was amazing a pleasant surprise and with the lovely views and kind staff it was brilliant Loved the ability of the rooftop bar and events and the area always seems good although i was only dashing from and to the station The facilities of having a sauna swimming pool gym was a really great surprise being included but just a shame I wasn t able to use them this time which is why for those two I couldn t rate a huge 5 star smile The staff were so nice and helpful either answering all questions or the ability when signing in to have two cards as one is used for power to keep the hotel more environmentally friendly which was a good thought and a great idea The room was to my surprise just lovely two great window views a nice clean bathroom which for me had a rainforest type shower if you know what I mean the bed was comfy and relaxing the TV was huge and I mean huge and other aspects such as a mini fridge charging usb ports power ports the different drink options etc just really added to everything Food for breakfast was good with staff to give you needed teas while you use the buffet and overlook a window seat to the sights of London 
179484,Novotel London Canary Wharf, There was nothing unlikeable I didn t like that I didn t have enough time to visit the swimming pool and gym as the pictures looked really nice online Next time I will though , The staff are so lovely at this hotel and are very accommodating If you met a member of staff in the lift they were always so courteous In addition to this the roof top bar is great and the decoration of the hotel is lovely and modern with great views from your room across London I would love to visit here again 
179485,Novotel London Canary Wharf, There was one gripe which got sorted out very promptly When we arrived back after our day out the bathroom had a very foul smell coming from the drainage We called the desk and they sent someone right away who fixed it on the spot in a matter of minutes , Upgraded room got a fantastic almost pent house style skyline view of London The check in assistant was extremely informative and friendly making the checking in process very relaxing and easy going It felt like luxury but very welcoming and not exclusive Will definitely stopping there angain
179486,Novotel London Canary Wharf, There is a lot of construction in the area so the hotel is a bit hard to get to at the moment This is obviously not the hotel s fault , Very efficient check in and check out Great bathroom and toiletries 
179487,Novotel London Canary Wharf, Pool could be warmer Conditioner in room changing room Night light for bathroom Perhaps provide bins on floors for guests to leave rubbish , Location Location location Pool great addition Staff friendly Fridge in room Wifi 55 tv Water replenished daily Able to extend stay for good price 
179488,Novotel London Canary Wharf, Paid extra for the executive room which was advertised as having landmark views At arrival was given a room on the East side of the building facing away from London with no landmark views and the only way to have landmark views was to move out of executive room but we were not refunded the difference Saw complaints that the restaurant was open to public and thought this was an unfair complaint however upon trying to go to dinner we were told that no tables were open the rest of the evening and limited times were available the following night Staff often seemed to have the attitude of sorry we can t help you , Fantastic views nice facilities and good breakfast 
179489,Novotel London Canary Wharf, The staff didn t inform us that the toilet glass frosted when a button was pressed no sign in room to say this my girlfriend could not go to the toilet with me being able to see through the glass so spent the night with stomach pain when I told the staff on checking out they found this funny Very upsetting experience for both myself and new girlfriend ,No Positive
179490,Novotel London Canary Wharf, I would ve liked a mirror in the room not just in the bathroom for hairdrying Bed pillows were unusually large and uncomfortable Hot breakfast was luke warm to cold both days , Amazing views Roof terrace is fantastic Rooms were bright and clean Hotel was peaceful and quiet Reception staff were polite and helpful Being allowed to leave luggage for free after checkout was a huge bonus Fog screen in the shower was very entertaining Anniversary card and complimentary truffles upon arrival Breakfast was good terrific range Lots of choice 
179491,Novotel London Canary Wharf, The only proper issue I can think of was that the lifts took ages but that is understandable as there is 39 floors however there were four lifts Also the keys could be a bit of a pain One last minor problem for me was that the tv had limited channels and gave you no tv guide option but that s minor and i only watched the tv before breakfast and before I went to sleep , The bed was very comfortable with a great view of London from just lying there The check out time and breakfast time was also very good nice and late Breakfast was great with lots of choices and had amazing views of London as did the roof top lounge Overall great stay with great nearby public transport The hotel is very modern
179492,Novotel London Canary Wharf, Little bit out of the way for us but depends on where you are intending to visit , Fantastic views from the top floor restaurant and bar Everywhere spotless Friendly efficient staff
179493,Novotel London Canary Wharf, The minibar should have been free considering how much you pay for a night stay Plus the prices for the drinks and crisps were extremely high I have stayed in many other top hotels and the minibar has always been free ,No Positive
179494,Novotel London Canary Wharf, Parking a 10 to 12 minute walk to get to the parking absolutely not convenient for those traveling by car I made my reservation through booking com upon arrival while checking in I was asked to pay a lot more than what I had booked for That was because the check in person was charging me based on the hotel fares not booking com fares it was then solved after talking to someone else anyway that made my check in take a long time Booked the executive room based on reviews of outstanding service and concierge Got none of it absolutely nothing different from anyone else I have to say though it might be a good deal if you are in for the 6 8pm free buffet Other than that don t waste your money Tried the restaurant on the 38th floor on the first night the rooftop was closed for a private event which totally let us down It was to me a good idea to be at a hotel with a rooftop bar So we stayed at the restaurant area it did have nice views but service was somewhat strange on the first night but OK on the second day we went back the next afternoon and it took them a while to serve us as they were having a team meeting in the middle of the restaurant I personally like staying in nice hotels not only for their facilities but specially because of good service Based on reviews here I thought that was what I was going to get This Novotel has a long way to go , New hotel with nice views quite spacious for London standards and a nice restaurant Breakfast was good too 
179495,Novotel London Canary Wharf, As fantastic as the staff were there wasn t enough of them to make the service 10 10 I d say at best the service purely due to lack of staff was 3 10 and all our party said the same On talking to others in the bar it was the only negative Not one guest looked happy with wait times on drinks and food but they never actually stopped for a minute In fact one waiter was there at breakfast after we left him at 1 40am the night before It s a real shame there wasn t more staff around as the ones that were left a fantastic impression on us and would prompt a return visit , Never stayed anywhere with staff as eager to please Every one of them were happy and helpful and smiled as soon as they saw you 
179496,Novotel London Canary Wharf, The walk from the tube station was a little far and confusing especially at night but nothing major just ask if you get stuck The breakfast seemed expensive at 17 a person , The location was excellent the staff were polite friendly and helpful and as we arrived were informed that our room had been upgraded for free Definitely book an executive room if you want an epic view 
179497,Novotel London Canary Wharf,No Negative, A very modern hotel excellent facilities Funky d cor amazing views from the Bokan at the top and all rooms Spot on service very accommodating loved the whole feel of the hotel restaurant and bar they have got it just right for the modern traveller Easy access to the whole of London by bus rail or taxi We used the water taxi 100m up the road this was the quickest route into the centre 15 mins and the most fun 
179498,Novotel London Canary Wharf, I booked a twin room but the gap between the beds was like a pack of cards which made the twin arrangement non existent Also the staff while helpful were hampered by the use of tablets to check people in it didn t really work , Comfortable bed with USB chargers head side which is always a nice bonus fridge with complimentary water was good on a warm night 
179499,Novotel London Canary Wharf, booked specifically for the roof bar and was told no need to book then told we couldn t go there as we hadn t booked other bar was far to hot with no air con and every seat reserved so had to go elsewhere for drinks, the staff were very friendly
179500,Novotel London Canary Wharf, Lights were too bright Bathroom too small Did nt agree with the pre authorisation Do you not trust me to pay my bill , Rooftop bar was great Service was good
179501,Novotel London Canary Wharf, View from the hotel room was unfortunately not matched expectations DBL room had one robe one toothbrush etc It was a suite executice , The restaurant is top grade Dinner service and food were Superlux View from restaurant was wonderful and the kitchen at restaurant would go back there anytime after hotel is quite new and clean
179502,Novotel London Canary Wharf, Room key which was needed to operate lift and to gain access to pool and gym was temperamental , Very smart and stylish new hotel within easy walking distance of Canada square Excellent sauna Pool on the small side but very clean Excellent breakfast buffet 
179503,Novotel London Canary Wharf, Zero hotel parking Extremely limited street parking First night drove around for 30 minutes looking for a spot Ridiculous Also room air conditioner did not work very well Room at night was very warm , Location and modern style of hotel
179504,Novotel London Canary Wharf, Cooked breakfast was cold Reception check in slow as only 2 staff on duty, The rooms were in excellent condition clean large TV fridge and fantastic views Location ideal 
179505,Novotel London Canary Wharf, You could see into the toilet from the room as it was glass see through so my partner was watching my poo from the bed very awkward hopefully not all rooms are designed like that , n a
179506,Novotel London Canary Wharf, I can t find a single fault, Immaculately clean Fantastic service Amazing attention to detail Great location and the views from 39th floor were absolutely amazing
179507,Novotel London Canary Wharf, Dressing Gowns would have been a welcomed extra for use in room adding comfort following a well earned shower Roof Top Terrace as reviewed was amazing however if you are not a smoker this could cause you not to hang around Smokers were free to smoke anywhere on the terrace which spoiled the experience As a non smoker having someone sat next to us smoking was off putting and feel that the terrace should be free for all to enjoy Smokers should have an area away from everyone else should they need to have a smoke keeping the rest of the terrace smoke free I asked for 2 Jack Daniel s and coke total cost was 22 50 be warned the bar staff will automatically pour a double shot unless you tell them otherwise JD cost 7 00 each and a small bottle of coke was 3 00 20 00 then we had 12 5 service charge added 2 50 , We stayed on the 20th floor The room was clean well presented The views looked out over the docklands with Canary Wharf to one side and a clear view across the Thames towards the Shard the other Bathroom was clean with plenty of towels Ironing board Iron and safe as standard in the closet The bed was very comfortable with a selection of pillows the little grey ones are particularly good when sat up reading The restaurant and dining area was on the 37th Floor with the roof top terrace bar on the 38th The restaurant had beautiful views across the Thames and surrounding area staff very accommodating and the coffee was free flowing Roof Top Terrace Bar was fantastic the view is spectacular perfect for the panoramic photoshoots great ambiance and buzzing feeling while sat in the sun having a drink 
179508,Novotel London Canary Wharf, This isn t a criticism on you are your hotel But I didn t like the frosted see through glass shower panel my better half uses the toilet a lot during the night and the whole bedroom light up when she put the bathroom light on it didn t matter if it was frosted or not This won t prevent me from staying here again but I ll leave the wife home next time , The staff were so helpful and friendly and couldn t do enough for us
179509,Novotel London Canary Wharf, twice the staff tried to come into the room whilst we were in and on the saturday morning there was a leak in the bathroom maintenance were very good but spoilt our plan for a lie in lol, Lovely clean comfy bed 55 tv great wi fi
179510,Novotel London Canary Wharf, On the arrival the check in was a mess and the service atmosphere was monotone and like a dull machine There were no bath towels in the room The breakfast was served on the 37th floor and again the view was amazing But nobody gave me any notice and it was difficult to know whether I shoud just take a seat or wait someone to show me to the table When I was finally shown to the table nobody was interested to take my order for coffee The next morning I ordered breakfast from the room service A few items from my order was missing The service concept is not ready at this hotel and I will not return , The room was nice and clean and the view was amazing 
179511,Novotel London Canary Wharf, The bathroom windows were very dirty from room into the shower and bathroom itself could have bin better cleaned and also around the bed tables besides that good, Loved it nice room the breakfast buffet was great bar had great fun staff and the view was one of a kind awesome great room service girl and councillor just fantastic staff all around and almost everything was great

179513,Novotel London Canary Wharf, The room size is absolutely shocking SUPER small and overrated for what you get Perhaps you pay for the views only but I was very disappointed with the room was expecting more for a deluxe room and for the price , The food in this hotel is absolutely stunning it is brand new and very clean 
179514,Novotel London Canary Wharf, The breakfast on delivery was cold when delivered to room there was a charge 5 each , Croissants were beautiful so much flavour Bacon was nice and crispy Toast and selection of jams was great poached eggs were cooked to perfection 
179515,Novotel London Canary Wharf, Unnecessary charge taken from my card and taking a long time to be released back to me, Bed was very comfortable decor in the room was very modern and stylish
179516,Novotel London Canary Wharf, The concierge when i checked in wasn t very friendly Shorter guy with glasses It was late but still Everyone else was friendly there , The rooftop restaurant And swing in the lobby

179521,Novotel London Canary Wharf, That all Novotels are not like this, The amazing friendly staff Comfy bed Fantastic breakfast Excellent quality Lovely rooftop bar Edgy design So not the traditional Novotel thank god 
179522,Novotel London Canary Wharf, I loved everything, I absolutely loved to start into the day with fresh fruit not just the typical weird fruit salad no Fresh strawberries avocado and everything one needs for a healthy start And all this at 37th floor with a view over London 
179523,Novotel London Canary Wharf, Nothing not to like , We stayed for a 2 night stay for my partners birthday it was the BEST customer service we ve ever received at a hotel not to forget the most beautiful hotel we ve stayed at also I m confused as to why it s a 4 star not 5 That star needs to be added on that s for sure We also can t thank Anna enough for all her acknowledgement effort she made us feel so welcomed as well as all the other brilliant staff we got an upgraded room birthday card chocolates We were also shocked in a good way when we found out we were put in the VIP lounge in the bar Which made our night even more special for us There s so much to see do in this Hotel we barely even went out of the hotel we decided we preferred staying in We relaxed by the most beautiful pool there s also a modern unique lounge on the 1st floor that you can play games have coffee in And you can also head up to the Restaurant Bar Terrace which is amazingly laid out with beautiful views This hotel will have your whole stay planned out it s the only hotel we ve stayed at that actually has a lot to do see inside We re so excited to come back in a few months for our anniversary as we know it will be the best Hotel to stay at for such an special occasion It s also the most perfect location close to tube station very close to food places also a shopping mall What more could you possibly want Apart from wanting to live in this Hotel 
179524,Novotel London Canary Wharf, There was nothing to fault Maybe a couple more Nespresso pods would have been nice , Even though the hotel is brand new and only been open for a couple of months everything worked superbly well The staff in particular were exemplary and very warm and welcoming 
179525,Novotel London Canary Wharf, Canary Wharf is still developing and alternative bars or restaurants in the area are somehow limited , Hotel just recently opened and staff motivation is high No ambitions to appear like a luxury boutique no expensive materials amenities or design But everything you would expect from a 4 star business hotel Bokan restaurant on the 38th floor is excellent awesome food great cocktails magnificent view Thumps up for this place

179529,Novotel London Canary Wharf, The bar staff We were told to move around the bar various times as they were unable to accommodate for paying guests due to reservations despite me phoning up beforehand to ensure we had a table and was told you can just simply walk in and get a table The bar staff was extremely slow and took 30 minutes to make us a cocktail and when asked if he could mix our favourite cocktail he simply refused abruptly and demanded us to choose strictly from the menu or he won t be making a drink , The beds were extremely comfortable The swimming pool along with saunarium was excellent and overall staff co operation was brilliant 
179530,Novotel London Canary Wharf, Fitness centre was still work in progress , Fantastic room with stunning views over central London Bathroom was excellent and bed was very comfy Staff were fantastic and very professional Swimming pool and sauna were fantastic Atmosphere was fantastic Didn t hear anyone in the other rooms or outside in the corridor Location was excellent
