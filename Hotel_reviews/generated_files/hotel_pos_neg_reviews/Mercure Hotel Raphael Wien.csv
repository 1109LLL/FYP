501337,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, We didn t understand the term privileged room We booked more expensive room because of the extra large double bed All the other options looked like there are two or more beds apart from each other in the room not clear on your website So for us as a couple this was the only option The bed was comfortable yes but also split in the middle so it didn t feel like something special We were told by check in that we had a privileged room and that meant wifi for free and free access to the mini bar Wifi was super slow and in the mini bar there were 2 waters 1 coca cola and 1 orange juice That was a bit funny I think the bar should have other options and maybe we should be told that we have non alcoholic drinks for free and the rest we pay That would be ok But to put there what was in there and not give another option while calling the room privileged was to laugh about So we called the reception and asked for two beers which we would pay We didn t have to pay but the beer arrived totally warm so we had to wait anyway till the next day so that it would cool in the fridge , Super great breakfast and friendly stuff 
501338,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, Reconstruction works across the street where was my room window was a little bit noisy , The staff was friendly helping me with all my requests ironing drinking water etc Mariahilfer Strasse and metro station nearby and a nice surprise for me Josef Haydn house in the neighbor quarter 
501339,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, The hotel lady should ask the customer to see wether he will need the invoice or not when check out but not to say it is too late when the customer signed the bill and said the customer should ask her in advance It is shown she didn t care too much , no special at all
501340,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, It was a bit far not as close to Museum Quartier as in the description It was very cold in the room One cannot open the windows for fresh air instead a cold air system is running all the time even with air conditionate off The gym has only 3 gadgets no soap no bathrobe for a 4stars hotel , Great choice for breakfast 
501341,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, No proper restaurant for evening meal Having to pay 20 euros a night for the balcony to smoke on seemed a bit steep Toiletries were hit and miss No astray on balcony had to ask for one even then wasn t emptied at all Telephone in room not working, Handy for the shops and the metro Very clean room Handy for the balcony to smoke on Bathrobes slippers iron kettle and coffee machine Toiletries supplied Staff friendly helpful
501342,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, The housekeeping service is not as good as my expectation and they forgot to do this or that everyday the wifi signal is just so so , The facilities have been well upgraded and the staff service improved a lot comparing to those of my last lodging there last year 
501343,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, The car parking its is very difficult to enter the car parking because it is has very small entrance, Very clean room nice comfortable bed close to the metro station
501344,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, nothing everything was just perfect , One of the best hotel breakfast we have ever had great choise Very comfortable bed quit room friendly staff we can just highly recommend this place and will stay here again for sure 
501345,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, Staff not very friendly Breakfast was not the best and the coffee mugs were rinsed and not properly washed No airport shuttle bus , Hotel was clean and room comfortable 
501346,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien,No Negative, Quiet area within the G rtel Vienna s second ring Close to underground tram and Wien Westbahnhof station that has direct connection to the airport by bus 45 min 8 There is a Lidle at 100 m Modern spacious and very comfortable room with fridge and excellent bed Good value for money 
501347,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, Allot of drunk and narcotic people in the train station near to the hotel I assume its because there is some help center for those people over there Not very nice to walk in this side of the hotel better the other side to the main street Only German channels in the TV Expensive breakfast There is not bar in the hotel although they are pictures of it in websites , Nice little hotel Very clean Excellent value for money comfortable rooms close to shopping street and super markets The staff is GREAT very nice and very helpful The breakfast is amazing although for my opinion a bit expensive 16 euro 
501348,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, Only tea available bad pillow trying to sell you a specific sightseeing tour breakfast is super expensive, Air conditioning really working not common in Austria very clean
501349,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, The air conditioning failed to work We complained and were informed that the technical person had gone home it was 18 00 and there were no other rooms It was very warm The following day the air conditioning was still not working and it was only when we insisted strongly that they agree to move our room the following day which they did When leaving I complained and we received a ten euro rebate 3 of the bill All in all a very poor response and very in Austrian, They finally changed our room after twibdays without air conditioning
501350,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, Heavy room doors that led to lots of slamming doors on closing not great late at night and early morning which resulted in disturbed sleep on both nights in the hotel , The breakfast at the hotel was really good with lots of variety The only waitress was fantastic too 
501351,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, I booked this hotel as part of my honeymoon trip around central Europe First of all we advised the hotel that we were honeymooners and they did not have any kind detail for us not even a sweeet or a congrat s card Breakfast rate is very expensive 16 euros Metro stop 7 minutes walking from the hotel, I would say that the room was comfortable and clean 
501352,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, Wifi connection was average and cable TV reception didn t work at all in our room , The bed quilt and pillows were amazing It s only a 40 minute walk to downtown Vienna Bathroom was big and clean lots of hot water 
501353,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien,No Negative, We were there only for an overnight stay to change trains The hotel had a modern European design By this time we had become accustomed to B B S
501354,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, I extended my stay by one day adding the night of 16 May so there were two bookings done through bookings com However on the morning of 16 May there was a notice on my door which meant that Housekeeping was not aware that I d be staying longer They also didn t replenish the sugar and coffee cr me capsules , The room was spacious and comfortable thank you for upgrading us because of longer stay The hotel was also close to the Underground and other public transport systems and was really quiet which worked well for business purposes And the Nespresso machine in the room was a nice surprise 
501355,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien,No Negative, The hotel was just beside Westbahnhof where an airport bus comes in so that was perfeect The hotel was very welcoming and comfortable and great value for money We did not have breakfast as 16euro was too much Great public transport and cafes and restaurants nearby A perfect stay 
501356,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien,No Negative, This hotel is located in a quieter part of Vienna and set a bit far out from the main part of town Nice newly renovated rooms with good TV nice bathrooms and Tea Coffee kettle in room option Our room was next to the lift so definitely wasn t quiet and as you were trying to sleep the sounds of the lift were audible So was the people coming and going The staff are friendly and provide the information for us to travel around Vienna 
501357,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, The problem was in staff and parking the girl on reception I think was first time in this hotel and she didn t know exactly where the parking in the hotel is situated The parking place was not ok for our normal car because parking places are ok for only very small cars and we had to park our car in the nearest hotel And the second thing concerning staff in the morning while we were wearing our jeans to our room came without knocking or just with very quiet knocking girl because she decided that it is time for housekeeping , The room was very clean and modern It was just perfect The hotel is situated on a quiet and nice street 
501358,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, Internet doesn t work in the rooms after many requests it still did not work They should not say internet works in rooms as it works only in lobby ,No Positive
501359,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, a Most receptionists never acknowledged guests on their way in and out but kept head low or on computer screen Eye contact and greetings make a difference b I would add some pastries for breakfast like croissants , a Cleanliness and facilities were very good b Breakfast very good and decent timings c Close to transport restaurants etc d Free WiFi e Luggage room available 
501360,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, The neighborhood was a bit quiet so it look a bit scary when walking from the station to the hotel , The room was spacious very nice bed There s a bathtub which you could really relax after a long day 
501361,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, Read about restaurant and bar available on site wasn t open at all during our stay Read about air conditioning available in the rooms but when we got to our room and called reception about why the aircon wasn t working we were told that it was disconnected as they only make it available during summer months Our bedroom was so hot we had to open windows during night which was really noisy from outside as they were working in the courtyard from early hours of the morning , Rooms neat and had all required amenities Close to train station and easy access to travel around Vienna 
501362,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, asked the staff to put the bouquet of flowers that my husband bought me for my birthday early in the morning came back at 8pm to find it lying on the same place despite the fact that housekeeping cleaned the room then asked for the scissors to cut down the ends of those roses receptionist promised to bring them and never came poor attitude came for my birthday trip but the hotel didn t even send a birthday card it was an unpleasant surprise, new rooms very convenient bathroom
501363,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, There were not many restaurant options near the property but the few that we found were good italian food , The hotel was really nice very comfortable big bedroom nice beds really clean The bathroom was really nice and the breakfast buffet is the best I ve seen in years 
501364,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, Rooms are clean and nice enough Location is pretty central very easy to get about using the metro Air con TV and wifi did not work in our room on first night Was absolutely roasting and we couldnt do some of the work we needed to do for our trip We got moved rooms but air con still did not work Overall was not very happy with the whole experience ,No Positive
501365,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, A few of the things they told you that you were getting you didn t Such as dressing gown and slippers The room was a little scruffy with marks on the floor and the room key kept on stopping working , The rooms were spacious So great for more than one night stay 
501366,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, Issues with the hotel the rooms were too hot especially in the night There were some minor construction noises in the morning as some parts of the hotel were not ready yet e g restaurant parking I guess but we didn t mind because we had to be up relatively early and we didn t eat there Vienna has so many options regarding breakfast lunch coffee etc just go out and explore the beautiful city The design of the rooms is very nice the only negative would be the design of the bathtub too tall and you have to be careful Issues with the hotel staff minor issues didn t ruin our overall impression of the hotel For example two weeks before arrival I sent to the hotel the details for the invoice it was a business trip and I also gave them the required info upon arrival However when I checked out the receptionist issued an invoice to the wrong address he said he hadn t been informed about my request for a company invoice and I had to request a new one via e mail from the hotel manager because he said he couldn t change it Nothing serious but they gave me the impression they are a bit disorganized In my opinion these minor issues could have been avoided if the hotel was opened a little later , The bed was large and comfy the design and facilities of the room were really nice the room was very clean Big plus the big TV the tea coffee making facilities the laptop safe the USB wall sockets Hotel is also near to metro train stations Great value for money 
501367,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, The male staff where just seemed apathetic since im a receptionist too in a 5 star hotel i think that they have to be more helpful i asked him to make for me a dinner reservation and they told me that i can call from their phone on my own Also for their info a smile to their guests is not a big deal Overall i reccomend this property and maybe i would stay there again , Breakfast was delicious the room enough spacy modern and very clean the bed extremely comfortable i wish o could take it with me The young blond lady at the reception was very very kind and we thank her for her help 
501368,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien,No Negative, Excellent service Clean and nice design overall Friendly and professional boutique hotel staff Perfect for business travelers nearby metro station
501369,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, I wouldn t repeat althought is well comunicated the location is far if you come and go several times per day I ve asked in the reception for hair conditioner and hand lotion and there wasn t They said I will have for the next day and never arrived , The bed was very comfortable Breakfast was good although pricey There are two super markets 5 minutes walking and airport bus near by 
501370,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, still the area looked pretty unsafe they did not provide any hygiene products slippers or other necessities , good location close to metro and city centre good conditions great breakfast nice staff 
501371,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, Only a minor inconvenience overall we liked the hotel very much the soap dispenser at the sink ran out of soap on the first day of our trip and they didn t refill it even after our request , Very clean modern hotel room with extra comfortable bed and smart interior design We had a very relaxing time there

501374,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, the lobby is small and the reception desk unusual Checking out I had USD cash only but they didnt accept and they asked for Euro It was saturday and the banks were closed It was strange such a nice hotel couldnt accept USD ,No Positive
501375,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, There was a little bit cold in the rooom batteries didn t work there was only warm floor I asked several times to the staff to make temperature hight but they couldn t I thought the hotel had restaurant but unfortunatelly it was in process , I like room design and location 
501376,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, Everything was fine , The best thing there is the bed Extremely comfortable The location is also good Near to railway station metro and touristic places I really like this hotel 
501377,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, In my last day some one working somewhere which the sound was very distracting and was very annoying at that time but overall it was a good experience, The bed was awesome the color inside the room was perfect
501378,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, It was too hot in the room and we couldn t switch off nor regulate the heating system so we had to sleep with the window open but then it was too cold , Good comfort quiet location

501380,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien,No Negative, I spent lots of my time to compare this Hotel with similar ones I think I did my job well its better than some of them that I have been there before 
501381,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, Is a 10 15 min walk to the nearest train station which is a decent length walk in the cold over Christmas Ran out of bacon at breakfast the first morning Second morning we were the first people at breakfast and bacon hadn t been prepared at all, Hotel was quiet beds were very comfortable and warm 
501382,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, Room was slightly smaller than expected No windows to open, Great staff very helpful Warm nice atmosphere Well equipped room Good option of satellite channels
501383,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, The mini bar was empty and on the second day the ham for breakfast was definitely not fresh as the previous day The bed and pillows were too soft to my liking however I guess that depends on one s preference , The hotel s location is excellent and the price paid was also very good Staff were friendly and helpful Having Lidl and the train station in the vicinity are a bonus 
501384,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien,No Negative, Wonderful hotel Great value for the money The location is perfect walking distance to Mariahilfer Street and Westbahnhof 5 min walk from the bus 1187 which goes to from the airport every 30 min The staff is very helpful and nice The room was cleaned to perfection every day and overall we were very happy with our hotel choice We enjoyed our vacation a lot We will be back 
501385,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien,No Negative, It s quite a modern style hotel clean bright and concise Nice staff nice location only 5 minutes walk to the subway station There s also a supermarket just down the street quite convenient 
501386,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, The staffs were friendly but was not efficient in solving real problems We were in a double room for three nights The bathroom door was broken cannot be closed before we moved in What make it worse there was a mirror on the wall outside the bathroom so you could see everything in the bathroom from the living room if the door cannot be closed We repeatedly reported this problem to the reception people every day but was never solved I understood that it was the holiday time therefore they do not have spare room for us to change though there were people check out everyday and the workers might have shorter working hours However the way they processed our problem is very disappointing We had to explain our issue everyday to different staff every time we come to the reception desk The earlier staff never pass the problem to the later staff None of them followed our issue Neither did the same staff ever checked with us about the progress the expression they had when I repeated the problem made me feel that the door should definitely be fixed by itself I am even not sure whether they have sent any one to check on the door as there was no hint of fix Again the staffs are friendly but not very efficient , The room was clean and the bed was comfortable The location is good close to bus metro station 
501387,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, Was not allowed to park in front of the Hotel just to download the bags and suitcases , It is quite near to the Westbahnhof Mariehilfestrasse Beds are really comfortable 
501388,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, breakfast is a joke poor quality not worth the money you have restaurants near by heating not adjustable was a little chilly still looks like being under construction private parking means you have to park your car at a nearby 50m away Ibis hotel if you dare to park in front of or near the hotel you will get a fine or even your car will be towed although there is NO sign warning you to purchase any parking ticket can only be bought from WestBahnhof 400m away this is a total rip off hotel staff does not warn you about this , rooms were nice comfortable beds big and clean bathroom
501389,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, i did not like the bed which is too soft and too uncomfortable i also did not like that i can not control heating system in the room and the air was too dry ,No Positive
501390,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, Privilege room which means do not tell you anyone I found out after a day consummation of the refrigerator is free and you can drink coffee and tea made available in room if you have sugar Breakfast poorly you wait in line to eat something I waited 20 minutes after some eggs And when I told the to waiter that missing food he responded that this is demanded 100 euros per room with breakfast which does not deserve in any case , Nothing
501391,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, Breakfast could be more varied , Very modern clean and confortable hotel We booked a Privilege double room wich is very large confortable modern furnished and quiet Location is very good close to Mariahilfestrasse and the metro station

501395,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, Even though I got an e mail confirming my reservation the reception at the hotel could not find it It took me too long to be checked in and my family had to wait accordingly All other guests showing up in the meanwhile were attended first than me making my waiting time even longer Very embarrassing and frustrating , very clean good bedding everything looking new around
501396,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, 1 Our biggest problem was related to the housekiping We have left hanged to the door the please clean my room sign To ease the works for the housekiping we have left the used towels in the bathtube In the most ugly way to responde on our simple request who was in charge to clean our room simply swiched the sign to please do not disturb just to avoid to clean the room Never in my life happend such a thing Comming so late we chose not to call at reception Was unbelivable Shame on who was in charge for this service 2 The second problem was that the bed was not double matrimonial it was formed by putting two single beds together Verry UNCONFORTABLE because we simply fall in the middle 3 Even when we took corespondence with reception manager the simple fact that he adressed to me with Frau Ms prove the ignorance of Mercure Hotel stuff the reservation is on MR because without question they didn t even bother to check my reservation details prior to write to me They don t care about our requests ,No Positive

501401,Mercure Hotel Raphael Wien, The location although there was a subway very close to the hotel It says they have a private parking but it is actually the parking of a hotel nearby which concerned me because I was only travelling through Vienna with a lot of luggage in the car, Really kind staff and the most comfortable bed in the world Most importantly very clean
