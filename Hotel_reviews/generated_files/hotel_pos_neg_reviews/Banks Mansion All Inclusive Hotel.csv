341412,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, The room is on a smaller side although it is eqiupped with all you need , Location could not be better half way between museums and Dam everything within walking distance Excellent breakfast very nice staff complimentary drinks both in the lobby and in the room 
341413,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, Rooms are on the small side but no issue for me The one thing to fix is the water pressure in the showers it is too weak and sometimes the temperature fluctuates , Stayed here before as it s very convenient for meetings I need to attend nearby The inclusive bar is a nice touch Great breakfast

341419,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, We where a little disappointed about the work going on in the living area on our last visit We realise it had to be done sometime but think we should have been told about it before hand and either given a discount or chance to change dates , Stayed at the Banks Mansion many times It s a lovely hotel with great staff We love the location and the laid back atmosphere not to mention drinks and snacks

341422,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, Nothing , We had an amazing time at the Banks Mansion hotel The staff couldn t have been more friendly and helpful They gave us restaurant recommendations and talked us through a map of the city advising us on where we should visit The bedroom was lovely with the most comfortable bed and pillows The breakfast was delicious such a great selection to choose from It really did feel like you were at home when you got in the door and could help yourself to a drink and snacks in the lobby It was a lovely treat and I would highly recommend this hotel I can t wait to go back

341426,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, The beds were soooo comfy I didn t want to get up Was late for breakfast Was given a quiet room at the rear of the building There wasn t much of a view thankfully Amsterdam is a busy city and the view wasn t needed I didn t take advantage of the hotel s generous guest inclusive food and drink I felt as though I was missing out , Excellent location moments walk to world class Art Galleries restaurants and bars The tram stop over the road made getting around the city so simple Was surprised and delighted with the interior style definitely had period charm Most enjoyable All the staff were really friendly they went that extra mile for me when I arrived late for breakfast Treated me like royalty My room was spacious and stylish Bathroom very clean and fitted with luxury suite A nice hot shower in the morning was wonderful 
341427,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, Room wasn t vacuumed during our entire stay 3 nights , Wonderful atmosphere to relax in at the end of the day with a drink or two from the bar without worrying about the tab 
341428,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, The general cleanliness of the room especially the carpets were far below par from what you would expect from this fabulous hotel Other than that there was absolutely nothing to fault , The kitchen staff especially the male cook and the staff at reception were all an absolute delight Our visit to Amsterdam would not have been as fantastic as it was if it was not for our stay at Banks Mansion We loved everything about this hotel 
341429,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, I wasn t happy that there is no porter at door to help with heavy luggage Also there were stairs and no ramp to pull bags up on Had sore back and had to lift two heavy bags , Friendly and helpful staff Free complimentary drinks and snacks Position on canal 
341430,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, The lounge area needs updating as the chairs looked a bit worn , The staff were very friendly and helpful We appreciated the drinks and snacks that were included and use of daily newspapers The breakfast was excellent and the rooms were comfortable The position was good for all the local sights and we were able to walk everywhere 
341431,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, Everything was perfect, Stuff always ready to help Nice surprise in the room as we were celebrating 2 important events in our life Very good breakfast among others vegetables fresh juice live cooking Room and all facilities exactly as described Very good wifi covering the entire hotel Very well located within walking distance to all highlights of amsterdam It is expensive but worth it other hotels were offering only the room for the same fee or even higher and anyway amsterdam is an expensive city 
341432,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, I guess no gym or pool but to be honest the rest makes up for it , Amazing staff brought up every pillow they had on the pillow menu for us to try All Inclusive Wine prosecco and cheese in the evenings beer spirits and chocolate in the daytime Breakfast Pancakes and traditional amsterdam lots of cheese Lounge With open fire Oh and go to Spelt around the corner for dinner 
341433,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, Room was very small and dimly lit breakfast buffet offers little variety day to day and is just average also need more variety in the open bar more brands and varieties of beer wind and spirits , Quiet room facing the canal hot breakfast made to order is very nice all inclusive nice to have in the heart of a major city
341434,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, The room was a bit small for the amount of furniture The ottoman for the chair was a traffic obstacle made to be tripped over , The warmth and helpfulness of the staff were extraordinary We loved the afternoon tea with goodies and the evening wine and cheese hours Coming into the hotel felt like coming into a friend s home The view from the canal facing rooms is lovely 
341435,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, If you say anything bad about this place you should quit traveling , This has to be one of the nicest hotels I ve stayed in All inclusive beautiful location and exceptional staff They d pretty much bend over backwards to make you happy When I go back I m definitely staying here for a few nights WE LOVE YOU AND THANK YOU 
341436,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel,No Negative, Brilliant location with well appointed and comfortable rooms Friendly and helpful team and wonderful breakfast the on tap drinks and snacks are a real bonus too 
341437,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, I don t want to criticise this place because it felt like a family run hotel with fabulous staff who ensured we had a perfect stay But for the purposes of trip advisor honesty the rooms were cramped and felt dated although furniture was new so perhaps that is the Dutch styling Beds are incredibly comfortable Hallways are a bit grubby If you can get rooms for a good price the staff and lounge well and truly make up for any negatives I would stay here again , The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful Breakfast was highly entertaining thanks to the jovial chef The lounge bar was fabulous The kids loved the games on the lounge iPads It was great to come back any time of the day 24hr to a free access bar and snacks We really spent no time in the room Despite no restaurant the room service for the kids provided great food from local restaurants at reasonable prices So many restaurants are so close to the hotel we didn t need and in hotel option We checked out early am Staff brought croissants to the lounge for us before we left The rooms and bathrooms were very clean Beds very comfortable The hotel is locked at night with someone on staff 24hrs to let you in so great security if you re staying alone It s a very small hotel do very much a hone away from home atmosphere 
341438,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, The bed is too hard to sleep Daily room service was not doing a thorough cleaning job as expected , The free bar concept However the drinks selection does not reflect 4 star expectations for a 4 star hotel All are below average alcoholic drinks The location Helpful staff 
341439,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel,No Negative, Good location can return to hotel during day of sightseeing friendly helpful staff comfortable You could help yourself to good coffee tea soft drinks beer spirits and snacks which gave it a sense of home from home This together with sofas and chairs made the lounge feel quite sociable and more like a lounge than a hotel reception 
341440,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, The room was a bit small , Liked the all inclucive bar and breakfast Staff were very helpful and friendly It was very clean Definatly going back to this hotel on my next visit to dam 
341441,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, My boyfriend had trouble sleeping on the foam mattress Much too soft for him Coffees for the coffee maker were not replaced daily nor were dirty glasses removed from room Tickets we purchased at the front desk for Van Gogh Museum were not accepted they were valid through 12 31 15 only I believe These latter issues were only minor hassles The mattress however was quite uncomfortable for my boyfriend , The warmth and ease of the staff The generosity of the snacks in the lobby and in our deluxe suite first night and the abundant breakfast 
341442,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, Nothing to report , Staff very friendly and great focus on customer service Breakfast was great lots of choice All inclusive excellent lots of choice Liked the glass of prosecco at 5pm Location excellent Rooms excellent
341443,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel,No Negative, Great location close to everything we wanted to do The 24 hour free open bar was great for pre and after dinner drinks Minibar in room also free Just ask the staff if your preference was missing and they replaced it Free cheese platter at 5PM was also great Breakfast was cooked to order not heated in a bay marie Also included in price 
341444,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, The bar is in he reception so it can get crowded The hotel was too hot and the aircon to cool the room down was very noisy Towels were a bit old and thin, Great location and friendly staff The self service bar is good but not enough seating in the bar reception area at peak times
341445,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel,No Negative, staff were very friendly and always willing to help Beds were super comfortable and the double room we booked was a very good size location is perfect set on the side of of a lovely canal close to everything nearby but still chilled and peaceful The all inclusive thing is all well and good but it s hard to spend much time in the hotel when you re in Amsterdam so never really made the most of it although it s nice to be able to arrive back to the hotel and have a few nightcap drinks for free rather than pay 10euros each Great hotel would love to go back
341446,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, The breakfast was fine if you wanted the cold items bread meat cheeses etc However if you wanted a cooked breakfast this was appalling The bacon on both mornings was well passed crisp and was cremated Although the eggs were cooked on request they were tasteless quite simply this was the worst breakfast I have ever had in a hotel Mini bar in room poorly stocked and no tea making facilities in the room , Convenient location reception staff good room comfortable and noise free despite overlooking the canal and a busy road 
341447,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, Our room double deluxe was on the small side and so was the bathroom Very quiet despite its canal side location , Wonderful location good breakfast and the all inclusive formula is a real bonus Charming and funky at the same time

341466,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, not a bad experience but the lobby and hallways were dated and maybe a little on the grungy side closet space was minimal the staff while friendly and helpful didn t seem to have a dress code and therefore didn t have a sharp look but I would go back , The location was great the nightly snack hours and the accompanying drinks added to the fun The breakfasts were outstanding

341471,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, First time that I had to pay a late check out fee I understand it s the hotel policy just caught us off gaurd after spending so much money at this hotel Hotel also needs a doorman and a way for strollers or anything on wheels to get up and down for the few couple of steps in front of the building Overall Art Deco look of the building is nice but maybe they should touch up the scuffs on the walls , Amazing housekeeping and cooking staff Front staff was very helpful as well 
341472,Banks Mansion All Inclusive Hotel, There are several things that they need to focus on 1 the check in area needs more staff we had to wait 20 min to check out because the check out person was more interested in advising guests on tour options and selling tickets Maybe look at a concierge desk 2 the room prices are a little on the high side, the location was very convenient The bar coffee option was really appreciated
