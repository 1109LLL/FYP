243244,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Room is really small i can barely put my luggage in too small even for a single man , Very convenient location very close to Paddington Station good and quiet neighborhood 
243245,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The room hadn t been cleaned properly we found two tablets left in the room on the floor There was a damp musty smell Electrical sockets not working When we used the shower it leaked flooding the bathroom We asked for some more milk and coffee for the room it never arrived Reception staff rude The room was in the basement and when, Really don t have anything to say that would be an advantage for this hotel 
243246,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Refurbishment of Hotel is ongoing First room was on ground level and could not be entered due to carpet installation during that day Second room we got was on first level and had its window to the ventilation system very noisy Staff was unfriendly On departure day they booked us an unofficial cab where the driver had to call his boss to ask for the price I cannot recommend this Hotel as you get no value for your cash and we are speaking of a quasi 4 Hotel , Hotel close to Paddington Station
243247,Park Grand London Hyde Park, different hotel nothing Grand about this one, Rooms extremely small view out of window was awful with area full of bird poor had to wait 1hr for breakfast 2nd day gave up waiting
243248,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Basic facilities in bedroom No fridge when one was provided it didn t work No towel rails or even hooks to hang all our towels there were 3 of us in a small double room with sofa bed Room sizes have been compromised in these once elegant spacious georgian terraced buildings to accommodate more people , Address is an extra wide tree lined avenue so building is set back from the road 
243249,Park Grand London Hyde Park,No Negative, Great location It s a short walk to the Paddington train station and underground The rooms are comfortable You can either get breakfast as part of the room rate while booking or pay 10 pounds once you get there The staff is friendly 
243250,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Cost was ridiculously high Smallest and most expensive room on our trip As an aside bar tender could not make an expresso literally My least favorite hotel on a 10 day trip , Location to Paddington was great 
243251,Park Grand London Hyde Park, small room but just fine for a weekend , Location easy to get to from Heathrow via Paddington Heathrow express close to the Hyde park ease to walk everywhere great Tube connection 
243252,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Air conditioner turned on in the middle of the night and was too cold The light didn t turn all the way off had a green light on all night, The extra phone in the room Really handy to use for maps in the city
243253,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The room was too small Bed was too soft and also small Not suitable for anyone above average height Toilet area so small that you need to either sit side saddle or with you leg against the wall and knee against a toilet roll holder No clear information to say it is a B B and not a hotel , Location is central
243254,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Having to leave , Fantastic location near Paddington train station Hyde Park is a few minutes walk away There are plenty of shops and some great restaurants close by Room was well appointed very clean and comfortable Bed was extra comfy Breakfast was great Staff were very nice Wi fi was fast and reliable 
243255,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Small room with dangerous 3 steps down immediately on entering the room Loose handrail and extremely slow running sink in bathroom Had to request electricity left on as fridge and air con go off when card removed Breakfast ok but all hot items were cold eggs Bacon etc , Staff and location 
243256,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Bedrooms too small Waiting to be seated at breakfast for over 30 mins Bar area like a canteen No way this should be a 4 star hotel, Location is good for rail connections
243257,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The window was on street level so could see people walking past which meant we had to shut the curtains most of the time This then blocked out any natural light making the room very dark Bathroom was a little small and awkward to get in and out of the shower , The staff were great the hotel called me with a problem with our room They informed us that they would put us up in another one of their hotels with complimentary parking and breakfast for the 2 nights 
243258,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Poor service of can have the room we were offered or would have to stay somewhere else, Very poor was meant to have double deluxe was put in a double room with no breakfast when had been charged for bed and breakfast
243259,Park Grand London Hyde Park, It was a hot day and the room was stiflingly hot when I walked in The A C was a unit right over the bed and though it cooled the room quite quickly it had a loud whirring noise that was unpleasant This would not be a problem much of the time in London only if one were travelling on a hot day , The location was excellent for me close to the rail station and underground on a lovely leafy street a short walk from Paddington The staff were friendly and helpful and I felt comfortable being on my own there 
243260,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The room was occasionally a little noisy but this is central London and it could have done with air conditioning , The room was clean comfortable and nicely laid out Wifi connection was generally very good There was even a mobile in the room for complimentary use locally There was a desk to work at and there was tea and coffee making and even daily biscuits The bathroom was small but modern and spotlessly clean The staff were friendly and helpful Paddington tube and rail was close by and Hyde Park was a short walk away Plenty of places to eat and drink locally Generally the area has a pleasant buzz to it It made for a hassle free and enjoyable stay 
243261,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Bathroom on small side but was clean Shower unit would have been the better option Air conditioning was on the noisy side but on the whole very enjoyable, All staff friendly and helpfull Nothing was too much trouble
243262,Park Grand London Hyde Park, We had a few issues to do with other guests staying at the hotel We had booked 3 twin rooms however on arrival we had 1 twin room and 4 single rooms The hotel then sorted this for the 2nd night so that we had 3 twin rooms The manager was extremely helpful in sorting out our issues and resolving them , Great location
243263,Park Grand London Hyde Park,No Negative, The staff were friendly and very helpful The phone from the room was a excellent thought from the Hotel to let us use for the stay and walking around London
243264,Park Grand London Hyde Park,No Negative, Friendly staff Rooms small but clean and supplied everything thing we needed Surprisingly quiet for such a busy location Great location Restaurants everywhere Hyde Park and Kensington Park just a short walk from hotel Pattington Station easy to navaigate for train and underground access Highly recommend this hotel 
243265,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Pot of tea wasn t offered at breakfast until nearly finished eating even though I had to go and ask for one it still Didn t arrive for another 5 minutes Was offered room 505 at first and I didn t like the fact the bed was pushed up against the wall I could not sleep in that bed I requested for another room and had to wait over an hour for one We originally had to wait for an hour for the first room I would ve thought complimentary drinks would have been offered but they weren t I appreciate there were late check outs and rooms have to be cleaned however complimentary drinks snacks would have made the difference We were sat on sofa opposite the check in desk and although it was busy I felt just an acknowledgement from the reception staff that they remembered we were sat there and giving us the progress of our room being available We were just sat there watching lots of people checking in and going to their rooms We felt like we d been forgotten Over 2 hours waiting to get a room was disappointing We were attending the Phil Collins concert in Hyde Park and had missed the first 3 hours of it which was disappointing We had travelled from Liverpool and had been up since 6am and really didn t want to be hanging around for a room We paid 224 for a room and I felt the first room we were offered room 505 was not value for the money we paid The dressing table in our room room 607 did not have a stool to sit on although there was a chair in the room the bed was in the way and therefore wouldn t fit in front of it The bedside light would not go off at all no matter what switch we used so we had to take it out of the holder to go to sleep It was replaced the following morning I also thought given the money we paid we would ve had slippers and dressing gowns to wear The largest bath towel wasn t that big , The tall concierge dark hair was very courteous and showed concern interest and made us feel welcome 
243266,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Bathroom very small Aircon didn t work properly , Easy walking access to Paddington Rail station Heathrow express Oxford etc as well as tube station Close to Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens 
243267,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Everything was good , Comfy air conditioned room for one Appreciated the biscuits left with tea making facilities Good shower Very comfortable bed Suitcase rack was useful 
243268,Park Grand London Hyde Park,No Negative, To our surprise there were no rooms available for 3 persons so we were referred to another nearby hotel This was a very nice surprise as we were driven to a charming Park Grand hotel where we enjoyed a lovely weekend The service was excellent and we just loved the hotel 
243269,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Nothing to say as i like all of it, Was there last year too the staffs there are very welcoming Specially Lucian i call him Mr Gps Because i always ask which road to take to go somewhere always smiling a friendly person and also always helpful also for Pavel and Adriana They were always here to help Will recommend this hotel to everyone 
243270,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The room is too small and the corridor to the room is too narrow The access to the room has to go through the stairs Too troublesome when we have a heavy suitcase to carry up the stairs ,No Positive
243271,Park Grand London Hyde Park, I had specified no stairs on my booking form but the room I was given when I arrived was up two steep flights of stairs When I complained I was given another room This room was tiny even by London standards with no room for a bedside table and looked out onto a light well The dark wood and curtains added to its cave like appearance The mattress was lumpy and sloped to one side The bottom sheet was so small that it could not be tucked in The duvet cover was at least six inches too short exposing the bare end of the duvet All in all I expected a lot more from a four star hotel , The shower was excellent 
243272,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The bathroom was very small but had everything that we needed We got back from London in the late evening and called down for two coffees via room service which was met with a slightly lukewarm response When the coffee arrived it tasted awful Everything else was perfect though , We were upgraded to an executive room which had two floors which was an excellent surprise The room was lovely and very comfortable Majority of the staff were very friendly and the hotel is located around the corner from Paddington station 
243273,Park Grand London Hyde Park, NOTHING, I have traveled all over the world for work and always stay in 5 star hotel but wanted to do something different this time and have not been sorry From the moment I got to the hotel I was treated as if I had walk into my fully staff home This is a real review of this hotel and the people that work there There is no words so say how helpful the staff was how peaceful the area is but still close to transportion The room that I stayed in was not a big room but I was alone and it was fine for me and CLEAN CLEAN and A C that kept you cool in the heat wave that London is having now Please keep in mind that all the rooms in Europe are not huge as space is limited The hotel does have bigger room so if you want more space for two or more people my suggestion will be to get a bigger room My time in London will not have been so enjoyable if it was not for the hotel staff Aaron Pavel Lucian and Sakar these people were warm friendly and most of all helpful and happy to be so always with a smile on their face I spoke to the staff about some of the negative reviews I have read and it was explain to me that sometime their sister hotels have to send over guests because somethings may not be working at the former hotel and they have to give the guests the rooms that they have at the Park Grand London Hype Park and it may not be the best however they move the guests to better rooms as soon as it becomes available When my time was up to leave I was sorry I had booked to go to Brussels because I was so comfortable at the Park Grand London Hype Park I plan to visit London again next year with my brother and his family and I have already spoken to the staff about the best rooms to get for a family 
243274,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Bed was a bit lumpy but it didn t wake us , Very friendly concierge would ve liked to have seen him when we were leaving to say goodbye All staff friendly and courteous Awesome location Will be back 
243275,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The bed had a big dip in the middle which made it quite uncomfortable when sleeping especially when there is another person in the bed as we kept rolling into the middle The room is also very small but didn t bother us that much The air con was quite loud but you only need it on for a few minutes to cool the room Down, The breakfast was complimentary as we had to change hotels from the one we originally booked The quality of the breakfast was very good very tasty food and good tea The staff were also very friendly and helpful The shower in the room is very good and powerful and the room was kept very clean 
243276,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The shower room and bedroom were a little tight and cramped , Staff were extra helpful and just got us settled in quickly and made us feel welcome Really helpful with our parking needs as well 
243277,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The staff are super rude the way they speak act and how they look at you they even refuse to give my luggage back to me when I gave them the tickets The manger is trying to protect their staff which he tried arguing with me making excuse and even threaten me The staff s attitude had destroyed my stay in London It s a TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE , The location is great 5 mins walk to Paddington station 
243278,Park Grand London Hyde Park, When we arrived at the hotel we were informed that we would stay in another building from the same group that was in another location They arranged a car to take us there but we had to check in twice and it was confusing On top of that the shower drain was clogged It had water everywhere when used As I only spent one night due to the cancellation of my flight with BA it was not worth asking to change rooms ,No Positive
243279,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Only downfall was that it seemed there was a used towel in the wardrobe but after speaking to management they were quick to remove in and couldn t be more sorry , Extremely friendly staff beds super comfortable Room just felt fresh 
243280,Park Grand London Hyde Park, verys small room on arrival was confronted with the fact that I had to go to another sister hotel due to technical circumstances my impression was that this loaction was clearly not of the same standards as promised by the 4 start rating Will never book this hotel again ,No Positive
243281,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Nothing, I have to say the staff are absolutely fantastic Clean comfy rooms Lovely location Would definitely stay again Paddington station a 5 minute walk 
243282,Park Grand London Hyde Park,No Negative, It was a fab find it was close to the tube really great friendly staff who were very helpful Beautiful room only not enough coffee in the room but otherwise fab 
243283,Park Grand London Hyde Park, They put me in the side off the side building I had to go down a weird stair way to another stairway and the room was super small They had other rooms but stuck me in there , near Paddington and your door man is wonderful 
243284,Park Grand London Hyde Park, It would be good to have dinner options at the hotel Single room was really small , Staff was very welcoming and helpful Breakfast was good value for money 
243285,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Check in took a long time as the front desk couldn t confirm if my room was ready and I was then shown to one that already had an occupant The shower in the room I was finally settled into had a tendency to leak water onto the floor even with the doors closed and both a mat and towel down , Room was clean and comfortable location very convenient for Paddington Station and Underground 
243286,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The pictures online were far nicer than actual room It was dirty and a little worn , Location to property from tube was convenient short walk Friendly staff 
243287,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The toilet bowl was in a very narrow area For a big chap like me this was an issue , I was greeted by pleasant friendly staff The room was small but clean The bed was very comfortable The shower pressure was fantastic Very close to tube 
243288,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The shower is tiny Breakfast is expensive , It is a great location The staff is friendly and though small the rooms are clean and comfortable There is a safe mini fridge electric kettle with tea coffee biscuits This is the second time I stayed here and will stay again 
243289,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Room too small With two baggages was impossible to move in and the level of cleaning was not good moreover the bed was strong very difficult to sleep well ,No Positive
243290,Park Grand London Hyde Park, 1 The clerk male at reception was rather rude indifferent at best At every other hotel the staff were beaming and bending over backwards to help It was NOT a good introduction to the hotel 2 The bed was uncomfortable it sank into the middle 3 The air conditioning was very noisy 4 The breakfast was way overpriced NEEDLESS TO SAY WE WON T BE STAYING HERE AGAIN , The hotel is near Paddington Station making it very convenient for the Heathrow express 
243291,Park Grand London Hyde Park,No Negative, Given that we actually missed our flight and had to stay in London for two nights we had a very late check in and the staff at Park Grand were more than accommodating and helped us with all our needs Needless to say it was the hospitable and friendly service that we got that made our stay in the hotel better 
243292,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Room is inaccessible with big luggage Narrow Flight of stairs is impossible to lug my luggage on my own Heater is not working and room is cold Had to sleep with jacket on Single Room is so tiny that After opening my luggage I can t even move around the room , Great location
243293,Park Grand London Hyde Park, There was a safety light in our room which did not have a switch to be able to turn it off I can t sleep with a light on so this was a little disruptive They did offer to send someone up to turn it off but I left it as is Hair dryer was hard to find it s in the study table instead of the bathroom which makes it a bit inconvenient Robes and slippers should have been provided along with bigger towels Walls are thin and windows are not sound proof so you can hear sirens and traffic noise from the rooms facing the street , This place had the most comfiest beds and pillows I ever slept on The staff were very friendly and were very accommodating with all the requests We got upgraded to another room as the first room we had had a weird smell coming from the bathroom I liked that room service was never intrusive and always tidied up our room once we were out exploring There was no ironing services but they can provide you an ironing board and iron The hotel was easy to get to from the Paddington train station and had easy access to bars restaurants and Hyde Park I highly recommend this place based on location 
243294,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The room had been dated tatty the price of the stay was expensive for what we got room was just average Just felt it needed a good clean , The location was very good near to Hyde park tube station close by
243295,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The overall cleanliness of the bathroom could have been better with dust and previous disposable razors left behind the sink The TV also kept flickering which was highly distracting There was no chain or lock on the door which didn t make me feel safe as a young solo female traveller at night given that anyone could walk into the hotel and use the lift without a room key card , Welcoming knowledgable doorman and efficient reception staff nothing is ever too much trouble Very comfortable bed with fluffy pillows perfect for relaxing after a long day As a young female solo traveller I felt safe within this hotel and within this area of London I found the 5 minute walk to Paddington station very easy and well lit in the dark The location is perfect for connection links around London with Paddington tube station a 5 minute walk away Oxford Circus was a short 10 minute tube journey for anyone interested staying here for retail therapy Very powerful shower 
243296,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Menu was very basic but we ate out every night It s a clean hotel in a great location for us Close to Paddington station and tubes , Didn t have breakfast
243297,Park Grand London Hyde Park, My only complaint was that the window in the room didn t close properly The frame was quite old and didn t sit quite right However this was fixed by maintenance promptly , This is a nice little hotel My room was small but this was because I requested a room with a bath and there were only a few available I also prefer a smaller room when travelling alone The bathroom was lovely with under floor heating The bed was very comfortable The d cor in the bedroom is a little old fashioned but clean The bathroom seemed fairly recently refurbished Breakfast was very nice 
243298,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Nothing The staff were excellent helping with luggage opening doors and attending immediately to problems and so courteous , The room was quiet and although not the largest single room I stayed in it was comfortable with a comfortable bed 
243299,Park Grand London Hyde Park, There were strong smells of cleaning materials and dust throughout the hotel The room s window frames were corroded and the frames were mouldy and the windows rattled loudly in the breeze , The staff were very friendly genuinely so Some of the deco in the room was very new and stylish 
243300,Park Grand London Hyde Park,No Negative, I loved the welcome I received upon arrival the cozy and quaint single room and the location I was looking for an inn near public transit with some pubs nearby the hotel property itself is beautiful and sits on a beautiful tree lined street I was welcomed immediately and since I was traveling alone it was nice to feel safe I adored my room I knew I would be spending more time out of my room but it was so delightfully cozy to come back to single comfortable bed with a giant TV on the opposite wall for late night viewing The bathroom was perfect for me small but clean and charming The breakfast was delicious I opted to pre pay at check in and it certainly gave me the fuel I needed before each day typical English breakfast with lighter options available I appreciated being able to walk to Paddington to catch the Heathrow Express to the airport amazing location Overall it is a lovely Inn hotel and should I find myself back in London I will book here again no research will be required 
243301,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The room size was rather that of a mouse hole for a room named deluxe this was very disappointing Service was not really satisfactory no power adapter available at the reception and if it was defective I heard several guests with that problem Hair dryer was hidden in the desk drawer so one could dry one s hair but without a mirror Next time in London I will try another hotel can t recommend it to nobody , Only good point the situation The hotel is quite near Paddington Station and not far away from the Hyde Park 
243302,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The room wasn t up to standard It was really noisy Apparently this is the lowest I can score I can go on for ages but no point Stay away from this hotel , nothing
243303,Park Grand London Hyde Park, They wouldn t price match as advertised when the same night was advertised 30 cheaper found such a simple thing would of been easy to do and made me be a repeat customer but now would never stay there again, Location
243304,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The room was at the top and next to a lift shaft and was constantly noisy in our opinion they should not charge the full rate for that room due to the disturbance caused by the noisy lift, Location was ok
243305,Park Grand London Hyde Park, To call room a 5 square meter space is pushing it quite a bit A 180x90cm bed was basically half of the whole room To charge 150 GBP for that is the definition of a rip off Any resemblance between the pictures I was presented in Booking and what it is in reality is just pure coincidence Please give me the contact of the photographer that made the pictures She he is a genius The furniture and the decoration were already old in the 90 s The carpet smelled and there were mots flying around , Nice and polite personnel 
243306,Park Grand London Hyde Park, There was nothing in particular the previous time I felt that the property was too far out for me and I felt slightly uncomfortable making my way back however as this was my second visit I felt more familiar with my surroundings which made travelling back and forward easier for me and less intimidating, Single room had a double bed and was very spacious it was the same room I had before When I got back to my room after the first afternoon there was complimentary fruit waiting for me which was very nice The staff were friendly and helpful the bed was comfortable and room spacious and ensuite facilities were very clean The tube was close by and location was central to attractions I wished to visit
243307,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The room was supposed to be a deluxe double No way was it a deluxe double You couldn t even walk past the end of the bed for shut the curtains my husband who is 6 foot 1 had to clamber over the bed Not good for 165 for one night Won t be stopping here again ,No Positive
243308,Park Grand London Hyde Park, As above, Location and staff were good however the toilet you seat on it is a tight area definitely not good if you re a dive 12 or more that was a big issue fro me
243309,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The room was tiny and dusty there was blood on a bedside lamp shade A member of staff walked in the room while I was changing Worth paying more for better quality , Parking outside the property was very convenient and s good rate Good location for a leisurely walk to Hyde park and the Royal Albert Hall
243310,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Very Small room But clean Bath room also very very small I pay cache for 5 days I got emergency after 3 days and went back to home country we asked for money back remaining 2 days but they did not give us , Near to main station and all public transport Lift is available 
243311,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Paid extra for a club deluxe double which to be honest was a waste of money The only difference we could see between this and a normal double which one of our party had was a little more space and a mezzanine level with a lounge area and small kitchenette which was a nice touch but unnecessary for just the one night Also very disappointed that there was no bath in the bathroom Came back from theatre around 11pm and needed a snack before bed There was no room service offered and no food available after 10pm Had to settle for the fruit and biscuits in the room instead o k but not ideal Breakfast system was awful Travelled as part of a very small group We gave our room numbers to the Breakfast Manager expecting to be seated straight away only to be told we would need to wait in the bar area until seating was available This we did for 30mins When the Breakfast Manager came to get us he said there was room for 1 of us only We complained and then a couple of minutes later were told we could all sit together When we got into the breakfast room it was practically empty So what the problem was who knows Thought it was very expensive for what it was It was o k but isn t really boutique just an average hotel , Staff were friendly and helpful Room was comfort and clean
243312,Park Grand London Hyde Park, A man walked into my room without knocking as I was getting changed he then wanted to climb out my bedroom window This is acceptable even with the hotel saying the man was sorting ac out but surely shouldn t just be allowed to walk into someone s room without knocking or even asking Told the hotel front desk and they didn t do anything about it My window didn t close correctly and front desk said they would sort the problem Which wasn t done The view was a white walk which online doesn t state that we was in the basement The breakfast is a nightmare there was 7 of us travelling together and turns out when bust your not allowed to sit together unless you kick up and make it known your not happy Staff do not know or understand customer service they smile when your telling them your not happy with something or someone Felt my complain wasn t dealt with Definitely not worth the money We not be staying again , The only thing I liked was a member of staff think he was a manager whom helped with my own problem 
243313,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Overall ok for a brief stay 5 7 min journey by car to Central London so that was good however the view outside window was not not at all No toothpaste Wasn t aware that the holding fee would be placed even though bill was payed for so had to go back to the hotel and enquire,No Positive
243314,Park Grand London Hyde Park, I didn t enjoy the stay if I m honest The shower wouldn t drain so I took the plug up which was full of hairs Wee stains on the toilet seat the bed wasn t comfy you were constantly dipped into one side of the bed The floor has floorboard missing you could feel them whilst you were walking around the room A water stain on the ceiling from previous water leaks The iron didn t work well you put water into the iron and it came straight out at the bottom The location of our room wasn t the best the door on the stairs kept me awake And the view looking into a small roof a yard It was my anniversary break away and it wasn t the best ,No Positive
243315,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Men must have designed the layout of the room There was not one mirror near a socket to be able to style your hair with the hairdryer a must for most women The bathroom was too small and the towels were too high on the shelf above the loo sounds ridiculous but if your 5 or under no chance , The position of the hotel close to shops tube and Hyde Park All the staff were lovely and very helpful 
243316,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Bath should have a grab handle for helping older people like myself Coffee at breakfast was awful but otherwise the breakfast was very good , Lovely room and even better as given a complimentary upgrade 
243317,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Very un hygienic rooms are really small the furniture and beds are bad the washroomvis very narrow the breakfast area is really small and smelled really bad and the view was directly above a dumpster leaving no reason to look out the window , Location and staff
243318,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Delux room wasn t delux 3 beds bit of an overkill Fridge broken and bit dusty in the room Fine for 1 night but prefer sister properties in Inverness Terrace and The Premier Notting Hill Tiny bathroom , Location great for Paddington Staff were charming friendly and very attentive to guests 
243319,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Perhaps the only negative aspect of the hotel is the small size of the room but that is to expect out of any London hotel , We have stayed at Park Grand Hyde Park multiple times We love the location near to Paddington Baywater and Kensington Garden The staffs are ever so friendly and would always greet us with their smiles and would help us at any time Breakfast spread is quite good to give us a kick start to the day 
243320,Park Grand London Hyde Park, No complaints I ll definitely be back again, My second time to stay here Staff were lovely and friendly especially Lucan who s always so helpful my room was upgraded to a club delux room which was fab so comfy and spacious especially for a London hotel 
243321,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Terrible staff that didn t speak English well Broken window in room Air conditioning that didn t function Room in basement Doorcards didn t work No information about the metro station nearby that was under construction Overall a bad price quality rating for this hotel Since we paid a fortune for 3 nights for a four star hotel we expected a four star hotel Sadly this wasn t the case ,No Positive
243322,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The fruit salad could have had more than just apples pears , We are currently not eating meal the vegetarian selection was excellent There was plenty of choice for both hot cold options 
243323,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Our room very small with half a window Not good if your claustrophobic Bath had no anti slip prevention my husband fell in bath no slip mats either when requested so I only had shower the room needed an update looking quite tired, Comfy bed good location staff very polite and helpful
243324,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Room was in basement it was dark and the view was of the hotel generator right at the back of the hotel couldn t close the window and the air condition was extremely noisy when we saw our friends room and they paid the same was very disappointed those rooms should not be used for guests 007 006 ask for a room at the front of the building but not 705, Staff were realltfruendly
243325,Park Grand London Hyde Park, I love this place don t have any complaints, Very friendly staff from the doormen concierge front desk bartenders restaurant staff are all very helpful and friendly The front desk staff is very courteous and extremely friendly The two bartenders were exceptional The dining room staff catered to my dietary restrictions Sanya Sarkar and Yvetia went beyond the call of duty and will be the reason I will not stay anywhere else on my next trip to London This has become my home away from home Highly recommend this place 
243326,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Noise and voices of people can be heard from adjacent rooms, The staff are really nice room is comfortable very nice bathroom very fast wifi with strong signal 
243327,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Not the newest hotel Lobby bar wasn t very cozy , Very friendly staff and easy access to Paddington underground Very nice breakfast clean and comfortable hotel all in all 
243328,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The staff could have been better When checking out my luggage was stuck in the elevator and although staff watched they didn t help I instead received help from another guest It ended up breaking the wheel on my brand new suitcase , The size of the room and the amenities It was close to Paddington station 
243329,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Instant coffee in the room although that s a hotel thing not necessarily just this hotel it was pretty average and nothing special , It was in the right location for what we needed

243332,Park Grand London Hyde Park, I found very few negative points but at a push I would say that the bathroom was quite small and this could be a problem for some We could hear a little noise from the next door room this wasn t a problem but if the guests were very loud it could be an issue Overall though we loved the park grand and will definitely come back next time we visit London , Our stay at Park Grand was excellent so close to paddington station We booked a club double room 307 and it was a lovely surprise to find it was on two floors with a maisonette living area up some stairs It was really nice to have that extra space and a proper kitchen sink and microwave as well as the complementary snacks and drinks Our bed was super comfy and a special thanks to the staff who were all lovely and to whom nothing was too much trouble

243353,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Nothing I can really think of other than the steep stairs to access my room after taking the elevator Manageable but can be a challenge if you have luggage , Firstly the service exceeded my expectations Sanya and Pavel by far exceeded their call of duty and ensured that my stay was very comfortable They were very friendly polite helpful welcoming everything you would love to find at a hotel I would not ask for better service from such hosts Thank you guys I was also afforded early check in and a room upgrade The room was very clean comfortable quiet and the bathroom area was sparkling I also loved the buffet breakfast real value for money Proximity to Paddington station was a thumbs up Finally the free Android phone service made my movements around London much easier definately a notch above other hotels

243361,Park Grand London Hyde Park, In the single bedroom there was no space between the toilet and the bathroom wall on one side therefore I had to sit sort of sideways It would have been more ideal if the parking was either free or cheaper at least , Position was very good very close to paddinghton underground Single bedrrom almost ideal for a single traveller with a car 
243362,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The food menu for room service is very limited not very appetising Also being on the top floor our room got very hot Had to have the windows open for ventilation as air con wasn t very powerful , Really friendly helpful staff pleasant room overall good location

243364,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The hotel is very old and outdated The floor was dirty everything needed to be replaced as was far too old to be used by customers Showers were nasty in both rooms we had I didn t like the fact we were told to leave a good review on TripAdvisor , Location was ok as easy to walk to pubs food places Staff did make an effort to make a good impression Best area to stay if you are doing a Big Bus Tour This is the only reason why I have picked this hotel 
243365,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The staff were intimidating the fire alarm went off at 7am with no explanation from staff 15 for breakfast is extortionate pricing Over all not worth what we paid at all, The location
243366,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The room was very small and the walls are very thin so you can hear the slightest movements in neighboring rooms , The doorman Lucian was always friendly and helpful 
243367,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The Hotel is very dated in the bedrooms need carpets changed and could be doing with new windows our room the glass was taped together Would not stay here again, The staff at this Hotel was so friendly The location was great 
243368,Park Grand London Hyde Park, the windows were so dirty and one was wide open when i got into the room It was missing the inner curtain as well , bed was comfortable and location was great
243369,Park Grand London Hyde Park, I wasn t able to check in right away I d had a long day so this was disappointing , not enough room service options for a hotel of this calibre
243370,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The toilet was positioned so close to the wall that i could not wipe my bum Not what you expect at a contemporary hotel I suggest the manager sits on that room s toilet seat and gives that particular experience a try Impossible for any right handed people and there are lots of us , The staff were very friendly
243371,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The room carpets were filled with an inch layer of dust and never cleaned in ages We noticed that the room service cleaners do not use vacuum cleaners to clean the rooms The entire family got ill due to dust allergy and creaking windows We had to move out of hotel 2 days prior to departure as it was unbearable We changed rooms after the 2 nights but it seems all rooms had similar issues Also they are bunch of cheats as they promised to refund 1 nights s payment since we cancelled the last 2 nights and asked for a confirmation from booking com This was provided by email still they did not refund the payment Overall our holiday was a big disaster due to choosing the wrong hotel ,No Positive
243372,Park Grand London Hyde Park, There no water in the room plus no toilet brush and the bed is small as my husband is 6 foot his feet was hanging over the bed and there need to sort out there system as I was checking out there were about to charge me for breakfast again I told them it all paid up front after about 5 minute there said oh yes you paid all up on front on your arrival, We got there the girl on was friendly and I paid in full and was very helpful 
243373,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Room service would have been nice but not really an issue , Travelled with my family to visit Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park This hotel is an excellent location as only a ten minute walk away Staff very friendly and helpful Also a nice little Italian restaurant just around the corner which was a bonus

243375,Park Grand London Hyde Park, I was transfered to another hotel across the street as the initial one was refurbished First they put me into to a tiny basement room that had old windows This caused draught and the heating wouldn t work The room had already seen better times After I complained I was assigned another room which then was ok but not worth 4 stars , The staff is very friendly and very well trained 
243376,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The deluxe double rooms are actually the cheapest ones and are very small these are definitely only deluxe by name We requested to be moved to another room as the bed in the room that was first given to us was really narrow a lot smaller than a standard double bed perhaps 120cm or 130cm wide But the above was nothing as compared to the complete lack of sound insulation within the walls We were unfortunate to end up in a room next to noisy customers and it felt more or less the same as being in the same room so we were able to share all their discussions and activities if you see what I mean That could have actually been a bit funny as I am not really fussy but on that occasion it wasn t and I did not sleep at all that night , The hotel is reasonably priced and located at walking distance from Paddington station The staff looks after customers well and were nice

243378,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The receptions didn t quite helpful They provided wrong type of room for us and they denied to change the room because the room was full How was it happened bucause we booked about 1 2 months in advance in booking com Moreover the complimentary water was provided 2 bottles just for first night other days I have to pay for 3 50 per bottles , I like the location 
243379,Park Grand London Hyde Park, It s becoming quiet expensive to stay here , Staff are so friendly and helpful I ve stayed here a few times and the service I receive is always excellent No hesitation on returning 
243380,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Poor condition room peeling wall paper poor facilities described as deluxe room but couldn t haven t been further from the truth Confused how this has been graded 4 star Travelodge are finished better window looked out on what looked to be the back of a kitchen Not the worst hotel but for the price and the fact it was described as deluxe very disappointed , Very comfy bed and fairly nice bathroom

243384,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The room was very very noisy You can hear the television conversation and opening and closing of the safe in the room next door and the guests in the room above The fire detector has a very bright green light and as a result the room is far from dark at night , The hotel is in a great location And the room is very comfortable 
243385,Park Grand London Hyde Park, I think you should putting disbality and walk in shower big one easy to walk, The room so small and bathroom due im disability to space round and prefer go big room than very smaill but lovely relaxing and tv is wrong place where we sleeping
243386,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Arrived and got informed that we had to go to another Park Ground hotel near by because there was some issue would have been better to let us know by email to save us going there at the start The room we had was small only had one plug in the entire room which was used for an air freshener and were given a lower ground room Bathrobe that s included in a deluxe double room was not there , Breakfast was good shower was nice and bed was comfortable The staff was nice 
243387,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The rooms are very old and have to be repaired For 1 night it s more or less fine but wouldn t stay for longer period too old rooms torn curtain bad smell , Excellent staff very polite helpful really great 
243388,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Hallways smell of stale food and furnishings are in shabby condition Housekeeping keeps the linens and towels on the floor discovered this by accident when a storage room was left open The room was dusty and it never really seemed clean I complained about way the towels were stored and the poor housekeeping but was told if I didn t like it I should stay elsewhere Staff are a funny mix of pleasant clueless and astonishingly rude I am never returning Spend your money elsewhere , A doorman and one of the reception staff were kind and friendly Breakfast is decent and filling Convenient location

243394,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The location didn t quite live up to my expectations I felt it was too far out for where I wanted to be and felt a bit uncomfortable walking from the tube on my own so had to leave central London earlier than I wanted However saying this it wouldn t deter me from staying here again , Staff friendly the single deluxe room was a surprise and ample size for a single traveller It was very clean The bed was very comfortable There was some noise from upstairs but nothing major The en suite facilities were very good The staff were very helpful and check in couldn t have been simpler As a solo female guest it was important that I felt safe and welcome in my accomodation and I did 
243395,Park Grand London Hyde Park, No lift for access to rooms at the back of the hotel however the hotel do offer porter service to help carry the luggage through the winding steps The initial check in was rather unpleasant as they told me that there was some admin issue they will transfer me to a sistel hotel nearby I was happy at first as they offer to book a cab free of charge to bring me to the sister hotel When I reach the hotel it was a distance away from Paddingtin Station and it was still undergoing some renovation Upon seeing this I requested to go back to this hotel which I had booked initially base on its proximity to Paddington Station Without much fuss the staff at the sister hotel again book a cab to transfer me back to this hotel The staff in this hotel was fast to find a room for me and offer to provide free breakfast for my 2 day stay Though it was a happy ending I am still puzzled as to why they are able to find me a room when initially they said there was no room for me due to some admin issue with the booking , Proximity to train station Good spread of breakfast Efficient and friendly staff A modern hotel with comfortable and powerful shower facilities Will definitely stay here again

243403,Park Grand London Hyde Park, There is very very little room to manoevour in the bedroom or bathroom Whilst the bed was a nice big size there was zero room to walk around it The furniture is too big for the size of the room There should be a shelf above the sink in bathroom as there is absolutely nowhere to put toiletries Also having no light over the dressing table makes zero sense should be a desk lamp at least Clearly not designed by a female , staff were as described on all reviews so so friendly the hotel was very clean and very centrally located for going to theatre and west end and shopping and was very easy to find The bed was very comfy Great hairdryer a bonus Tea Coffee in room super bonus too Dont want to fault the hotel but some things do need improvement to make me come back 
243404,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Hotel 6th floor seemed quite warm in the room I was able to regulate by running the air conditioning the whole time though it did make a fair bit of noise which At bedtime was a little annoying but definitely not enough to discourage us from booking here again , Excellent location for Paddington station lovely staff Comfortable room the best hotel I ve booked in London

243432,Park Grand London Hyde Park, From the pictures when I booked I thought my room was going to be different better I think I could have given Harry Potter s cupboard under the stairs a run and had more space Not a problem really just an observation What was a problem was the mattress Presumably because of the size of the room people sit on the side of the bed This has damaged the mattress to the point where turning it would not even help , The staff were amazing very helpful Great location very easy to get to and from everywhere Anthony took great care with my breakfasts each morning The 5 99 healthy choices were great 
243433,Park Grand London Hyde Park, It says that its no deposit when booking the hotel however they hold the first nights funds out of your account prior to your arrival I wasn t happy about this as I had booked three rooms for family and had the money held out of my account for all three rooms even though it is made out that you pay on arrival When i rang the hotel to find out why they had attempted to take the amount out three times I only knew because my bank had cancelled the transactions and froze my account believing it was fraudulent activity the woman I spoke told me it was standard procedure for all hotels I have never had this happen to me before when booking hotels Then she pointed out it was in smaller font at the very bottom of the page When i said this should really be made more clear she said i will pass the message on to the manager as your not the first to question the procedure Surely if its a problem you have been made aware of in the past you would sort it The bar area is really small and has one sofa then the most uncomfortable chairs imaginable No draught was available asked for a large wine only had small wine glasses so that was another no The room was basic very small but ok for a city break where you aren t in the room much Our stay was ok and in a nice area but we won t be returning to this hotel on our next trip ,No Positive

243478,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Long time for Booking com confirmation to reach hotel booking system I was stuck unexpectedly overnight in London Paddington Derailment all my normal Hotels were full and it took maybe an hour for the Hotel to be able to book me in Maybe perhaps due to volume of bookings as lots of people looking for London Hotels that night , Bathroom very clean and fresh new but very little room in bedroom or bathroom Tea and Coffee facilities good Great TV Hotel paid for my beer whilst waiting for booking to come through nice

243485,Park Grand London Hyde Park, I had to sign a document stating charges if I were to damage something in the room I felt entrapped that if I didn t sign it I won t be allowed to stay in Single bed room was very small but for that price range acceptable The hotel corridors are very narrow and maze like No mini fridge for a 4 star hotel The mobilephone tour guide called handy was not charged when I received it took me all day to charge it since the battery was probably not charged for months , Clean comfortable Rooms Complementary fast wifi At request you can recieve a mobile phone called handy which acts like your tour guide which for me was quiet efficient free of charge ofcourse Air conditioned room Friendly staff

243495,Park Grand London Hyde Park, We had a two storey room and the downstairs was so small especially when we had a pram The pull out bed upstairs had stain on the sheet and there was no spare duvet to go on this bed Tried to use the microwave and after a minute it started cracking and smelling like burning, Location to Paddington was spot on and the wifi was also really good 
243496,Park Grand London Hyde Park, You book at Park Grand but it is quite often full so get placed elsewhere not too far away but just adds to the fiddle of getting checked in etc , Compact room but wifi and nice breakfast

243502,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The room and facilities were OK but in terms of cleanliness the hotel is ridiculously below par Spillages down the radiator curtains were in need of a clean and generally quite shabby looking The worst part being the bodily hair in the bed and over the pillows In spite of asking to change rooms and another being offered it was still the same They actually did offer to deep clean the room whilst we waited and even after this the beds were still disgusting If they can t even ensure the cleanliness of the bed you sleep in then I m not sure I d ever go back We stayed a total of around 2 hours and then were offered a refund to go elsewhere Not exactly an ideal way to start your holiday when you have to book another hotel from the one you are in On the plus side the Hilton was beautiful, Staff were really friendly and tried to sort out our issues to an extent
243503,Park Grand London Hyde Park,No Negative, Very close to Paddington station train tube and Hyde Park Beautiful traditional buildings Staff was very friendly Room had complimentary coffee tea water and wifi

243510,Park Grand London Hyde Park, We got in late after a day touring London and we had a lot of trouble getting a room The room was small and smelly We were in B1 the window look out to a dark area between other buildings I guess not only can t it be locked it was BROKEN As if someone was trying to break in before The room was VERY small Hard to even walk Wifi cuts in and out Had to email the hotels 4 times before hand to ask for direction to the hotel and got two different kind of direction Responds time was not very good Location was okay That s about it , Only one of the morning staff was great

243514,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The rooms could have been bigger , We stayed for 3 nights in this hotel The staff was super helpful and guided us about the various tourist attractions The hotel is conveniently located in the center of town with a good balance of quiet and serene vs noisy and crowded Quite close to the Paddington railway station as well as the subway Easy to get to all the main tourist places from here Plenty of restaurants and stores around Will definitely choose this hotel again 
243515,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Didn t sleep because windows too fin single glaze and could hear traffic wind birds like the window was open Heating wasn t working and took ages to fix the duvet was really fin and had to ask for a second duvet no information in the room no iron no hairdryer room had a mini bar but it was empty Uncomfortable toilet couldn t sit straight because the sink was in the way also no shelves to put your things in the bathroom Breakfast had to wait to be seated and then back to back with other people really tight spaces then plates and food would finish very quickly also not much choice one lift in the hotel and waiting for ages to use it we often gave up and use the stairs we were on 6th floor , Staff were helpful TV and channels available
243516,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Can I start off by saying I am not your typical complainer in fact more the type to defend bad criticism if not worthy of the comments However this hotel and its facilities are not a patch on the basic Premier Inns and Travelodge s So here goes The room was not what we had booked we booked a double club room and what we got was a tiny room that was only fit for a single bed to find that there was two single beds and a put me up that you could not get around The put me up was up against the fridge and would have required moving to get to the fridge and tea making facilities The receptionist was well trained and versed and when we complained advised us that that was all they had until the following night We asked to be refunded but were advised that they do not refund Only when I explained that we had contracted for and paid for a Double club room and this was not and that I was going to write to the managing director of the hotel chain that out of the blue a double club room appeared with a complimentary bottle of prosecco The bathroom in the first room 602 had no standing room at the sink because the toilet was in the way or visa versa The staff albeit somewhat embarrassed were actually quite nice and very apologetic they do need a new toaster downstairs in the restaurant however and for those travellers wishing to use this hotel be aware that the rooms are very small unless you go club the restaurant is very small and providing everyone does not want breakfast at the same time then it may be OK I stop in hotels most weeks this is definitely NOT a 4 Star Hotel at best a 3 star , The staff were really trying and helpful especially Sylvia on reception They had a young Italian Boy who was so trying and apologetic who had not been long with the company 
243517,Park Grand London Hyde Park, London must rate the stars in a different way the room was never a four stars hotel s worth maximum a two stars hotel the furniture was old and well used the room narrow and crooked There was no hair dryer in the bathroom or room and there was a really bad smell in the reception The bed wasn t the best either I would give this hotel 1 star for the room 2 stars for the bathroom I found the hotel too expensive for this kind of room , The room was quiet and there was coffee tea and free fruits The staff was friendly The area was calm 
243518,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The decor in the bedrooms was a bit dated and messy Could do with a clean up , The staff were the best thing about this hotel They will go the extra mile to help you out Very kind and welcoming Location ok for all tubes and bus services Over all the hotel is clean and tidy 
243519,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Lift went only to 6th floor and our room was on 7th Room looked much bigger on pictures provided Stairway and hall upstairs felt like a house instead of hotel, Really liked location of the hotel and kindness of staff Breakfast and price was spot on 
243520,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Nothing to dislike , First and foremost the high quality of the hotel staff Nothing was too much trouble Reception and housekeeping almost faultless Very quiet room on lower level

243522,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Small room tight space had my legs and head hit a couple of times as I get in the room and while taking a shower , I like that Park Grand Hyde Park London is a good 5 minutes 2 3 blocks walking distance to Paddington station 
243523,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Beds were tiny Green security light in the bedroom that was incredibly bright and couldn t turn off staff said no solution and then asked for my room number as if to check that I wouldn t try and tamper with it ,No Positive
243524,Park Grand London Hyde Park,No Negative, The staff especially Darja and Lucian made a huge difference in my experience What would have been a satisfactory stay became a great stay because the they cared and it showed It wasn t just in handling my needs but those of the other guests as well 
243525,Park Grand London Hyde Park, took more than an hour to check in as they had allowed somebody to check in under my booking and then they proceeded to ring several rooms to try to sort it out rather than just allocating me another room which they eventually did bathroom very very small,No Positive
243526,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Parking very limited get there early No parking when I got there but helpful staff found me a parking spot nearby outside another establishment Not a negative just a warning Only negatives for me was the hard pillows personnel taste and that in the morning we knew breakfast was being cooked because that s all we could smell in the room , 5 minute walk to nearest Tube Location quiet Staff very friendly and helpful Breakfast very good value for money Room was very clean This hotel looks like it is made out of a few houses so expect it to be a bit of a labyrinth with odd shaped rooms I liked that feature but everyone s different 
243527,Park Grand London Hyde Park, I was on a 2 night stay The first room I was given was in the basement and very cold I woke in the night freezing and had to put a coat over me as the duvet was very thin The air con also heated the room but was too noisy to leave on all night Also I was woken up at 4 30 am as I was very close to where they served breakfast and the staff started work at this time I was unable to get back to sleep I asked to change rooms for my second night and was given another room on the 1st floor It was warmer but the bathroom was dirty and there was no hot water lukewarm at best , The staff were very helpful tackling all the problems I encountered 
243528,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The room was of a poor standard for the cost the bathroom wall was just clear glass It was on the basement floor with just a wall outside the window very poor , Was near the park
243529,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Nothing, Very nice hotel very good value we were upgraded to room with 2 double beds bathroom only shower and a bit cramped but adequate friendly staff and good car park at 20 per 24 hrs good for London 
243530,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Computer didn t reflect payment had already been taken and caused frustration when booking in A variance across sites on nightly cost and whether breakfast was included Some had paid 20 more with no breakfast , The staff were excellent Very attentive Concierge was extremely helpful and a very happy person
243531,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Could do with a better parkibg system we had to wait 30 minutes as someone parked awkwardly and had to wait for an engineer to leave would prefer to pre book a parking space so its ready for arrival , Loved the location of the hotel not to far away from most attractions Safe street of an evening and only 10 minute walk from shops restaurants and bars Staff very polite and helpful Room was compact but lovely and clean Bed and pillows were heaven Definitely book again 
243532,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The bed was not comfy Walls were thin you could hear people in the room next door and on the floor above The overall space of the room was very small compared to the impression given online Even Premiere Inn hotel rooms are bigger , The friendly staff
243533,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Very difficult to get access to the basin in my bathroom The shower cubicle was roomy but in fact took up most of the space making it difficult for me to easily reach the basin , Very friendly and helpful staff 
243534,Park Grand London Hyde Park,No Negative, I loved my room which was small but beautifully appointed and quiet The shower was fab I also liked the fact I could go down to the bar and have a glass of wine All a few minutes walk from Paddington station 
243535,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Room is reeeeeally small Heat was too strong even if you set it to really low , Close to paddington station nice if you are coming from Heathrow and get the Heathrow express 
243536,Park Grand London Hyde Park, of course the rooms are smallish but the rates are low, Convenient location easy access small hotel no fuss clean and modern rooms free wifi ideal for an overnight stay 
243537,Park Grand London Hyde Park, No one mans the bar leading to long waits for a drink The rooms are very fashionably dim great for relaxing in the evening but sometimes you do actually wish to see what you re doing , The staff are very friendly and helpful 5 min walk from Paddington Station Little Venice and Hyde Park 
243538,Park Grand London Hyde Park, for the price I paid I should not grumble but room was VERY small hence the comfort not being top score , the staff especially a porter called Lucien excellent worthy of any five star All smiley and welcoming and positive 
243539,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The bed sheet has dirt marks which looks old and not clean Room is tired I think it needed renovation Wash room is very tiny glad we are not big guys otherwise you can t even go inside , Location is good which close to train underground in 10 min walking distance Staff are helpful Since the hotel is not located in busy area so it is quiet This is a credit 
243540,Park Grand London Hyde Park,No Negative, Really spacious room lovely bathroom with big shower great refreshments they gave us free fizzy drinks small bottle of wine and fruit as well as tea and coffee etc Really lovely stay here Fantasic location just a short walk from bus trains as well as restaurants and shops Would definitely stay here again 
243541,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Ordered food but had to wait very long time before it was served I understand there was a shortage of staff on that day if so they should have not offered us their menu Also I was told the parking area was fist come first serve despite parking was advertised on the website no such a thing was mentioned Having known about the parking facility I may have chosen a different hotel where a parking space was guaranteed to the guest Very noisy, The staff were amazing
243542,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The Lift was a bit too small Our bed was 2 singles put together and had a sink in the middle due to this Parking outside is great but comes with a 20 charge , Close to paddington station short walk In a lovely area The room wasn t too small and was very clean inside Room had ac and heating Very happy with it
243543,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Long checking in despite being at 17 00 paid for breakfast however the buffet was almost empty had to ask for juice and fruits Room had items from previous customer some checks and tube ticket Not impressed, Location is really good 
243544,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The rooms are not very well noise insulated there was a lot of noise coming from the other rooms The lift is terribly and frustratingly slow i had to wait 10 minutes one morning , The room was a decent size Very clean 
243545,Park Grand London Hyde Park, I suggest the cleaners doing less noise , Should most hotels work on the simile sistem small room single bed was really good mattress make more comfortable my stay and also make better space I m in love with all staff they are all helpful and friendly that reason I had a great time all problem I had was solve in time i recommend
243546,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Bathroom was tiny Fridge wasn t working Room was extremely hot even with window open Staff said they would come and look at air conditioning but never did decor in room needs updating, Good location not far from pubs and restaurants Nice staff Clean room
243547,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The gap between the toilet in the bedroom and the wall is quite right any above 13 14stone will struggle , We had a club double room was gorgeous bed was super comfy massive window with amazing view out on to the long road and amazing buildings staff were so friendly on arrival and throughout the stay Breakfast was good wide variety hot and cold food 
243548,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The first room they put us in the third bed was a chair bed no mattress so we told them it was not acceptable and they placed us in a room with a proper twin bed, In a great location close to the underground great staff
243549,Park Grand London Hyde Park, We were on the top floor and there was a family next door who had very noisy children who were screaming at 6am in the morning, Staff were very helpful hotel was in a prime location
243550,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Light over bathroom mirror not the greatest for shaving maybe an extending lighted shaving mirror is the solution No shelf to put toiletries down on Windows in room could do with replacing for modern double glazed units , From the moment I arrived the staff were super friendly and attentive The bed is so comfortable I didn t want to get up in the morning Location is great for Paddington Station Biscuits with tea making facilities great for me Would stay again so has to be the ultimate endorsement 
243551,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The room that i booked was for 4 persons and it looks big and spacious in the photos from website but the room that i got was too small and i think it is suitable for only 2 persons not 4 adults , I like the hospitality of hotel staffs They have good service mind which is hard to see nowsaday 
243552,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Not as expected some Facilities are not available Rooms are old fashion Fridge not working inside the rooms Check in should be 2 pm but stayed waiting for 40 minutes Parking very expensive , nothing
243553,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Shame the lift was broken but hey I was on the first floor, Every time I stay in London I m always disappointed Hotels are expensive and shabby Here I was met with friendly staff had an excellent room and at a price that was very reasonable I m actually looking forward to staying here again
243554,Park Grand London Hyde Park, I booked 2 deluxe double rooms they should just be called double rooms No bath robes as stated there would be when I booked Asked at reception eventually after showing my booking to the receptionist who still wouldn t agree we should have bathrobes even though it stated we should when returning back to the room one bathrobe appeared Poor little grey I think it used to be white well worn robe , The staff were amazing Location perfect for where we needed to be Very close to Paddington station Amazing restaurant 5mins walk away bizarro Italian 
243555,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The room bathroom was very small cramped but this is balanced with the value for money , The location is good value for money Staff were friendly helpful Clean

243557,Park Grand London Hyde Park, We stayed in a family Room Beds are little small they are more like Queen size Room key cards are very sensitive we had to replace them three times Location a bit far form oxford street However Paddington Metro station in a 5 mins walk only , Staff were very kind and helpful especially Sakar Lucian and Adriana hotel has a free wifi and room service was excellent 
243558,Park Grand London Hyde Park, the noise in breakfast room but this was only during 15min a day , availibilities of personnal and their kind attendance The calm around the hotel was really appreciated
243559,Park Grand London Hyde Park, We have no complaints , The staff were warm and welcoming and when we requested for an extra duvet we were given one without any fuss The breakfast was excellent and very economical We were a bit apprehensive after reading some of the previous reviews but honestly our stay was comfy and excellent even though it was on New Years day Thanks to all the staff for giving us a tension free stay on the first day of the year 
243560,Park Grand London Hyde Park, No comments , The staffs are approachable to guide us the directions to our destinations around there with patience and very clear and polite too Thank you Mr Sakar The few of them are Mr Lucian thank you for ur sharing stories and Ms Adriana very polite 5mins walking distance to Train Station Paddington Alots of shops around the corner and easy to find Halal food 
243561,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Breakfasts were poor and no food available from hotel in the evening The access for a child s pram was difficult having to carry it up stairs , The hotel was close to Hyde park which was a s short walk away 
243562,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Breakfast was chaotic Cramp ed room cold food running out of most things during Breakfast so h having to wait meaning that everything else on the plate got even colder I asked for a side plate and was brought a saucer Main lights in our family room fused twice , Staff were very pleasant
243563,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Nothing springs to mind, Helpful friendly staff the hotel was situated on a busy road but the noise was negligible Rooms cleaned to a very high standard each day If we decide to return to London this is the first place we ll check out for availability
243564,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Worst breakfast I ever had at an hotel and its definitely not 4 stars and I travel for work and have seen some stuff Costs 10 as well , Nice and neat room Fair price for being during holiday Good location 
243565,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Very thin walls and noisy neighbours I was in the basement some natural light to be fair but not a great feel , Location and friendly staff Clean 
243566,Park Grand London Hyde Park, had to change room after 2 nights because of the first room we got was located too close to the kitchen every morning a very strong smell came from the kitchen frying and cooking , the rooms itself was good location was good the staff was welcoming and nice 
243567,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Paper thin walls heard way too much from room next door electricals were dodgy no help with luggage up flights of stairs bedding had dust remnants from air vent disappointed with standard of upgrade wasn t worth the extra money No true lounge space and wireless was very poor , Location was lovely view from window adorable close to train station and walking distance to many sites 
243568,Park Grand London Hyde Park, too much furniture i the room carpets don t feel hygienic low value breakfast cheap overall aspect low value for money considering a 200 rate, location
243569,Park Grand London Hyde Park, room was overheated even the bathroom floor was too hot to stand on Room was cramped difficult to manoeuvre around TV at the end of the bed , staff very helpful and friendly
243570,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Tiniest room we have ever stayed in like a 2 berth caravan Not all the advertised facilities were present in the room we had to ask for bathrobes and slippers A fridge would have been nice Breakfast was too expensive , Convenient to stations areas of interest shops and restaurants 
243571,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The room we were given was a tiny basement room after being told they wanted to move us to another hotel We were on a trip with our daughter and her family so did not want to be in a different hotel even with an upgrade Breakfast was not a very good experience the dining room is small the tables too close together and we had to wait 20 mins to be seated and then the six of us were placed on three different tables The food was ok though , The staff are the best thing about this hotel helpful polite and friendly
243572,Park Grand London Hyde Park, How this can be 4 stars on Booking com I don t know The picture is very misleading makes it look more than it is Bed had been used by a sumo wrestling team And room service menu literally had 5 food items 3 Panninis and 2 sandwiches And this gets 4 stars Someone s having a laugh , Staff very friendly and helpful
243573,Park Grand London Hyde Park, I m sure it s typical London but the room was tiny and sometimes too small for even one person with a large amount of luggage Also no free breakfast 15 pounds is a lot of money for breakfast , Clean comfortable and good location Staff were friendly and helpful 
243574,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The first night the room I had booked was not available and I was shifted to a nearby hotel not a good experience though I was shifted back next day The rooms have singe glazed windows and let the cold in, Courteous and helpful staff Location close to two underground stations within 10 minute walk
243575,Park Grand London Hyde Park, There was only one lift and it was slow Their was not enough choice of cereals at Breakast and no Granola , The room was quiet and well appointed Bed was comfortable and the the fact it had parking right outside was very convienent Staff were friendly and helpful
243576,Park Grand London Hyde Park,No Negative, Very friendly staff in the breakfast room and front desk Front desk provided me with an adapter at midnight so I could charge up my phone when my adapter failed 
243577,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Small rooms small toilets small bar had to wait for table for breakfast and eventually had to ask for refund Ordered 4 meals late on 10 30pm on the evening and had only enough for 1 so had to order takeaway pizza instead Staff still extremely helpful though with finding somewhere for us to order from , Very friendly helpful staff Good location within few minutes walk of Paddington station 
243578,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Alarm was going off outside my hotel from 4am it didn t stop I ended up having to get up as the alarm was doing my head it I got a really bad night sleep, Close to my office
243579,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The room was very noisy I don t think they have good sound proofing as I could hear the people in the rooms both above and next to me , Great location very close to Paddington train and tube station I got there quite early but they let me check in 
243580,Park Grand London Hyde Park, I think the hotel needs decorating as rooms in reception and bar looking tired But purely cosmetic criti ism, Ideally placed hotel walking distance to Oxford St and other central places of interest The hotel is quiet allowing for an undisturbed nights sleep The beds are the most comfortable I had used in a hotel The staff were extemely helpful as I have a disabled daughter and very friendly 
243581,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The room was very small especially the bath room and that unfortunately is the downside of the place , The staff was very helpful and the location is wonderful as its within walking distance to paddington station but remains relatively quiet despite the excellent location 
243582,Park Grand London Hyde Park, the safety deposit box in the room was not attached to the inside of the wardrobe it was possible to pick up the safety deposit box and take it with you , The lobby room and breakfast room where very clean Fresh flowers at entrance and breakfast room Breakfast very good tea coffee maker in the room 
243583,Park Grand London Hyde Park, First got a room in the basement With a window facing a wall in a distance of less than 1 meter Could change the room after one night , overall clean room location is good 
243584,Park Grand London Hyde Park, the room was dirty the carpet and curtains had stains on them and it smell of humidity was rampant , Location is very convenient and close to Paddington station Very affordable 
243585,Park Grand London Hyde Park,No Negative, Lovely helpful courteous staff Close to paddington station for train to heathrow Walking distance to Hyde Park Lots of resturants and pubs Variety of size rooms all clean and well attended Leafy street outlook
243586,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Rooms no longer available because arrived at midnight Unbelievable Booking took money by the way Staff not willing to help and living us outside at midnight ,No Positive
243587,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Is an old hotel with an average service, Is a good old proper hotel You what you pay for Very large rooms me and my family had double queens beds and a quite convenient location
243588,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Beds are too old and uncomfortable TV did not worked they charge the full amount of your stay on check in and not on check out as many hotels do , Location and spacious room for a family of 4
243589,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The staff tried to place me in a sister hotel the location of which I never actually discovered because of essential maintenance When I insisted on staying at the hotel I had booked and suggested that if they had overbooked their rooms they should bump someone else they quickly found a room for me But then they tried to make me pay for the room that had already been paid for again and refused to let me check in and give me a key until I did When I explained that I could not pay if I could have I would have and sorted out any overcharge later as I had traveled with only enough cash to buy food and drink for the day and no credit or debit card they still refused Carrying little money when travelling in my own country for a single nights stay is something I do nowadays when attending crowded events concerts gigs where I expect to be at or near the front because of having lost cards wallets and a watch in my time over 30 years I explained again and again that I would have to sleep rough on the streets of London if they did not give me the room as booked because I had no means to pay them or anywhere else for a room to which they responded that they would get the money anyway When I asked what would happen to the room in that case they said it would remain empty to which I suggested that they should let me check in then and I assured them again that if they were correct and the room had not been paid for that I would see to it that it was eventually after emailing a friend of mine a form for payment but before any further payment was made they gave in and allowed me to check in and showed me to a room The single room was ridiculously small I was not expecting much room to be fair but the phrase about swinging a cat comes to mind and to be honest there was not even enough room for a cat , checking out the next day
243590,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Definitely not a 4 hotel Breakfast was so disorganised and no one paid attention to refill drink dispensers food etc Room was disappointing due to the noise could hear the rooms on the same floor and lights not workingproperly Although the first room we were given was someone else s room containing their luggage etc Overall I don t think we would stay again , Good location close to Paddington Station
243591,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Some of the staff were great the two staff that were on the desk when I arrived were so helpful But at the end of my stay the I asked for wake up call and a taxi to the main train station I got no call and was quote 10 pound for the cab which they forgot to call as well and then got charged 21 pound was ripped off not happy spoke to hotel and they said the staff member I spoke to got the wrong info and I still had to pay the manager sent an email apologising but that didn t help that I had to pay 21 pound for a 10 minutes taxi ride, The hotel was in a good location close to 2 stations it was clean and the rooms okay the bed was very comfortable
243592,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Bathroom is very small in family room and the beds are not comfortable Also limited spaces are available in the restaurant and breakfast buffet is the same everyday, The location is nearby metro station and Hyde Park
243593,Park Grand London Hyde Park, uncomfortable bed too soft slanted and sunken room located in the basement quite loud too costly for standard offered no gym, good interior design room deco modern bathroom facilities for tee coffee making in the room fresh fruits and biscuits
243594,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Relocated from the hotel we had booked to a sister hotel across the road which was inferior Appalling location of room right on busy road meant no sleep and that was an upgrade from the room they planned to give me which was a door off of reception Smallest room I have ever seen ,No Positive
243595,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Cramped property access to the rooms is terrible need to use a number of very narrow corridors to access the rooms While Rooms are reasonable in size the bathrooms are cramped and poorly designed , Good and helpful staff decent breakfast
243596,Park Grand London Hyde Park, At this price the hotel rate could include some breakfast The single room was so small , Nice location a few minutes walk from Paddington Station Friendly waiters Some basic fruit and water in the room 
243597,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Room was not up to the standard especially for the price we paid 192 for the night without breakfast Air cond didn t work hence it was so stuffy especially when the temp Was almost 20c outside Bathroom fittings were falling apart and the lifts were very slow We had no choice as we were put on the 6th floor, It was close to the places we were visiting so it was very convenient
243598,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The only problem is the ridiculous price of a very basic and tiny room People and location great , Great location good people ridiculous price typical central London Stayed in hotels Belgium 2 Spain 2 Italy 2 China 6 in last two months By far the worst room by far the most expensive 
243599,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The breakfast was very average One of us is a coeliac who usually has fruit and yoghurt but the fruit on offer was tasteless unripe melon and tough tinned peaches pretty inedible If we had been paying the big bucks breakfast cost we would have been really upset The other of us had very average cereal followed by bacon and poor pallid eggs Not worth the charge at all Service was good but what is the use of poor service when the food is bad The Indian restaurant s offerings were not gluten free although most authentic curries never contain gluten so we were very disappointed that we had to go out to eat , We liked the location although we were transferred there from another hotel in the Park Grand chain Breakfast was thrown in to compensate us for the inconvenience an additional taxi ride We liked the friendly bar and bar staff 
243600,Park Grand London Hyde Park, For the price tag 350 night very poor facility very simple room spider webs in one corner mini bar was empty electricity did not work when card was put in had to go down to reception where a member of staff helped out with a trick by putting in two cards contact was enabled I could not recommend this place at that price to anybody Kind regards Christian Kummert, good location very close to Paddington
243601,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Nothing everything was great, The staff could not have been nicer we caught colds during our stay and the staff was always asking what they could do to help Felt like home 
243602,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Small rooms no ventilation in bathrooms thin old towels but amazing staff , We booked a triple room because we were travelling with our adult daughter This room turned out to be far too small for 3 adults and their luggage We therefore booked another single room which greatly increased the expense If I had know this was the situation ahead of time I would rather have booked an apartment in London for the same price as the 2 rooms The single room was also unbelievably tiny I have stayed in many hotels in London with small rooms but these were beyond a joke The staff however were absolutely fantastic and did everything in their power to try and address the situation and keep us happy They were a credit to the establishment The breakfast is also very good value for money if you prebook it 
243603,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The Shaftesbury hotel rooms and en suites were terrible Worst we have ever stayed in , We were moved to the Shaftesbury hotel on arrival due to maintenance problems No prior warning given
243604,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The fact that I didn t stay at the hotel that I had booked On arrival we were dispatched to another hotel nearby Extremely disappointed as this was a birthday surprise for my sister ,No Positive
243605,Park Grand London Hyde Park, First they gave me a basement room then upon my request they gave me a room at the back that the front wall almost blocking the window and then gave me another room with back view but better anyway The room was so tiny and the wall next to the bed had spots on , It was close to Paddington station which was good for my traveling plan 
243606,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Size of the rooms and bathrooms Though I did take a very basic room as it was a 2 day business visit I feel the room was painfully small including the bathrooms , Staff Location comfort of bed
243607,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The property is listed as Westminster and although it is in the Westminster Burrough it is actually located in Bayswater with the nearest tube station being Paddington It would be helpful if they were clearer with the location The rooms were a little noisy My door was difficult to close to had to be slammed shut rather loudly and squeaky boards from the room above were disturbing also , Staff were friendly and helpful Rooms were clean 
243608,Park Grand London Hyde Park, the wifi will always lose connection when i lock the screen, extra soft bed that you can even sink in nice breakfast polite and helpful waiters everything is very nice except for the small room though everything is available 
243609,Park Grand London Hyde Park, I realize that the staff never smiles which was kept allover my stay The hotel did not care about my recommendation in online booking when I asked for a hard pillow The room was very small but well arranged it got unpleasant decoration including the carpets and the wall color The ac was not working but thanks God London was work at this time The window was leaking air with another unpleasant view The corridor was ancient and smelly Amenities were basic but enough The bathroom was small but well arranged The towels were smelly Sleeping was ok The staffs were helpful when asking but never smile when facing customers also did not look overloaded The hotel did not contain any facilities and I wonder how it got 4 stars Check out was express and it was the best thing happened during my stay In summary I won t be staying again , I had a five nights stay in August A location is perfect 5 minutes walk to London Paddington or Lancaster stations Check in out was fast 
243610,Park Grand London Hyde Park, We thought the rooms were to small But we know that with London property space is a premium We have just left the Hilton Hawaii and all we can say is wow , We liked Valerie and the other girls at the desk Also the porter and bar Man They all went out of there way to be friendly and helpful 
243611,Park Grand London Hyde Park, When we arrived in our room we were shocked at the size We had booked a deluxe double however it was more like a small double The bed was comfy however a small double bed There was no real room to move about The room was also not as clean as we would expect there was a few stains here and there When checking out the staff members were not so friendly not even a thank you or goodbye We would not stay here again due to the small rooms , Me and my partner stayed in the hotel for one night for my 18th birthday On arrival we were welcomed with friendly staff After a few moments we were told where our room was 
243612,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The noisy air con machine in the room and the small bathroom , The nice touches by the hotel as it was our anniversary including upgrade if the room The staff were great and really friendly 
243613,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Staff had little knowledge about tourist attractions and I got the impression were pushing those they were on commission for this may not be correct but this was our impression, Functional accommodation which suited our needs as a base to explore
243614,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The bathroom was tiny and cramped and there was very little public space to outside of the room , Bedroom had comfortable beds decent tv and a nice tea tray Staff were very pleasant and helpful 
243615,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The Bathroom in Room 403 smelt very strongly of stale cigarettes The room felt very hot and we had to have the air con on during August but when the weather was very rainy The air con made it hard to sleep initially Also there is little space between tables at breakfast so moving around is cosy perhaps smaller tables would help this , Very helpful friendly staff good quality sausages at breakfast 
243616,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Breakfast was awful and a waste of money Room was too small and the bathroom was ridiculous I have seen bigger match boxes, Some staff were nice and did try hard It I feel that a lot of the staff lacked the proper training
243617,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The carpets were dirty and bathrooms ambience was smelly In fact for my room 614 they have repaired the leakage twice and it took 5 6 hours everytime Moreover the exhaust fan in Bath room was not working And they fixed up on my 7th day of stay , The hotel rack rates are better then the Booking com rates It really disappointed me when I got to know about it because the rack rates were including breakfast otherwise costing 15 per person whereas booking com rates were excluding breakfast So in total we 8 night stay we have to pay 5 person x15 75 x8 nights 600 we paid extra due to booking through Booking com It s really disappointing 
243618,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The room had been moved around so that the desk was not where it was originally located making it impossible to see in the mirror over the desk and use the hairdryer Bathroom was a cupboard, The location
243619,Park Grand London Hyde Park, Toilets and bath very small for 4 persons bedroom , Very kind staff nice hotel but a little old Good location Tea coffee and nice biscuits offered in our bedroom self service 
243620,Park Grand London Hyde Park,No Negative, The hotel was nicer than I was expecting and the room was huge It was very easy to get to from Paddington Station convenient and ideal for my time in London 
243621,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The bed in my room wasn t particularly comfortable The single room was quite small for the money paid , The staff on reception were excellent very knowledgeable and efficient The hotel is in a decent location close to a lot of local restaurants and amenities Hotel has a sophisticated feel about it and there is a small bar and restaurant on site Wifi works well in the rooms Handy for the Heathrow Express 
243622,Park Grand London Hyde Park, The rooms are very small I had asked for an extra bed in the children s room only to get their and be told it was not possible , The location of the hotel gave easy access to Oxford Street
