372010,Vincci Maritimo, the fact that it took very long on one of the days for our room to be cleaned only happened late afternoon and we were quite tired, The hotel is in a quiet neighbourhood and lent itself to a relaxed atmosphere it is well located in terms of malls public transport leizure
372011,Vincci Maritimo, We paid for a triple room but realisitically it could only fit two single beds so we had to share 2 They offered a 3rd bed but there would have been no space to sit Also room at the end of the hall internet not working , Very well located for everything 
372012,Vincci Maritimo, Breakfast was very basic so don t expect too much they really need to improve that , very close to the beach and shopping mall and small local supermarkets cheaper than big malls clean rooms and nice bathroom very close to metro station salva de mar 
372013,Vincci Maritimo, Cleanliness Hair in the bathtub and dust in the room I arrived just after midnight and there was a queue at check in so I didn t return to the front desk to request a room change , Nice room comfy bed and wifi available 
372014,Vincci Maritimo, Sadly there are a couple of things that really let the hotel down and would in our opinion be pretty easy to solve The Junior Suites are on all floors the first Suite and not ideally placed next to the Housekeeping Room so there is a lot of noise from the Housekeeping door being opened closed and the Room Attendants and their associated noise chatter Our Room attendants failed badly on the second third night First night we opted just for change of towels But nights 2 3 the room was not cleaned properly mini bar not replaced toiletries not replaced all round a shoddy rushed job not once but twice After we complained to Front Desk things were fine but the staff on Housekeeping those two days badly let the hotel down just simple laziness The second problem is that Wi Fi whilst free throughout is not stable at all and not only keeps dropping but can remain down for long periods of time If you do find that you are the type of person that needs to work whilst travelling this can be a major interruption But solve the 2 problems above and you have a very good pleasant experience and even without a Gym or Pool you would have a good stay if only those 2 issues could be resolved , The location of this venue is absolutely perfect 5 minute walk to the Diagonal Mar Shopping Centre and 10 minute walk to the beach Banks ATM s Supermarkets 2 minutes walk away The Front Desk Staff were awesome and always ready available to assist Checking in and out was a breeze and absolutely no problem hassle at all The Staff in the Restaurant in the Evening were very kind helpful attentive and the food quality was very good Breakfast Buffet was fine good choice of coffees beverages and the options for which type of breakfast were wide The Junior Suite has a large bathroom and the bed was comfortable 
372015,Vincci Maritimo, Cleaning of the room should be done much earlier in the day , The Staff are really helpful and very friendly The hotel is also located in very close proximity to Taxi s Bus Stop Train Stop and a great Shopping Mall 
372016,Vincci Maritimo, Room not too big but I guess this is average size in BCN, Metro close by 15 minutes ride to downtown Good private parking not expensive Big shopping mall nearby Easy to get to from the motorway
372017,Vincci Maritimo, 1 4 Star and no pool or gym 2 Pre prepared breakfast No chef in attendance 3 Hotel aircon inadequate so main areas and lifts very hot in summer 4 No concierge to arrange taxi s activities etc , 1 Great pastry section in the morning 2 Good locality to beach and promenade 3 Good locality to Diagonal Mar shopping centre 4 View over park and not a side street 5 Newly refurbished 7 2017 6 Under 160 rooms so not too busy 
372018,Vincci Maritimo, SECURITY or lack of it At the check in counter I deposited 2 suitcase and my handbaggage They were immediately behind me when I presented my passport When I turned around to collect my bags the h bag was missing The CCTV later showed a black male entering the hotel The 2 check in ladies saw NOTHING They were facing the door and noticed NOTHING WHY WHY WHY was there no security in this 4 star hotel The lady manager later told me that it had happened at a nearby hotel and still they didnt pay for security Nobody to help with baggage Cheap Charlies Please do not use this hotel It is not in a good part of town Raphael was a great help thanks to him All I was offered was a cup of tea a phone call and a ride to the police station Not exactly good customer service , The help of Raphael the trainee manager Nothing else 
372019,Vincci Maritimo, Bathroom needed cleaning and maintenance Overall furniture in the junior suite was unsafe for small children The price was too expensive as we believe this not to be the quality expected of a 4 hotel , Proximity to the beach and outside city center 
372020,Vincci Maritimo, We ve paid for a paid early check in 50 and they gave us a room right in the first floor when I asked on the top and there were construction work happening in the lobby that seemed that our room would explode But the manager was great and offered us a new room on the top floor like I ve asked in the first place away from the construction work and a free breakfast which was great Not the best but at least they sorted it out , Great location Great manager 
372021,Vincci Maritimo, it is located in very calm area very distant for walking from the city center about 15 20 minutes in metro the surrounding neighborhood is very poor nothing around no cafes no restaurants only mini market 2 mn walk decent shopping mall 15 minutes walking rare people during the day and nobody during the night 15 minutes metro frequency after 21 h and 30 mn after 22 h the metro is 4 minutes walk from the hotel it is a waste of time i do not recommend at all it is not a 4 stars hotel in my opinion cleanliness is average with small rooms and simple breakfast services are very basic , i didn t like the hotel Does not worth the money i paid very expensive you can take better one in the city center with the same price 
372022,Vincci Maritimo, The safe which didn t quite work the first time Though the staff gladly fixed the problem with it within 10 minutes or less , Very friendly and fast service from all of the staff in this hotel Any problems were dealt with immediately in a quick and professional fashion Good breakfast and is a hotel fairly close to the beach and some wonderful restaurants I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a place that has great comfort and even better service 
372023,Vincci Maritimo, The room got a little warm at night but it wasn t out of control I either slept on top of the sheets or with a top sheet only , The location was about a 10 15 min walk to the beach and only a 3 or so minute walk to the Selva de Mar Metro Station on the L4 line The staff was INCREDIBLE and they were able to make recommendations for places to eat things to see do scheduled a taxi for us to the airport and even notified us of an upcoming metro strike The breakfast including the dining area was a great way to start our day If you didn t want to get coffee from one of two machines hot freshly brewed coffee and milk was available upon request from one of the many staff members at breakfast 
372024,Vincci Maritimo, Housekeeping Staff didnt respect do not disturb sign when expressing our concerns and inquired about the reason behind not respecting the sign and not even knocking on the room door the front office manager just gave us a free drink at the bar Perfectly ignoring our concerns and just throwing something for free to make us happy in her perception without any follow up answering our question from the head housekeeper as the front office manager said they will investigate The AC was barely cooling the room the hotel tries to save money by turning off the room corridors AC and opening the window by the end of the hall as its a better solution when its 30 degrees outside , Breakfast and the hotel garden
372025,Vincci Maritimo, For a hotel targeting international guests and business travelers I believe that room service should be available outside the late r dinner times typcial for Spain as from 20h00 Choice is quite restricted outside these hours , Clean spacious rooms in a hotel that is a bit further away from the Ramblas for example but close to the beach for an evening walk or run Very friendly staff and a great breakfast 
372026,Vincci Maritimo, 3 Euro Corkage charge to borrow a cork screw For 200 a night I would not expect this petty charge , Very friendly staff Easy access to the TMB Metro Clean rooms 
372027,Vincci Maritimo,No Negative, Though the location was not in the centre of town it is close to the metro and within walking distance of the beach and Las Ramblas On our arrival at reception we were given a map and metro map along with recommandations of places to visit It is also about 5minutes walk from the mall which also has restaurants and a supermarket which was very convenient 
372028,Vincci Maritimo, Hotel lacked somewhere to sit and relax eg a bar or comfotable garden However renovation was ongoing so will assume this will be recified, Quite location but within reach of everything you need Very comfortable and quite room Breakfast excellent Staff excellant very friendly and helpful 
372029,Vincci Maritimo, There was renovation work going on so the bar and restaurant were in the same place therefore no atmosphere at all No explanation as to the nature of the building work either , The room is lovely with large comfortable bed and very well equipped bathroom
372030,Vincci Maritimo, the room was not comfortable at night all the noise from the corridor and up floor and room from left or right comes to our room and we can not sleep normal at night because every night someone is check in or check out or going to shower and you can hear all , the location of hotel is perfect close to metro and tram and close to big shopping mall
372031,Vincci Maritimo,No Negative, Close to the beach and next to the Metro station Modern facilities with good rooms and service Next to Diagonal Mar shopping center and restaurants Good WiFi
372032,Vincci Maritimo, A little out of the way It would also be a good idea if the staff asked for the nightly tax at the beginning of the stay rather than the end when people could have spent their euros or better still add it to the price of the room a small thing but slightly annoying, Staff during check in very friendly rooms Nicely presented and clean
372033,Vincci Maritimo, Although it s a 4 star hotel not many amenities in the building basically it is a place to sleep, New Hotel nice size of room compare to those old luxurious ones because the old ones are usually small
372034,Vincci Maritimo, Window could only be opened a little Beds were quite short Extra bed in room was not comfortable normal ones were , Clean and quite new inside Near to metro shopping mall beach 
372035,Vincci Maritimo, The location while close to the metro it was in a weird part of the city Other guests were very loud and inconsiderate making excessive noise in hallways late at night early in the morning, The staff was incredibly helpful Especially the restaurant staff
372036,Vincci Maritimo, They took money out of my bank account even though when I signed up it said Don t pay until you get there They said it was a deposit and I was supposed to get it back I still haven t received it So it was 150 extra Not cool , The service was really great The bathtub was really comfortable It was a nice quiet part of Barcelona and it was right next to metro and tram lines There was shopping and all of the major Barcelona attractions were one metro train ride away But the hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful 
372037,Vincci Maritimo, Way too far from city centre about 1 2 hours walk breakfast was rather poor for a 4 Had to ask for everything including salt Not much was provided , Very clean Train station is near by Nice rooms 
372038,Vincci Maritimo,No Negative, Very friendly and helpful staff in every area of the hotel excellent breakfast good food in the restaurant and bar I would stay there again Quiet neighborhood and so easy with the proximity to metro and beach 
372039,Vincci Maritimo, too strong audibility impossible to fall asleep while other guests are talking and walking along corridor, nice and neat presentation of a decent breakfast large and clean rooms
372040,Vincci Maritimo, Nothing, High quality hotel in every sense Clean and comfortable with great staff Close to the Metro with several low cost restaurants also close by Just a short walk to the great beach and with lots of free parking close by 
372041,Vincci Maritimo, No iPhone charger available , Bed was extra comfy Great first impression beautiful luxurious scent in reception area Stunning room with pretty view 
372042,Vincci Maritimo, Location is on the edge of city so you will probably need to take underground as long way to walk , Well presented hotel with an excellent breakfast Room looked exactly like photo and bathroom was clean large and lovely hot shower 
372043,Vincci Maritimo, It was a little loud being next to a park but I was able to tone it out and fall right back to sleep , Very clean and a few minutes walk to being right in the sand Staff was very kind and helpful 
372044,Vincci Maritimo, Not very good restaurants bistro near the hotel compared to the centre of Barcelona, Nice hotel not far away from the beach shopping mall near the hotel with subway to centre approx 15 20min subway station very close good price per night December 
372045,Vincci Maritimo, I didnt like only one thing rooms not sound proof at all i can hear everything in the room beside me or in corridor i didnt sleep 2 time because the people beside me at 4 am and 5 am , I like the location its really perfect staff is awsome and really helpful room size is really big cafeteria stuff is really good and had best coffee ever very clean rooms i really recommend it
372046,Vincci Maritimo, THE NOISY PEOPLE NEXT DOOR AT 4 IN THE MORNING AND THEY LEFT THEIR FAST FOOD RUBBISH OUTSIDE OUR DOOR ALTHOUGH WE KNOW THAT WAS NOT THE HOTELS FAULT, WE THOUGH THE QUALITY OF THE ROOM WAS GREAT AND THE RECEPTION STAFF ALWAYS HELPFUL AND FRIENDLY
372047,Vincci Maritimo, In low season there is not much going on around the hotel nor are there very many restaurants or bars to choose from , The metro line L4 which will take you to the gothic quarter of Barcelona is just around the corner from the hotel 
372048,Vincci Maritimo, The only downside was that the walls are not soundproof enough I had some very loud neighbours who were partying in the room next door but I suppose that can happen anywhere , Great location moments away from metro station and few minutes walk from the beach Spacious room with big and comfy bed and very helpful staff Big selection of food at breakfast and tasty and well presented food in the restaurant too 
372049,Vincci Maritimo, far from the airport it s about 80 minutes and you have to change 3 metro lines no soundproofing, Close to metro station and tram comfortable bed clean close to a mall
372050,Vincci Maritimo, The bar could stay open longer hours , Excellent buffet breakfast in a very nice space Charming terrace Only a couple minutes walk from the Metro station Very polite staff 
372051,Vincci Maritimo, the first impression of the hotel is a real disappointment outdated reception furniture which looks not only old but also really bad it seams dirty unsanitary even, the hotel is close to the SElva del Mar metro station which is really helpful for getting around the city 
372052,Vincci Maritimo, Place could need some touchup so that it becomes more inviting At least some more lighting The bar restaurant is friendly but lacks in quality and vibe , Nice people relaxed attitude clean functional Good rooms with nice beds most important and nice bathrooms 
372053,Vincci Maritimo, During cleaning the cleaning lady lost a memory card of my camera that I was preparing for backup This had my work on it of a couple jobs I did in the weeks before I had to cancel invoices for 5 jobs I did in 3 countries with a value of 15 000 euro excl expenses The hotel didn t do anything to compensate I was very polite during the whole situation and they simply misused my understanding of their mistakes I used an iron and ironing board twice First time they send me a dirty one second time I had to call 3 times and wait 45 minute to get one Cleaner walked in the room twice while I was on a conference meeting online and the do not disturb sign was out ,No Positive
372054,Vincci Maritimo, At the 4 stars hotel should be present at least slippers walls are quite thin you can hear at night almost everything what are your neighbors talking about , Good value for money hotel very close to the metro station reception is working 24 hours received us at 22 00 pm with a smile Room the same as presented on the photos and You can find as well water pot coffee and tea bathroom accessories hair dryer and safe deposit free of charge channels on TV with Russian Italian Spanish languages 
372055,Vincci Maritimo, Honestly I can t think of somethings My card kept on getting deactivating but that was more of a personal issue than a staff issue , Bed was very comfy The bathroom was efficient and the brownie served downstairs was very delicious 
372056,Vincci Maritimo, Breakfast at the hotel is a little pricey so we chose to have that elsewhere each day Local supermarkets will sell you a box of filled croissants or ensaimadas for under 3 euros , Our second stay at this quiet modern hotel which is a short walk from Selva de Mar Metro station and close to the Diagonal Mar Shopping Centre in the opposite direction Lots of restaurants near by The block containing the hotel is flanked by a sports park and a further park near the shopping centre has one of Barcelona s wacky sculptural steel arrangements which is worth seeing Great welcome at the hotel on arrival and no fuss when we wanted to leave our bags in storage on departure day Reception staff are fluent in several languages and very helpful Selva de Mar is 5 or 6 metro stops from the main attractions in the city centre so we tended to go out early and then stay out until after dinner During Summer the Green route of the Bus Turistic also stops a short walk away As it s a purpose built hotel rooms are spacious and decorated in a stylish modern way There s plenty of light available free safe hot drink making facilities and fridge mini bar The glass fronted bathroom is initially disconcerting but is built with privacy glass so no worries there and again there s plenty of space and a reasonable hairdryer We didn t use the restaurants or cafe bar this time as there are so many options in Barcelona but again these spaces are comfortable and well laid out A real gem if you are OK staying away from the centre 
372057,Vincci Maritimo, Not sure it was sweet , Come bed modern and clean decor Good location on a quiet street and most staff were extremely kind and very helpful Loved it 
372058,Vincci Maritimo, The room was not particularly clean Furthermore we had to ask for cleaning the room at around 16 30 Not up to the standard of 4 stars hotel In addition the facilities are outdated and require an update ,No Positive
372059,Vincci Maritimo, The man on reception needs a holiday No electric jug until we asked for one and got it 24hours later Bedspreads in serious need of a good wash random cutlery no teatowel tired towels no remote but no english channel anyway Whole apartment feels like the owner doesnt care much about upkeep , Situated in old city center Heaps of character a unique experience Close to many cafes and small shops Cathedral 100 steps away Wonderful view from bedroom window Has aircon 
372060,Vincci Maritimo, Booking com price was 3 times cheaper than hotel rates I did not like they changes the room rates very quickly There is no any facility in the hotel only sleeing place they say the facilities are in their other building , Staff are nice and very clean hotel
372061,Vincci Maritimo, Cleaningness of the room dust on the bedside table Not enought space to store luggage other belongings , Stylish modern hotel Very comfortable bed spacious room windows overlooking nice Diagonal Park Great location 1 7 10 mins to the beach 2 5 mins to excellent Shopping mall Diagonal Mar it offers variety of great restaurants on the open air terrace 3 5 minutes to Metro station 10 mins by metro to the city Center Free parking right in front of the hotel so you don t need to pay extra to keep your car 
372062,Vincci Maritimo, Don t confuse with Maritimo Bit which is close by , Good value for money Good location if at conference centre but not if a tourist as you would be better closer to the centre of town 
372063,Vincci Maritimo,No Negative, The hotel was well located only a 10 min walk to restaurants in the city and 5 min to the beach and a large shopping centre just around the corner The staff were excellent very friendly and helpful The hotel was clean and tidy and nicely decorated The rooms were spacious and clean The beds were very comfortable The bathrooms were a good size 
372064,Vincci Maritimo,No Negative, From the moment you get inside you know you are in the right place Our staying there was absolutely AMAZING The staff was so helpfull and trust me i needed them all the time beacuse i was traveling with my older parents and the fact that the sweetest receptionist named Diana called and looked up for us the best spot to get to see views without walking too much for my parents was so nice Everyone there always took care of us and made us feel like we were staying in a 5 stars hotel The fact it was so near to the beach and the mall was a bonus Huge thank you 
372065,Vincci Maritimo, The wifi could be better , A wonderful hotel it is very close to the beach The rooms are good size and very clean The staff members are very polite and helpful I would definitely recommend it 
372066,Vincci Maritimo, I didn t like the room service which closes at 10 pm , it s in a calm area and also it s near to a mall which has many types of food and restaurants
372067,Vincci Maritimo, There is nothing at all to dislike we were happy with everything The hotel is beautiful , The beds were perfect Especialy the bolster like pillows Staff were attentive and friendly at all times and may I be so bold as to say also that the receptionist male with the beautiful brown eyes dark hair and designer beard was exceptionaly charming and very handsome He reminded me of my stepson My friend and I had a beautiful stay at your hotel and the weather was perfect Thank you 
372068,Vincci Maritimo, I toke my luggage myself since the concerned staff was not there while checked in and out the cleanliness was good but not perfect they did not take the dirty glasses one day they didnt put new towels , Reception staff were helpful free wifi location next to mall which is a bonus to me since i have a child with me
372069,Vincci Maritimo, No GYM but its great to run outside, The staff are super friendly Adrian Annice Andrew Cludia I had a nice one week stay and hoped to stay more but due to full bookinh issue i couldnt The Diahonal Mar shopping mall is just nearby Minutes walking to the beach Lovely area
372070,Vincci Maritimo, A little pool would have been nice But beach takes care of it , Not a high rise Excellent staff Short distance to the beaches Great location away from hustle and bustle Next to a park Close to many small and less pricey restaurants 
372071,Vincci Maritimo, The staff is not that happy even though always there to help you maybe its the hot weather and the boredom of being in such a great location , Nice and spacious rooms Very good location Working AC Good neighbourhood a shopping mall nearby and a green park Also metro station very close 
372072,Vincci Maritimo, Pillow only one each too soft Kitchen can t cook food for us, I can t remember the lady name but it s the lady who check me in on actual day
372073,Vincci Maritimo, Paid way too much for what hotel was offering Was checking in over 1h Rooms are small and hot even with AC on My room key was always broken everyday the same story of making it work again stuff really unfriendly For this price you can have much better Poor chain overall , Close to the metro 
372074,Vincci Maritimo, If you prefer the sight seeing rather than the beach you need to take metro to go to the city center The metro station is just a couple hundred meters away though Very convenient , Location is great Just a few minutes to the beach We went there every afternoon Our kid loved it Excellent staff at the reception especially Andreu Always tried to help whenever they could Breakfast buffet was great 
372075,Vincci Maritimo, the price is a little to high not the cleanest hotel the price is a little too high, location close to beach and metro station big room kind personnel peace and quite
372076,Vincci Maritimo, The internet was horrible and the towels werent changed but simply refolded and put back in place for further use , It was close to a mall and to the metro
372077,Vincci Maritimo, 4 star hotel with English channels staff are not friendly the come out as rude to customers maybe its the language and culture issue , Location and quietness of the hotel
372078,Vincci Maritimo,No Negative, Nice and helpful staff at reception Room is big enough and very clean Bath suit is included Also can borrow beach towel at the reception and it is totally free There is a big shopping mall nearby Hotel provides private parking garage with charge 18 per day which is very convenient for person traveling by car 
372079,Vincci Maritimo, No fitness center it could be a great addition to the hotel No ice machine on any floor If ice is needed there s a price for it 3 This is free of charge in almost every hotel , Excellent location to go to the beach 3 minute walk to metro station and 10 minutes from downtown Very helpful staff Good breakfast 
372080,Vincci Maritimo, A little more could be done on the front office staff in terms of customers service Response for queries is not very welcoming, The room was nice and spacious
372081,Vincci Maritimo, Breakfast is not as expected And rooms are not very sound proof there was one night I could even hear kids playing til almost mid night , Good location Very bright rooms Staff were very friendly and helpful 
372082,Vincci Maritimo, the bar didnt serve us ice insisted on charging 3 euro we wanted some plates but that to was refused when you paying 120 euro a night you expect a few cubes of ice free , the front desk staff was always very helpful 
372083,Vincci Maritimo, Little far from the main street I lost my mobile in the metro from the thief If you are with family I recommend you to use the taxi from the main street Because they moved 2 3 person as a team and push the one of my family in cloud metro So I had to see them to protect and lost my mobile Again hotel was very nice and trip was perfect I just inform you that please be careful in the metro , Good for the family trip Clean and comfortable 
372084,Vincci Maritimo,No Negative, Was a very nice hotel clean large and modern rooms Hotel is close to public transport to go to historic centre close to beach and large shopping mall Free parking across the street 
372085,Vincci Maritimo, Would have been a benefit to have a swimming pool as there is ample space , Location was convenient for car users with free parking adjacent Restaurants bars and shopping cemtre within easy walking distance 
372086,Vincci Maritimo, The services are very disappointing I asked the reception to call a taxi to go airport and they forgot to do it and the requested extra duvet was not sent for the whole night Plus a 4 star hotel dont have enough adapters available , Nice shower Big bed
372087,Vincci Maritimo, Not too many facilities on site , It s quite close to the beach that is not as busy as Barcelona city center Breakfast is really amazing maybe it is a bit expensive but the choice and the quality is really outstanding except for the coffee 
372088,Vincci Maritimo,No Negative, Restaurant staff was very friendly Variety of options available for breakfast Chef made hot veg breakfast specially as we do not eat non veg and eggs Hotel is close to shopping mall and beach 
372089,Vincci Maritimo, Breakfast good but limited menu choices for dinner and service slow , Excellent location easy to get both to beach and central Barcelona Staff very friendly and room kept very clean 
372090,Vincci Maritimo, Not that I watched much tv but couldn t find anything in English Walls bit thin , Lovely big modern room Great location Nice garden area Wifi worked fine Friendly staff
372091,Vincci Maritimo, The WIFI was very slow in the room so when required to do some work it wasnt very efficient Room 237 specifically If the wifi in the room was better i would have definitely given a higher score No swimming pool was small inadequacy in comparison to other local hotels but we knew this upon booking , The location was great for what we required The receptionist was super helpful with recommendations and taxi reservations etc 
372092,Vincci Maritimo, No complaints, This property was a pleasant surprise for us after a horrible experience at Holiday Inn Express few kms away Staff at the reception was super efficient we checked in like under 5 mins and they advised us on which places to see directions and average fare for transport Their willingness to genuinely help out was extremely appreciable Wifi was pretty good and breakfast was superb too Metro station is 5 mins away and a big Diagnol Mar Mall is 7 mins away We walked to the beach in 10 mins Services was excellent and we wish them all the best for future and hope they maintain their excellent track record 
372093,Vincci Maritimo, 3 times credit card pre authorization and call on midterm of stay at 23 30 from reception about payments is disgustingly Internet is poor and Wi Fi required manual reconnection every 5 minutes , Location some staff breakfast cleanness

372095,Vincci Maritimo, There was a slight musty smell in the room could use better cleaning Time to renovate modernize the rooms, Even though not central can be easily reached via metro Break fast was good comfortable beds Friendly staff 
372096,Vincci Maritimo, Tried to book a room for the second night but the lady at the front desk said it would be double what we paid for the first night We just checked out and booked on booking com and checked back in A bit of a hassle but it saved a ton of money , Good location competitive price 
372097,Vincci Maritimo, when we reported blood on the sheet we were told they have an eco policy of not changing the sheets every day even when it is a new booking , nice sized room with view of garden
372098,Vincci Maritimo, When I chose the rooms they were apparently at an 82 discount but certainly did not warrant the full price It felt like the room rates were inflated to make the deal seem better Also our bath towels were not replaced by housekeeping everything else was , Staff were very helpful with suggesting local places to eat and drink It s in a convenient location for catching the metro or walking to Poblenou for some better priced local food 
372099,Vincci Maritimo, Washbasin leaks and soundproofing is not so good can hear people next door or in the corridor talking , The bed extremely comfortable Location is great closed to beach shopping mall and metro station Staff helpful and friendly 
372100,Vincci Maritimo, Rooms are not noise isolated so you can hear snoring in the other room not to mention party kids in the corridor doing the night You pay for all extras wifi comes with a huge expense just to be able to download a simple document if you don t have all day to wait for the free wifi to do the job , It s new and the design of the rooms are good

372108,Vincci Maritimo, Nil, Excellent quiet hotel located a 5 minute walk to the convention centre with easy access to transportation to the city centre Very comfortable beds with superb sleep quality and very nice bathrooms A very welcome change from the larger hotels around the convention centre I will not be going back to them Excellent value for money spent 
372109,Vincci Maritimo, The floors in the rooms are from linoleum when you walk bare feet they stick to the floor Laminate would be a better solution I stayed two nights and after the first night the cups for tea and napkins were not replaced For the rest it was a very pleasant stay , The personnel was very friendly Nice style of the rooms calm rooms Breakfast was also quite good

372112,Vincci Maritimo, Nothing, Wonderful location and nice clean rooms which were close to the sea side and shops restaurants I would like to stay again Staff behaviour was excellent as well 
372113,Vincci Maritimo, Small size TV screen , Staff was friendly We didn t had the European electric plug converters they provided us with no extra cost They arranged early check for us 
372114,Vincci Maritimo, Breakfast was a bit expensive can t comment on the quality and quantity of the food as I didn t opt for breakfast in the hotel due to price better value for money places available nearby or in the city , Hotel was at a very good price stayed during low season location was convenient enough to travel to the city center by metro big mall nearby with some good tapas and Sangria restaurants
372115,Vincci Maritimo, They still have to refund me the amount of 52 accessed from my account despite me paying them in cash I have filed a complaint to my bank due to no answer from Vincci Maritimo regarding my call about this matter , The room was clean 
372116,Vincci Maritimo, I had a very bad experience with the hotel trying to charge me an extra 60 at the end of my stay and wouldn t tell me what it was for and were incredibly rude throughout my stay and was absolutely disgusted with the service and the way I was treated ,No Positive
372117,Vincci Maritimo, The gap between the bed and the desk is just a chair width This blocks circulation from one side of the room to the other when someone is sat at the desk A very tiny dislike the only one we could find , Excellent position near access to public transport and very easy to reach by car parking under hotel available Very short walk to the beach and a quiet location made for a perfect choice for our christmas break 
372118,Vincci Maritimo,No Negative, Very nice comfortable hotel Good price vs quality Good breakfasts very close to the sea 15 min walk Calm area Also very close to metro station 
372119,Vincci Maritimo, There was only one TV channel in English CNN news and yes I did check out the others on offer but no other channel worked CNN gets very repetitive , I really liked how the staff were really helpful nothing was too much trouble I returned to this hotel twice
372120,Vincci Maritimo, Breakfast a bit overly priced TV is paid Location is somehow far from City Center but once You get used to Tram and Metro it becomes easy , This is my second time I stay in Vincci Maritimo and I really like everything about it 
372121,Vincci Maritimo,No Negative, good location If you travel by car a little bit outside the city center but there is a free parking in front of the hotel spacious modern clean room good toiletries tea facilities in the room
372122,Vincci Maritimo, The reception was very unpolite and rude The lady treatet me like a little child just because i am young I am working in switzerland in a bigger hotel and if i treat a guest like this i wont work anymore there , The badroom was very clean but the roof was wett
372123,Vincci Maritimo, Free WiFi was good enough for occasional e mail but bandwidth and signal availability insufficient for anything else Small space between bed and desk made one seated person an obstacle to circulation , Location within easy walking distance for beach metro and tram to city centre Great breakfast available Parking under hotel at a good price 
372124,Vincci Maritimo, Arrogant reception manager with a questionable line of customer service in reality Despite making a big deal abut taking my complaints on board the only solution was to offer more expensive accommodation elsewhere On the second night had to report bugs in the room Also it can get quit hot due to the location of some rooms in relation to the sunlight , The lay out of the room The wifi The value for money as far as the size of the room goes
372125,Vincci Maritimo, be careful you are only allowed to consume beverage bought from the hotel or they charge you 3 euros just to open a wine bottle that you want to drink only in your room,No Positive
372126,Vincci Maritimo, not always security guard in entrance rooms are very noisy you can hear all less options in mini bar room , employee is very friendly and professional one of the most important reasons why we visit this hotel for many times Clean rooms near to the shopping center Diagonal de Mar 
372127,Vincci Maritimo,No Negative, Staff was outstanding from A to Z Cafeteria at night and a complete breakfast were excellent assets Very good connection with trams taxis and bus A fantastic mall just 200m away with all kinds of shops and restaurants connected with the seashore as well Rooms are roomy and quiet 
372128,Vincci Maritimo, Only thing missing was a swimming pool However with the beach on a 5 minutes distance we had nothing to complain about, Location is great away from the busy places but still Las Rambles 15 minutes away and the beach only 5 minutes
372129,Vincci Maritimo, Miserable hostile ill mannered receptionist at point of check with glasses a young women Her manner seemed to act like she was doing the world a favour also noticed clients that spoke English at first were treated much better I have read reviews from non european travellers about a similar rude attitude so this might indeed have something to do with the grudging service as my appearance would fit that assumption I left tips for the cleaning staff every single day yet still they left dirty glasses on occasion and would not replace a towel even though the hotel policy said if its left in the tub it will be replaced This happened four days in a row On occasion I had to mention it twice On the last day it seemed as a sarcastic way they filled the room with more towels the needed When I reported a broken bin in the morning the receptionist said she would look into it and get it fixed When I came home later in the evening it was left as it was I reported it again to reception the lady on duty Cludia was flippant someone came up to have a look then said you don t really need it replaced but after further stress said he would see that is was sorted later that evening Nothing happened phoned booking at ten and suddenly the hotel started to treat me like a valued customer but of course being as it was this hotel that too failed within minutes when a rude night porter came up and ordered me to pick up the old one and give it to him like I was his slave no manners no grace no apology even for the delay Even if there was some initial misunderstanding which seems surprising since I looked up the Spanish word for bit before reporting it it still dragged on to long Next morning staff suddenly became polite at check out The reception manager was standing over them , In general the level of cleaning was high but there were a few noticeable exceptions for the price it was good the design of the room was classic and relaxin g the bar staff in general were nice apart form surly young women
372130,Vincci Maritimo, Far from center but close to the metro station beach and a large shopping center , Excellent breakfast Airport shuttle if you register at reception 1 day before departure Big and comfortable bed 
372131,Vincci Maritimo, The staff were not helpful at all They didn t come in to clean our rooms They didn t want to come up to get our luggage at check out Just not helpful , The hote structure
372132,Vincci Maritimo, Nothing specific , The hotel room was excellent for the money that was paid Convenient to the Metro station Big shopping mall in 2 min walking distance Calm and quiet location 
372133,Vincci Maritimo, No business center in the hotel which very important No AC in the room its only fan air wich is to hot in the summer , Frontof the hotel place for free parking yor car
372134,Vincci Maritimo, The light in the room could be better but we weren t there to spend much time in the room They had a problem with the heating system the first night but solved it next day and offered a free breakfast for the inconvenience which was very nice , It s quiet and you can rest at night A nice and calm neighborhood The bed was great clean sheets good maitress Very nice staff 
372135,Vincci Maritimo, The property is a bit noisy You ll hear voices in the corridor and if on the first floor you might be disturbed by noise coming from the breakfast area just beneath you , Close to the convention centre the metro and the seashore Gigantic shopping mall just close by 
372136,Vincci Maritimo, , I loved this hotel very stylish and modern and not too far from the city center and within walking distance of the beach We had a very large room with a great bed and well equipped bathroom Very comfortable stay Would recommend this hotel without hesitation 
372137,Vincci Maritimo, A bit far from city center if you don t have a car But in a great location, The staff are amazing Rooms are excellent free parking across the road relaxing
372138,Vincci Maritimo,No Negative, There was a lady at the front desk her name should be claudia she explaned everything about barcelona we been there for fc barcelona match miss claudia told to us best metro line for reach to camp nou stadium thanks so much to her 
372139,Vincci Maritimo, Is about 15 minutes by metro from city center Metro station is nearby No real terrace wher you can sit in the sun as surrounded by high buildings No fitness no swimmingpool, Rooms are clean breakfast is good staff is very helpful Prices in bar are ok not too expensive Close to the beach within 10 minutes walk 
372140,Vincci Maritimo, Wifi is simply ridicoulus tv also receptionist asked almost 100 times about to book the breakfast 15 Told her that I will think it over she asked another 50 times and then offering a discount 2 breakfast very poor one you can get the same or even better 200 meters far from the hotel in the shopping mall 3 times cheaper, The location of the hotel
372141,Vincci Maritimo, Not really anything, Staff were very friendly and helpful room was exceptionally clean and food and wine was really good Though it isnt in the heart of Barcelona it is close to the waterfront and really nice walk along the beach to some yummy restaraunts and quiet spots to watch the waves and relax 
372142,Vincci Maritimo, No Tea Coffee making facilities Surprised that you have to pay extra to watch any TV channels , Nice modern room with excellent beds Onsite secure parking extra charge Room service minibar reasonable prices Local large shopping mall has supermarket 
372143,Vincci Maritimo, Bathroom ventilation needs to be improved , Very clean contemporary hotel room Good location just outside centre Barcelona Served very well via Bus Tram Metro all within 3 mins walking distance Staff very friendly the night security guard very helpful On the way to station there are 2 grocery stores fantastic helpful staff there too 
372144,Vincci Maritimo, The free wi fi was incredibly slow Around 50 60kb max I suppose it s enough to load text emails but not something I expected in 2015 There is also a premium wi fi I noticed being broadcast but we were not told about it so I presume it comes with the premium rooms Finally there was a flat screen television in the room but renting a movie was more expensive than a trip to the cinema and the screen itself was far too small to watch comfortably from the bed , The bed was very large with lovely soft pillows and a nice memory foam like bed top The sheets were also very soft Very good sound proofing I couldn t hear a thing from other rooms or outside even though the wind picked up massively 
372145,Vincci Maritimo,No Negative, Location is convenient 1 minute to the park 3 minutes to the metro 10 minutes to the beach 5 minutes to shopping mall The room is clean the breakfast is good 
372146,Vincci Maritimo, The room was cleaned very late in the day so we had to leave the room after a long day sight seeing , The bed was very comfortable and the room was spacious 
372147,Vincci Maritimo, While the food and service was good during breakfast the cafeteria less expensive meals remained closed Also as someone who can function only minimally without morning coffee it was a bit disconcerting to wait in line for the host to make sure of room numbers meal types and those paying or not Could you wait a minute please is not what one wants to hear when a first cup of coffee is the sole objective , Beautiful place Well located close to tour bus pick up point and shopping 
372148,Vincci Maritimo, location is not good service costs to get ice 3 euro to open a wine bottle 3 euro the worst thing was a promotion saying you can book a room for 500 euro instead of 2000 euro for 4 nights Of course the room never really cost 2000 euro for 4 nights in this hotel it was made only to attract clients And there is neither criminal in that not honest , rooms are ok nice interior good beds spacious enough 
372149,Vincci Maritimo, Despite being a four star hotel it didn t have a swimming pool spa or gym the checkout was long 20 mins hard to find local cabs I had to wait 15 mins before the receptionist could call a cab as there was no cab outside the hotel the hotel is far from the city centre as a guest you spend more money commuting to the city centre by taxi vs what u save by booking here vs some centrally located 4 star hotel, Clean rooms and close to the beach
372150,Vincci Maritimo, I only could spend two nights it s the type of place you want to linger for at least a month , Underrated I give it a 10 beautifully decorated wonderful service and very clean 
372151,Vincci Maritimo, Would be nice if the room had tea making facilities Also had difficulty finding the contact numbers for reception and the restaurant Should be clearly listed next to the room phone and not have to flip through pages of a directory, Distance to the beach and polite reception staff 
372152,Vincci Maritimo, Free WiFi is very very slow and you have to pay more to get a premium WiFi, Breakfast and the garden the Hotel is in a quiet residential area and it s a 3 mins walk distance to the underground 
372153,Vincci Maritimo, The air conditioning can be improved however it met our needs for the stay, Good location closer to the beach in a quite locality It is about 15 20 minutes from centre when travelling in metro Very close to Selva de Mar tube station Buying T 10 cards made travelling super cheap
372154,Vincci Maritimo, Poor wi fi in rooms often had to go to the downstairs foyer to get decent coverage , Excellent location for beaches Close to Metro buses shopping centre Diagonal Mar and local bars restaurants Excellent menu lunch and dinner good value 
372155,Vincci Maritimo, Wifi was spotty at times but this is just me nitpicking , Fantastic location Just a quick 5 minute walk to the beach with lots of opportunities for beach volleyball Also just one block away from the Metro which runs every 5 minutes and gets you into the city center with 6 stops Also great for experiencing nightlife since the night bus stop is also close by and directly leads into the fun areas of town 
372156,Vincci Maritimo, The rest days of our stay house keeping was very disappointing so in the end it was not so clean nit to mention that we complained about it and no action was taken Another point to be made is that with the exception of two employees in the hotel the rest of the staff was very rude and unhelpful , The rooms are nice big and sunny Walking in for the first time everything is and smells very clean 
372157,Vincci Maritimo,No Negative, Room is comfy bath is really nice beds are big It s my second stay and I think it says a lot Hotel is located close to the beach Also in the same street as the biggest shopping mall metro is close supermercado also hop on off buses It s just great

372161,Vincci Maritimo, The only thing that disapointed me was I came back to the hotel in the early morning from a night out with my friends Had an incident with our cab driver when I asked the gentlman at the front desk to call the cops he refused , The hotel was very clean Walking distance to the beach and to a shopping mall Friendly area Restaurant was amazing The cleaning crew were very sweet as well Over all a very nice staff 
372162,Vincci Maritimo, The location wasn t the best and the reception need a Little updating as it wasn t a good first impression so was very surprised that the room was great to be fair Would stay again as value for money was very good, Bedrooms and bed very comfortable Breakfast was very and good staff very friendly
372163,Vincci Maritimo, The breakfast felt like it was not fresh avoid the eggs The staff like cleaning staff doesn t speak a word of English and you have to chase them away if they don t get you want to stay in the room WITHOUT them in the way of Come back later please , The overall service was pretty good if you except some people 
372164,Vincci Maritimo, Everything was great , Hotel was 4 stars but actually it s a 5 star establishment rooms were first class clean large and modern check in was a brisk hotel is 50 meter walking distance to Diagsnol Mar Mall room rate was best in Barcelona for its class I would highly recommend this hotel 
372165,Vincci Maritimo,No Negative, Lovely friendly staff good size rooms nicely decorated and presented Breakfast may seem a little expensive but well worth it fab selection of quality produce everything you could wish for and as much as you like worth paying the extra few euros
