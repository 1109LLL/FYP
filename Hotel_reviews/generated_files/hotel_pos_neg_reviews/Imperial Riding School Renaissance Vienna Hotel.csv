468194,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, This is the only real negative the bedrooms need redecorating ours had wallpaper peeling off the walls in several places and so did some of the rooms for other members of our party , The public areas of the hotel are excellent There is an inside restaurant and also an outdoor eating and drinking area There is an indoor pool and a garden area for sunbathing There is also a sauna steam room and gym which are all free for hotel guests We found all staff to be very customer focused 
468195,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, We did not have Wifi access but when we asked Staff was very helpful and sorted our Wifi by joining us to the Marriott reward scheme which was free , Our stay in Vienna was enhanced by staying at this hotel It had everything we were looking for In spite of temperatures over 30C the air conditioning made the room pleasant in an instant We were on the 6th floor and did not get disturbed with any noises could barely make out the tram that passed beside the hotel The king size bed was divine the fittings luxurious The minibar was useful to cool our own drinks and fruit Top marks for the pool which was the highlight at the end of a hot day in town Although small 11 metres long it was never too full as people took their turn There were ample loungers around the pool and also in the large garden together with tables and chairs and parasols The poolside staff catered to all your needs and delivered drinks and coffee cake which was only 4 80 EURO very reasonable On the other side of the hotel the garden was used as an extension of the restaurant we were able to breakfast outdoor under the trees a great pleasure or in the conservatory Breakfast was on until 11am every day which allowed me to go for a leisurely swim first At night there was entertainment in their City Garden once or twice a week Our favourite hang out at night was the Salm Brau Microbrewery right beside the entrance to the Belvedere Gardens about 5 mins from the Hotel Their rustic courtyard restaurant was always busy and they served food until 11pm If busy there is always room indoor as we found out when we were looking for a bite to eat after a late concert one night It was very convenient to get to the Hotel S7 train to Rennweg Station and luckily we took the right exit that brought us up right next door to the Hotel Trains to and from the Airport are every half hour We found public transport very well organised vast underground passes which made it easy to travel across the city 
468196,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, The hotel reserves the whole price of the stay on the credit card already during check in plus 150 eur extra which will be released later but you have to take that into account when booking this hotel Also when you stay in the club room you have to take note that a breakfast in the main building is not included in the price I did not know that but the hotel did not luckily charge us as we used it only once , Club room was very nice and the club lounge with snacks and drinks a very good addition It was a really good decision to book it it was worth the higher price The reception staff is really helpful and polite Overall a very good customer service experience 
468197,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, I didn t like that you could only have the business lounge breakfast and not the main one without paying My room was cleaned ok but details where missed and my mini bar was not replenished 2 days in a row Asked for an iron from the front desk when it didn t come I rang up and reception was a little rude, I liked the business lounge
468198,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, The hotel houses airline crews from many airlines and the reception area is too busy to handle them my point is they also need to concentrate on the other guests Front desk staffs are fully occupied with airline crews and no one seem to bother about rest of the guests , The location is good nice spa facilities and pool 
468199,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, There was no English speaking films or programmes available only News programmes which we found dissapointing The hotel management of taxis to the airport was nonexistent we ordered a taxi and the driver said he was for us he wasn t and we had to return to the hotel very annoying , The staff were friendly and helpful the room comfortable location good
468200,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Location of the hotel is not in the very heart of the city therefore taxi Uber or public transportation is a requirement to access other parts of Vienna for those not wanting to take longer walks The underground parking garage is pricy EUR 32 per day compared to other hotels or options The internet access is complicated to set up would expect complimentary hassle free service nowadays We haven t really watched television but the screen size and programme quality was below the expectations Again electronics technology would deserve some improvement , Breakfast quality and selection was beyond expectations and were able to accommodate healthy and not so healthy desires The room rate was relatively fair to other accommodation options in Vienna However not in located in the city centre the proximity of the Botanical Gardens and Belvedere offers a great walk and time off right around the corner The hotel lobby is offering a nice hang off place for short time breaks as well as the maintained garden for even sunbathing between visiting attractions 
468201,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, My only complaint is the pay wifi Wifi service should be free especially at the prices charged by this hotel The bathroom was clean and spacious but offered almost no protection from water leaking from the shower making the floor a swimming pool each time Why cant hotels just get this one thing right , Service in the restaurant was excellent as was the buffet breakfast itself Very nice polite and friendly staff Nice lobby with a very nice bar and staff 
468202,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, No breakfast variation wrong info at desk cold food loud and noisy room meet vacuumed not dusted on a week Had to write notes to get clean glasses toilet paper 90 of the time we poured our own coffee , The bed
468203,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Prices fairly expensive very little included no free wi fi or TV in rooms hotel South of main area and neighbourhood not brilliant , Nice hotel good sized beds
468204,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, the cleaning people were a bit too pushy check out was at 12 and since 9 am someone came 4 5 times to ask if we are still there , overall atmosphere comfortable rooms beds nicely equipped gym
468205,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Dinner menu poor food very bland Did not have breakfast as too expensive not justified as we don t eat too much for breakfast , Comfortable bed 
468206,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel,No Negative, Great location and lovely bar in the garden Good cocktails in the foyer bar too Beds were very comfortable and the room a good size Breakfast not included so went to Chilai just up the road which has a great range of breakfasts and the coffee is FAB Chilai open on a Sunday from 8am 
468207,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, The swimming pool was freezing and very uninviting we had been looking forward to a relaxing swim in between sightseeing disappointing The cleaning of the room was very poor The television came as a package very strange it did not work and there was no signal therefore no movies The music in the main lobby was to loud and intrusive in the reception area difficult to communicate , The breakfast was gorgeous smoked salmon and a choice of eggs well balanced and very fresh Staff at reception were helpful for directions 
468208,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Beds could have been more comfortable , Rooms are clean and comfortable Nice gym and pool Lovely host at breakfast Breakfast is very good lots of options 
468209,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, No tea coffee or kettle in the room the air con wasn t the best and the shower was a bit rubbish in the bathroom Also i felt they are a bit stingy with the free toiletries silly but i would use the soap in the shower and rather than give us another one for washing our hands they would move it back to the soap dish every day All very silly little things All the above didnt really matter What did upset me was how rude the lady in the swimming pool area was I asked for a towel and it was a huge inconvenience to her to simply pass me a towel I didnt dare ask for a robe as well Also there is a big sign saying remove swimwear in the sauna THAT IS DISGUSTING , Size of the room was really good size of bed was fantastic room was clean and location was perfect for us Also they gave us an iron free of charge and showed us how to get free wifi 
468210,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Although if my German understands it there was a notice in the locker room of the health suite about nudity in the mixed sauna being forbidden there were still fully naked men hogging the sauna and no one was supervising this although there were two receptionists on duty This is something which frequently goes on in European hotels and needs to be monitored At the hotel in Berlin recently this was happening at 4 o clock in the afternoon while women and a 5 year old female child were around which upset the child It is selfish behaviour and hotels need to have segregated saunas as they always do in Finland and separate times for using the plunge pools , The staff are extremely courteous and attentive the facilities are very good and the ambience and space in the hotel are unique 
468211,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Design beyond the lobby floors less than a 2 stars hotel appearance specially a very long not ending corridors with very poor design that needs a complete restoration and new design Broken damaged and not repaired door corners Used breakfast plateau in front of a guest door ugliest most disgusting not hygienic thing in a hotel Not even a welcoming small bottle of water in the room Electrical water heater in the room but no tea no coffee At the lobby a luxurious shop buying fur coats but 2 persons inside playing tric trac was very chocky to be seen Taking photos of the beautiful church nearby within the hotel photos just to promote the hotel outside appearence on the internet is not fair at all Letting guest to write their name the country origin on a paper signaling 28 for breakfast than to sign up EVERY MORNING before the breakfast was somewhat offensive not ethical specially if someone had already booked with a B B facilities , Reception personal excellent Breakfast enjoyable Lobby architecture good 
468212,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Nothing to add in this section, Fantastic breakfast and Imperial club lounge access was excellent All staff were so friendly and took time to assist Our room was in the Imperial club it was lovely spotlessly clean fresh and cosy We are delighted with our experience would love to go back 
468213,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Some things were a bit outdated like the oldest phones in the room I ve seen in a while a TV that could be a newer model and the ventilation made very strange and loud sounds a couple times which made me wake up during the night Luckily enough the bed itself was so comfortable that I fell right back to sleep , The bed was unbelievable They even have a little pamphlet about it and they weren t wrong best sleep I ve had in a while Very easy to get to from the station and a beautiful building Their selection of shampoo conditioner etc was amazing 
468214,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, well not having free WiFi in a room is getting old even for 2017 hotel is clean but a bit dated You can see mold in the bathroom windows weren t that clean some other imperfections here and there they completely ignored my booking request on a quiet room as I was traveling for business A young girl at the reception was even surprised there was any request She did not attempt to fix it at the spot either sauna they call it a spa and charge extra for it Old facilities very small packed with people poorly managed the floor is wet everywhere there is no one to dry it every once in a while we spent 3 hours there Not a Spa not by today s industry standards that unfriendly personnel in the restaurant wow even rude sometimes 2 men at the omelet station They must hate making those eggs for people , Some things are really great location close to Belvedere the center is walking distance as well breakfast apart from the unfriendly or even hostile chefs on the omelet station having fresh omelet was great though comfortable beds most of the personnel is helpful room service getting a taxi all is easy 
468215,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel,No Negative, A fairly modern impersonal hotel 15 minutes walk from Vienna centre Ok if you don t mind walking Had a nice garden area if you wanted to sit outside The staff were helpful but I had to become a member of Marriott hotel s loyalty scheme to get free Wifi which shouldn t be necessary in this type of hotel Breakfast was good and plenty of options and staff dealt with wifi queries well 
468216,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, It was all good , Breakfast is really good with quite a variety to choose from Dinner menu was delicious We especially enjoyed the potato soup My husband liked it so much for three nights in a row that the waitress asked the chef for the recipe and he wrote it down for us Salsa night was entertaining at the hotel One of the highlights was attending the Mozart Strauss Concert at the Kursalon Wien The opera singers ballet dancers and orchestra was fabulous Visiting the castles is a history highlight 
468217,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, On arrival we were told that we could not have a twin club room for our whole stay as our Booking com reservation was only a preference and not guaranteed I have booked many rooms and have never had this problem before This was very disappointing given that I had also messaged the hotel in advance about our room preference The reservation staff tried hard to fix our problem and about an hour after check in they visited us with the welcome news that we could remain in the same room for the duration of our stay they also brought drinks cake and fruit I have no idea how they sorted this but would like to say thank you very much , I chose a twin club room with lounge access as I was travelling with my 80 year old mother so knew we would probably spend a fair amount of time in the hotel between trips The room was spacious and the beds were really comfortable Access to the lounge with its numerous snacks and drinks was fabulous The staff were very friendly and helpful 
468218,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, The halls and main rooms look very dated The rooms are nice once you get inside but you feel like you re in an old dorm and not the Renaissance as you re getting from the lobby to your room , Super friendly staff upon arrival Nice lobby and bar 
468219,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Overall I would stay here again There are some minor issues but you should focus on the positive comments I ve made it s a shame the negative ones get top billing on this site The swimming pool and changing facilities are small and the pool was a bit too chilly for me The temperature control in our room was non existent other than for warming up which was unfortunate because it was 20 degrees outside and certainly not needed Even after turning off the heating and opening the windows the room was very warm They did offer us a fan though In the summer they will have changed the air conditioning over to cool so it was really only a problem because of a hot week in spring , The breakfast was tremendous so much variety and very good quality We used this as our main meal of the day and just topped up with kaffe und kuchen in Vienna s many coffee shops Ideal Staff are friendly helpful and courteous particularly at the front desk and in the bar restaurants The location is excellent right next to Rennweg train station and lots of tram stops so getting around the city was a breeze 
468220,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Location of the hotel a little far from center 25 minute walk, Bed and room very comfortable Pool tricky in terms of changing area shower didn t seem connected well But the pool itself was very nice 
468221,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, No tea and coffee in the room, A great choice at breakfast Even a bottle of vodka for a Bloody Mary Rooms were a good size and beds very comfortable Staff attentive and friendly Good service from everyone A great atmosphere We all hope to return for a second trip 
468222,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Wifi wasn t free Location wasn t very central but hotel worth travelling further for , Fantastic breakfast and staff couldn t of been more helpful 
468223,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Nothing really apart from the pool was a little cold, On arrival we were greeted by a lovely and enthusiastic lady on reception called Katherina We explained it was our first time to Vienna and it was a birthday treat for myself On our return on the second day there was a complimentary bottle of Prosecco and a cake from Katherina and staff Very welcome and appreciated 
468224,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Staying there last we were unpleasantly surprised by the several things value for money The quality of rooms is way below the price Rooms need renovation they are shabby some places wall paper comes off the walls doors look like from 10 years ago we had to pay extra 39 for our sons bed even though in the past it was never the case , We ve been staying in this hotel for last year stayed first time about a year ago and liked its location value for money I personally liked their beds very much Staff was always friendly and helpful 
468225,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, The cost of breakfast 28 Euros is very high You can get a very good full breakfast at less than 10 Euros just next to the hotel , The staff is wonderful 
468226,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, 15 EURO charge for wi fi in the room In the 21st century This would be a joke if it wouldn t have been so outlandishly expensive , Nice ambiance in the lobby 
468227,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Did not include free Wi Fi access in rooms TV access was complicated to figure out Hard to figure out temperature control in the room , Breakfast with American style coffee Ice machines Comfortable bedding Clean 
468228,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, the sauna was untidy and crowded which was a great disappointment to us as we especially like a sauna after a day of 9 degrees, friendliness of the staff easy transfer via train to airport
468229,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, no free wifi just in the lobby if you want it in the room you have to pay the women on the reception did not explain when is the breakfast where the pool is where we can get the bath stuff for the pool we had to pay 50 per day for insurence we got it back but noone told us , Good position nice rooms big choice for breakfast
468230,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel,No Negative, The girl who did our check in was excellent good location 10 m near the station metro bus etc excellent hotel i will return to it for sure 
468231,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Ridiculously the hotel charges for wifi and the sum itself is ridiculous This can be avoided by becoming a Marriott member something that is free but then you have to go through a process that proves to be a painful rigmarole on a mobile The internet connection itself then proved to be poor There was nothing in the fridge bar and no complementary water tea coffee or kettle in the room For a visitor like myself who is used to travelling in central Asia China and poorer parts of central Europe where all of this is par for the course this is pretty frustrating you wonder what other problems will emerge I avoided finding out other disappointments by taking my custom elsewhere and not having the very expensive breakfast for example Slippers are another thing that would be standard for a moderate hotel in Kazakhstan or China for example but weren t available here but that s just a minor issue Overall the entrance to the hotel looks nice but the decor in the long corridors ages the establishment The staff were pleasant but fell short on some pretty standard questions , The bed was very good and the room was quiet The location close to the Belvedere and under the cupola of the Russian church is very nice The rooms are relatively big other hotels in the same price category are less generous in metres squared 
468232,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Our room was right on the street which was noisy after we asked for a quiet room Also tv had no English channels although this is a very minor problem as we don t usually go away to watch TV , Glad we choose an imperial room The hotel was very clean and our room had everything we needed and was a great size The food and drink throughout the day in the Imperial lounge was great with the staff refreshing the choices and clearing tables 
468233,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, We could not sleep because of the christmastree seller from early in the mor ing till late throwing things against our window what keep us a wake the staff only said sorry thet better give you a refund Breakfast food was very good but no table and when you had one it was not cleaned or no cups for coffee etc thats not good if you see you pay 28euro a person, Clean big room good location 
468234,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, nothing, The best things about this hotel is 3 nice ladies Ms Doris Vivien and Felicitas in the Executive Lounge they were attentive helpful very friendly 
468235,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, No kettle and tea coffee in the room Restaurant and bar were so expensive we didn t eat or drink there , Location cleanliness large bedroom the staff were all very polite and knowledgeable 
468236,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, It is in a good location but it isn t right in the centre so need to be prepared to use trams 10 mins or subway to see the sights Or you can walk into the centre in about half an hour , Room very quiet spacious and very comfortable bed Breakfast excellent massive buffet choice The best breakfast I ve had in a hotel All the staff were charming and helpful 
468237,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Paid internet except for a small section of the hotel lobby covered by WiFi signal, Stylish hotel abundant breakfast very nice and helpful personnel good location possibility of paid parking garage that can be reached by the hotel elevator
468238,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, to revert to hot food each night not every other night this started in the summer when we visited in October there was cold salad and soup every other night, The Executive lounge opened from 6 a m to midnight giving a good choice of snacks hot and cold meals and drinks including wine and beer
468239,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Could have been slightly nearer the city centre but we made it work by using the trams , Big rooms great service the club facilities were spot on Coffee and cake all day nearly
468240,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, In order to get free Wi Fi in the room you need to book high priced Club Room Despite of that your min bar would not be complimentary Wow I remember it was free just a few years go , Good clean pool
468241,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel,No Negative, Located next to a connecting station with the Airport S7 train which for an small extra charge means the Vienna transport card pays for it Near the tram 71 which takes you to all the major sites and connects with thUbahn 
468242,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Eating area loud Some breakfast food gone when we went to eat Swim pool small Room was too cold during day and too hot at night Reception Foyer was constantly full of business tours it wasn t relaxing being there , Comfy bed Cleaning lady for our bedroom was lovely Friendly helpful staff Was given upgrade for our special occasion and treated very well 
468243,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, On the last day the main breakfast room was reserved for a larger group and although there was plenty of space to receive us in the main breakfast room we were directed to have breakfast in a smaller less comfortable room which clearly was not ideally equipped for serving breakfast Service was a bit clumsy that day The other two days however breakfast was delightful and flawless , Excellent breakfast Good beds Quiet and spacey rooms Direct train access to the airport as it is located at the Rennweg train station Attentive staff 
468244,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel,No Negative, Hotel was very near the Tram stop which was ideal getting around Vienna We bought a 72 hour ticket which meant we could Hop on and Off The breakfast was great with plenty of choice The bed was extremely comfortable 
468245,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, BEWARE The security of the hotel is not good There were outsiders who were lurking to the unattended bags of our friends They have even tried to steal and a friend of us was hurt since she stopped them from taking the bags The hotel should have CCTV or security to allow hotel guests only to certain floors or limited access to the hotel facilities , The hotel facilities was amazing The room is very tidy The breakfast was great 
468246,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Absolutely shocking that wifi is charged at all let alone at such a high rate Further charges for movies on TV then an extortionate additional charge for breakfast which they just assume you ll want Food nowhere near worth that price , Room pleasant and pool nice though a bit small Certain staff members very nice 
468247,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, The bathroom was flooded each time we showered Too far from main tourist attractions in the city Check in took a long time as they seem to have trouble finding my booking , The beds were comfortable and the room clean
468248,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, The room we had booked was not available and they were not very helpful resolving the problem in a satisfactory manner Our option was to get a downgraded room or have a sofa bed in the room We were offered no compensation and had to ask for a refund for the difference in the room rates This has still not been paid ,No Positive
468249,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Nothing , Everything was amazing We had imperial room free high wi fi free bar Also some free snacks drinks all day long non alc in the afternoon and alcohol drinks in the evening wine beer Free fitness and pool So we are excited that we chose this hotel and especially this imperial room and close to the center for sure 
468250,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel,No Negative, The Salsa evening and entertainment on offer nice touch The pool is always an excellent amenity and the reception staff were extremely pleasant The reception staff left a really good impression We are definitely thinking of returning to Vienna if not this year then early 2017 I think Vienna is easily one of the most impressive and interesting cities I have visited in Europe Your hotel will be the first we will check to see if you have availability 
468251,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is in a very good location just next to a train station and a few minutes by walk from the city centre The facilities are really good and include sauna pool gym and a marvellous lounge The rooms are really big and the beds are super comfortable The hotel restaurant has good dishes and there are quite a lot of good restaurants around All in all it we were really pleased with the experience 
468252,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, it was really unpleasant the fact that we went there and were informed that the visa card we gave wasn t for payment so we had to pay on the spot Then I gave my visa two time and was declined while it worked just fine in other places As a result I paid cash and they still hold half amount of the payment that I have already paid by cash in my card until this day without me knowing something that I think I saw in the reviews from someone else as well before we went so checking their visas could save them and the tourists lots of trouble I found that to be quite a mistake because I tried to get that money out on the last day of my holidays and couldn t not even knowing why Good thing I had more cash with me Overall it was a very good stay we used the pool the pool and the rooms were good just a bit smaller than the pictures I didn t try the sauna but the fact that they closed the facilities at 22 00 it was a big plus, the bed was very comfy and the staff more than willing to answer every question we had a perfect 10 for that Not quite near to stephansdom but its close to belvedere castle and has a metro station right next to the hotel 
468253,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Arrived at the hotel at around 6pm only to be told that our club room wasn t ready Apparently it hadn t yet been cleaned We were told to go away for an hour or two and eat and then come back A complimentary coffee or drink offered after a long journey would have been appreciated but it wasn t offered Eventually our room was ready at 8pm Not satisfactory Very very expensive for drinks and food in this hotel , Staff were pleasant in all areas Good variety of breakfast dishes Good location we felt very safe walking around in the evening 
468254,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Paid wifi Free in lobby though Normal breakfast offer seems a bit exorbitant so I did not use the option , Beds I go for the beds Nice hotel I enjoy being in this hotel 
468255,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Photo of swimming pool leads you to believe that it is a big swimming pool IT IS NOT hotel older that what it looks on booking, Breakfast wide choice high quality of product and until 11 00
468256,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, The distance to the town centre was slightly farther than expeced although the tramstation at Rennweg was within a 5 minute walk , The overall fabric and quality of the furnishings were good 
468257,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, smokers standing right next to front entrance some train noise as hotel situated next to Rennweg station, Executive lounge food and drinks available all day till late excellent value having a pool very useful in hot weather
468258,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, The hotel staff look like they are very unhappy to work there They are all very curt and unwilling to help The breakfast is horrible And I stayed in the Exclusive area The hotel lobby is run down and the restaurant is smelly and old Would not recommend for this price , I like the location and the easy access to public transportation 
468259,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Mattress i brand newly decorated room was very uncomfortable How can that be We dont know Terrible backaches Everything else superb , The hospitality room open to Deluxe Room occupiers was handy and superb Taxis came withi 2 minutes Staff very courteous Nice room Nice surroundings 
468260,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, room wifi is not free of charge which is not shown on booking com before you place the order The receptionist talked to the manager and exempted the charge , A nice hotel worthy the money great location 2 minutes walk to the train station very convenient the breakfast is fabulous Swimming pool is a nice plus 
468261,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, everyday there was a collection of dirty bottles and glasses in the passage outside our room Clearly this is where house keeping felt it was appropriate to store dirty things I personally cannot see it as acceptable to store dirty crockery in the passage In the evenings there were groups of students playing guitar and doing singsongs in the public areas This is very much a hostel rather than a hotel Please see then photos for the typical appearance of the passage outside our room , um what did I like Well the bed was comfortable 
468262,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, far from center parking expensive after a week staying in various b bs this felt like standard hotel missing little touches Would stay here again for business not necessarily for pleasure, bbq restaurant was great proximity to belevedere a plus pool was big and open early
468263,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Booking direct with Marriott which would have earned me points easy free wi fi and potentially upgrades Not blaming Booking but you should note , Breakfast was very good
468264,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, This hotel has so much potential but Oldish deco room not that clean and shower door broken am on crutches and was sent to the Farthest room possible However very helpful bell service , Very nice garden party pool gym surrounding architecture
468265,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel,No Negative, We stayed at the Imperial club and liked the big room and the access to the lounge Comfortable beds Nice staff We didn t use the facilities in the hotel building 
468266,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, I don t like complaining and we weren t too bothered but the room wasn t cleaned everyday and the coffee tea making facilities weren t replenished without asking , The staff were lovely and recommended fabulous restaurants the location was perfect and the ease of getting around thank you for allocating a ground floor room and disabled facilities the bed was amazing Breakfast and the restaurant was excellent 
468267,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Paying for parking Internet not automatically free in the evening we were asked to move to another part of the lobby No background music in bar area , Room exeptioal
468268,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, the staff on check in the guy was ok but when I asked if we had single beds or a double he was not polite on his reply on check out the woman was moody and no smile and when I was asked if I enjoyed my stay I said it was ok small ok then she looked shocked and started to be more friendly I had little time to tell her so here it is regardless of it being in Vienna there is no excuse for unfriendliness especially at reception or in any service industry anywhere in the world On Saturday evening it took 25 minutes to be served 1 drink 1 drink at one point there were 4 staff members behind a tiny bar area not doing much there were not that many drinks poured to customers either they were disorganized there was no system and because of this they served who ever was in front of them which was not always the first person waiting I have to say that even though I had a long wait they bar staff were friendly when they did serve For this standard of hotel I expect friendly staff at reception and bar service quicker than that , the beds were amazing and very comfortable the rooms were big and shower great 
468269,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, The t v didnt work properly and I like to keep up with the news while I am out of the UK The internet connection in our room was not reliable, Good stylish hotel with helpful well informed staff all with good command of English As my german is school standard I found the staff s language ability very helpful
468270,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, You have to pay to watch TV You have to pay to have WiFi You have too many hidden costs and the location is quite a way from main attractions , The room was comfortable 
468271,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Chilly in room even with the aircon off although I did have a fluctuating temperature Sauna and steam room confused people some had towels round their waist others were naked Bottled water at the hotel was 7 5 to 10 cheaper to drink wine and anything else really, Restaurant was nice ate there two nights rooms were good king size bed was nice Staff were faultless
468272,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Very expensive for the facilities it offers Very far from tourist attractions no proper swimming pool no proper bar or restaurant Hotel doesn t even offe free wifi or breakfast for the price we pay , cleanliness and the room quality 
468273,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Pool was a little cold and you have to be aware of the more relaxed European attitude towards nakedness , Lovely hotel in good quiet location only 4 stops on tram to the city centre Staff were all polite and helpful at all times We were upgraded to a junior suite which was lovely and had access to the lounge with drinks and snacks included marvellous Riesling Excellent choice at breakfast and great cocktails at the bar Would definitely recommend and stay again 
468274,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, The person at the checking lied twice to me saying that the mistake business package included when not requested or used had been taken out of my bill he closed the enveloppe with the bill When i opened the enveloppe at the lift this was still included He then said he had deducted it another way i insisted and another member of staff gave me a credit card credit Mistakes happen three lies should never happen , All fine except an essential point honesty the overall score should therefore be below 5 
468275,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, breakfast was rather expensive 28 Euro Even with a special offer we could get a nice breakfast for less money for two people down the street Wifi was also supposed to cost extra in the room in a time when one can get free wifi in most caf s that seemed a bit silly , good beds very comfortable Convenient to the S bahn and airport walking distance to the downtown core Location was also quiet at the back of building 
468276,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Location not that near main attractions Have to pay 14 95 extra per day for internet swimming pool and sauna not open until 10am Kettle in room only provided on request and tea and coffee not replenished , Bed was incredibly comfortable Staff friendly and helpful Spacious Close to U bahn station 
468277,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, We had to leave a 50 for each night we stayed even though I had pre paid Seeing as we stayed for three nights this was a fair bit of money It then took four days after we checked up for the money to released back into my account The pool is also a little cold and you had to be naked to go into the sauna The air con in the room wasn t great so we were boiling in the night despite it being almost zero degrees outside , The hotel s interior is incredibly impressive and the rooms were lovely with very comfy beds The bar in the lobby had a good sitting area and wasn t too expensive compared to restaurants either The swimming pool was clean with plenty of loungers around it 
468278,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, we travelled with friends asked for 2 rooms on the same floor with big beds upon arrival we realized they didn t keep us the rooms requested the receptionist did his very best to give us very nice rooms although no on the same floor to bad there is no WIFI in the rooms I do think paying for this service is unnecessary other then that we had a great time , great location minutes from the train station with line to the airport very rich breakfast very elegant rooms and comfortable bed hellpfull staff

468281,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, We were given a key to a room that already had a guest in it and were told that the room would be free because of that The front desk then went bad on it s promise , Everything was perfect with an exception of how the staff dealt with an issue of giving us a key to a room that already had a guest 
468282,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, there was no kettle or iron in the room, the staff at check in were very friendly and helpful Breakfast was good It was a pleasant walk to the nearby attractions 
468283,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, None of the hot breakfast food was ever really hot barely reaching tepid if lucky This didn t change throughout our stay despite raising it as a potential health issue with the staff Opt for the cold breakfast and eat out for cheaper food and drinks which were expensive , Lovely hotel within 15min walk of city centre and accessible by train Super atmosphere clean and quiet The staff were very friendly and we had an enjoyable and restful stay 
468284,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Reception staff had charged me during check out a mini bar although I did not use it First the receptionist has charged me sum up and when I noticed it she said that mistakenly charged amount will be refunded to my account I hope Internet in the room for a fee The hotel with 4 should be offer an internet in the room free of charge , Perfect breakfast with a lot of choice
468285,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, The pool needs serious renovation and extension the site and pictures do not show it is really a mini pool especially for the luxury branding they advertise and for the size of the place, The room and the bathroom were nice also the club lounge was great as you can get some snacks and drinks always and also daily re stocked minibar was great
468286,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Leaving, Friendly staff Breakfast top drawer Near to centre of town and 100m from train stop Rennweg which has a direct link to Airport 20 min and 2 20 euro one way 
468287,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, grossly overpriced hotel tired decor filthy carpets in rooms and corridors grumpy and exceptionally unfriendly staff small overcrowded pool, Location buffet breakfast range of food

468297,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, The saunas and fitness room looked a bit outdated and There were many people from outside the hotel which made it crowded, Great location The suite we booked was spacious nicely furnished and i liked it that the minibar was included in the room rate Besides that the lounge acces adds value to the package
468298,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel,No Negative, Great location a short walk from the Belvedere Palace and all the sights Comfortable room great breakfast Make sure you get it included as it is expensive otherwise The gym is well equipped The pool is small Nice sauna and steam room Would stay there again 
468299,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, hotel is old and you can feel it restaurant was worse than a typical tourist trap staff don t know how to work their own parking system , Hotel was clean 
468300,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Nothing which I remember maybe for the internet sometime was working sometime not , Everything was perfect and the best of all is the access of the Business Lounge

468302,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Extra charges for internet a bit too much for that as well Check in took forever , The bed was way too comfortable like a cloud i didn t wanna get up Room was nice ans clean Good location
468303,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Personal nicht so hilfreich Problems with the lifts Wrong booking for the restaurant We ve been asked to leave the restaurant at 10 50 because they arr closing st 11 00 They went to every table for it This is a no go for this type of ranking hotel,No Positive
468304,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Internet connection not for free in the room this is something medieval and a shame not really acceptable in 2015 Tv did not work fine breakfast for 28 room for 2people but with just 1soap and not refilled every day Window half broken poor value for money although we heard that Vienna is expensive 139 per night with no internet no breakfast not even a water bottle for compliments or tea facility view on a busy highway street , Not far from city center
468305,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, It wasn t a huge detractor but the Imperial Club section of the hotel was completely separate to the main part of the hotel It might bother some guests , Location equidistant between Wien Station and Central Vienna Great transport links tram 71 straight into town Executive lounge Room 912 very large comfortable well appointed Impeccably clean Good Wi Fi in public areas Staff very helpful

468308,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Wi Fi is still treated by the hotel as source of revenue it is not free in guests room , Unlike other Renaissance Vienna Hotel this hotel still has a nice swimming pool
468309,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel,No Negative, The Imperial Riding School is a walk away from the Belvedere It is centrally located if the point of your journey is to see concerts and art We also liked the lounge suites we got with full consumption of the minibar and access to the Imperial Club Lounge included in the rates Breakfast snacks and even high tea are all included in the lounge plus premium spirits and wines Value for money is high 
468310,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, internal finishes in room rather dated and in restaurant check out with new staff member was tedious as mistakes made in billing, with the suite booked there was use of club lounge throughout the day we arrived early and were found a room immediately by helpful reception staff member and even offered breakfast Room had exceptionally comfortable bed 
468311,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Staff and manager on duty not very cooperative when we approached them about our non working keycard Still allowed to smoke at the Arsenal Bar Restaurant 14 95 for 24hrs WiFi at room must be a record , Nice rooms Very nice breakfast buffet Friendly staff in general

468314,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, I was expecting walking distance from old , While the location is a more than a brisk walk away from old town the trolley car about 2 blocks from the hotel does stop about a 1 block from the Hadsburg Palace 
468315,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, No tea and coffee in the room and no free wi fi in the room Hard to believe that some hotels are still trying to charge 40 for wi fi access in the room , Very nice hotel good location for access to transport 
468316,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, very expensive in the bar 7 5 Euros for a bottle of water Expensive breakfast Under average quality on food and service in the restaurant Poor quality in the turist service desk lady working there informed us that she was not able to recomend anything like concerts etc since she spent all her time at work , nice breakfast close to the tram so city center is easilly reached
468317,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, was all a little tired looking and areas in need of an update Club lounge greed and wastefulness but that s nothing to do with the hotel just the guest behaviour , Close proximity to parking access to club lounge was just ok but our room was in the other building to the club lounge Room rate had free wifi and complimentary minibar but had to make this explicit x twice on arrival 
468318,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, no information on the hotel at the check in nor in the room time of breakfast restaurant hotel services etc no slippers sewing kit and shoe cleaner in the room , breakfast
468319,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, This is astonishingly poor value for money Despite the high price tag the room facilities are decidedly average and many things come at an additional cost the TV and parking for example I really do not know what you are paying for here so much so we cut our visit short It felt soul less and stuffy and there were no tea coffee facilities in the room ,No Positive
468320,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, There was no down side to this location, The location of the hotel right next to Rennweg railway station which was so easy to get to from the airport on the S7 We were a 5 minute walk from Belvedere castle and it was a 20 minute stroll into the city centre The hotel was very clean and the staff very friendly and helpful We will use this hotel for our next visit to Vienna
468321,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Everything was great I had no complaints, Room was nice and quiet and night and beds lovely and comfortable Good restaurants nearby and near the U and S bahns Lots of choice at breakfast time
468322,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Confusion over available dinner menu in garden and then our order was lost Very long wait and we were left feeling embarrassed as others received their meal and we were pretty much ignored There seemed to be a grumpy approach from the woman and a fantastic approach from the man Left a bad taste in our mouth as this was our last evening in Vienna ,No Positive
468323,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, i wonder why WIFI is only free at the lobby and on charge in rooms the result of this is that by evening you will find mostly all hotel residence are in the lobby surfing net this actually what happenes, everything

468327,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, Slightly Disappointed with spa facilities They didn t match the standard of the rest of the hotel Also we Kept banging our head on towel shelf in shower , Great bed Good access to food and drink in Imperial club Super breakfast 
468328,Imperial Riding School Renaissance Vienna Hotel, We had booked with the understanding we would have two beds but the hotel had accepted a large tourist group and tried to give us a queen sized bed It was disappointing to have to have words with the staff after arriving following a long train ride Luckily we had the paper trail , The hotel was clean and reasonably located near trams and The Belvedare Museum The wifi in the lobby was disappointing no kettle in the room was more disappointing and a cup of tea at five euros quite disappointing The air conditioning was good
