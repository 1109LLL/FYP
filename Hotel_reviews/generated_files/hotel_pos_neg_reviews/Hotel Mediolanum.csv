481975,Hotel Mediolanum, Not the first one saying this very small bathroom this is a pretty average height and weight person complaining Also it wouldn t hurt if they would update the furniture but it wasn t bad And if you are a light sleeper better avoid the 4th floor rooms with the street view walls are thinner there than the rest of the building and the noise was quite excessive , The location was perfect very close to everything you need Central Station metro stations shopping streets cafes bars The most charming street view Also the staff were amazing people and the cleaning team did an outstanding job

481979,Hotel Mediolanum, Tha mattress on the bed is no good anymore The chairs in the breakfast room are too low Th benches are ok , Almost everything Good location near central train station but not too far from the Duomo Quiet and lovely neighbourhood with eating options around very helpful staff great breakfast nicely designed loby bar and rooms clean comfortable room
481980,Hotel Mediolanum, the bathroom was small the maids kept taking my extra towels i asked for every morning signing people in like i was in a college dorm proved to be insulting seeing how i have lodged at 4 star hotels or higher without that hassle getting in and out of the building at early mornings depended on an attendant being at the desk it was like i was visiting someone in prison I didn t get a good gist of the kitchen and it s possibilities the snack bar was a joke the room lighting options were something out of a whore house , the breakfast was probably the best part the internet connection was strong
481981,Hotel Mediolanum, Air conditioning would not go down to cool and therefore the room was too hot for me but my wife found it OK Small shower size as compared to what we have at home but it was OK , This hotel was a little bit out of the middle of the city say 20 minute walk but there was public transport into town Close by shops if you are into shopping Close by the main railway station 10 minute close walk Breakfast was included when we stayed Street was not noisy

481986,Hotel Mediolanum, In this day and age security is important so having cctv among others within premises is imperative My stay would ve been more comfortable along with peace of mind having the Cctv around Please do others a favor of installing asap and having more aware staff , We arrived at night so location was alright there are cafes a small grocery and the train station is nearby The breakfast spread was wider than some but could improve on taste and coffee
