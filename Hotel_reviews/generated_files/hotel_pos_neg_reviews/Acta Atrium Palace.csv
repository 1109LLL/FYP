330831,Acta Atrium Palace, Honestly its the most homophobic hotel i have ever been to I was there with my partner and my friends and they asked for an upgrade we did too as it was our anniversary the difference was they were heterosexual they got an upgrade we voiced our opinion to the reception tastefully and honestly Unfortunately she was extremely rude and simply rejected us , The restaurants around the hotel were nice
330832,Acta Atrium Palace, Had a room on the 3 rd floor facing away from the street which was good as the rooms are not very well insulated for sound You get a fair degree of distrurbing noise from people in adjoining rooms or in the hallway , Good breakfast and a great location Close to the sitt center Close to public transportation
330833,Acta Atrium Palace, Cleanliness was below average view is the backyard of buildings which was very poor ugly the hotel is nice and location very convenient yet a lot can be done to improve the quality of service especially cleaning and room amenities , Location convenient friendly staff

330859,Acta Atrium Palace, what a badly run place i don t even know where to start called reception as cleaning staff had forgotten to replace toilet paper cleaning lady comes up with just one third of a toilet paper roll that she probably took from the neighbor the day after the depleted face towel box hadn t been filled called reception again on yet another day soap and toiletries were missing and the absolute disaster was the total mismanagement on the part of hotel staff of the crisis after a fire that broke out in the sauna , location comfy bed

330882,Acta Atrium Palace,No Negative, I honestly never write reviews for the places I stay in but my stay with Atrium Palace was so perfect my friends and I were adamant we had to write a review The hotel staff were amazing and extremely helpful We were only in Barcelona for the weekend so we asked them for places to eat and where to go Moises helped us find our way around The location was perfect it was on a quieter street to la ramblas but everything was within walking distance It was probably a 10 minute walk to the aerobus which takes you straight to the airport All attractions are close by from sagrada familia to local parks the only place you will probably have to travel a little extra for is park Guell I could not recommend this hotel enough the extra touches in the room walking us out to the taxi under an umbrella to 24 hour room service ordered pizza 6 in the morning Also on the Sunday our flight was in the evening so we wanted to leave our suitcases at the hotel this was the first time a hotel asked us if we wished to leave our luggage During my stay I used the massage room which again I would highly recommend as it s worth the euros on the last day we did make use of the pool and also the sauna which is incredibly relaxing before a flight The hotel itself is beautiful our room had a balcony and looked out on to street which during sunset looks stunning We didn t take advantage of breakfast but we were recommended Alsur Cafe which I will be returning to as the food is delicious We will definitely be staying here again when we return to Barcelona

330884,Acta Atrium Palace, Pool and Sauna isn t up to much pool had floating bits of black in and me and my partner felt very awkward getting into the pool as there was litrally only one seat outside of the pool which was taken and one lady in the pool The sauna was nice but small also there was a naked young lad in the sauna who just didn t seem to mind company awkward The maids woke us up every single morning about 8am by slamming doors constantly when we politely asked them to be a bit quieter it just seemed as it got louder asked a second time still no change complained to reception and explained we are not ones to complain we came back to 2 chocolates on our bed from the maids haha the next morning we was up extra early for our flight so not sure if they watched the doors more careful also our room was at the back of the hotel which we didn t mind but it looked onto school playing courts which could annoy some people wanting a view This didn t bother us as we was out every day exploring but the children did get quiet loud whilst they was playing We would probably say it was more of a 3 star than a 4 but don t know if it s just because we didn t have the best room etc , The bed was amazing staff at reception were extremely helpful Location of the hotel is amazing we came to Barcelona in August and stayed a bit further down This time we explored so much more and seen a lot more as everything was walking distance Defanatly walk if u can taxis are a rip off as it s all one way systems Shopping is amazing in Barcelona and litrally is walk away from this hotel hotel is really modern and quirky 
330885,Acta Atrium Palace, Our room was far too hot on the first night we were staying in January and even putting the thermostat down to 0 seemed to do nothing so we slept badly but we moved rooms the next day to the other side of the hotel and it was much cooler , Overall a lovely hotel in a perfect location 
330886,Acta Atrium Palace, On the evening of Dec 24 and while we were getting prepared for the Christmas eve celebration the electrical power shut down and we were suddenly in the dark without explanation from the staff It took approximately one hour to resolve the problem and to have the power back however it would have been better if the staff explained the situation instead of waiting for the guest to approach them asking what was going on I had this experience in other hotels and always there was a phone call from the staff or a member going room by room explaining the situation, great location big room and bathroom with refrigerator and electrical kettle 
330887,Acta Atrium Palace, the staff was not that helpful even if I was speaking English with them they were replying in Spanish because I m Spanish while I was with English people that cant understand Quite unpolite from my point of view Moreover we asked if they could call a taxi for us as we had some issues with the phone and they refused The extra duvet in the room was dirty The document to write the review had some chewing gum inside so we had not the chance to leave any review , Location is good
330888,Acta Atrium Palace, Rooms are rather tired and old fashioned looking definitely in need of a refurbishment No English news channels on the TV , Good central location although on a busy road the rooms were very quiet Quite a spacious room

330893,Acta Atrium Palace, Not a fan of the interconnecting doors They make it much less private as we could hear the couple chatting in the room next to us It was fine as we weren t disturbed through the night but could ve been disastrous The cleaners were also VERY noisy changing bin bags in the hallway It was like someone was standing outside our door with a supermarket carrier bag rolling it between their hands for 15 minutes at 9am , Location was just amazing Right on Passeig de Gracia easy access to metro walking distance from EVERYTHING The spa pool was OK but needs a bit of updating Very good sauna and showering facilities though Breakfast was FANTASTIC Lovely varied buffet and love the way the rest of Europe seems to cook bacon Excellent Staff were friendly efficient and very helpful Also in a city renowned for pickpocketing the hotel had a great sense of security

330924,Acta Atrium Palace, On arrival we were told that our room would not be ready until 3pm and to go away and come back although we were checked in We arrived back to the hotel early as we were tired from the flight We had to wait for over an hour before we asked if we could be let into the room The lady was very rude and told us it had been ready for a while although they knew we were sat in reception waiting for our room When we got to the room they rang us to tell us we hadn t been checked in correctly so had to go back downstairs It all semmed a bit unorganised and not very friendly We also had a triple room a double and a single The single bed was so uncomfortable that we couldn t use it , This hotel is in a perfect location right near a metro station and about 10 minutes walk from las ramblas The room was very clean and exactly like the pictures on their website Taxi rank outside hotel which we used back to the airport about 40 It was nicely decorated and the room had everything we needed so would consider staying here again in the future 
330925,Acta Atrium Palace, We would have appreciated better security in the lobby and restaurant as one of the members in our travel party was robbed while eating in the restaurant , Excellent location friendly staff and good restaurant 
330926,Acta Atrium Palace, The hotel is too noisy we had 2 rooms the noise was incredible always their is sound of doors that open and close at midnight and after Also their is sound of water maybe it was because washing machine was next to our room We could not sleep well at night don t ever take 307 and 207 rooms since they are next to the room were the staff work and wash dishes or clothes , Great Location friendly staff clean room
330927,Acta Atrium Palace, One of the Wardrobe s door did not slide smoothly One of the bedside sockets needed refitting Bathroom pedal bin was hollow I would not rate this hotel as , Location location location just around the corner from Plaza de Catalunya and buses to the airtport Extra comfy bed Receptionist most helpful and attentive Very quiet room Digital safety locker Easy and straight forward Clean and tidy

330935,Acta Atrium Palace, The breakfast could have been more various There should be more salty things like cheese types and olive etc Also the spa facilities were problematic the pool is so small and shallow jacuzzi wasn t working , First of all the staff was very helpful and cheerful The room was nice cosy and comfortable Hotel s facilities were adequate If you can t find cigarettes outside on Sunday you can find in the machine inside the hotel s cafeteria The location was fantastic we found every important place easily and metro is just 500 metres away 
330936,Acta Atrium Palace, It would be nice to include baked beans on the breakfast menu admittedly personal preference, Staff at the reception were excellent in every way Very helpful Arrangements made to accommodate the children family ie larger room at no extra cost This was my 2nd stay I would definitely stay there again Good standards well maintained
330937,Acta Atrium Palace, Upon departure the staff weren t that helpful Apparently they cannot call cabs even though we had asked from the day before Then when we had no option but to go to the taxi stand they didn t help with our luggage we had 4 which upon arrival they had been more than happy to help with The jacuzzi was out of order but the massages were good The walls are paper thin so we kept getting woken up by guests close to us as well as the housekeeping The beds could be more comfortable but most importantly they could work a little more on cleanliness , Good location upon arrival the staff were really helpful The rooms are spacious but awkward there s a second sink next to the wardrobe and the room is almost split in two so it doesn t feel as big and space becomes limited 
330938,Acta Atrium Palace, The size of the swimming pool , Hotel location is great to reach the main tourist attraction zone There is a taxi stands and convenience stores near by the hotel The room was in good size for us 2 adults young child Hotel s staffs were friendly and helpful

330941,Acta Atrium Palace, Booked this hotel as it was advertising as a spa hotel was not informed when checking in that the hot tub was not working so the whole point of paying extra for spa hotel did not pay off spa area needs a lot of TLC showering before entering pool was impossible plumbing needs attention no water comming out of shower head Pool was cold and looked dirty no direct access to sauna you had to ask reception if you could use sauna all in all not a proper spa hotel change description Reason booking spa facilities because sightseeing around Barcelona is exhausting need rejuvenating in nice hot tub and pool Was not offered a reduction of cost of room or upgraded even though staff new hot tub was not working check window locks as ours was broke reported to staff took 6 hours for maintenance to try and fix it was not possible to repair as part needed no offer to relocate us to another room , Bed and linen clean rooms

330946,Acta Atrium Palace, Our room had a window looking into the atrium It was covered by a curtain and the other window looked into a dark alley so there was no natural light in the room but the biggest negative was the noise from the atrium Early every morning when s guests returned from a night out the sounds from the atrium lobby were very loud in our room They should install some kind of sound absorbers to reduce the noise from the atrium , The staff was extremely friendly and helpful The hotel was in walking distance to many of the areas we wanted to tour and public transportation The rooms were well appointed and comfortable 
330947,Acta Atrium Palace, The breakfast could have more variety , The staff was so helpful They were always friendly and looked after all our needs The pool was a welcome sight after all the walking

330949,Acta Atrium Palace, It was a very nice experience, my trip was a result of a very bad emotional experience I was overwhelmed upon my arrival at the hotel In tears The staff could not have been more empathetic and caring They offered me water and encouraged me to take my time to check in It was so touching to know strangers can be so kind I appreciated this far beyond the words I can express here Thank you 
330950,Acta Atrium Palace, I would have liked a bedside table on my side we only had one and a clock in the room I didn t like the polystyrene cups and plastic stirrers China cups and proper spoons would have been much nicer to make tea The decor was very dark and unimaginative not my thing , The staff were excellent very helpful and friendly Bed very comfortable nice linens and pillows Hotel in a perfect location for a short first visit to Barcelona I liked the flip flops and robe Nice bathroom and the room was spacious enough Breakfast was satisfactory although the toaster didn t work at all well We both found the cooked food a little oily But otherwise there was a good choice and it was adequate

330956,Acta Atrium Palace,No Negative, We arrived at this hotel after staying in a not so great hotel and really appreciated the extremely comfy bed and the lovely bathroom It was a 5 minute walk to the top of La Rambla and better still a 5 minute walk to the gothic quarter where there are some great restaurants The hotel was easy to landmark and therefore find our way home after a fun night out eating tapas and drinking the local beer and of course Sangria The staff were very friendly welcoming and helpful I would definitely recommend this hotel BTW if you are going on a cruise starting or ending in Barcelona this hotel is a 10 Euro taxi ride to the Port 
330957,Acta Atrium Palace, Your receptionist when I arrived would not charge the cost of the room to each occupant He put it on on my card only although I asked him to charge each room individually That is unacceptable , Central location close to good restaurants
330958,Acta Atrium Palace, For a supposed 4 star hotel it was a bit strange to have paper cups in the room especially as the room was otherwise excellent The hotel bar was closed at the weekend as well Seems bizarre when that would be the busiest time surely , The staff could not have been more helpful and cheerful throughout our stay Bedroom was large clean and the bed was very comfortable Location was great for the city but was still relatively quiet which was great 
330959,Acta Atrium Palace,No Negative, Location and staff at front desk were super friendly helpful and accommodating Stayed at a hotel doors away the previous week with the snobbiest coldest staff so this was a welcome change Also arrived early asked for quiet room and they delivered

330962,Acta Atrium Palace, some things were a lil brocken eg part of the bathtub maybe due to other clients Nevertheless the hotel should try to renew the damaged things , Friendly helpful staff Clean Location 
330963,Acta Atrium Palace, One complaint In the rooms there were coffee making facilities with cardboard cups In my view this is not acceptable for a four star hotel, excellent hotel for comfort and position
330964,Acta Atrium Palace, China cups and metal spoons for tea coffee instead of paper cups with stirrer sticks Also provision for more than a cup of coffee day These mean touches were not in keeping with the luxury of the experience , Great location friendly and efficient staff who were helpful too readily printed out boarding forms and greeted us by name Our room was well appointed light airy great temp control lots of storage too Room was cleaned immaculately daily Great facilities which we didn t use 
330965,Acta Atrium Palace, The d cor is quite dark not to my taste The curtains in the bedroom barely opened so very little natural light in the room Our room backed onto a school play area which was noisy until quite late The bathroom was quite spacious but suite tiles etc are very dated , Excellent location Very friendly helpful staff Breakfast was reasonable value with the package offered 
330966,Acta Atrium Palace, Too much noise from the rooms around and the corridor Not a room that matches the standards for a 4star hotel Not satisfied with the bathroom Found hair that was someone s else , The stuff at the reception was great and much helpful Very good wifi network Great location 
330967,Acta Atrium Palace, The spa facilities weren t excellent The jacuzzi didn t work it was just like sitting in a warm bath The pool and sauna were nice though The room was a bit noisy due to our room overlooking the atrium but it didn t bother us too much , The hotel is in a great location to easily access all of the sights The staff were friendly and helpful The beds were super comfy although we had a room overlooking the atrium which got a little bit noisy when people were leaving or returning to the hotel even though our room was on the 4th floor

330970,Acta Atrium Palace, The bar area is disappointing and clearly not used so if you like a good bar for pre or post dinner drinks this is not the hotel for you However as there are bars in the area we did not find it too much of a problem , bedroom and bathroom were both well equipped 
330971,Acta Atrium Palace, Room price should include breakfast as quite expensive for a 4 star and we stayed outside of school holidays Jacuzzi didn t work properly , Bed was comfy Nice they provide flip flops for the pool 
330972,Acta Atrium Palace, Heated pool not very warm and jacuzzi not working well , Good sized comfortable well equipped rooms very clean and modern Staff friendly and helpful and great location

330975,Acta Atrium Palace, Constant noise due to room facing inner countyard school Walls are thin you can hear the neighbours, Great location friendly staff great value for the price
330976,Acta Atrium Palace, The breakfast catering facilities and the food were definitely NOT 4 Star The restaurant itself was very basic and not of a standard that one would expect from a 4 Star hotel I would not expect to have a basic automatic coffee machine of porr quality coffee and then to be charged extra if ordering an espresso The fruit juice was terrible It tasted like powdered drink and I was not able to drink it The food range was poor and little options for vegetarians as we are We were offered chips French fries with our breakfast choice This was not what we were expecting from such a hotel in Spain We had just relocated from a Paradore Cardona and the difference in food and ambiance was striking yet supposedly the same star rating Restaurant staff were efficient but too fast and no one smiled They made the breakfast experience rather unpleasant and made us feel unwelcome They were very much set on the process of getting breakfast over with and getting ready for lunches This was areal shame as it was a special weekend for us and the hotel did not live up to its own publicity and marketing I may well use these hotel again BUT NOT book breakfast , Room as very good clean and comfortable Spa facilities also very good We booked a massage which was excellent 
330977,Acta Atrium Palace, There was no greeting Simple thing but it s the initial exposure to the hotel and the doorman simply walked away when I greeted him myself since he did not , Great location Right off main city center square and a few blocks from Old city medina 
330978,Acta Atrium Palace, The room was a bit hot and the air conditioning didn t seem to work properly but we easily fixed this by opening the windows since the hotel is in a very quiet area it wasn t disturbing at all and it was fine , The hotel is perfectly located in the centre of Barcelona with easy access to many points of interests in the city and many metro lines while still being in a quiet area no noise at all at night from our room The staff was very friendly and helpful The room was nice and clean and the bed was very comfortable 
330979,Acta Atrium Palace, Direct sunlight in the room in the morning made a bit of airco necessary but unfortunately did not work never mentioned this to the hotel though Also shower pressure was really minimal Breakfast average but not that expensive either SPA area good shower unfortunately not everything was working properly , Location staff perfect 
330980,Acta Atrium Palace, Where do I start Check in was abysmal We arrived exhausted and late after flight delays to a rude receptionist Booking com had given me the wrong costing not their fault But they weren t particularly helpful Then I checked we d got a quiet room as I d red the reviews about rooms at the back He said we did We arrived to find we were next to the lift and housekeeping and at the back It was 1am and I was shown 3 rooms all of which were back facing and shabby I found a hair in the last bathroom but we were too tired so decided to just take it We were woken at 8am by kid playing football The air conditioning didn t work so we had to sleep with the window open The fridge didn t work either The toiletries weren t replaced and my boyfriend s swimming shorts were hug in the bidet The only apology we got was a bottle of cava to the room Not very impressed at all The coffee cups are paper Overall it just feels tired and shabby I wouldn t go back and stay there Not when you can stay in some amazing places that look and feel 4 And no to the reception who said Maybe this is the kind of hotel you re used to I m not I m used to way better service I ve stayed in hostels and up to 3 that were cleaner prettier and had more welcoming staff that this hotel , The location is excellent It has a lovely spa 
330981,Acta Atrium Palace, The restaurant was disappointing it s an excellent breakfast area with good food but eat out elsewhere reception will recommend an EXCELLENT Tapas bar If you have a room fronting over the street it s very noisy at night early morning , The staff decor cleanliness pool were all excellent The location is very good for access to all main attractions and we were made very welcome 
330982,Acta Atrium Palace, The bathroom could do with a little attention perhaps investment too , The staff were so welcoming on arrival and very knowledgeable offering further services and enquiring how they could make our stay as enjoyable as possible Our room was extremely spacious with all the necessities one could need during a stay Local transport around the city was extremely reliable and both the bus and metro stations were nearby 
330983,Acta Atrium Palace, Facilities first time I ve experienced almost 1hour no electricity at the hotel Very poor front desk when I asked what happened why no electricity , location
330984,Acta Atrium Palace, More milk teas and coffee sachets in the bedroom only enough for one drink per day which is not enough really , Staff were very informative on arrival locating the hotel on a map and advising key sites restraints and cafes nearby always helpful when we had any questions and nothing seemed like too much trouble very good service from the staff 
330985,Acta Atrium Palace, The beds We got a doubleroom But the double bed turned out to be two beds put together with a gap between Not a double bed as we would have had defined it , We asked for a balcony and got one of the bigger ones on 6th floor Really nice
330986,Acta Atrium Palace, Swimming pool was freezing Thankfully the Jacuzzi was nice and warm , Excellent location Room was surprisingly big for a city centre hotel and was well appointed The bed and pillows were very comfortable Free sweets at reception was a nice touch

330992,Acta Atrium Palace, Why are there cardboard disposable cups and plastic stirrers in the rooms instead of normal crockery and teaspoons Bizarre Asked for proper cups and was immediately given some was told it was a new idea so told them to forget that Otherwise no negatives , Great location for tourists close to tour bus start and famous La Rambla Aerobus direct from the airport to Plac de Catalunya Five minute walk to this fab hotel Very busy road but shut the balcony door for absolute peace Mini bar very welcome Friendly helpful staff relaxed but correct 
330993,Acta Atrium Palace, Noise It is the worst hotel for noise that I ve stayed in and a stay in different hotels every week with work There is a small playground at the back that makes a massive noise from early morning until very late at night The hotel claims that the rooms are soundproofed but ours wasn t We didn t have a proper nights sleep in 5 nights , Breakfast was good The room was clean 
330994,Acta Atrium Palace, The acoustic isolation is not that good particularly where the balcony has been transformed into a room addition The patio is also a sports field for a nearby school so this might be also noisy at some point but this is not the hotel owner responsability Some renovation works might also be needed at some point Final hotel score would be rated 8 5 10 , Top location friendly staff spa facilities clean
330995,Acta Atrium Palace, Restaurant in evening not good average food surly waiter, We loved the hotel superb location lovely room fantastic staff brilliant spa incredible breakfast including cava One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in already booked a return visit

330998,Acta Atrium Palace, Noisy room ventilation and street noise They need double glazing or so The water pressure in both shower and toilet is far too low Totally not worth the close to 300 euros paid for one night , The staff especially Zen don t know how to spell his name the beds the location was ok except they need double glazing cause of the busy street at nights breakfast was good 
330999,Acta Atrium Palace, Only with taxi as it took us to wrong location even after we gave driver a map Nothing to do with hotel but made us late for Flamenco and we had to pay for another taxi to take us to correct place , Location lovely and clean helpful reception staff Location was excellent for Ramblas open top bus and Sagrada Familia Room was spacious and clean and although overlooked busy Street did not prevent us sleeping well in large comfortable bed Tea and coffee making facilities were an added bonus

331007,Acta Atrium Palace, The air conditioning in our home wasn t working very well We had to turn it down to 0 degrees for it to feel like it was around 20 degrees in our room , Great location for seeing the city and going out Les Ramblas though probably a bit far if you re there for the beach Perfect for us in late November though

331010,Acta Atrium Palace, school outside in back can be very noisy but i really enjoyed seeing teh view and double glazing eliminates the sound breakfast adequate bit off being asked to pay extra for better coffee or orange juice as this was a 175 hotel ok late price with major event going on in town Taxis can for some reason be tricky to get but just walk 50M along road to rank hotel on corner does the trick, fairly late booking price acceptable location very good for what i needed room and hotel clean and comfortable and fairly characterful for a business hotel cafe next door also fairly good nice to have teh ability to open windows and turn off airco staff friendly and top marks for arranging to send a scarf back that i forgot 
331011,Acta Atrium Palace, Can t complain about anything, The staff were beyond help full and very accomodating They went out of their way to accomodate us as we arrived a day too early Brilliant service and I will definitely make use of them again
