328570,Sunotel Central, There weren t always enough towels ready in the pool area , Excellent location away from busy Street but close enough to walk Excellent pool and really friendly and helpful staff

328572,Sunotel Central, I dont believe this is a 4 star hotel The disgusting smell coming out of the bathroom for the entire 3 days we stayed here is enough to lower it to 2 stars however this same odour is also present throughout most of Barcelona s streets so maybe its a more broad issue TV is extremely small for such a large room Staff could be more personable , Decent location
328573,Sunotel Central, One needs to read the invoices carefully mistakes happen in my case room was for 2 persons and the invoice showed 4 persons , Breakfast was really good fresh fruits Beds were comfortable 
328574,Sunotel Central, The bathroom wasn t clean We found hairs in the shower and floor We informed reception but the floor was still the same , The room had a very nice terrace with table chairs and hammocks
328575,Sunotel Central, Breakfast typical european ingredients so you can t really moan as theres numerous irish bars to get a proper full english breakfast and no rooftop bar but then again its only a small area that can fit 15 20 people so not too bad negatives , Rooftop pool friendly staff location walking distance to most places and only 8 for a taxi to the Olimpic Port most bars restaurants and nightclubs Also a supermarket basically next door to the hotel for your every needs I would definitely return to this hotel again in the near future

328578,Sunotel Central, Booked a twin for two teenage boys given a double, Comfortable city centre hotel with the bonus of a pool on the roof Didn t stay there long enough to use facilities
328579,Sunotel Central, There was a club across the street that oonce oonce d into the early morning hours We didn t realize this until we got back to the room around midnight Luckily it was only open one night during our stay , The location of the hotel was excellent and close to a few cafes for breakfast Las Ramblas and the Universitat metro station and bus stop Decent walking distance to the Gothic Quarter and the open air market From Sunotel Central we could be anywhere in the city within 30 45 minutes The staff was very friendly and accommodating and the rooftop pool was small but pleasant

328581,Sunotel Central, Unfortunately we had a horrible experience in this hotel the first week of June After the first night in room 305 upon waking up in the hotel bed I had about 60 big bites of bed bugs bedwantsen chinches de cama All over my back arms and in my face They itched and hurt like mad and I got an allergic reaction as well and needed doctors treatment I have suffered for 2 weeks from these bed bug bites and they totally ruined my 4 day stay in Barcelona and a wedding I did not manage to sleep at all the remaining nights The staff seemed shocked as well and moved us to another room after that first night Changing hotel was not possible Manager was away throughout all our stay Upon checking out the staff offered me 1 free breakfast to compensate for the inconvenience I got really angry that this was all they came up with after so much misery and found this totally unacceptable and unbelievable this could happen in a 4 hotel It took me a lot of effort to speak to the manager but she was away and they did not want to contact her Eventually they called her after I got more and more angry and the manager offered to fully reimburse our stay That was appreciated it could have all been easier though and without having to get so angry Anyway despite this very bad hopefully once in a lifetime experience I must say the follow up from the manager upon getting home was excellent Besides the refund I received a long email when I got home with her apologies about the situation and fact that she could not be there in person at the time She wrote that the room would be quaraintained and that they would have pest control clean it thoroughly I was also offered to come again in the future for free to show that a stay can be nice and comfortable in this hotel They would do everything to avoid this from happening again We always stay in 4 and 5 hotels to have proper hygiene but I learnt from this experience that this is not a guarantee , Location is good 
328582,Sunotel Central, No complaints , Spacious room with balcony and good views of the tree lined street Had read reviews of clients booking via booking com being allocated poor rooms definitely not the case Staff were very courteous and helpful Allowed an early check in Breakfast room at ground floor level was well appointed with an excellent menu offering The roof top swimming pool and sun deck was a magic oasis in the heart of the city The pool deck decor would be enhanced considerably with some planting and greenery but the pool was great and the deck furniture comfortable and the towels fluffy The hotel is 2 minutes walk to the University metro and major bus routes An excellent array of bars restaurants and craft breweries are within easy walking distance 
328583,Sunotel Central,No Negative, The airport shuttle bus goes past the hotel It was a very hot day when we arrived and the aircon was excellent We were on the 7th floor and we had a balcony that overlooked the Gran Via but it wasn t noisy because there were double doors There is a small pool upstairs and an area to sit The staff were very helpful and there are lots of places nearby to eat and the bus stop to return to the airport is only a short walk away

328591,Sunotel Central,No Negative, Our stay was very comfortable at Sunotel Central The hotel was incredibly conveniently located very close to the centre with a clean room and a reasonable sized room The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful throughout our stay and were able to answer any querie we had We really liked the addition of the rooftop pool There s little else close to the centre that offers a pool or anywhere to sunbathe other than the beach which is a taxi ride away The pool was quiet and relaxing as well as clean 
328592,Sunotel Central, The air conditioning was not working so if you want to pay for a sauna go ahead The staff pretended to be trying to fix it but at the end of the day they just admitted that the whole system was not working The same problem was in other rooms as well Very expensive for hot uncomfortable stay Better use the 3 star hotel next door Caledonian have stayed there MUCH better and cheaper , location

328610,Sunotel Central, Breakfast buffet was maybe not always organized the best way Sometimes no coffe or no eggs or no milk If you offer cava for breakfast it should have some bubbles in and cold But in general I loved this breakfast buffet , Very Good location Very clean and well organized space Loved the pool deck Beautiful breakfast Helpful staff 
328611,Sunotel Central, My husband found the noise from the road at night slightly annoying but I told him that is being in a city We have travelled to Barcelona on numerous occasions and the road noise is part of it You can always ask to have a room at the back of the hotel , I stayed here in February with my Sister and again the bed and pillows are extremely comfortable The staff friendly and helpful and would certainly recommend this hotel to friends and colleagues The small roof terrace with pool and Jacuzzi are a bonus and enjoyed a couple of late afternoons in the sun 
328612,Sunotel Central, The outdoor swimming pool as it is NOT heated therefore the water is too cold to swim in We booked this hotel because it advertised the swimming pool as all year round therefore we assumed it was heated , The hot tub
328613,Sunotel Central, This hotel should not be classified as a 4 star The decor is old fashioned and the hotel rooms and hall ways are in need of refurb Beds are uncomfortable and move when you sit up The pool area was the most disappointing aspect though It felt old and tired and could fencing or something be put up to take from the view of other roof tops I had stayed earlier in the week at a 4 star two stops away and it was a different class completely and it was a 4 star too In fact we went there during day to use the pool , Staff were helpful and friendly good location
328614,Sunotel Central, The fried eggs were cold but fresh ones appeared after I had taken mine Coffee was not very good and not hot , Very well located hotel Clean and well maintained The mattress was comfortable but the pillows were thin and only one per person We should have asked for more but only staying one night didn t bother We arrived very early off a cruise so staff checked our luggage in a secure room We did not use the pool so cannot review Wifi was good 
328615,Sunotel Central, Beautiful room overlooking main road nice balcony unfortunately got no sleep first night due to continuous noisy traffic Hotel changed rooms for me to back of hotel no problem , Peace quiet room when I asked for move
328616,Sunotel Central, I asked for a room with the front view but the person on reception refused because I booked through booking com and not directly with the hotel I even said I am a genusis member but he didn t care ,No Positive
328617,Sunotel Central,No Negative, Great breakfast roof swimming pool and jacuzzi so comfortable beds and pillows that you want them pack to your suitcase Excellent and helpful staff as a perfect location 
328618,Sunotel Central, When I was there it was construction going on bad soundproof very easy to heard what is going on next room A little distance from attractions but if have ticket for train which is good n convenience then , Staff was friendly for helps room was nice and comfy Can t complaint too much for the price 
328619,Sunotel Central, The only downside was the parking Parking was 20eur per night which is a bit steep for guests but we were allowed to keep the car in the garage for the day after checkout while we went out sightseeing Barcelona which gave us great value and comfort in not having to move the car before leaving Just a heads up warning if arriving by car This hotel has an underground garage which is safe and secure But it is a VERY steep and narrow decent to get there Our car is very big and we had to reverse multiple times in the middle of the decent just to get around the corners with only 5 10 cm on each side of the car to the wall Before deciding to use this garage please take the elevator down from the reception and have a walk through the garage before getting into a though spot with your car , We had the luck to get a great deal I can t express how happy we were with our deal incredible value for money that I am going to remember for a long time Carlos at the reception was great from Check in through Check out The room was extremly clean and had a very posh feeling Jacuzzi Spa area open for guests until 10pm In fact we even decided to stay in for the evening after having dinner to do the sight seeing the day after that s a good rating for a hotel room Many thumbs up to the shower that was amazing Coffe was a Nespresso machine with capsules instead of the normal instant coffee with a water boiler The location was only 600m from plc Catalunia where you could find HOHO bus stops that takes you sightseeing through the city There are nerby 24h supermarkets as well as cervecerias bars and restaurants This was the best stay of our euro trip with 18 days in a row on different hotels every night so far 
328620,Sunotel Central, We stayed 3 nights we asked in advance for the invoice on company name and everything was OK But I checked the details on invoice home and I discovered that they put on the invoice only 2 nights not 3 nights how we paid Very disappointing and very frustrated I sent emails through booking com and directly on their email but nobody answer me , great location very good breakfast WiFi working perfectly helping staff to book tickets for a show 
328621,Sunotel Central, The rooms on the main road side Gran Via takes very high noise in the mornings because of the heavy traffic which starts around 05 45 in working days If you will stay hotel in working days I absolutely recommend you to stay in a room on the back side of the hotel Because the noise of the cars buses is extremely much , Wonderful location just 4 minutes of walk from Plaza Catalunya Very well educated polite staff Always clean and spacious rooms bathrooms Comfortable bed and pillows Very rich breakfast 
328622,Sunotel Central, Reception not very passionate about welcoming you and gave me the worst located room in the building might be because that I m the solo traveller Room size not as big as described on the web the actual facilities were much older than shown in the photos Okay for one night but will not come back ,No Positive
328623,Sunotel Central, Design of the bathrooms water is all over the floor but cannot drain due to practically lack of drainage We had to put towels on the bathroom floor to dry it , Location in the middle of everything in Barcelona excellent staff very good breakfast comfy beds

328625,Sunotel Central, This was not at all four star hotel Hotel a bit worn out Room very noisy because of traffic could be fixed if the balcony door was better isolated Was not very well cleaned , Good location Breakfast was good 
328626,Sunotel Central, The main street is noisy even in the night If you have problem to fall asleep ask for the room with windows to the different side , Breakfast are worth the price wine and prossecco included 
328627,Sunotel Central, Everything was just perfect , Excellent stay and incredible hotel Our room was very quiet and the beds were comfortable The location is only 10 minutes from Rambla of Barcelona Very recommended 
328628,Sunotel Central, Very small room Terrible smell from the bathroom The air conditioner didnt work Not so clean as it should be Fot me this is not a 4 star hotel , Good location Good breakfast Nice pool on the roof altough very small 
328629,Sunotel Central, Only slight gripe was had asked for a double bed but had 2 single beds pushed together fine but not quite the same , Rooftop pool area a real bonus in the city great place to relax after a busy day in the city Staff were always friendly and helpful Room was a good size for city hotel and was always quiet and peaceful shower was really good but a shelf would have been useful for shower gel shampoo etc 
328630,Sunotel Central, Missing warming cattle for hot cup of tea There is a coffe machine in roombut does not boiling the water The street view room are not sound proof and you can hear the trafic in the street all night long If you want to get some rest ask for the roomin the opposite direction from the main street , Good breakfast Time of breakfast from 7 11 Having vegetables in breajfast Sweeming pool Very fast and efficient check in and check out 
328631,Sunotel Central, Room 712 Soulless room very dated could use an update Strange smell when entering the room after a day out Curtains do not stop light and sun shines on back facade from morning till late afternoon Very noisy airconditioning Other unidentified noise during day swimming pool jacuzzi Difficult access from bed to light switches on night stands No 4 star hotel unless location in room coffee machine and swimming pool are taken into account , Excellent location Nice staff Room at the back of the building is quiet 
328632,Sunotel Central, On friday an saturnday there s loud music in a club under the hotel 1 floor We came tired late on friday and was settled into the worstest room in a hotel which right over the club There had been loud music and singing until 1 20 am and hotel s administrator cannot do nothing I m sure it s a usual story for this room on the first floor and near the far elevator The hotel shount settle here on friday an saturnday nights But greed is overcome Next day we has moved to the top floor where there s quite rooms Breakfast is expensive Near the hotel there s nice places with good breakfast for half the hotel price , The hotel is close to metro station There s a nice places with a good breakfast right near the hotel Catalynia place is 10 minutes of walk 
328633,Sunotel Central,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful The room was a good size and nice and quiet There was a great selection of food at breakfast It was really easy to get to from the Airport using the Aerobus It was a great location with plenty of restuarants shops and bars 
328634,Sunotel Central, Nothing specific Take a card with the hotel s address on when out not all taxis know where it is and Gran Via is a very long road , Good breakfast but breakfast room rather canteen like 
328635,Sunotel Central, Allt var j ttebra Trevlig personal Sk na s ngar men hade g rna nskat att f dubbels ng o inte tv enkels ngar , V ldig lugnt omr de men n ra till allt Hade ett tyst rum in mot g rden Det fanns en kaffemaskin p rummet o en flaska bubbel n r vi kom V ldigt god frukost f r att bara utomlands Barcelona bj d p sol
328636,Sunotel Central, The breakfast was not worth the amount of money paid for it Luckily many breakfast options around the hotel I don t understand the way hotels have been putting the bed sheets The duvet doesn t go inside a case anymore HOtels have been just putting a sheet under and a sheet above the duvet I find this completely unhygienic case with many hotels i visited lately because if you twist and turn at night you end up with the duvet alone without any clean sheets and while the clean sheets are changed regularly and washed in hotel rooms duvets themselves are not I advise all hotels to go back to the duvet pillow like cover as before the lobby is tiny and the hotel name outside is not so big and noticeable I wonder if anything could be done about this , The hotel location is absolutely perfect There is a starbucks right around the corner Universitat metro station is a one minute walk Plaza Catalunya is a 5 minute walk with another closeby metro station that connects the whole city and it is a perfect place to take wonderful pictures with the pigeons and catch a city bus tour Plenty of yummy neighborhood cafes for coffee and breakfast Gran Via de les cortes Catalan the street where the hotel is located cuts through barcelona and almost EVERYWHERE In barcelona except for the mountains is a 20 30 walk from the hotel The metro rides are a maximum of 20 30 minute trip the farthest The front desk staff are the most courteous and efficient that i have ever encountered and i travel a lot The lobby gives the impression that the hotel is small but i was surprised and impressed with how spacious the rooms are Cleanliness level is great The cleaning schedule is also great I came back to find my room perfectly cleaned every single day and regardless of the time i left the hotel Was this hotel expensive Yes Was it worth what i paid ALso yes Great complimentary coffee in the room 
328637,Sunotel Central, Definitely not 4 stars 3 at best Tea bags and milk weren t replenished after the first day so we had to keep asking reception for more They would only give us two tea bags at a time and they ran out of black tea in hindsight we would ve gone to the supermarket next door to buy our own On arrival we were told we had been upgraded but the room was extremely basic I wonder what the basic rooms were like We were given a twin bed on arrival instead of the double we requested so I wonder whether they mentioned upgrade to keep us sweet At the end of our stay we asked if it would be easy to grab a cab off the street to get to the airport and were told by the guy on reception Don t worry I ll call you one it will be here in 5 mins That s really kind we thought but when we arrived at the airport the taxi driver had added on an 11 Euro supplement to our 26 Euro fare because it had been pre booked by our receptionist Outrageous We felt totally ripped off and was a horrible end to our stay , The only good things about this place were the location and comfy beds pillows cleanliness of the rooms Great location in the university district less that 5 mins walk to the tube and 10 mins walk to Placa Catalunya 
328638,Sunotel Central, Breakfast was ok but got tiresome already after the the second morning The coffee was really bad , Very good location and quiet rooms nice with the pool on the roof 
328639,Sunotel Central, the room was cold and the heating was not working that was due to the weather change the room was with no carpets as well, The staff were excellent and fast services room was spacious
328640,Sunotel Central, I wouldn t recommend the breakfast For the upcharge I m sure you get a nicer one in the area It took the waiter 10min to recognize that I m there although there had been only 5 other people Took a while to refill eggs and other things ,No Positive
328641,Sunotel Central, The first night we had a really loud room facing the busy street , The uncomplicated possibility to change the room The good restaurants close to the hotel Flex Kale Barcelona Brew Company 
328642,Sunotel Central, Pool could have been heated A bath would have been nice Pillows were hard , Staff very friendly and helpful hot tub was good Breakfast good and lots of choice 
328643,Sunotel Central, The jacuzzi only worked one of the 3 days had to ask daily for tea coffee replacements breakfast was expensive , Great 24 hour reception and friendly staff Clean and comfortable room 
328644,Sunotel Central, No slippers in the room, Friendly staff nice view from the room located in the city center clean and comfortable place A great addition coffee machine and capsules in every room
328645,Sunotel Central,No Negative, The hotel is in an excellent location with accessibility to public transport and aerobus to from the airport The staff are very helpful and friendly 
328646,Sunotel Central,No Negative, Very comfy bed Very friendly and helpful staff We moved room to the back of the hotel because of traffic noise from the road and it was very quiet We did not have breakfast but there are many cafes and bars nearby Very good location as you can reach the old town and the new easily on foot Also there are buses and metro nearby if you need it Caught the train to Sitges for a day out well worth it
328647,Sunotel Central, One of my worst experiences in a hotel In the room was extremely hot and the air conditioning was available only on warm option You could not breath inside Not to mention the noisy music in the night 23 00 3AM I called two times in the reception and they didn t take any action The hotel should be rated with max 3 , It is near Pla a de Catalunya 
328648,Sunotel Central, Very bad sound insulation very very very bad I heard my neighbor at 2 o clock in the morning watching a comedy broadcast and laughing although maybe I m just not lucky with neighbors My advice take the earplugs , The location is wonderful the Piazza of Spain can be reached in 15 minutes to Catania Square beyond 10 Breakfast is delicious and for 4 stars is very rich choice like ham and hard cheese for breakfast there is no coffee machine Room is small but with very comfortable and large bed and what als do you need after five hours walking cleaned regularly 
328649,Sunotel Central, The room service haven t top up coffee capsules until we asked for that The air conditioner didn t work for cooling but the service always closed the window so the room got hot by the evenings , Spacious room and bathroom clean and silent 
328650,Sunotel Central, Rooms relatively dark at night no proper lighting installed All sockets used by lamps , Good value for money Great location You can get from the airport by AeroBus and get off at the Pl Universitat stop Hotel is 200 m away You can use also this metro stop to reach anywhere in the city Wi fi is good Rooms are clean 5 m walk to Placa Catalunya 
328651,Sunotel Central, Air cooling heating doesn t work properly but we didnt mind just opened the window, Bed was comfy and where our room was it was soooo silent You couldn t tell you were right on the grand blvd
328652,Sunotel Central, We couldn t get the airconditioning to work and the first night our room felt much too warm , Breakfast had a really good choice and was very nice We were given the suite on the top floor and had lots of space an nespresso machine and a large balcony all very good We had a problem with the safe which the staff managed to sort out without delay The bed was comfortable pillows good 
328653,Sunotel Central, Does not correspond at all to the photos Window with view on a wall facing other windows on a interior patio with ceiling no fresh air at all low light No window in the bathroom and no ventilation so unpleasant smell, close to tube jacuzzi was hot
328654,Sunotel Central, Besides the fact that I have forgotten an item of mine at the hotel in the room I was staying overall my stay and the staff were amazing and I am very happy about choosing this hotel for my vacation in Barcelona Great location , We didn t eat breakfast at the hotel unfortunately so I have no idea how it tasted like 
328655,Sunotel Central, Air con was ineffective so very hot as opening windows wasn t an option as hotel located on busy 8 lane road with 24hr traffic The noise is a trade off for location though, Location 10 minute walk to le Ramblas great Cleanliness of room great Staff great
328656,Sunotel Central,No Negative, Very very welcoming and nice staff reception room The hotel has a great feel in a fantastic location close to everything and I would say one of the best spots to plan the visit to Barcelona Nice and comfortable room with nice facilities 
328657,Sunotel Central, Our room was too warm the air con did not seem to be on and the thermostat did not respond to commands and the mini fridge did not work properly, The location was perfect and the staff were very polite 
328658,Sunotel Central, The door to balcony are not so soundproof so you can hear the streets at night The bathroom was good but there was bad smell sometime It s not a four star hotel , Location Staff Cleanliness 
328659,Sunotel Central, They put champagne coke cola fanta pineapple juice orange juice chrisps nuts beer and water in are fridge everyday which we never asked for and wasnt part of our hotel room and at the end of stay tried to charge me 160euros for it , The hotel was cleanly nice friendly staff and the hot tub
328660,Sunotel Central, Expensive breakfast We went elsewhere , Beds were great Memory foam I think Location was excellent only one block from Metro station It was very clean and the concierge spoke English and was very helpful 
328661,Sunotel Central, This is a silly question Or maybe the fact we didn t select to have breakfast because that looked great too , The pillows were amazing Fantastic friendly staff perfect location we walked to almost everything Pool area was clean and peaceful Just a wonderful place shall certainly be returning 
328662,Sunotel Central,No Negative, Our room was very clean and comfy Big windows let alot of lights comes in Very spacious balcony where we can sit having meals or just laying around enjoying the good weather of barcelona The staffs were very helpful we leave very early in the morning and they already prepared two take away breakfast package for us Would definitely reccomend this hotel to others and would definitely come back if we ever visit barcelona again 
328663,Sunotel Central, We were put at the front of the hotel great views but so noisy all night The door didn t provide any noise proofing at all Great hotel but something for people to consider when booking , I liked how it was at the centre of everything Made walking to everything so easy Only a ten minute walk from Las Ramblas
328664,Sunotel Central, Whilst the breakfast was ok and it was very convenient for our first morning it was expensive for what it offered and the following morning we breakfasted in town for less than half the price , Getting to the hotel from the airport was a breeze using the airport shuttle bus a a cost of 5 9 Euros The hotel was spotlessly clean and the staff were really helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them we even got a complementary bottle of CAVA on our arrival as it was my friends birthday a lovely touch Thank you Sunotel The pool and Jacuuzzi are open all year round so pack your cozzi We would stay here again without a moments hesitation 
328665,Sunotel Central, Lack of power sockets and ceiling lights in bedroom No extraction fan in bathroom , Location is very good Very good food selection at breakfast Friendly staff 
328666,Sunotel Central, Wouldn t change or criticise anything, Memory foam pillows were an unexpected bonus Staff super helpful and even had an iPhone charger when I thought I d left mine at home Location is a massive selling point as it s easy walking distance to Placa Catalunya and the Metro system All in all a great stay and will definitely stay again
328667,Sunotel Central, Nothing, The room was perfect clean and warm We were at the back of the hotel so no traffic noise from Gran Via Great location a few minutes walk from metro Bed very comfortable The staff on reception very helpful We didn t eat breakfast in the hotel but many cafe restaurants along the street The coffee machine in the room was a nice idea Pool and hot tub on the roof was open even in February Good price will be back
328668,Sunotel Central, Jacuzzi was empty Rooms are not soundproof , Very friendly staff nice rooftop terrace with a pool and jacuzzi and a view of the city Loved the complimentary Nespresso coffee in the room All over a good stay for a reasonable price 
328669,Sunotel Central, Some members of staff were very bad and simply incompetent to work who couldn t speak good English didn t know the restaurants around the hotel assured that the swimming pool and a jacuzzi are with heated water whilst jacuzzi was out of order and the water in the pool was very cold he didn t give us bathrobes saying they don t have it whilst next day his colleague provided us with bathrobes We have experience problems with hot water and electricity the room was small and in photos it looked much better than in a reality I was surprised it is 4 star hotel There was not even bottle of complimentary water in our room vanity set shower cap in a bathroom It s not too bad for the money but we wouldn t come back to stay in this hotel , The location is good Even though it s in a center of Barcelona it was quite and peaceful in a room Some of the staff were very helpful Breakfast was until 11am everyday which is very good if one wants to sleep longer 
328670,Sunotel Central, Nothing happy with everything Did not have the breakfast as appeared over priced , EXCELLENT location very clean and quite helpful Beds are very comfortable Good sunflower head showers too Request to change room on the first morning was done without hesitation Many good dining options nearby Many interesting things within walking distance Would repeat at this hotel 
328671,Sunotel Central, May be instructions on how to use the coffee machine, The pillows were the best I have ever slept on Lovely Room with balcony Ideal location Clean and tidy with a very good atmosphere Lovely pool and Jacuzzi on the top of the hotel ideal for warmer weather Although it was warm when we were there in February Would recommend 
328672,Sunotel Central, But it doesn t have anything special or a lot of charm and character I wouldn t say it is a four star hotel more like a very decent three star hotel , There was nothing not to like The location isn t exactly in the old centre but it s walking distance so that was good 
328673,Sunotel Central, We had a room against the street and the traffic outside was very disturbing the whole night , Very good location Easy to get there with Aerobus from airport just a few minutes to walk to the hotel Friendly staff Nice breakfast Close to Metro 
328674,Sunotel Central, Room to the street was noisy but with a wonderful view, The room was spacious and nice Quite new and spacious shower Clean room The location was fantastic just 2 3 minutes to the metro and 7 10min to the Catalunya square by foot 
328675,Sunotel Central, The car park It was a hair raising experience Steep steep slope and very narrow entry and exit We lost half our tyre rubber trying to get up the slope smoking tyres we hired a Ford Focus so anything bigger just wouldn t make it , Friendly staff clean hotel and central 
328676,Sunotel Central,No Negative, Clean room friendly staff big shout out to Edu Couldn t help us enough An absolute asset to the hotel roof terrace added bonus would like to return in the summer 
328677,Sunotel Central, Room was beside road which didn t actually bother me at all Very slight noise that others may not sleep through , Staff gave me free bottle of Cava because it was my birthday Had a slightly larger room than others Very convenient location Room was very clean and comfy
328678,Sunotel Central, The jacuzzi on the roof top was cold when it should have been hot the was a severe inconvenience as it was the sole reason I booked this hotel, Staff were very friendly and gave very good information on tours travel and resturants
328679,Sunotel Central,No Negative, I booked a standard room and we were given a suite on the 7th floor at no extra cost Very comfortable spacious and the terrace was really fantastic Pity it was cold and rainy Breakfast is a good spread with lots of different options Highly recommend this 
328680,Sunotel Central, The hot tub was cold when we tried to use it twice , The shower was amazing it was a massive overhead rain head and felt so nice The location couldn t be more perfect and a 4 minute walk from the metro The wifi was really strong and the computers were free to use 
328681,Sunotel Central, Quite noisy if your room is set on the street , A great hotel set a little bit out of the bustle of Barcelona A happy medium in terms of access to stadium museums and the old town The reception staff were always very helpful in times of need 
328682,Sunotel Central, Bit dodgy facility wise for a 4 star hotel The room was extremely small Nespresso machine had old capsule inside and they didn t refill the capsules even after couple of nights so I m guessing its only for one night Bit intrusive housekeepers as we asked them for the room to be cleaned later but two of them at different times just barged in without knocking , Good value for money Fantastic location Clean rooms Nice view on the rooftop Recommended 
328683,Sunotel Central,No Negative, The windows in my room were very big and the view was amazing even from the second floor The staff is really nice Apparently there is a rooftop with a swimming pool but I didn t get a chance to go up 
328684,Sunotel Central, The lighting in the bedrooms were quite dim if one wanted to read , The staff on the check in counter were all very helpful friendly and went out of their way to help with extra little things if needed They were kind and courteous and nothing was a problem The rooms were comfortable and quiet The food was plentiful and the waiters and also cleaning staff were friendly helpful and courteous The location was amazing in its closeness to the city centre We really enjoyed our stay and would happily recommend the hotel for families or anyone who wants to be in a reasonable budgeted hotel with pleasant friendly staff and close to the city 
328685,Sunotel Central, Lighting of the room was so poor and i couldn t see a thing so i purchase a flashlight to see better at night they should improve this aspect, Good location near metro
328686,Sunotel Central, The beds were really hard the room way too hot and the thermostat couldn t be adjusted any cooler Spent some time in the rooftop jacuzzi and the chemicals were so strong at one point that my husband and were both suddenly ill When I got out I realized I had sustained chemical burns on my body , This was a great value The location is central to pretty much everything in Barcelona 
328687,Sunotel Central, My room was looking to back side of the street and bathroom was bigger then room , Easy to reach from airport with bus A1 then 2 minutes by walking Also close to catalunya square Staff was helpfull and friendly 
328688,Sunotel Central, The look is a bit oldish towards 3 stars I wouldn t pay too much on the room If you pay like I did 40 euro per night then it is fine , Centrally located 5 minutes from airport buses very kind staff clean verycomfortable bed 
328689,Sunotel Central,No Negative, Breakfast ok bit expensive 15 pp but convenient and if you have for entire stay 20 discount Hotel good clean and comfortable excellent location for bus tube and tours Fabulous City of Barcelona so much to see lots of places to eat nearby we visited at Christmas just lovely
328690,Sunotel Central, Breakfast was expensive so we didn t get it , The metro stop was 200 m away It was just a few stops away from all the major sites Shower was hot and pressure great They also provided us with a baby crib with balloons and candies 
328691,Sunotel Central, If you are a light sleeper ask for a room at the back side , Excellent hotel The location is perfect 2 min from metro station and 7 min from Pla a Catalunya The staff is awesome ask for their recommendations Thank you Fran Carlos and Toni The room is comfortable and clean We also had a coffee maker in the room which was great and even had a champagne as a gift for our honeymoon 
328692,Sunotel Central, We had rain one day , Comfortable clean room Good Wi Fi also location close to AiroBus and Metro or number of other busses Breakfast was nice and variant and the breakfast room clean comfortable and quiet NO TV as it should be 
328693,Sunotel Central, We couldn t get a bathtub although we ve chosen this hotel for it They should fix the room window that never shut properly and the noise from outside was quite loud , Great location Bus stops are just in front of the hotel and the central square Pl Cataluna and metro stations are in 15 min walk distance What we needed such as shops bars restaurants cafeterias and a pharmacy are next to the hotel 
328694,Sunotel Central, Garage not suitable for big cars No slippers The Cleansing can be improved , Very good hotel with modern nice rooms Good bathroom Position walking distance Complementary coffee Nespresso in room 
328695,Sunotel Central, Bit slow service at the breakfast always something missing from the buffet and it took long for the staff to bring out more Bad coffee and juices and water not cold , Comfy bed and nice location 
328696,Sunotel Central, Nothing at all We didn t find any flaw , Staff excellent and helpful Location very near to Universitat metro station bus stop exactly outside the hotel entrance Cleanliness and facilities are excellent We went in November it was cold so couldn t use swimming pool but we did use jacuzzi Good value for money If we visit Barcelona again we would definitely stay here again 
328697,Sunotel Central, More electrical outlets are needed in the rooms People have to charge their mobile phones and their laptops , Everything was good mainly its closeness to the center of Barcelona
328698,Sunotel Central, It is not what you would expect to find in a 4 star hotel The interiors are very outdated and the rooms do not have any light We were first placed in a tiny room with no light at all there are no ceiling lights in the hotel or any spotlights just two small lamps at each side of the bed however after bringing this up to the reception they moved us to a bigger room Because the room was facing the sunrise and it was a wonderful weather during our stay the room got extremely hot to the point we started sweating and lucky for us the AC was not working , I would give the staff 10 out of 10 they were extremely helpful and friendly The location of the property was also very good and the WiFi excellent 
328699,Sunotel Central, n a, Balcony room very spacious and clean Very impressed The reception staff very helpful in advising where to catch bus metro etc and where Ramblas was 
328700,Sunotel Central, There is no feeling of 4stars hotel One single bed for a couple was just two beds moved together slipping on the floor Towels were not changed during 3 days stay as well as bedclothing No toothpaste no bathrobe We were refused to check out 2 hours later for free despite the fact that we arrived at midnight and they had free rooms , Location is perfect Tasty fruits for breakfast Free coffee machine in the room 
328701,Sunotel Central, We were first given a room with a balcony that was tremendously noisy Very poor noise canceling infrastructure and thin windows We were also woken up by the cleaning lady early in the morning , Location is great right in the city center Bed is comfortable 
328702,Sunotel Central, We were in the second floor and could hear the cars and the people in the street all night A 4 star hotel should have a better acoustic isolation , Central place really near to the subway line Good breakfast Everybody was very nice and all of the employees were able to speak in english 
328703,Sunotel Central, at the first night I stayed in the first floor and the place was noisy because is close from the reception and in the basement there were a party till 2 am so I couldn t sleep till morning next day I asked them to change the room for me and was much quite and comfortable , The hotel not far from the center and metro station
328704,Sunotel Central, Unfortunately my flight was delayed so when I arrived at the hotel the bar had closed at 10 pm so couldn t get a drink Also there were no plugs for the bath and they couldn t find any on the reception desk, The bed was very comfy and the hotel nice and quiet and clean
328705,Sunotel Central, Garage access is a trouble As a 4 star cleanless may be improved but is ok Air con system a bit noisy , Nice rooms confy bed Good bathroom with excellent shower Nespresso in the room is cool Position Breakfast 
328706,Sunotel Central, Nothing to mention , Great location between two metro stations amazing shower hair dryer in the bathroom and as a bonus a nespresso machine in our room with free replenishment every day Also very friendly staff from the moment of booking till our check out 
328707,Sunotel Central,No Negative, Perfect location close to many bars and restaurants and the metro station Five minutes from the aerobus stop and ten from la Rambla The staff was very polite and helpfull the rooms clean and spacious 
328708,Sunotel Central, The sound insulation is non existant I could constantly hear conversations of other people and a colleague who stayed on the top floor could hear people splashing about in the roof top jacuzzi , Good location a few minutes from the University The placa Catalunya is a 15 min walk from here The rooms are clean and functional albeit a bit small The breakfast is quite decent 
328709,Sunotel Central, Room was tiny Literally just enough space to walk around the bed View Well is was a view of all the other rooms windows in some strange enclosure That had a roof on so no fresh air Room got very stuffy Was very clean though cleaners are very nice and friendly and room was very clean 4 cleaning 4 staff Not a 4 facility in the uk this would be a b and b at best Cant stress enough how small the bed and room was The saving grace here is the staff , Staff are very helpful once you arrive Getting a straight forward answer before hand was alot harder But once we was there the staff was more then helpful young gentleman at breakfast was lovely n friendly and gentleman with the glasses on reception was very helpful 
328710,Sunotel Central, I didn t like the fact that I had twin bed that were on wheels and were moving a lot not comfortable at all the view from the first floor it wasn t nice especially that the room was orientated on the back of the hotel , The location is perfect close to the placa universitat and very close to the metro station 
328711,Sunotel Central, furniture in the lobby of the hotel in need of repair Staff working at the breakfast should be more qualified , The hotel s location is very convenient in the heart of the city Metro 3 minutes to go on foot Breakfast at the hotel great Rooms overlook the courtyard it was very quiet and comfortable rest 
328712,Sunotel Central, Sheets were a little thin and was put in a twin room when we came as a couple had to sleep seperate , Really good breakfast selection and in a great location just 2 minutes walk from universistat underground metro station
328713,Sunotel Central, We had to change our room twice the rooms positioned near the main road are very noisy and very poor isolated so it was cold at night and we couldn t sleep at all due to the noise Rooms are not smelling nice i guess the smell is coming from the bathroom and the furniture is kind of old and not giving the impression you re at a hotel of 4 stars Maids were making a lot of noise and you could not sleep after 8 8 30 a m, Very good position Coffee machine in the room with a good coffee Staff was nice
328714,Sunotel Central,No Negative, Very comfortable room with luxurious bathroom Very comfortable beds and Every day cleaning the room There is great espresso machine in the room The hotel s reception staff are helping all the questions There is traffic noise from the road but it does not bother me Especially important to be careful of pickpockets on the bus that someone Stole my wallet on the bus 
328715,Sunotel Central, That the terrace didn t open till 10am I think it should be earlier , The bed was comfortable good service and the balcony was my favourite feature 
328716,Sunotel Central, We didn t eat breakfast at the hotel It was offered at 15 Euro which I thought was overpriced when only a block down we could get a full breakfast of bacon eggs tomatoes and toast for 7 Euro , The hotel was only three blocks to the Metro The Gothic Quarter Las Ramblas and Port Vell were easy walking distance less than 10 minutes Good shopping restaurants We requested a quiet room and we re given one away from the street so was lovely and quiet The hotel has a pool and spa 
328717,Sunotel Central, The lobby is quite basic and so are the rooms but it s all about the location I would rate this a 3 star hotel and not 4 A room service menu would have been nice but i guess they don t do room service I ordered delivery from outside of the hotel and had no problems They actually let everyone inside which could be a problem , The location is as the hotel name suggests very central I had a room on street side on the 4th floor and even though you can hear the traffic or the youth hanging about outside it did not bother me as i am used to city noises and it s not that bad The room is basic but neat and clean and nothing was broken The TV people complained about is small indeed but if you go on holiday to watch TV the problem is with you I never even touched the TV 
328718,Sunotel Central, This hotel is appalling we arrived and were presented with a room with the remnants of the previous guests and not in a good way chewing gum on the bedside table condom wrappers on tv unit need we go on Lift didn t work safe box locked and would not open with our belongings safely stored inside doors would not lock a total sham of a hotel and to top it off they charged us twice DO NOT USE THIS HOTEL, Nothing
328719,Sunotel Central, Music club in the hotel very loud in weekend till 3 a m and the housekeepers working in the morning loud we stayed in the first floor So we have problems with sleep ,No Positive
328720,Sunotel Central, small room even though i had payed for a standard not basic room the room looked like the room from the booking com but standard not basic, clean and good position
328721,Sunotel Central, We asked for a double bed whereas we got 2 single beds standing next to each other They kept on moving apart which was really uncomfortable We also asked for a possibility to get a room with a balcony at least a month before our arrival but the one we got had a view on the patio and no balcony The breakfast was rather dissapointing arround 9 30 there were already no eggs left an even though the breakfast is served till 11 there was no second round of those wchich is pretty unfair to those who prefer to eat a bit later , The Personel was nice There was a coffee machine in our room with some really good coffee The rooms were tidy and cleaned up on a regular basis The location of the hotel is perfect 
328722,Sunotel Central, We had a street facing room which was quite noisy so earplugs solved that problem very easily , The bed and pillows were extremely comfy really comfortable 
328723,Sunotel Central, Unfortunately the pool area was being upgraded at the time so we could nt use it Did nt know that when booking , Helpful and friendly staff Hotel not overcrowded so could easily use their computers and hall area when needed Very good breakfast Bus stop outside the door and close to other routes too 
328724,Sunotel Central, The room was fairly small but adequate The shower was running very slowly so I told them as we left No idea whether action taken , We asked for a quiet room and had one facing into the central space high up no view but very quiet staff were very friendly The breakfast was OK It s handy for the shuttlebus from the airport only 5 minutes walk from the stop There is a pool but we didn t have time to use it
328725,Sunotel Central, Actually nothing , Been there on Oct 29 Nov 2 2016 Very kind and helpful staff clean and quiet room on the 4th floor facing the internal court nice pool on the rooftop 
328726,Sunotel Central, entrance a bit small and you need to look out carefully or you might miss that, very near metro and rambla pl catalunya where you can see lots of local shops and artists room is clean and staff is nice It s a bit expensive but thats about the average price in Barcelona
328727,Sunotel Central,No Negative, Excellent central location close to Hop on Hop off bus and to the Aerobus to airport Hotel was clean and the bed comfortable Staff was very helpful with directions and answering questions 
328728,Sunotel Central, Air Con was broken and the room was like the center of the sun when we checked in The hotel did change our room when we complained so that was really good , Breakfast was good staff we very helpful the location was awesome
328729,Sunotel Central, Room walls thin for next room noise and air conditioning not very good A request notice to keep noise down late would help , Room facing rear of hotel very good and quite late at night 
328730,Sunotel Central,No Negative, The staff were friendly and helpful We had a late flight home but our cases were looked after in a locked room following checkout so we could make the most of our last day The breakfast set us up for the day and there was plenty of choice 
328731,Sunotel Central,No Negative, The staff is great Inspite of being a hotel in the middle of a busy area the sound proofing is just great The location is just fantastic 100 recommended 
328732,Sunotel Central, We ended up with 2 single beds pushed together that wouldn t usually have been a problem but the beds were very unstable on the floor and would roll apart extremely easily They d roll away from the head board and roll away from each other leaving a huge gap in the centre It wasn t the end of the world but very annoying for a couple traveling together Also the walls are very very thin the rolling beds were obviously an issue in other rooms as you could hear furniture moving around through the walls and ceiling and hitting the head boards The doors to the rooms aren t very secure There are signs saying make sure you close the door securely which I did but one day we returned home to find the door open Luckily nothing was missing but this was very disturbing The jacuzzi water looked a bit murky We still used and enjoyed it but it could have looked fresher and more inviting rather than a dirty bath , Great location walking distance from central catalunya square and plenty of bars and restaurants near by We didn t really use the metro but there university at station is a block away Also a short walk from la rambla Lovely roof terrace with pool and the jacuzzi is heated which went down a treat when the temperature dropped in the evenings The roof terrace has bathrooms with lots of fresh towels to use around there The rooms are dated but nice and clean The walk in shower was great Very powerful with numerous heads and settings 
328733,Sunotel Central, The place is a dump and not worth the money It s clean enough but a depressing lobby and reception area My stomach sank the minute I walked into the place Room was okay but very bare with a small t v far away from the bed We could hear everything from the bathroom above us and we had a backflow of sewer gas one morning after a sudden thunderstorm If this place was half the price they could get away with this but they ve got a lot of nerve charging such a premium price , Great location close to La Rambla and easy access to airport Nice breakfast and the room was spacious enough for the two of us
328734,Sunotel Central, the beds had been twin beds not possible to sleep close together poorly equipped room no cosy sitting in the evening possible have to be outside , the location
328735,Sunotel Central, breakfast really not worth the money the worst I have ever had for a 4 stars hotel really crap and terrible quality I would certainly recommend to avoid spending that money Maintenance Not perfect ventilation system in the bathroom indeed the system was struggling to get rid of the humidity , location staff
328736,Sunotel Central, was a little chilly that night and could have done with an extra layer , The staff on reception were very friendly and helpful Shower was really good and the bed comfortable Loved the coffee and tea facilities in the room mini bar was a nice touch 
328737,Sunotel Central, The shower in my room was half covered not full covered not Capain So the water goes out of the shower to fill the floor of the bathroom while taking a shower , Everything is nice in this hotel All the stuff are really very helpful 
328738,Sunotel Central, very small and noisy room we had the room with street view on 6 floor very noisy and beds are really small , Great Location breakfat and very friendly staff 
328739,Sunotel Central, The hotel was OK but the rooms and seems a bit old The breakfast was borderline fine The food was not the best quality i e orange juice from concentrate , The location is excellent Right on an important street that connects with the rest of the city and 10 min to the Pla a Catayluna 
328740,Sunotel Central, Rooms slightly on the small side That s about it , Central location and well kept rooms bathroom Roof top pool and jacuzzi a plus as well Staff very friendly Nothing was too much trouble 
328741,Sunotel Central, The hotel offers early check in and when it s requested it s provided to some but not to others First come first serve should be appropriate not wait and watch someone who arrives an hour after you gets to check in early while you are still sitting waiting If it is a matter of more expensive rooms have early check in then that should be the stated policy , It is a perfect central location to the Eixample district The bars and restaurants were a few blocks away and it was just perfect 
328742,Sunotel Central, We made the mistake of booking on Booking com Their website was very deceiving in that when we reserved the room the website reported the room we reserved was booked and to book another room which we did Much to our surprise the website congratulated us for booking two rooms We tried to correct it with booking com Booking com said we had to correct it with Sunotel and Sunotel said we had to correct it with Booking com The issue was never resolved and we paid twice what we should have paid shame on Booking com Beware of their website , AC and pool
328743,Sunotel Central, We stayed at the front of the hotel which was very noisy also car park was very difficult to enter which entailed us damaging our car be aware , Location was good 
328744,Sunotel Central, Nothing, lovely hotel and the rooftop pool an added bonus breakfast here is nice Our bedroom on the 7th floor was excellent with a terrace and a spectacular city view and table and chairs on the terrace to relax Minibar provided and bathroom lovely the bed very comfortable there is a nespresso machine also A short walk to the main square and La Rambla make sure you call in the Estudente bar in University square for the best gin and tonics 
328745,Sunotel Central, Late flight and not being able to check out late as was fully booked Maybe hotels should have a bathroom available for guests with late flights to be able to shower and change and charge a usage tariff , Room was very nice and had spacious balcony Well located and staff pleasant and helpful 
328746,Sunotel Central, What s not to like, This hotel is within easy reach of all the sights It is on a lovely wide boulevard with plenty of bars and restaurants The staff are welcoming the rooms are spacious and clean and are kept clean every day by lovely staff But the best thing is the lush breakfast that is provided 
328747,Sunotel Central,No Negative, Good location pleasant staff cozy rooms nice breafkast working wi fi It s very nice that you can leave your luggage while your room is not ready and go for a walk Pool on the roof is not as big as we expected but still good refreshment during hot days 
328748,Sunotel Central, Breakfast for the price was a little disappointing there s plenty of options close by for half the price Our room faced the main avenue the noise from traffic was fairly loud so bear this in mind if this is something that would bother you we didn t mind and expected it given the location in fact we liked our balcony facing out on the lively street , The location is excellent Our room was surprisingly quite spacious given the general size of rooms you d expect for the price Hotel is clean and reception is open 24hrs Staff were pleasant and efficient The roof top pool although small is a good option for relaxing at the beginning end of the day with plenty of towels and loungers We d have no problem staying here again if back in Barcelona in the future 
328749,Sunotel Central, Very noisy room balcony door is very loose so there are drafts road noise and diesel smell inside the room Balcony is very tiny except floor 2 balconies only for one people There is a coffee machine in the room but no additional power outlets you should choose between charging a gadget and turning on room lights , Excellent location minutes walk from all you want to see in Barcelona 
328750,Sunotel Central, Loud area on main road guests making noise until 6am, Rooftop pool area jacuzzi Small but handy in the heat of summer Location on the edge of Las Ramblas 10 min walking 25 min walk to the gothic quarter Coffee facilities in room large bathrooms with rain shower 
328751,Sunotel Central, I did not care for the smell that came up from the bathroom pipes Once I closed the bathroom door then it was ok , The locaci n is perfect for me Close to metro and touristy area but far enouth that it s safe and quiet 
328752,Sunotel Central, In my first night my money was stolen from my wallet while I was taking a shower The manager never help us with solve the problem and after told him our experience he was really rude with us The response from the manager was we never closed our door properly but I never expected that Instead the Hotel have lots of warnings about check your things maybe I was not the first person that had happened REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE IN THIS HOTEL, Good location
328753,Sunotel Central, Tiny rooms the smallest of any hotel I ve ever stayed in Air conditioning was not good and room was very hot Bed was small Doesn t really warrant a 4 hotel rating , Location was good Reasonably priced 
328754,Sunotel Central, Coffee at breakfast could be better When you spend this amount in a hotel I expect better coffee in the morning, Great bed nice to have a coffee machine in the room love the air conditioning and basically loved the attitude of the staff Really great
328755,Sunotel Central,No Negative, Excellent location had balcony we could sit on Room was good bathroom too No complaints at all not disturbed by traffic noise and hotel very quiet 
328756,Sunotel Central, The hangover , I have stayed in this hotel before both experiences have been good nice hotel with a good location 10minute walk from ramblas excellent bars close by and the transport system in Barcelona is brilliant 
328757,Sunotel Central, The street maybe noisy if you want to sleep with the window open But we didn t really mind as we slept we airco on Nice to have a pool in the hotel but there was too much chlorine in the water, Comfortable and room great breakfast friendly staff and good location Good sized room with a very big shower cabin We had an espresso machine in our room Breakfast exactly like in pic We were on the 6th floor and had a great view on balcony I would definitly recommand Sunotel Central 
328758,Sunotel Central, Our room was facing the main street and a bit loud We had to have the balcony doors closed Breakfast was expensive chose the option without breakfast , Great location nice hotel with a pool on the roof Nespresso machine in the room 
328759,Sunotel Central, Elevator was quite slow , Good location just a ten min walk from city centre Helpful staff nice pool area and the room was very clean good air con and comfortable bed 
328760,Sunotel Central, There was nothing good about this hotel staff at reception was had no smile on face very rude room allotted to us was badly smelling lift was not working breakfast was very poor quality so as restaurant staff very rude and unpleasant faces over all very bad experience staying in this hotel never recommend any one to stay in this hotel, nothing was good at all except of location 
328761,Sunotel Central, Internet is not so good During our stay the only made ours beds but all the coffee cups and spoons and trash were there from day one until we check out , Location is very good Very friendly staff 
328762,Sunotel Central, Didn t get on too well with my bed pillow Shame the pool didn t open until 10 am Not enough wardrobe space for a family , Location was spot on Staff were very friendly View over the buildings from our window was charming 
328763,Sunotel Central, Maybe a little noisy at night but it s right in the city centre so that can t be helped , Very comfy bed super clean room new towels every day lovely bathroom blackout blinds were great and the aircon was spot on 
328764,Sunotel Central, Poor and Bad sound proof wall and balcony glass for the street or city view rooms so you can hear every single car in the room But thanks to the helpful Javier He has chaned my room to a quiet one immediately , Very helpful staff and a special thanks again to Javier and his manager they have changed my room to a quiet one Location is cntered close to everywhere very cleen Tv has USB port so i can play some of my media Rooftop view and swimming pool was nice which it has relaxing atmosphere after long day walking in Barcelona Good breakfast till 11 00am exactly as it shows in the photos Good room size Excellent Wifi in the room and Lobby
328765,Sunotel Central, The bed is a bit small and moves quite a lot The room is also a bit small for a supposedly 4 stars hotel The lobby is also unusually small More plugs and more storage room would be nice A bit pricey but it seems these are Barcelona standards for the season , The personal is very friendly The room and the bathroom is clean and nice The location is very central on a main avenue so a bit noisy and no particular view The pool and jacuzzi are ok but shouldn t be at the center of your decision 
328766,Sunotel Central, The air conditioner was not working properly when we arrived It made noise but almost did not give any cold I asked the guy on the reception to help with it When we came later the temperature in the room was rather good it was evening already and they offered us a bottle of champagne as an excuse But finally till the end of our stay during the day it was really hot in the room with the AC put at 19 degrees we had to keep the curtains closed all the day not to have additional heat from the sun but it was getting better only by late in the evening This was really disappoiting and annoying The temperature in the reception area was also too warm so we supposed the whole hotel did not have any good AC But later our friend told it was OK in his room so at least if you our room 510 try to change it Staff in the cateen cafe was not friendly at all but actually it does not matter In the bathroom you will only find shampoo shower gel and soap even no body lotion Smoking zone just near the swimming pool i could often smell smoke when sunbathing, Staff is helpful reception and cleaning Breakfast is good Room is quite big double room pretty big bathroom with good and comfortable shower Location is pretty good very close to the metro and not far from many sights Swimming pool on the roof is small but nice 2 computers with internet available in the reception area free of charge Good wardrobe
328767,Sunotel Central, The Wi fi does not always work , The hotel is very well located just 5 min away from the Rambla street When we arrived although we have booked a normal superior room the receptionist upgraded our room for free to a Suite Junior we really enjoyed 
328768,Sunotel Central, The hotel is a little bit old but i guess they are renewing step by step It is a good choise for travellers not That good for only resting at hotel type of guests , The location of the hotel was good very close to metro station and city centre
328769,Sunotel Central, there were noises of running water from the bathroom at any time of day and night The door of the bathroom is a sliding door that doesn t fit 100 so I couldn t stop noises coming from bathroom There was also a light smell of humidity coming from the bathroom pipes I guess , The rooftop pool with jacuzzi was very nice the bedroom and bathroom were very spacious and clean Very good location
328770,Sunotel Central, if you don t like noise go for the back rooms ours had a nice terrace but a bit noisy but we had no prob with it, the bed was comfy finaly a real double bed in europe cool cappuccino machine

328781,Sunotel Central, The staff was friendly and courteous and helped when possible My only comment about the staff was that they didn t seem to want to call and make reservations for us or go out of their way to schedule something until we explained that we don t have data working phones and then they did Not bad or the end of the world but it seemed a little pushing was required , The hotel location was very good we were a few blocks from Casa Batllo in one direction and Las Rambalas in the other and very close to a Metro for the further places The room was simple clean and very nice We didn t have breakfast so no idea about the food but pool was nice Smaller then it looks in photos but we did enjoy it for one afternoon We would recommend this hotel 
328782,Sunotel Central, Only small down point was the height of the shower too low not suited to me but being 6 4 probably didn t help , Good value buffet breakfast served from 7 11am Great location ideal for being a tourist close to airport and on the bus route Excellent small rooftop pool and jacuzzi for relaxing and catching some sun 
328783,Sunotel Central, The pool and jacuzzi were not clean and never any clean towels The lifts are very slow and the hotel has a very dark decor, Staff were okay Good location for first time in Barcelona only a short walk from the metro and main street la ramblas We received a bottle of champagne as it was out nursery and had a balcony room which made a difference 
328784,Sunotel Central, The hotel has terrible lighting The lobby always had a smell of trash sweat some type of foul oder constantly The room that was paid for was a double room but was suited really for a single When opening the window to get fresh air in a poor ventilated room we heard the loud sounds from the air conditioning unit outside all night , The pool on the roof was nice The staff was great The location is good as well 
328785,Sunotel Central, Room could have been a little larger and better sound proofed from neighbours but overall not bad , This hotel is in an excellent area and offers modern and comfortable accommodations Breakfast was good all the essentials were there except for oatmeal Clean and in good condition Staff were outstanding my fianc misplaced a ring not engagement and they found it and kept it for us until we returned to Barcelona Professional in all respects Will stay here again 
328786,Sunotel Central, Didn t have any of bathroom accessories ear cleaners little far from the main but it s OK to the money paid , Openness of the room spacious balcony 
328787,Sunotel Central, wasted money paying for breakfast option female member of staff was cheeky and bad tempered had to clean a table and set it up myself after she told us to sit at a table with some german men no tea coffee or milk didn t bother going down final day , good location good wifi
328788,Sunotel Central, Nothing We cannot comment on the food because we ate out all the time , The staff were very helpful they listened to our pre booking requests and provided us with a lovely suite including a balcony They also surprised us with a lovely bottle of bubbly for our special anniversary break they really couldn t have done more for us The room was lovely and comfortable with a double modern shower free WiFi and we were able to park our car underground for a small extra charge The location was perfect for us only a 20 minute walk to the Ramblas Gothic and Ravel areas Thank you for making our stay in Barcelona so memorable and enjoyable Gemma and team

328796,Sunotel Central, Maybe a small bar area where we could grab a drink before heading out although they might of had this but I didn t see it , The staff were very helpful we had twin beds the first night but they moved us for the remainder of our stay The roof top facilities were lovely and a great way to relax after site seeing all morning

328806,Sunotel Central, There was no do not disturb door hanger so the cleaner woke us up at 9 We got one from the reception afterwards The elevator didn t go up when taking it from the room floor only from the ground floor So when wanting to go to the pool on the 8th we had to take the stairs We could take the elevator down from there though , Pool on the roof though we never got time to use it Location was great Clean and fresh rooms Front desk staff were always helpful and greeted every time possible

328808,Sunotel Central, A fly screen on the window would have been good because the room was very warm even the air con didn t cool it It was lovely having the window open but couldn t keep it open at night because of insects , Rooms were very quiet We had a back room on the 5th floor The rooms were cleaned daily There was a fridge and coffee machine Complimentary nibbles were a nice touch Comfortable beds Plenty of room The shower was great Good hairdryer Shower gel shampoo and towels were provided WI FI worked well We didn t have the breakfast as there are plenty of places to eat nearby 
328809,Sunotel Central, Air con didn t cool room Not enough lights in room Very dim at night , Great location Spacious rooms Comfortable beds Coffee maker and fridge an added bonus 
328810,Sunotel Central, Some of the staff were friendly some were very rude and not at all helpful cleaning of the room was not what we had been used to rubbish left cups not washed Just little things, The venue was what I was looking for very central
328811,Sunotel Central, There was a bar but no one to serve and the drinks were very limited so we had to have other than what we really wanted we ordered drinks from the staff member from the reception but he had to leave us to serve other people so it took a long time to get fully served and he didnt seem to know what to charge us , It was clean and the staff were helpful it was close to the city

328818,Sunotel Central, A room is a little bit noisy The insulation of the room can be better , The place of the hotel was really nice It is in the center of the city and the neighbourhood was quite decent They gave us a room with a street view which i wanted especially I really recommend the hotel It was a nice experience 
328819,Sunotel Central, Bed was a little hard hurt my back a little Also one day when we put the do not disturb sign on the door someone still came into our room , Excellent location close to las ramblas the beach metro station universitat and only a couple of miles from the nou camp stadium Also lovely and helpful staff 
328820,Sunotel Central, I decided to stay one more day and the price for one night went up dramatically I didn t like it but I had not choice than stay but next time I will think twice to stay in this hotel , Good location
328821,Sunotel Central, The Sunotel Barcelona is a medium priced hotel located on the Gran Via in inner Barcelona The location of the hotel isn t the best although it is about a block and a half from the nearest subway station However it is 15 minutes from La Ramblas and the rest of the bustling portion of Barcelona When we arrived we were greeted by a friendly gentleman who gave us a quick overview of what to do in the city and gave us our room key Upon entering the room we immediately realized it was much too hot to be comfortable This is because during the winter the Sunotel turns off its AC and encourages guests to open their windows to better cool their rooms As we put our things away we noticed that the toilet in our room had what looked like fecal matter stained onto it perhaps from the previous occupant For lack of a better word this was pretty disgusting We didn t spend much time in the room that day As night fell we made it back to our hotel We had traversed the entire city and needed a good night s rest The blankets in the Sunotel were winter blankets but they were almost impossible to sleep under given the temperature of the room even after opening the windows As the night progressed mosquitos flew into our room due to the fact that the window did not have a screen on it I was bitten by mosquitos every night I stayed at the Sunotel Closing the window would have solved the problem but would have made the room extremely hot The beds also had wheels on them so if you were one to toss and turn in your sleep you would be surprised to discover that upon your waking you d be in a different place in the room than you were when you went to bed The wheels of the beds as well as the flooring used in the Sunotel a strange hybridization between linoleum and fake wood caused this and allowed the beds to freely move on their own , The hotel did have memory foam pillows which was a welcome plus 
328822,Sunotel Central, Parents while their stay 4 nights experienced problems with shower as well as deposit box safe wasn t working For both issues staff was contacted twice however no solution provided Generally didn t feel like 4 star hotel Also though booking com shows euro as hotel currency cost amount was taken by the hotel in usd Booking confirmation prior arrival was asked to be amended to add missing passport details instead of providing electronically edited version the details were added by thick marker and sent scanned version I consider it not professional and again not 4 hotel service, Good location nice breakfast comfortable bed
328823,Sunotel Central, From day 1 experienced problems with shower as well as deposit box safe wasn t working For both issues staff was contacted twice however no assistance provided Stayed in the hotel 4 nights Generally didn t feel like 4 star hotel more like 3 Also though booking com shows euro as hotel currency cost amount was taken from card in usd , Good location nice breakfast comfortable bed
328824,Sunotel Central, Breakfast is too expensive Avoid to include in the room rate since there are plenty of great cafe and restaurants in the area where you can get a great breakfast for up to 6 7 euro with really huge portions The hotel is old but in average it was clean cozy and look fresh , Great location very friendly staff ready to help with everything Very easy to get if you reach the downtown from the airport via Aerobus Try a pool and hot jakuzzi on the roof We ve been in November and it was a great pleasure to rest in the warm water after day walkings having a great view on the city and mountains 
328825,Sunotel Central, The spa was green when we went to use it the day before it was clear though , The staff were excellent The rooms very clean We asked to change our rooms when we arrived because they were small and one smelt like smoke It s winter so staff were happy to oblige Roof terrace great place for BYO lunch even in winter We walked everywhere from here

328827,Sunotel Central, 1 No bathrobes how can i go the the pool in such a cold weather 2 We called to the reception and asked to arrange a cheapest taxi possible had some problems with Uber A taxi organized by Hotel cost me 15 EUR per 2 km I paid only 7 EUR for the back trip , Location is great Jakuzi on the rooftop is perfect We had a number with a balcony WOW 
328828,Sunotel Central, The traffic noise on the Gran V a is mortal so closed windows are a must , I loved the open air jacuzzi on the roof with views of Barcelona backyards and the hills in the background which we had all for ourselves The staff was very friendly and helpful 
328829,Sunotel Central, The room is not sound proof at all You can hear your next door neighbour taking if they talk loud And at Friday night I heard very big noise till 2 00 in th morning I guess it is from the musical restaurant next door It was so pound u can party on your own bed , The room is quite big and very clean It is near the metro line 2 walking distance of 3 mins There are a couple of restaurants just right next to the hotel A Carrefour express on the opposite of the street Quite convenient 
328830,Sunotel Central, The view to backdoor wasn t very spectacular Room smelled to smoking probably problem vith ventilation Pool was much smaller than on picture , Location was perfect in convenient distance to everywhere
328831,Sunotel Central, The soud of water flow from other rooms was very loud , Very good location safe districts A lot of places to eat and buy Nice room no sound from the street 
328832,Sunotel Central, The air conditioner stops working spontaneously the staff needs to reset it multiple times There was brownish liquid dripping from ventilation in the ceiling The rooms smells kinda old and dirty The rooms are full of dust not very clean The wifi stops working on a daily basis The shower head was really disgusting and old This is definitely not a four star hotel Also the view was overlooking something of a dump , location is good Close to bus and metro 
328833,Sunotel Central, Very noisy busy street traffic was hard to sleep There was no bar or restaurant in the hotel , Location was great walking distance to shops restaurants pubs and metro very friendly staff comfortable and clean

328835,Sunotel Central, We had three single beds pushed together so we had to sleep in a line Mother son and daughter did not give us any room at all for maneuvering around the room and if you actually had things you needed to hang up then there was only once small wardrobe with five hangers between three of us No tea and coffee facilities , The Hotel was in a great location near to Placa do Catalunya and five mins from Las Ramblas Hotel staff friendly and helpful 
328836,Sunotel Central, The only bad thing paper thin walls When someone from other room closed the door the wall of my room trembled Not a nice feeling at 6am , Excellent location nice staff clean

328841,Sunotel Central, Pretty expensive 15 eur pers for breakfast is a waste of money as there are small coffe bars Starbucks and local bakeries just around the corner Rooms are pretty small we had a 3 beds room and there was actualy no place to put your bags after the third bed was put in the room View from the window was looking over backyard actualy in other people s windows and balconies did not impress me Tv did not work and we had to call reception every day to activate it Mini bar was well equipped but no bottle opener I think you can find better deals for the price of this one also close to the town centre , Location is superb right next to Plaza de Catalunya close to tourist buses and just 5 mins away from La Rambla Neighbourhood is full of small caffes restaurants Starbucks and small bistros are in the same street Staff was really helpfull and gave us many useful information regarding tourist sites and attractions Room was ok clean and well maintained cleaning ladies did a great job Breakfast was good but way too expensive 15 eur pers not worth it And they served it from 8 am too late Swimming pool is situated on the top floor but opens just after 10 am until 9 pm which we found too late as we are early risers You can t even sit on the terrace outside these hours because it s locked
