275920,Barcelona Princess, One day the cleaner forgot to add a towel in our bathroom so we only had one big one I called the reception and they promised to bring one but never showed up , The room was really nice 
275921,Barcelona Princess, The toilet door opened in and was stopped by the toilet seat so we had to squeeze in the little gap The wait for the lift can be quite long at times, The rooftop pool The service was great And very helpful The location was great too
275922,Barcelona Princess, Didn t like the room service served cold food only during the night no hot warm meals I am used to hotels serving this 24 7 Bit far from the city centre than I realised but it wasn t that bad in the end , Nice clean hotel room service good buffet breakfast bath robes and big bathroom We were one of the lucky rooms to have a terrace 
275923,Barcelona Princess, Average breakfast among the hotel breakfasts I have had in Spain , My wife and I stayed at Princess hotel during our honeymoon the hotel s location is brilliant and I personally think that s why it s rated so highly While the room may have been a bit small the view however was breathtaking We stayed on the 26th floor and were offered complimentary snacks and drinks upon checking in 
275924,Barcelona Princess, Food is below average and the gym bar is overpriced for what you get , Lovely staff The rooms were well sized and have great facilities Master suite has phenomenal views 
275925,Barcelona Princess, It was quite a long taxi ride to city centre and to the historical and cultural attractions of Barcelona , The location was close to the beach and the facilities were good 
275926,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, The hotel is right in front of a subway station so it made our way from the airport pretty easy We got there and everybody was extremely nice the room had a nice city view although we d have chosen the sea view if we d had known better the frigobar was free Not even after 10 minutes in the room we received a super welcoming gift a bottle of champagne and some chocolate covered strawberries We told them in advance we were celebrating our anniversary and they were lovely The restaurant in front of the swimming pool was also delicious and cheap We had many amazing tapas and draft beer enjoying the sun and the pool view It s also right next to a mall with good stores and restaurants for a quick meal 
275927,Barcelona Princess, We stayed 4 nights at Barcelona Prince hotel we were first assigned to room 601 The room was in the shadow side and had bad ventilation We found mold on the wall of the bath room We stayed one night in the room and requested to change room and been reassigned to 1011 The new room faces the morning sunlight and sea There is no more mold smell But when we enter the room we saw a bug on the bathroom floor which was really disgusting See picture After all the experience we had a bad memory in the hotel for 4 nights The room cleaner has done their job with good efforts I think the problem lays with shower design It is a fault design as if you are not careful when shower the water splits everywhere in the bath room and makes the whole room damp and easy to get mold bugs , The location of hotel is continent and close to metro and beach Complementary drinks are provided by hotel everyday in mini bar The bed is comfortable and wide 
275928,Barcelona Princess, The lifts indeed take ages sometimes If you are in a hurry on a business trip it might be an issue but for us spending a relaxed and fun weekend it was not really cumbersome , Excellent service attentive and friendly staff spacious modern rooms and delicious breakfast We came as a surprise birthday trip for my boyfriend s 30th I received an excellent assistance in preparation of the bday extras we received a free upgrade to a room on a higher floor with a view over the whole city where everything was perfectly arranged upon our arrival The hotel is located towards the northern end of the city next to a big shopping centre and perfectly connected with the city centre bus and metro stops are just around the corner Taxi from El Prat airport was less than EUR 40 on a Saturday evening Personally did not experience any noise and sleep disruption on the contrary but there were no events at Forum during our stay The rooms are spacious the beds gigantic and comfortable there is a free mini bar refilled daily and bathrobes and slippers are provided Breakfast buffet is rich and delicious With special thanks to Marina we ll be back and will certainly recommend to others 
275929,Barcelona Princess, The pools are a joke they are very small the room service is bad we ordered a pizza and it looked like a frozen pizza just put in the microwave the location is far from the major points of interest in Barcelona You have a metro station near the hotel but you have to take at least 10 15 station to reach a point of interest , The cleaning service was exceptional and the staff was very friendly Good for business 
275930,Barcelona Princess, If you go for the swimming pool don t expect to swim because the pool is very small , Great view on Barcelona There was a suprise in our room for our wedding anniversary The sauna was included There is a shopping center with breakfast possibilities in the neighbourhood 
275931,Barcelona Princess, nope , bed room rest room location all of them are good above all things staffs were so kind especially our baggage already arrived at our room after we played outside train station is so close to hotel thank you 
275932,Barcelona Princess, 3 hours late check in and when I requested for a late check out I got immediately rejected without even finishing up my sentence It was always a long wait for the lifts and too few sun beds by the pool, Great modern rooms great facilities good location near the mall restaurants and the beach 
275933,Barcelona Princess, Very dark rooms No kettle facility for boiling water to make baby s milk Very annoying having to order this from room service who repeatedly wanted money for this service , Location is great and free mini bar was a nice touch
275934,Barcelona Princess, It was a shame not to have a balcony to enjoy the views even more and the sheets in the room had dried blood on them even though changed twice Despite this the room was lovely Unfortunately the pool areas were always busy which was a shame The hotel is a little far from the airport in terms of public transport over an hour and 3 changes on metro so do expect to use taxis , The bed was huge and comfortable shower was amazing free drinks in the mini bar and amazing views from the 24th floor Best night sleep in ages due to black out blinds Brilliant to have 2 pools always busy and a bar in the building Good access to public transport taxi rank round the corner and a metro station 2 min walk away 
275935,Barcelona Princess, The area is VERY touristy so don t expect amazing tapas around every corner Rooms are pretty small plus the partion between the bedroom and bathroom is glass so you can see you partner showering or going to the bathroom The wifi is pretty crappy Being on the 22nd floor meant waiting constantly for the lifts As one was out of order during our stay it meant we spent half our day waiting around in the lobby or our floor The sunbathing area of the top floor pool was big enough either to get hold of a lounger we had to get there at 8am , Hotel was in a fantastic location to the beach and on top of a massive shopping centre with restaurants and a cinema We had an amazing view of the city and the cathedral from the 22nd floor The mini fridge is free And is stocked up semi regularly Not sure if that was intential or not Staff are friendly enough Pool areas are nice enough each with a bar and snacks 
275936,Barcelona Princess, instead of one double bed there was 2 twin beds put together the minimum time of waiting an elevator is 5 minutes , great breakfast the staff are very helpful 
275937,Barcelona Princess, The pools although nice do not really accommodate the number of guests staying at the very large hotel We tried to go a couple of times however each time was too busy and we couldn t get a seat The room could do with more plug sockets Although a hair drier is provided it was very heavy and required you to hold down the button at all times I decided to use my own instead but could not find a plug socket close enough to a mirror to do this Again due to the sheer size of the hotel getting to the ground floor from the 20th floor can take a long time because we had to stop at every other floor for more people to get in , We stayed on the 20th floor and the view was spectacular The window was the width of the room so you could see everything The room was clean modern and a decent size The bed was very comfortable and the black out blinds ensured a good sleep The staff were pleasant and helpful 
275938,Barcelona Princess, The breakfast looked somewhat ok but it could be better so I preferred not to have it as an option as it was quite expensive The night shift personnel were very rude and actually not any helpful at all I asked for help with luggage and they showed me the carriage so that I will do it myself I know some of the persons working at the front desk during the day were more than helpful and did their best to furnish all my requests while my stay there like my amigo Miguel who was excellent but this guy on the night shift was terrible even threatened of cancelling my reservation there for an absurd reason that wanted everyone to give them their id before the room was offered to us so everybody should have their id s ready to get in the hotel even if it was 3 a m and really wanted to go to sleep I believe that most hotels if not all just need the id of the person that reserved the room and a visa card at the most but just imagine someone travelling with 4 children and to have to show everyone s id s before he gets the rooms good luck , The hotel offers a great view from their swimming pool on one f the top floors of the building Nice comfortable beds even though I specifically asked for a large double bed and got two twins joined together instead Nice location and very good view of the Port of Barcelona even though it is far from the center 
275939,Barcelona Princess, On one of the days we had do not disturb on the door and the cleaner still came in and woke us up , I loved the way the room was arranged on request with rose petals and chocolate strawberries and champagne 
275940,Barcelona Princess, Rude staff bar staff were very rude and abrupt when asked for anything Lack of lifts, Excellent location Excellent views of the city and out towards the beaches Lovely laid out rooms and spacious bathroom 
275941,Barcelona Princess, When checking out at reception was alittle hard to understand staff lack of english was very friendly , Room was excellent Location was perfect Lots around the area 
275942,Barcelona Princess, Wish the pool was heated , It was a 5 minute walk to the beach Very clean and the staff were friendly Free drinks from the minibar in the room Great view from the pool of the beach 
275943,Barcelona Princess, Waiting time for the lifts There was only 3 lifts and sometimes it took more than a few minutes before one arrived , Room was excellent condition and size very modern and the view was fantastic could see the sea even from only the 9th floor 
275944,Barcelona Princess, The hotel security was sporadic and we had a handbag snatched in reception when no security on duty When alerted the reception staff fetched the security guard gave us info re the police but then never contacted us again during our stay The hotel bar closed early and only room service after 1 00am for residents Bit early when travelling with teenagers and out seeing the evening sights in the city would have liked a nightcap altogether as on holiday , The rooms were lovely good location Had breakfast at a couple of bars nearby as hotel was way too expensive Shopping mall next door Beach walkable very nice beach club 
275945,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, We were on the 23rd floor with the pool and bar on the same level a great floor to be on The beach nearby was a bonus and much less crowded than Barcelonetta 
275946,Barcelona Princess, The cleanliness of furniture and decor in room needs updating The bathroom Could Better also especially what you pay for Also got over charged for the room , The hotel was lovely overall the views from the hotel were amazing The staff I spoke with were polite The pool area was cute and simple with good view The room was a great size 
275947,Barcelona Princess, No iron available only laundry service we had to pay on arrival instead of departure pools were very small and cold no conditioner only cheap shampoo and shower gel , Happy Hour at the Gym bar from 3pm 7pm 
275948,Barcelona Princess, The 2 pools were very small especially the rooftop one There was no room to sit by the pool or go in the pool after 5 6 other people were there , The staff were very friendly and helpful room was large and confortable 
275949,Barcelona Princess, The stuff was arogant and rude the cleaning service was poor The hotel is quite far from the city centre , The room was nice spacious beds were comfy the view was great pool view quiet area
275950,Barcelona Princess, No tea making facilities in the room Room service only gave 1 sachet of milk with a pot of tea costing 3 TV only in Spanish Other than the cash machines in hotel and shopping centre no where other than in the La Ramblas Gothic Quarter area to change cash , Location Shopping centre next door to hotel Beach less than a 10 walk Metro tram bus and tour bus stop just steps away Cash machine in hotel 2 pools gym sauna free mini bar Comfy cool room with sea street view 
275951,Barcelona Princess, I asked for clothes to just be ironed as they do not offer an iron for your room and they charged me a full dry cleaning service which was 50 for 5 items Literally ridiculous I could of brought an iron for that Not all staff understood English and there was then a miss communication about a late check out Simple English would help , Really nice size bed Staff went the extra mile for my partner and got him champagne and a cake for his 21st 
275952,Barcelona Princess, The bed was comfy but instead of a double it felt like two single beds pushed together which was a bit odd Food and drinks were average , The view from the room was great the room was modern and clean pool facilities were good and staff were helpful Walking distance to a beach and metro station 
275953,Barcelona Princess, Staff are not so friendly and work in a slow pace, Nice breakfast swimming pool is small but nice view Location is far from city center but there is metro close to hotel There is also a big shopping mall just next to the hotel which is fantastic 
275954,Barcelona Princess, Roof top pool not that great although the one on the 3rd floor was nice It s a reasonable distance from the main city 8 stops on the metro, Staff were friendly room was clean
275955,Barcelona Princess, When it s busy not enough lifts No external staircase in event of fire especially high floors , Breakfast vey good but very expensive Beds comfortable
275956,Barcelona Princess, Lift busy in the morning a lot of people were waiting a lot for a lift but this is only small think, Perfect stay with great sea view soft drinks free each day in the room
275957,Barcelona Princess, There s footprints and some kinda stains on the walls and if you book the standard room with double bed then you get two single beds combined , Great location right beside the shopping mall and also close to my conference place 
275958,Barcelona Princess, Had power cut for several hours which meant no AC and the blinds stuck shut so had pitch black hot room and when calling reception they found it amusing Lifts were dreadfully slow when working No guidelines to opening hours of hotel bars pools No help with luggage to room while having to move car as they never replied to parking booking,No Positive
275959,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, Breakfast was great Everytime you come back to hotel wiFi needs to be connected again Very troublesome Even going from one place to another within the hotel needed reconnection No tea coffee making facilities in the room Even hot water is not complimentary No ironing facility in the room Long waiting for the elevators Overpriced 
275960,Barcelona Princess, Imagine yourself in a 20th floor room a fantastic sea view through an enormous window and all of a sudden there is a guy outside the window cleaning it Without you being warn What a strange and uncomfortable situation ,No Positive
275961,Barcelona Princess, I was not gone on the room though because there was none or little privacy between the main room and the bathroom area I thought the place was too modern plastic There was a girl at reception who has an attitude problem so we tended to wait until the guy There was no ironing facilities in the room and the price to have anything done was extortionate , The bar food was excellent and reasonably priced We really enjoyed Barcelona though oh and the beer was good in the bar at the hotel 
275962,Barcelona Princess, The elevators took a long time and there were always queues to travel between floors The reception staff were very unfriendly The swimming pools are much smaller than in the photos online with limited seating, The room was nice had a good view
275963,Barcelona Princess, The lift wait for hours and then took the stairs as many other guest In this hotel they have a problem with lifts, 2 small pools at different floor level Slept very well room totally dark 
275964,Barcelona Princess, There was a lot of noise partying The walls seem to be paper thin The pools was a little grubby and dirty It s disgusting having smoking on the pool decks It inevitably ends up in the pool , Room was comfortable Incredible shower Very nice view 
275965,Barcelona Princess, We had asked for a double bed but were given twin beds the first night Air con did not work well in the room the first night so asked to swap room the following night Bathroom is not a completely separate room , Located next to a mall with restaurants Nice view from room Comfortable bed Good furniture 
275966,Barcelona Princess, There can be door locks for the restroom , The concept of the room was great Kudos to that the bar service sauna guy swimming pool and many others I also like the type of shower in the bathroom 
275967,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, The hotel is located at the end of the Diagonal it s walking distance to the seaside Big shopping mall just across Great breakfast with fantastic choice 
275968,Barcelona Princess, We found it far from City Centre The ventilation in the Bathrooms was bad Open Toilets Very Expensive Break fast at 20 Euros per head No drinking water no room service no porter swimming pool very small more like a large tank , The rooms were good on the 24th level superb view The staff who checked us in Was wonderfull the staff was generally friendly 
275969,Barcelona Princess, Staff at the hotel are not very friendly they are slow in their work generally one of the them are even rude But not only at the hotel my impression of Barcelona is that the people are generally not so friendly to tourist , location of the hotel is far from city center only stay there because its near the CCIB when I have to go there everyday The big shopping mall next to the hotel is a good place to go shopping There is a metro across the stress and also bus stop where you can go to the city center in around 30 minutes Buffet breakfast is very nice with various choices 
275970,Barcelona Princess, Too old furnishing finishing for 1 stars hotel not for 4 stars very bad shower very bad wc AC with problems no safety box Reporter quality price very very expensive , The location
275971,Barcelona Princess, Staff was horrible front desk wasn t helpful and very rude only night services was great daytime stuffshould left this hotel with 2 no more, Location room
275972,Barcelona Princess, Pool area too busy would have been better if it had been bigger for the size of the hotel Gym not up to much and the resistance machine was broken, Massage was very good
275973,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, Room had an amazing view over Barcelona we could see the Sangrada Familia from our room Free minibar was great room was spotless Fresh towels and toiletries topped up frequently Few minutes walk to metro which took you to most places within 20 mins beach close too Tram also few minutes walk away but no noise from it in hotel Rooftop pool was heated and so relaxing Gave us champagne and cake with a 5 candle in for our 5 year anniversary such a lovely touch Amazing hotel 
275974,Barcelona Princess, I booked a room with sea view but the view was more to the hotel and a little to the sea The room is small and the furniture need to be changed , Very clouse to the beach public transportation and metro station Good breakfast Clean room 
275975,Barcelona Princess, The queues for the lifts they lifts didn t appear to all be working at the same time There was no coffee in the room, Very helpful receptionists although they didn t advise us of the most straightforward way to the Grand Prix but they did give us options and directions Large choice for breakfast
275976,Barcelona Princess, When we got there we had no towels at all When they cleaned the room the second day they only gave us one towel Small gripe in otherwise great stay , Room was stylish and comfy Staff were friendly and helpful 24hr room service and lots of great facilities to use 
275977,Barcelona Princess, Hotel looked much better online pool was tiny with around 6 sun beds that were always occupied Second pool had flies swarming around Restaurant was closed at 7pm when we tried to go , Room was clean and tidy
275978,Barcelona Princess, No in room coffee maker At the price we paid the facilities were not great Towels were an issue as the hotel had shortage I had to ask for towels multiple times as they were not replaced The shower was poorly designed as the water was leaking onto the floor The hotel is very over priced There was no morning coffee or water available on the lobby For this price there should be more facilities The printers did not work properly either The breakfast was pricey especially since there were no make to order omelettes or pan cakes etc , Location was good The staff were helpful Breakfast had good variety 
275979,Barcelona Princess, The hotel is a bit far away if you like to explore cities on foot and feel the city pulse close However all public transportation and taxis are available right outside of the hotel The surroundings are modern with conference halls big mall Diagonal Mar museum and maybe not that picturesque , We stayed in a room with a terrace high up in the hotel with an amazing view both of the skyline of Barcelona and the ocean How about watching Barcelona skyline by night from the bathtub The breakfast is excellent You can choose from everything you would like and it is also possible to make the breakfast really healthy with vegetables fresh fruit ham turkey greek yoghurt etc though it has all the pastries pancakes waffles egg bacon also The people at the reception are really nice and helpful High quality massage available at the spa I suffered from lumbago during my visit and the woman who does massage tweaked it a bit and managed to help me with that Short walk 10min to where the 5km beach of Barcelona ends or begins Nice beach bars side by side where you can have a drink a meal or just have a day on the beach on walking distance from the hotel 
275980,Barcelona Princess, Large groups at one point a group of probably 100 Asians trying to get to their rooms blocking functioning of elevators Lots of noise during all three nights They must have saved money on sound proofing , The shower was ok the airco as well
275981,Barcelona Princess, The breakfast was very pricey so we decided to eat at a small restaurant across the street The hotel offered a discount but only if you bought it for your entire stay Since we were leaving early on the last day we could not sign up and they would not offer the discount , Hotel was located away from the tourist areas and was quite nice It was only a couple of blocks from the metro and the Avenue Diagonal trolley and the City Tour busses stopped near the hotel The sea was only a few blocks away and could be seen from the rooftop pool which was relaxing after a day of touring There was also a large mall next door with a lot of shops and restaurants but the shops were closed due to the Easter holiday 
275982,Barcelona Princess, Well outside the city expensive taxis needed to get anywhere We got there at 11 and was told room would be ready early We stayed in and waited but it wasn t done until 4pm Day wasted, Staff were friendly and the place is very clean Views were nice on our side but opposite side of hotel were poor 
275983,Barcelona Princess, Location not great Staff busy and rushed so no service Noise in rooms still on 19th floor Every noise heard from room next door, Was nice enough hotel
275984,Barcelona Princess, The staff were a little rude and abrupt one night came marching over to ask for our room key to prove we were staying there and the girls on the reception desk were more interested in talking to each other than serving no Please or Thank You nothing Also the pool looked very murky so we went to the beach , Huge bed shower was great and the view was okay too 
275985,Barcelona Princess, Cash machine broke not a massive problem as theres one just round the corner Also no iron to run over a few of our items, Could not fault the staff very friendly and welcoming Myself and my partner arrived a few hours early and we was allowed access to our room well before the 3pm check in Mentioned to the staff we was celebrating and a hour later Champagne and strawberrys dipped in chocolate arrived at our door Thank you The bed was amazing we slept in every morning and even through our check out sorry the bathroom was spotless and well equipped also the black out blinds are a good touch Cocktails at the bar on the ground floor were amazing and a great price The room service was great rang up for food at 4am and the gent who brought it was lovely really enjoyed our pizza the following day too Sauna and pools were fab pool could have been a little warmer but still very much enjoyed it GREAT location situated above a shopping centre and food court massive range of food and 5 minute walk from the beach 
275986,Barcelona Princess, The swimming pool is just ridiculous and soooo small In the picture it looks great but in real sorry that feels more like a joke , The location was good for me as there was a beach in about 10 15 minutes walk The breakfast was really good with various food and drink options
275987,Barcelona Princess, Showers are leaking to the toilets the breakfast is a little expensive for what they offer in the resturant The waiting time for the elevator is very long, The hotel design and facilities are very nice and comfortable Very clean and staff are great Showers are well equipped and the view from high floors are amazing 
275988,Barcelona Princess, In the room I stayed in the lights were very poor couldn t to my make up because it was very dark the lighting, Staff very friendly and helpful very clean has a amazing view close to everyone you would like to go in Barcelona
275989,Barcelona Princess, they have no irons only an ironing service which takes a while Arrived off the flight and had no way of getting a shirt ironed before going out for dinner Called to try and arrange laundry for the next day and they kept putting the phone down , room was fine and served its purpose
275990,Barcelona Princess, Both me and my friend slipped by top pool as you go from decking to pool My friend is now off work for ten days and i am limping , Hotel was fantastic lovely pools 
275991,Barcelona Princess, room was dark at night even with all the lights on the next door guests kept us up all night with loud music and yellings not really hotel s fault though the food wasn t upto the mark , location was really great staffs were polite and helpful 
275992,Barcelona Princess, Staff on reception quite unfriendly Room was OK but quite small for the price paid Bar in reception was small Pool on roof was dirty and rubbish around the floor The whole hotel felt tired and definitely didn t feel like a 4 star , Views from the room especially from the bath were great Mini fridge with complimentary drinks were good Aircon great 
275993,Barcelona Princess, The area is lively noise from outside and other rooms can be heard Water leaked out of the shower Elevators can be busy and can happen to wait long for them , Staff was very nice and helpful location is good 5 mins walk to metro line and tram 10 15 mins ride to the city Panoramic view The breakfast selection is wide very good for good price 
275994,Barcelona Princess, Hotel is old so it feels a bit odd Also some services were missing when expected in a 4 star hotel e g no option to get an iron , Great views and nice swimming pools
275995,Barcelona Princess, Bed is not clean I have to ask for a change There is no hot water kettle , Quiet place near the metro station and a big shopping mall My daughter like the two swimming pools It is easy to find good restaurant as the shopping mall is next to the hotel And also we can find simple food and bakery just opposite to the hotel There is a kids play ground in the shopping mall 
275996,Barcelona Princess, I arrived at 2 30pm instead of 3pm when the check in was expected and I kindly said hello I have to check in The answer from the guy at the desk was I don t think so Not really polite but the hotel was really beautiful except that thing ,No Positive
275997,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, Very good hotel The location is good too because it is very close to the beach and several public transportations bus subway city tour bus etc 
275998,Barcelona Princess, The light in the bathroom was bad for applying make up or shaving Two cushions per person on the bed one was too small the other too big The hotel has 25 floors but only 3 elevators Lots of waiting time and endless stops on all floors before you are up or down The business area is way too hot so we worked in the room instead The gym is very small and the only weight lifting machine was broken After a sweaty excercies we had to pass an outside passage it was very windy and cold before you could go back to your room Not handy to avoid a cold , Awful coffee for breakfast not enough choice no biological healthy choices No value for money For a simple Spanish breakfast you can better cross the street to one of the small cafes there are a couple around and get breakfast and great coffee for less than 5 euros Nice addtions in room like bathrobe slippers free minibar nice sheets Nice business area We asked for and got a quiet room with a beautiful few on the city 
275999,Barcelona Princess, The pool was always busy I ve never managed to swim it s small but it wasn t even the point most of those who reserved chairs never swam and took the places so there was nowhere to leave my bathrobe and towel And three elevators aren t enough for so many people But I would still love to come back , Interior window view breakfast hotel personnel were perfect 
276000,Barcelona Princess, The pools could have been a bit bigger and more variety for breakfast , The beds were very luxurious and comfy the shower was excellent and the sea view was amazing The guest service was very good a bottle of bubbly and birthday cake was left in our room for my daughters birthday a very nice touch
276001,Barcelona Princess, Nothing, Excellent customer service Room service very prompt with food hot Hotel staff all very accommodating and happy to assist your queries Room excellent cleaned daily with fresh towels bed linen and toiletries Minibar stocked and could request a top up without charge excellent location opposite the beach and metro right aoutsude which has access to the whole city to explore We will be returning again 
276002,Barcelona Princess, There was no king size bed but 2 attached mattresses There was a huge crack in the glass wall between toilet and shower Even after reporting this no action was taken Except for some staff at the reception the staff was very cold and not service oriented There are only 3 elevators and a broken service elevator which made waiting for the elevator an annoying daily event I do not know how star are assigned in Spain but this is not a 4 star hotel , Not much
276003,Barcelona Princess, The first night that we came to the hotel the bed were uncomfortable and we became itchy due to the fact that we think there were either bugs or those sheets were not changed probably The second day we were moved to another room in which the heater was not working it took three hours for the staff members to let us know that they could not fix it It would need to be fixed the next day The point was that we had called around 8 o clock and it was 11 o clock at night when we got in formed We had called three times insistently and yet no one had told us anything by this time we were tired and we re not willing to wait any longer Due to the discomfort of this hotel we had to check out the night before Making our trip a very unpleasant one in Barcelona ,No Positive
276004,Barcelona Princess, Beds hard bathroom shower broken in three places and breakfast overpriced and not edible, Room nice and spacious Staff helpful and friendly Hotel clean and safe
276005,Barcelona Princess, The hotel is L shaped linked by a glass corridor from the lift Being on the 10th floor this was not ideal for my fear of heights so I was given another room nearer the lift so I didn t have to walk the glass corridor Unfortunately the water seal at the bottom of the shower door was broken which resulted in a serious flood to my room on my first morning It took me about 30m to mop it up I reported it to a housekeeper who said it would be attended to but after three nights it wasn t fixed I resorted to repairing the door myself by inverting the water seal and attaching the broken piece of it to the top of the shower door As an added precaution I placed a towel at the bottom I m sure the previous occupant of the room would have had the same problem I m not sure 19 euros for breakfast is excellent value but to counteract this the mini bar was free and topped up daily , Generally a very nice hotel in an ideal position albeit 20km from the airport 35 40 euros by taxi 
276006,Barcelona Princess, Rooms are a little weary some renovations are needed Air conditioner had problems , High tower beautiful views hard to beat the views from the top floors fast elevators 
276007,Barcelona Princess, Room was dated and needed painting Couldn t control the heating cooling system It was cold when we checked in and once they fixed that problem the room overheated and you couldn t turn the heat off , The view was great Staff was very nice Location was close to the subway and the hop on hop off bus 
276008,Barcelona Princess, The gym facilities weren t great and the outdoor heated pools are freezing , The staff and place itself is lovely very clean Big enough rooms and bathroom Shower is lovely Big balcony close to a big shopping mall
276009,Barcelona Princess, the room was because of technic problem very loud and there was no other room available for change No bath only shower , We lived at 26th floor with very good views The design charmed me
276010,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, Very nice hotel clean with two great swimming pools Rooms are large very urbanistic style and comfortable Maybe the bathroom toilets isolation could be better otherwise a great place to stay 
276011,Barcelona Princess, Tea coffee making facilities in the room Use of Iron in hotel or having one in the room Having creazed clothes when away very annoying for most Especially if you are an a business trip , The location of the hotel was excellent metro stating 2 min walk away to get into the centre of Barcelona 
276012,Barcelona Princess, It can get a bit hectic when the Hotel is hosting some big conference group , Rooms are fantastic especially on the top floors Good wifi Breakfast has a great selection and always very fresh Taxis always in front of the door and great shopping mall next door 
276013,Barcelona Princess, Quite far away from the centre transportation needed Air circulation in the hotel room wasn t fantastic not even with the ventilation system on full force Would be nice to be able to open a window or have a stronger ventilation system , Excellent breakfast So much to choose from and great quality food Best breakfast on this trip Wonderful views from the hotel rooms cool to have access to a rooftop pool Very friendly and helpful staff Comfortable beds and clean facilities Right next to the metro station which helps as it s far to walk to the centre of Barcelona 
276014,Barcelona Princess, Not exactly a 4 hotel We felt the lack of amenities eg no electric kettle low AC performance etc From that perspective I feel that the hotel is not value for money 160 euros night The bathroom roof was leaking Moreover the water from the shower area would leak into the WC area Bathroom fittings dis lodged No bathroom freshner was provided Having said that we had booked a sea view room the room gets really hot as it is east facing rising sun The best time to be in the room is from 4 5pm onwards The window of the seaview rooms need cleaning , Good location shopping center beach close by Taxi stand and Barcelona Turistic GREEN line just next to the hotel 30 mins from El prat airport Will cost about 35 euros by taxi The breakfast is lavish You will enjoy it We had booked a sea view room The view from the room was really nice The staff were helpful and guided us regarding the tourist spots and related info The mini bar is free You will get 1 coke 1 fanta 1 beer 1 sparkling water 1 still water everyday Enjoyed the 23rd floor swimming pool too 
276015,Barcelona Princess, Location was a bit out from resturants Had to drive to town for dinner everything 40min away However beach was a 15 min walking distance , Lovely hotel warm welcoming staff amazing view great hospitality very comfortable bed and a great shower bed an shower are the key for me so I was very pleased We didn t have breakfast there nor any lunch dinner so unable to comment on that Will definitely stay there again 
276016,Barcelona Princess, Both pool areas were always busy due the small layout of both pools Had to get up early to reserve a bed At full capacity in the summer this would be a nightmare No kettle or iron in the room which was not good for me , Location was great Rooms with city view were comfortable modern and clean Restaurant on 3rd floor was good with happy staff Free soft drinks in room was a nice touch Hotel attached to Diagonal Mall which had Zara Mango HnM and Primark etc Lots of restaurants in mall and also a really good hairdressers Lots of restaurants opposite hotel also 
276017,Barcelona Princess, If I am being critical there were two very minor issues The beds are very comfortable We asked for a double bed which was two single beds joined together Only issue being the gap between the two mattresses Would ve been nicer having a double bed mattress The room often steamed up very quickly if the shower was on hot for a long period of time and the bathroom door was open , Extremely modern rooms and a great layout We were lucky enough to stay on the 23rd floor which is the floor that the rooftop pool and bar is on 
276018,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, It was perfect a little out of city but nothing drastic roughly 8 in a taxi and to be honest it was preferred as we felt like we were more on holiday The staff we exceptional and very helpful at all times Not over priced either The views of the sea were fantastic Couldn t fault it in anyway 
276019,Barcelona Princess, Requested an early check in room wasn t actually ready at 3pm their stated time , The scenic bathroom view over the city was spectacular close vicinity to the beach
276020,Barcelona Princess, The only remark Internet is not really working And the location is quite far away from anything you have tram and subway close but it takes some time to get into the city center paid around 11 EUR with taxi , Room was nice good view over the city from the 12th floor also good window blinds to cover the large window I liked the tiled floor good for people with allergies Bathroom nice though I question why you need this open layout with glass between bed and the sink Shower and toilet is with a separate door Liked the little bathroom accessories bag this was nice Further facilities I did not use like breakfast 
276021,Barcelona Princess, There was not a b fast option reasonably priced or coffee in a convenient place No coffee in room This is a high rise hotel , Loved the view size of room balcony and water pressure 
276022,Barcelona Princess, Parking is on demand but no card to acess it You need to let the keys and park in front of h tel temporary, The view from room The swimming pool The kindness at the reception Breakfast
276023,Barcelona Princess, Breakfast was awful Hairdryer heavy and hard to use Hotel had no iron available to use Lifts ridiculously slow Bar closes even if people still drinking , Most bar staff friendly Make great sangria Very clean 
276024,Barcelona Princess, If you are looking for a city centre break this hotel might be further out than you would like however there is a metro stop two minutes away as well as buses and trams , The staff were friendly and offered assistance without complaint The hotel itself had great access to public transport was situated next to a shopping centre which had a number of restaurants The bar offered a great selection of cocktails although they were just a little bit on the expensive side outwith the hours that had special deals For those looking for touristy things to do the City Bus Tour stops right outside the hotel which will allow you to see the whole of Barcelona without having to live somewhere too busy 
276025,Barcelona Princess, The metro station is close but there are many pickpockets in the metro system My wallet was stolen in this trip because of this The center is far by foot and to be safe I suggest going by taxi , Amazing view great price and welcoming staff There s no downside to the hotel itself 
276026,Barcelona Princess, The breakfast was little disapointing Croissant one side of the room bread on the other side and so on Not really well organised Missing some fresh eggs ,No Positive
276027,Barcelona Princess, Rooms need soundproofing Could even hear the shades being raised lowered from the room next door the outside noise seemed like the windows were open the street sounds were very clear even above the 10th floor Rooms are modern updated but seemed to be lacking in quality The location is close to the water a couple of blocks away but a large fence prevents one from actually going onto the shore The tour busses don t run past this hotel in the off season , Staff was great From the front desk to the door men to the dining room staff all friendly helpful professional Wifi was reliable Rooms were modern
276028,Barcelona Princess, Only thing that let it down was the tapas we tried in the corner bar downstairs We d had high hopes as the cocktails were really good but the food wasn t as enjoyable , Room had a great view and was perfect temperature for a good nights sleep Facilities were also excellent Breakfast included was very good with a wide variety to choose from Most of the staff were super friendly and helpful when asking for directions The sangria was the best we had the whole trip and we tried a lot Would definitely stay again and recommend to friends 
276029,Barcelona Princess, hotel could fix some things in a bathroom in a cupboard water stays in a sink , design comfortable bed close to metro line nice view from windows
276030,Barcelona Princess, They were one lady at the reception had an attitude l have noticed that l forgot to bring my charger for my phone and l believe this is a very commen thing but this lady who works at the reception been actually rude to me and she asked me to go and buy one from shopping centre at 9pm in the evening and l had my son with me wearing his pyjamas already in the bed He is only 7 years old I have explained this to her but she still told me what do you want me to do madam you need to go to shopping centre and get one I found this very rude I needed my phone for next day to show my boarding pass at the airport Wasn t helpfull at all , It was generally not bad
276031,Barcelona Princess, Shower flooded the floor and the shower control of heat is very bad nearly scalded myself when I put it into full shower mode Either too hot or too cold , Great room loved the pool on roof Great bar at reasonable prices
276032,Barcelona Princess, Information on outings could have been offered on arrival without us having to ask especially as we were only there a short time , The location was fantastic close to transport and shops and restaurants 
276033,Barcelona Princess, I did not find the crew friendly just acceptable However the prices are quite high One night we paid close to 300 euros and they kept me ranging up in the room until I went down to the reception to pay Not really acceptable on this level Be prepared that you have to wait for the elevators 5 7 minutes whenever you use them The walls are really thin you can hear everything what is at the neighbours and on the corridors Big disappointment is the WIFI So after you pay 300 euros a night you have to register yourself or give your Facebook account in order to use it No one wants to be spammed with their unwanted marketing offer after you pay this amount per night , The small restaurant they have is nice The express menu is good but more importantly they bring is fast View is pretty nice to the sea side and there is a small pool on the roof top 
276034,Barcelona Princess, Could not find any faults, The hotel was exceptional and if was in a more central position would get 10 out of 10 even though this does not cause a major problem as the hotel is next to a mtero station also the view from the high floor was the whole of the city
276035,Barcelona Princess, AC was not working properly room was very hot Toilet door cannot be fully closed 1cm gap is always there The furniture was chipped on many spots ,No Positive
276036,Barcelona Princess, The room needed airing because there was a bad smell form the bathroom After the bathroom was cleaned there was no smell , The hotel located in a quiet part of the city The tram runs straight out the font which will take you into the city centre A large shopping mall next door with all the major shops Walking distance to the beach and a large open play area for kids 
276037,Barcelona Princess, They were doing some building work in the reception which resulted in a weird smell in the lobby The price for what was essentially a pretty small room was quite high maybe because the WMC was in town , The reception staff was efficient and very friendly The rest was quite average really 
276038,Barcelona Princess, Few small issues on the telephone the 7 button is stuck making it difficult to call the long and complicated room service number small details matter and shoulnd t there be a single button to dial room service Also it seems asking for a spare toothbrush does not constitute as room service in a 4 star hotel which is odd They asked me to come downstairs to pick one up then when I got downstairs they couldn t find one and said they would send one up The staff that I spoke to were not extremely friendly and when you re on the phone to room service they are not extremely helpful either In fact it seems they re quite busy to the point where they re almost insisting you get off the phone That s how I felt One more thing when you re in bed you d like to turn off all the lights with the light switch but it seems most of the lights you have to manually turn them off at the power switches which is a bit annoying once you re cosy and in bed , Liked the electronic roller blinds between the bedroom bathroom and the outside windows very good feature Room design and overall feeling in the hotel is very pleasant Very nice views Pros well outweigh the cons 
276039,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, Everything was perfect form the moment we arrived until the moment we left Valet parking is fabulous the staff at the front desk all with a smile and very helpful Nothing to fault Excellent Excellent 
276040,Barcelona Princess, Should have looked more closely at the location before booking 5km from the centre, Electric shades and blinds were a nice touch Sea view was great And the shower was amazing
276041,Barcelona Princess, Only downfall was the bed Moved a lot and was rolling Can t complain as I do move a lot in bed Also breakfast at 17 per night pp was a bit expensive but we got a deal at 13 which was reasonable considering the variety , Breakfast had wide variety There was a lot to do in the hotel Staff were always helpful and polite 
276042,Barcelona Princess, The bed was hard but manageable No coffee tea available to be made in the room The gym and pool were not available during my stay, It was close to public transportation and local establishments mall and restaurants The staff was helpful The wifi in the rooms was great The mini bar was free
276043,Barcelona Princess, Swimming pools and sauna close at 23 00, Staff was wellcoming and friendly hotel was clean splendid view sea close to underground and tram station close to shopping centre 
276044,Barcelona Princess, 1 Temperature in the room was cold AC system not worked properly 2 Door in the room was not locked properly there was the problem with door locker Even after complaining for it on the reception doesn t help to solve it , 1 Breakfast was very good 2 Close to metro station 
276045,Barcelona Princess, Nothing Aaa, Bed very comfortable nice room good room service perfect view nice bar really nice pool The metro is near and the mall exactly beside the hotel The staff was really great helpful and professional I will for sure return 
276046,Barcelona Princess, Nothing , The hotel location is excellent I requested a bedroom on the highest floor possible which I got and the views were amazing The room itself was stunning and to top it of I had a free bar each time the room was cleaned the bar would be refilled Top class 
276047,Barcelona Princess, Staff at the reception desk maintenance of the rooms and no privacy in the bathroom towels were not changed during the week end difficult to use the safebox cleaning trolleys left in the corridors all the time few elevators for too many rooms and staff were using elevators in the peak time clients had to wait for long time, Sea view at sunrise
276048,Barcelona Princess, Check in took half an hour It s better if they have tea coffee making facilities and ironing facilities in the room , Location is very good right next to a shopping mall Nice clean hotel 
276049,Barcelona Princess, We had to wait until our check out day to ask if we could have a late one reasons because we had a flight late in the evening Also the King or Queen size bed in the Sea View room was just two single beds put together Which was uncomfortable when sleeping as there was a gap in the middle, The view from our room was ok 
276050,Barcelona Princess, it was really hot in the room in the Evening we weren t able to adjust the temp in the room and had to have maintenance open the window every night we were there , Staff amazing i mentioned to staff it was my dads birthday they wished him happy birthday and when we went out the first evening we arrived we were given champs and homemade chocs all for free we were give a perfect room great location
276051,Barcelona Princess, calling the room service was abit abit of a problem but food was good , hotel was amazing perfect size lovely view from bathroom overlooked the whole city Staff were friendly 
276052,Barcelona Princess, The breakfast was varied and standard continental with lots f choice hug wasn t very hot , The staff were amazingly helpful Giving us metro directions restaurant recommendations and travel plugs we d forgotten Hotel is lovely Amazing views in the lift We were floor 25 and the view was spectacular Comfy king size bed and amazing room with blackout blind which ensured a great nights sleep every night Location is great 2 mins walk from the metro station which gives you easy access to la rambla and port Olympic Right next door to diagonal avenue shopping centre where there s a food court and lots of shops Highly recommended 
276053,Barcelona Princess, Breakfast was way too expensive 21 for a full English madness, Staff were friendly hotel was clean right next door to a very good shopping centre metro close by and the mini bar was free
276054,Barcelona Princess, My room was 28C and no air conditioning due to it being winter After asking twice they finally opened my window but even then it only sank to 25C Unpleasant to sleep in ,No Positive
276055,Barcelona Princess, On the first day we found a terrible leak between the bathroom and restroom at 1 o clock in the morning Staff first said no more room and after the technician came without a solution miracle happened now there was an availalbe room Sound isolation is not that good you can hear the neighbour s talk , Great hotel with beautiful view and facilities Next to a shopping mall and metro station 
276056,Barcelona Princess, I made a 5 days reservation on booking but my plans changed and I stayed 4 nights I wanted refuned my money they didnt agree This is unacceptable for the first time in my life I encounter such a thing I dont recommend Dont stay this hotel, nothing 
276057,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, We had room with sea view it was really amazing Really top Swimming pool on the rooftop For us it was the best time spent in Barcelona We hope that soon will be back at Barcelona Princess Can t wait 
276058,Barcelona Princess, No tea or coffee facilities in room Refused to supply ironing board and iron Offered instead ironing facilities with an 8 hour wait plus an exorbitant cost of 9 Euros for each of 6 shirts Staff refused on 2 occasions to call me a taxi Had to wait for 15 minutes at taxi rank in temperature of 3 Restaurant meals only available with prior booking , Not very much 
276059,Barcelona Princess, It was really cold in the room , Good WiFi Private parking 23 euro d Nice view Good location near the big shopping mall subway and an interesting museum 
276060,Barcelona Princess, One of the staff at the bar refused to give me a bucket of ice for my drinks and said I had to ring room service for that of which I felt I was being forced to pay for a service I didn t want there was no iron in the hotel and I was told I had to pay for my clothes to be ironed of which I would have been happy to do so myself For a 4star hotel I think they ought to have irons and kettles in their rooms Wasn t aloud to take my breakfast to my room which once again was ridiculous, The staff at the reception where brilliant very friendly and the hotel was very clean 
276061,Barcelona Princess, Toilet door broken weird layout of bathroom merged together with the hall Very long wating time for the elevators 5 min each time , Good breakfast nice view from room and elevators lounge area in 23 floor pool is nice but it s too cold in December January
276062,Barcelona Princess, Cannot stop the car infront of hotel entrance this is busline check in first then they will give u access card to the parking, Rooftop pool excellent room with sea view was great clean room and more important is fast wifi shopping mall next door close to beach very welcoming staff 
276063,Barcelona Princess, The bed was combined of 2single beds The window glass of the bath could have been made of ground glass to a half height so that one can enjoy the open window, The window scene was very good The compliments in mini bar were quite fair
276064,Barcelona Princess, Shower in not hermetic and water goes on the floor It is not possible to open windows in the room Receptionist girl was not kind during check in No any smile at all behaved like we are better not to come since we forced her to do some work Soundproof is extremely poor for the hotel that was built quite recently You will hear everything even small noise of your neighbors Expensive breakfast 19eur, Very nice panoramic sea view Warm room with well working air conditioning Nice pool on the roof Convenient Location close to metro huge mall market and sea promenade Free soft drinks are provided in your room s refrigerator each morning during cleaning
276065,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, Friendly and professional staff nice hotel with great amenities an indoor pool would be a nice addition for the winter months or slightly warmer outdoor pools Close to public transport links easy to find your way around Breakfast was nice with a nice enough selection for everyone Room service delivered promptly with a smile Nice extras provided by the hotel that you won t get in many other places bath robe slippers toothbrush plug converter It s a 5 from us 
276066,Barcelona Princess, My only gripe was that my room seriously needed soundproofing I could hear every little cough sneeze and quarrel next door , Lovely spacious room with a free minibar of drinks that was restocked daily Very impressed by the shower that had many knobs to play around with Had the sea view and what bliss it was to wake up to the sunrise every morning Staff were very cheerful accommodating and extremely helpful Location is away from the hustle and bustle of Barcelona but it s near a metro station just 2 mins away so it s easy to reach the tourist attractions in Barcelona and near a beach and a park Perfect if you want someplace quiet but also accessible Additionally there s a huge mall next door Perfect for some shopping and when I m feeling peckish for food My favourite stay in my Europe trip 
276067,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, The front desk was very helpful to arrange my whole vacation and trips the restaurant was amazing this hotel made my visit to Barcelona much more than perfect for me and z family they arranged my days with less money and most pleasure as possible thanks hotel princess team 
276068,Barcelona Princess, The shower leaked into the bathroom floor The toilet was broken so the tank never filled up causing constant noise The aroma at the front desk can get overwhelming , The view was realy beautiful The beds were comfortable It s really easy to reach by metro and tram Check in and check out was a breeze 
276069,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, 1 Loved the entire hotel we stayed for 3 nights and it was a wonderful experience The mini bar was free 2 The sauna and the swimming pool are very good and can be used 3 Excellent options for Breakfast 4 Easy access to public transport which is a big plus point 5 Nearby to shopping mall which is good 
276070,Barcelona Princess, I could hear the shower next door as if it was in my room and unfortunately the toilet stall had a bit of a sewer smell I left in a bit of a hurry and forgot to mention this at the front desk , the 25th floor has a great view Breakfast buffet is good and the staff is friendly 
276071,Barcelona Princess, Water dripping from the ceiling when someone in the room above showered some clean plates at the buffet were dirty, Quiet room awesome view on the city very firendly staff convention center at the other side of the street
276072,Barcelona Princess, Most Asian females must look the same to the staff otherwise why did they give my luggage storage tickets to a random guest without even re confirming the identity That guest and I were the only two Asian females in the lobby ,No Positive
276073,Barcelona Princess, After a stay of 4 nights in last day the cleaning staff came and made partially work they didn t supply the drinks in the room minibar , When I made the Check In the Staff from reception behaved extremely beautiful on a scale from 1 to 5 I ll give them 5 The design of Hotel and Swimming Pool are excellent big like for pool from 23th floor again 5 
276074,Barcelona Princess, You need to take the metro into the centre of town as it is too far to walk So it depends on the purpose of your travel if you can live with that , Nice spacious room Fantastic view over the sea and the town Wonderful heated pools 
276075,Barcelona Princess, We were at the hotel only from midnight to 10 am as we had to catch a flight When we arrived there was no water in the shower and bathroom So we couldn t take a shower It turned out that there was a plumbing problem at the hotel We also ordered a ceaser salad from the room service The turkey on the salad was not eatable we believe it was rotten but the manager said it was the normal taste of the turkey When we talked to the management they were polite They even asked the chef to explain the taste of the turkey They also did not charge us for the food and offered free tea and cake However the problem with plumbing and the food created a very uncomfortable 10 hours stay for my wife and I ,No Positive
276076,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, location close to the sea shopping centre and local cafeterias amazing views from high floors outdoor heated pool on 23rd floor ask for a room as high as possible 
276077,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, We really loved the pool from the 23 floor We didn t booked a room with sea view but we received one which was awesome The shower is also really great The mini bar was free and the metro station is really close Everything was awesome We will definitely come back 
276078,Barcelona Princess, we were unaware that we had to pay a lot more in euros that the pound rate did not see it on the ref but they didn t do anything to reduce the price the make up room policy was unclear we have never heard that you need to ask them to make up the room by leaving a card on the door came back in the evening and bed not made even though we had left a card on the doo it had been turned around to do not disturb only 1 English channel on the tv toilet was far too small that you had to leave the door open or bang your head on it when you use it and didn t like the electric screens and blinds they were annoying also no windows for a bit of fresh air could have had a small one all in all we had a lovely break but it could ve been better, the muffins and croissants were lovely the waiter especially went down to the kitchen to get some as they had sold out in the corner caf and Catrina was excellent in her job very helpful bed was amazing amazing views from 19th floor
276079,Barcelona Princess, Floor without rug was cold but they give slippers, Room design Never waited for service Choice of bar or restaurant Pool Handy to congress center and shopping mall 
276080,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, We loved this hotel and would come back again We liked the location because it was out of the middle of town but had a metro stop taxi stand and hop on hop off bus site right by the hotel Huge shopping mall with lots of restaurants Our room was very modern and comfortable with a beautiful view of the ocean
276081,Barcelona Princess, Maintenance staff We have a water leak in the water closet floor We call the reception and off we went When we return to the room a few hours late the water is running without stoping We call the reception again and a maintenance staff member come to the room A few minutes later he exit the room stating the problem is solved We realize that he just close a water valve It s suppose that we didn t use the WC until next day We call reception that was unaware of this issue They gave us a new room , Views reception staff breakfast
276082,Barcelona Princess, It s alot if people here and traffic is packed I there are so ways but the sell like subways The foods not only the food is just sea food because of the sea , The staff was amazing they showed me all the great places to see and they really made me feel at home I m Barcelona I definitely will be able to get a copy of all the great things Barcelona is an awesome place to travel there is plenty of culture and things to see you should definitely bring the family I mean the wife the kids the granny the grandpa the cousins all the people that you know should be coming to Barcelona all at the same time I just this should be enough to write so I m done now 
276083,Barcelona Princess, Almost nothing that I asked when I made the reservation was fulfilled eg room number late checkout room beside friends , Variety and quantity of breakfast perfect room with sea view beside metro station And free mini bar 
276084,Barcelona Princess, The room was clean but it was at a weird angle Not my favorite room but good for the price , We loved the location of this hotel it was right next to a huge mall and right in front of the bus line 
276085,Barcelona Princess, shower was poor soaked the floor Room 419 causing slip hazard I fell room cleaning was below par they even forgot on one day The hotel has 26 floors and only 3 lifts so always had to wait on one day 8 mins not good if you are in a wheelchair as my wife The pool on the roof was NOT wheelchair accessible and the splash pool on the 3rd floor had no disability aids Not a very wheelchair friendly hotel which is a shame as it could be great , reception staff are excellent and helpful the breakfast was good with plenty of choice the free mini bar was a welcome surprise and the FREE Wi Fi was great
276086,Barcelona Princess, Paying for car park this much location staff price do not match the value, This hotel has a really bad location way too far away from the centre and the seafront too Staff are not to friendly at the reception looks like they do not communicate to each other Room was nothing like in a 4 hotel and was very smelly at all the times Not worth the money Can not recommend to anyone 
276087,Barcelona Princess, There was not even one single English Channel working For you to have a fried egg instead of a scramble egg you have to pay 5 euro for that Ridiculous , The location the room and the easy access of transportation 
276088,Barcelona Princess, the hotel makes the impression that the best times for it are over the windows in the lifts were very dirty the gym is very small and the work out machines are worn out the door between sleeping room and bathroom didn t close shower couldn t be regulated normally and was leaking water, the bed was okay
276089,Barcelona Princess, Staff lacked warmth Service was far below 4 star standard shower door did not close properly etc Scale to weigh luggage was out of order and remained so for 2 days this is a 4 star Took 90 mins to bring a cot up to room for Baby , Location is good Swimming pools are okay Food was decent for room service and it was delivered fast 
276090,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, Was more like 43 euros from the aitport not 17 as it said in the booking Hotel pools were so small and the food is way over priced aswell as the drinks Would not suggest this place 
276091,Barcelona Princess, The receptionist was not friendly at all I needed just 30 minutes extra on checking out and that was the least I could expect from this out of proportion roomrate , perfect location
276092,Barcelona Princess, Heated pool was not heated 20 degrees Celsius is very cold and freezy for me , Wonderful view Great friendly and helpful staff Clean nice room Breakfast was very delicious coffee was very good I have never stayed in such a great hotel where minibar is free nonstop room service is delivered so fast and we get welcome present champagne and strawberry dipped in chocolate 
276093,Barcelona Princess, I thought the breakfast charge was too high but I did see it on the website before hand So nothing really to not like , Everything Especially the fab shower lovely decor of the room and the wonderful roof top pool and views 
276094,Barcelona Princess, Road construction in front of hotel No temporary guest parking for drop offs , Very clean and comfortable room Staff at reception very helpful and with good manners 
276095,Barcelona Princess, Our room was quite small and the shower was terrible the water goes all over the floor we had a disabled bathroom but didn t want to complain because everything else was perfect, The style of the hotel comfort location food and friendly staff
276096,Barcelona Princess, The picture of the room on the website did not match with the reality There is no housing service after 9 pm Also did not clean the room just made the beds,No Positive
276097,Barcelona Princess, The location is far from the center the wi fi is poor and the breakfast could have been better, The hotel photos b4 booking it was nothing like what I saw when I stayed and the room are very small that you Bearley can walk
276098,Barcelona Princess, Hairdryer is pretty inconvenient to use as you have to keep pushing the button to be able to use it Room s atmosphere is a bit cold having tiles instead of wooden floor and no carpet , Breakfast area and breakfast is nice housekeeping and reception staff is kind and polite Complimentary minibar drinks are very nice touch Wifi is working well Great view 
276099,Barcelona Princess, windows cannot be opened some fresh air would feel good in the late evening furniture was a little run down shelves patched with duct tape , location next to the conference center very friendly and professional staff big choice of breakfast good coffee comfy bed
276100,Barcelona Princess, Slow elevators during the peak time you can wait 10 minutes for the lift some times they don t work at all Hotel is fairly good located next to the shopping center but unfortunately far from all the attractions you need at least 30 minutes to get to the city center by either tube 2 changes tram or a bus Because of that I think this hotel was slightly overpriced Small and unequipped gym , Good breakfast Wi Fi was quiet fast rooms comfortable and good beds 
276101,Barcelona Princess, Some of the furniture is a bit old and require renovation , Big and even a bit of luxury hotel at the 12th floor we had a balcony with great view both to the city and surprisingly also to the sea Even the Sagrada Familia is visible we have had another hotel to move to beach rest but it wasn t really necessary There is only 7 minutes walk to the very good beach The location is very good regarding transport too the tram metro and bus station are also just here Very good breakfast with discount for 13euro instead 19 
276102,Barcelona Princess, I booked a superior terrace room for me and my partner for a break away The staff were not very welcoming quite rude We were made to pay upfront for the room usually you pay when you check out Then on the bottom of the receipt it said no refunds why didn t she make that clear and make sure we were happy with the room before payment Nobody helped us with our bags they could see we were struggling The bed was a small double and so uncomfortable Room service and laundry services Were not answering the phone so I had to keep calling reception More of a corporate hotel , Good location
276103,Barcelona Princess, Bathroom had a terrible odour which wecoudn t get rid of We were offered another room but it was very far away from our friends , Bed was fine but we did not have the croissants The breakfast was very good
276104,Barcelona Princess, My handbag was broken upon arrival by the reception staff and upon leaving we were only given a discount on one of our bills Which they said would now be the money to replace the broken item I thought this was quite rude and unfair as a 4 establishment to rule out the cost of my bag and deny us any sympathy or any compensation was just rude I complained the day it happened but didn t want to make a fuss so thought we would deal with it as we left and this was what we received , Bedroom with a balcony was excellent 
276105,Barcelona Princess, Our shower leaked on one occasion our whole bathroom and bedroom was flooded and the water even managed to get to the hotel corridors Hotel staff arrived immediately and cleaned everything up which was good , We thoroughly enjoyed our stay all staff were polite and welcoming breakfast was amazing extensive variety Our room had an amazing view 24th floor we were greeted with champagne and chocolate covered strawberries It was also a 2 minute walk from the beach and a 30 second walk to the shopping centre Tour bus stops right outside the hotel nearest station is across the road Definitely recommend this hotel 
276106,Barcelona Princess, We booked the relax package where we received massages each day of our stay We wished that the massage had more of a relaxing atmosphere as we could hear the restaurant very clearly and there could be more of a calming ambiance perhaps some soundproofing of the room would help The pool water was also very cold so we never went in , Great breakfast buffet very comfy beds the blackout blinds were awesome to be able to sleep in The pools were both very nice as well The staff was friendly and helpful 
276107,Barcelona Princess, The bed is in the hard side a bit The shower design is not comfortable because the in order to avoid the water spray in the shade you have to lifted open it and the view is awesome but you re not just to be naked in an open window also the shower head is a bit higher than average and my wife couldn t reach it , The view from our room cleanliness facilities atmosphere and the bell person who grit us with a warm Welcome showed room facilities and engage with us in a fan conversation he also called the taxi for when leaving the hotel for good overall we had a good experience at Barcelona Princess 
276108,Barcelona Princess, To park the car you have to leave it in front of the hotel and the bellboy will take care of it Parking and breakfast are rather on the expensive side 20 , Very luxurious and spacious room that is equipped with a nice and relaxing shower I had a room with sea view the higher you go the better the view With the tram and the metro close by you can get to the city centre in less than 20 minutes 
276109,Barcelona Princess, A bit far from restaurants so we had to take bus or taxi to centre of Barcelona, Good value helpful staff garage and parking good rooms well equipped
276110,Barcelona Princess, We have only one problem swimming pool We choose this hotel for pool and sun but unfortunately the swimming pool was too cold and nobody can swim We noticed each day but they did not matter about our problem Also there was some trashes in the swimming pool , Viem location comfort cleanliness
276111,Barcelona Princess, The rooftop pool was a disappointment and there was a bad smell coming from the drains into our room which we was informed is common for that part of the city , The staff were very helpful and friendly It was a good location with a metro very close giving good access to the rest of the city There are plenty of nice reasonably priced places to eat nearby 
276112,Barcelona Princess, Pricing for washing laundry was extremely expensive For a couple of shirts and underwear it cost me 150 00 Euros , Room was fabulous very spacious and clean Hotel location was excellent with shopping mall right next door Bars and pools made our stay nearly perfect Buffet breakfast was well worth it too View from our room was excellent and loved the automatic blinds 
276113,Barcelona Princess, The sea view thought it was a beach but it was not accessible , Bed was really comfy food on 3rd floor was really good as were the cocktails at the 23rd floor pool bar where there was a really smashing Morocan style lounge 
276114,Barcelona Princess, Inconsistent front desk service This could be due to us being non Spanish speaking guests , Good location Very nice clean room with good amenities However our last night was soured by a leaking bathroom ceiling 
276115,Barcelona Princess, Small room set up with a see through glass divider to bathroom toilet and if you leave the shower door open the shower head faces the bedroom and can easily flood the room No space to leave toiletries No mirror to make up No drawer or cupboard space for folded clothes Dim light Distant from town Very expensive, Lobby looks nice Staff are nice Taxi stand close by
276116,Barcelona Princess, The staff does not help at all especially Clara It is unbelievable but I paid for one night 120 and I ask for a late check out They told me that to have a late check out I have to pay regarding the price they have at that moment related the room which was 300 instead of the price I have paid for my room So I had to pay half day which means 150 more to get a late check out to left the room about 6pm instead of 12pm Unbelievable I don t recommend to any one to stay in this hotel I will never come back ,No Positive
276117,Barcelona Princess, is was a little far from the city center and it took me a while to reach there by the touristic buses, the hotel was clean modern and the rooms was beatifull this is not my first time in there
276118,Barcelona Princess, The elevators were very slow and stopped at every level This was very frustrating when on the 18th floor , Loved the shutters the shower and the bed was wonderful 
276119,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, Great staff very help full Nice aNd quiet location next to a shopping centre which is great to get anything you may have forgotten at home Views are amazing and it was near a nice quiet part of the beach Access to things like the tour bus are on the doorstep and getting to the cityre centre was easy via a subway that was down the road
276120,Barcelona Princess, Suite was a little tired looking hole in wall generally rather dull Lifts are a nightmare take ages to arrive 2nd stay here nothing s changed would like to see it upgraded a little rooms could do with modernising Pool was freezing on 3rd floor not much room round top floor pool area , Had a balcony in a junior suite 3rd floor allowed use of showers for departing later in the evening Staff at the cafe bar here were lovely Would return as location restaurants shopping centre on doorstep Buses trams taxis on doorstep 
276121,Barcelona Princess, Cannot fault the hotel but the location is not the best it is far from the centre of Barcelona and there is not much in the surrounding area except for a shopping centre but who wants to go there on their holidays, The staff were lovely and rooms were very clean the cleaners came everyday day 
276122,Barcelona Princess, Nothing, Large very comfortable rooms Booked three rooms 2 for 2 adults and 1 for 2 adults and 2 small children Breakfast very good and location good for children as near beach and play parks 
276123,Barcelona Princess, Mini bar good but no diet drinks and only 1 beer we had to share , Good breakfast comfy room with great view Location ok out of town but close to metro station good shopping centre and beach Pool and bar nice on 3rd floor massages really good 
276124,Barcelona Princess, Iron in the room would make a difference since it s a 4 hotel Swimming pool on 23rd floor is not ad clean as it could be at least not when we stayed , Stunning views very attentive and friendly staff Great breakfast 
276125,Barcelona Princess, Elevators often very slow Some staff have no English at all , Well located for Metro underground and tourist bus Extensive breakfast buffet Fabulous view from the roof top pool 
276126,Barcelona Princess, The hot food in the breakfast bar Scrambled eggs lukewarm Bacon is very fat and I was wondering if the fruit juices were made from concentrates No yogurt available at breakfast that I could see I m afraid I am not a lover of machines for dispensing coffee hot water etc It s a personal thing , The variety and quality and tasthe of the fresh fruit each morning The warmth and friendliness of your restaurant staff and especially your Marcham breakfast staff Perhaps you could let us have them on loan for a time in Ireland Your front line reception staff were quality all through 
276127,Barcelona Princess, the elevator doors of the hotel close really quick so sometimes you miss it and have to wait for the next which can take a few minutes , Private balcony was absolutely stunning sea view and city view in 1 go brilliant to sit there have breakfast and just take it all in amazing 
276128,Barcelona Princess, Personell not really that helpfull and and the wait for the lifts can take several minutes , Great breakfest good internet connection nice pool Located right next to a mall 
276129,Barcelona Princess, No restaurant for lunch or dinner but plenty of restaurants close by, Staff were very helpful Rooms were made up each day No complaints at all Whilst it is not located in the city centre the metro is a 3 minute walk Hop on Hop off bus outside the hotel
276130,Barcelona Princess, The lifts seem to take ages to arrive and you couldn t see what floor they were on , Great breakfast Good location and very friendly and helpful staff 
276131,Barcelona Princess, room was a bit tired considering the price roof pool is tiny lower also smaller than expected, free upgrade generous engagement gift attentive staff 10 minute walk to nice beach and 5 minutes to restaurants
276132,Barcelona Princess, The location of the hotel was a bit too far from all touristic places in the center of Barcelona good thing the metro was easy to use Both pools are very small The gym was very small as well and all equipment was old or not working it takes a very long time before the elevator arrives at your level, The room was very nice loved the bed Everything was clean Friendly helpfull staff
276133,Barcelona Princess, They do not include irons in the room however they also do not allow guest to rent any irons Guest have to use their expensive laundry service unless they bring their own travle iron It would have been nice to have read this in the description or on their website The room service food was HORRIBLE See photos below I had to speak to the manager of the kitchen to et it resolved but I never ordered room service food after that When a woman and her crying baby was place across the hall from me I had to request a room change but I also requested to speak to the hotel manager twice Each time he was not available nor did he bother to contact me to make sure my matter was resolved I have never seen such an unprofessional lasy hotel manager in my life A guest shouldn t have to chase the manager to obtain satisfaction in a matter I DON T RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL GO TO THE HOTELS ACROSS THE STREET You pay a little more money but the service and everything else is much better , I like the fact that I will never return Really I was disappointed with everything I can see why the Spanish economy is bad 
276134,Barcelona Princess, Instead of a double bed we had two singles pushed together which means without much movement they would spread apart and was particularly frustrating , The rooms were very nice The staff were very helpful and gave fantastic advice Full room clean everyday with little surprised from the cleaners everyday which I won t spoil 
276135,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, The hotel was beautiful exceptionally clean and the staff were so helpful and happy to help The hotel is in an excellent location for the bus tram and metro with the red bus tour just outside and a few minutes walk to the beach An amazing holiday 
276136,Barcelona Princess, Floor in room could have been swept better, Being in a location directly next to a shopping mall and restaurants was also useful the hotel was a 10 minutes walk to beach and 2 minute walk from open top bus point and taxi rank The free mini bar was a great little extra facilitates were excellent strong wifi and generous breakfast selection
276137,Barcelona Princess, The swimming pool was way too small on the roof and the area up there too small too for size of hotel Advertised on your website as 50m from the beach totally incorrect more like 1000m to the nearest packed small beach Far better off down near the Casino beach Downstairs bar fairly redundant waste of space 23rs floor bar very strange and could be a lot more stylish than a fake Morroccan look We were there for 3 days and only 2 of the 3 main lifts working so long delays made worse, The view was good the beds were very comfy and the housekeeping very good Had a minor problem with the safe that needed re setting I called reception and the maintenance man came immediately and fixed it very impressive
276138,Barcelona Princess, Beach was not as close as I thought swimming pools small with very few sun beds , Wonderful view Clean modern room with great amenities Was right next door to a huge shopping centre which was a pleasant surprise Plentiful breakfast Very close to the Metro station 
276139,Barcelona Princess, My partner is scared of heights so the glass fronted elevators freaked her a little We were put on the fourth floor which worked out fine , The bathroom area was modern and attractive The cocktail waiters were friendly Cocktails were a little expensive The metro across the road was very handy for the centre The recommendation of a restaurant from the desk staff was not good as the restaurant was in a not so good area and when we arrived it was empty 
276140,Barcelona Princess, The lifts took too long to come and there was not enough space on the swimming pools , The cocktails at the gym bar were great and the room was always clean 
276141,Barcelona Princess, Breakfast is quite poor for this qualified hotel Hotel is so far away from the touristic places and airport Furthermore the metro line passing close to the hotel does not make you reach center Therefore you need to deal with many connections , Except from its location and breakfast everything is perfect 
276142,Barcelona Princess, The bathroom shower cubicle water leaked out and across the tiles everytime which was quite dangerous not to mention inconvenient when you have to clean it up The air con wasn t cold enough we would have liked to have changed the temperature ourselves The lifts were a nightmare in general and at 6 months pregnant and staying on the 16th floor sometimes the stairs were actually a better option , Nice to get the free mini bar Nice big bed too 
276143,Barcelona Princess, This hotel definitely needs more elevators If I d been on a lower floor I wouldn t have even used them but I always waited several minutes once over 10 for them One morning the housekeeper knocked before we left the room and I asked her to come back after her next room By early afternoon it wasn t clean and a male hotel worker told me it was too late to clean or get towels I ran into a lady next and she was happy to clean it for us Odd Breadfast was not cheap but very good , Clean rooms quick room service great pools always stocked with towels location to mall beach hop on buses taxis Wifi worked well After complaining about being in a smoking room with a toddler I got upgraded to a larger room on non smoking floor 
276144,Barcelona Princess, Looby and entrance Elevators to slow and long time spend waiting , Roof to pool as well as gtm bar and pool on 3 rd floor Perfect breakfast with variety of options Coffee should be improved 
276145,Barcelona Princess, The pool actually looked bigger in the pics than actual size, The views over Barcelona were fantastic Nothing was an issue with the Team at Barcelona Princess Great value would definitely recommend 
276146,Barcelona Princess, They put a family with young children next to a group of men who were letting every one in their room from 3am in the morning until 5 30am with the door being knocked on and banging their door shut The strong smell of alcohol Please check which visitors are being put next to each other Explained this to staff they did say if I would have phoned down to the reception they would have sorted things out , Good breakfast nice views 
276147,Barcelona Princess, I didn t like how the room they gave us had a few problems we couldn t get into our room as there was a problem with the door which was eventually fixed and also how we had to wait so long for the lift, I loved the blackout blinds so we had an excellent nights sleep the buffet breakfast was amazing and catered for every kind of taste I loved how the hotel was one minute to the metro and a five minute walk to the beach Also I loved how a lot of the staff spoke English and were very helpful Excellent alround 
276148,Barcelona Princess, no kettle in the room breakfast was very boring my kids got an eye infenction in the swimming pool and thats destroyed half of ours holiday, staff very friendly close to metro shopping centre right beside the hotel 
276149,Barcelona Princess, The hotel is a little dated but still comfortable It is a little bit away from the centre but easily reached by the metro Sometimes had to wait a while for the lifts Loud music from some festival to 3 am on two consecutive days , Most of the staff were very friendly Two outdoor pools with good views albeit on the small size but consistent with the size of other Barcelona hotels Breakfast had a wide choice of things to eat it even had skimmed milk a rare thing for a hotel in Spain Spectacular view from room Loved the cava sold by the hotel 
276150,Barcelona Princess, The capacity of elevators , Next to the metro station and close to the beaches Spacious restaurant with great variety of foods for breakfast View from the pool at 23rd floor is awesome 
276151,Barcelona Princess, The rooms were nice but the shower was so frustrating the shower leaked through the door which made the whole bathroom floor look like a pool and it even went into the separate toilet That was annoying Loved the free bar although instead of another soft drink it would have been nice to have an extra beer Bit annoying when both myself and my husband wanted a beer and there was only one The lift was probably the most frustrating thing out of the whole holiday They just stopped working and when they did work we could wait 10 minutes for one of the three lifts to arrive , Comfy beds free mini bar good pool areas Friendly helpful staff 
276152,Barcelona Princess, Bathroom could to with a bit of maintenance The doors wouldn t close properly and the taps were not fitted properly on the sink , The hotel was well situated Amazing view of the sea The hotel was right next to a shopping centre making it convenient for food Breakfast was amazing 
276153,Barcelona Princess, Breakfast was a little bit over priced, Room was lovely bed was cosy pool bar food was delicious Right next door to a big shopping centre couldn t fault the hotel one bit
276154,Barcelona Princess, For such a big hotel two very small swimming pools There was always no place for me even to sit somewhere near , Friendly and professional personnel clean room beautiful view from the window to the whole city 19 floor Comfortable stay in general 
276155,Barcelona Princess, We had to wait such a long time for the lift every time we needed one which was very frustrating , Convenient location to public transport The metro station was only two minutes walk and the bus stop was almost just outside the hotel 
276156,Barcelona Princess, The room service ignored our do not disturb sign and came into our room at 9 30am on a Friday morning For touristy activities it was a bit of a way out of the main city The bed was too small, The bar was great
276157,Barcelona Princess, No room facilities for coffee or tea making Room could have been a little cleaner, Room very comfy bed excellent and location was good Food lovely and would stay again 
276158,Barcelona Princess, the staff offered no tourist help It was a long way to the centre of town Check in was an hour later than my booking confirmation said , bed was comfy shower was amazing Comouter business facilities were great 
276159,Barcelona Princess, We booked a double room and were given a twin on arrival The staff were helpful and swapped for a double the one they had left was disabled access which was fine The lifts take ages to arrive especially at busy times , Location cleanliness Great little pool on the roof 
276160,Barcelona Princess, The pool could be twice the size , The pool on 23 floor was amazing even despite it gets crowded at 8 am The beach which is more airy then Barceloneta is 10 minutes walk Complementary drinks every day including beer Location is perfect once you get tired from the crowds in the center 
276161,Barcelona Princess, However there was such an odor of garbage outside that I couldn t use the outdoor terrace that I paid extra for When I reported this to the staff they simply told me they couldn t control odors and offered me nothing in the way of compensation That was disappointing , The room and breakfast were fantastic 
276162,Barcelona Princess, No kettle in room or iron so would suggest to bring travel ones with you Not all rooms have a balcony so woul suggest to request it when booking But it is not a major downer overall very happy with it with hotell Would defo stay again , Room was lovely and spacious Clean and tidy which was done daily Free minibar too hotel has everything you need and more staff were lovely 
276163,Barcelona Princess, Probably not enough lifts you could wait for ages we were on 4th floor and walked down a few times A tram or metro journey required to get to city centre but more than reflected in the price, Hotel and room a stunning design roof top pool has splendid views close to beach
276164,Barcelona Princess, Lifts broke down on two occasions and one of our group got caught in them both times , Great location 5 minutes walk to the beach and main centre within easy reach by metro station which is also a few minutes walk from the hotel 
276165,Barcelona Princess, The pillows were uncomfortable There was always a long wait for the lift Breakfast was expensive , The roof top pool The location was excellent The rooms were spacious 
276166,Barcelona Princess, There was nothing to do in the area and the rooftop pool was not very hygienic or much of a view The decor needs to be improved as it appears dated the hotel, The location was superb for someone visiting the city for the first time The hop on off bus stop was great outside hotel
276167,Barcelona Princess, room service was not a very pleasant experience the person who came was rude and he didnt like it when i sent an item back because it wasnt what i ordered the 23rd floor pool area i dont understand why there was only 7 sunbeds there when there are 26 floors filled with guests that wants to get the chance to sit there i know there is another pool on the third floor but it is also very tiny and felt weird swimming there if there was one other person swimming as well because you came so close to eachother in the pool Princess Barcelona sells this hotel with its sea views and pools but they were both a disappointment view of the ugly museum roof was not very nice i didnt think it would be so visible at the 16th floor but it was and the rooms walls were very scrached made it not so fresh feeling , we loved the location most of the staff and the bed was very comfortable Reception was very helpfull and was very nice comfortable bed its very close to subway nd beach too the mini bar was free and they refill it everyday with couple of drinks and you are always met a very friendly face in the entrance everytime you go in and out 
276168,Barcelona Princess, There was a horrible noise constantly day and night from the floor above we think it may have been from the swimming pool The rooms were a little small but we didnt spend much time there so it didnt affect us , The views from the rooms were lovely as we were on the 22nd floor All the staff were very friendly and helpful We had a lovely welcome gift waiting for us in our room which was a lovely surprise the mini bar was stocked up every day which was also free 
276169,Barcelona Princess, Coffee in the room A need to stop residents reserving beds by the pool for the whole day A need to review lift system was very slow at times use of a stairway for those hopping from for example 0 to 3 floor, Very good hotel The room was amazing and all round facilities were great 
276170,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, The Rooftop pool was a disappointment the bar attached to it looked more like a children s room than a cocktail bar the pool area was often dirty left a mess Third floor pool area was much better 
276171,Barcelona Princess, The hotel is falling apart When we came back to room the toilette door was out of place It was same with the bath The tap was stuck so we could not even use it The pool in rooftop the one in 3rd floor as well is incredibly small Besides there are only 5 6 beds to lie down where you can never find any available Moreover people smoke and drink in the pool Hence you can imagine how dirty it can get easily It is really far from center and the sea is not near as looks at the maps Very sad to pay 17 euros per person to breakfast , Located next to shopping mall 
276172,Barcelona Princess, There was a ridge in the middle of the twin beds that were pushed together which would widen if we slept in the middle Also no kettle in the room however we asked for hot water from room service which they provided for 2 70 therefore it was not an issue The pros of the hotel far outweighed these cons , Fabulous hotel We had a fancy room with impressive city views The button controlled blinds were a dream come true The room would get pitch black and allowed us to sleep in Staff here are wonderful We checked out of the hotel at midday since they were unable to accomodate a late checkout but our flight was not until 10 pm The hotel offered us the service of their luggage room and also said that we are welcome to use the showers in the gym they provided towels and shower gel etc The taxi rank is just outside the hotel and the metro is a 3 4 min walk The metro ride to the gothic quarter Las Ramblas takes about 15 mins and 12 mins to Barcelonetta beach We walked to a nearby beach about 10 min walk this one was heaps nicer than Barcelonetta 
276173,Barcelona Princess, No wall separation between bathroom and room s entrance noise of refrigerator no electricity provider in the bathroom, Nice view clran rooms wall isolation modern deco close to mall sea tram and metro station nice area
276174,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, Check in was a quick easy process The rooms are gorgeous very clean The pool is a little smaller than it seems in the photos but the beach is only a short walk away 
276175,Barcelona Princess, Elevator facilities were not sufficient resulting in long waits for lift arrival very full lifts and a long time in the lift to reach destination Also got stuck in the lift for 15 minutes at one point Level 3 stairs door was locked which was a safety concern and made it difficult to get to the 3rd floor if you got fed up waiting for the lift Air conditioning in the bar made it uncomfortably cold at night like being IN a fridge but during the day when it was warm outside the air con was switched off ,No Positive
276176,Barcelona Princess, Sometimes there was not enough staff on to accommodate the amount of guests at the bars within the hotel The majority of the staff were really helpful , Loved being so close to the beach and transport links 
276177,Barcelona Princess, We were originally scheduled to stay for 9 nights but moved hotels after 2 due to the loud music playing until 4 30 5am and we were on the 18th floor Pools and gym very limited considering the number of rooms ,No Positive
276178,Barcelona Princess, After a trip to see the last showing of the fountains a tram and a metro ride away we came back feeling very hungry It was our last night before coming home and would have liked to have finished off with a final cocktail Unfortunately the bar had closed and therefore our only alternative was to order room service Due to the location of the hotel we had to make our way back earlier than we would have liked but we were worried about public transport times , Good variety of food at breakfast Gorgeous cocktails 
276179,Barcelona Princess, Waiting for the lifts they took ages , Great breakfast Close to the Metro Tour bus stops outside which made it good for exploring the City Visited with my 16 year old daughter it felt like a safe area
276180,Barcelona Princess, Breakfast in the main restaurant is ridiculous prices 19 euros per person when you can breakfast from the shopping centre for about 6 euros Room was ok not cleaned very well dust all over the window blinds were dirty walls were dirty fridge broke drinks were warm air conditioned had a funny smell like someone was smoking in the room , Very close to the beach reception staff very good and very helpful 
276181,Barcelona Princess, Decor is a bit dated the pool needs to be resurfaced the lifts are terrible not enough for the amount of people so had long waits to use them , Good breakfast good location by the metro stop great views lovely rooftop pool 
276182,Barcelona Princess, Our friends had left sunglasses and came to our room to collect them as I opened the door to my two friends in tears with two very intimidating bouncers grabbing them and throwing them in our room Saying they where going to take our friends away to kill them I have never been more frightened in my life and I was appoled by this behaviour I could not believe we where being treated like this The bouncers then barged in our room and where pushing everyone about screaming at us Horrible experience , The hotel itself was beautiful very clean and the views from the room pool where amazing 
276183,Barcelona Princess, Service is very slow on 3rd floor bar Ordered a Drink and we stood at the bar for 30 mins waiting for it to be made There are only 3 lifts and they are verrryyy slow and can sometimes be waiting for at least 10 mins for it to come to your floor Lifts are the only thing letting the hotel down Not many sunbeds around the pools , Lovely views from the 23rd pool Great clean rooms Nice food and drinks Metro is close and easy to get everywhere 
276184,Barcelona Princess, There could have been more choice for the hot food food for breakfast, Excellent location perfect if you want a peaceful break just outside the hustle and bustle of the city 
276185,Barcelona Princess, No balcony seemed like a lot of money to pay for not having a small balcony or even able to open the windows Very expensive drinks Location too far from the centre, The views from the room The bars and restaurants in the area
276186,Barcelona Princess, Not enough lifts for the hotel would often wait very long times for the lift especially in the mornings The pool is too small for the size of the hotel never any sunbeds available We paid for superior rooms which were vey small and dark and the breakfast was awful The food at the pool bar wasn t nice either for the cost of the food I expected a lot more The beach was further than advertised too I would stay at this hotel again , Bathroom is very nice 
276187,Barcelona Princess, The molding around the doors on the 19th floor are very badly water damaged The shower door also didn t close correctly but the room in whole was very nice I didn t notice any water damage or rotten wood on the inside of the room just on the outside by pretty much all the doors , Breakfast was great friendly staff that was more than helpful with directions recommendations and getting bikes for us to use The room was really nice with an amazing view and had blackout curtains for the huge windows with an ocean view 
276188,Barcelona Princess, Pool area extremely dirty with cigarette ends everywhere a very dated property that needs to be re decorated , The staff were helpful the concierge were very helpful in hiring bikes for us 
276189,Barcelona Princess, Very enjoyable convenient stay, Clean and friendly we had a beautiful view pool on roof top very good breakfast Good location next to subway station and hop on and off bus 
276190,Barcelona Princess, Price was a little high for room only but after checking other local hotels they are all pretty much the same , Location was perfect swimming pool gorgeous and great views Could do with a little more space for the swimming pool as we never managed to get a sunbed but it is what it is I guess Staff were great room lovely and clean 
276191,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, This hotel is really a great choice for Barcelona Just outside the city center noise and dust Its 15 mins away by metro from Placa Catalunya city center The Metro station is just by the hotel There is a big mall close by that has all the boutiques and restaurants you want It is close to the beach as well The rooms are spacious the bed extra comfy and the breakfast is really perfect The swimming pool area is a good break from walking the town The rooms are sound proof and the view is spectacular We really enjoyed everything 
276192,Barcelona Princess, too small pool area avoid this hotel for business trips they have some crazy complicated invoicing system that will create you problems with your expenses claim , 15 20 min distance from the beach and very close to a big shopping center
276193,Barcelona Princess, Breakfast was expensive 15 euro per person per day If you are looking for somewhere with a lot of nightlife restaurants close by this is not an ideal location , Very comfortable hotel loved the goodie bag in the bathroom Beds were great staff were helpful free mini bar an added bonus Good location beside large shopping centre with lots of places to eat Taxi rank and metro stop just outside the door 
276194,Barcelona Princess, the AC was broken we had to call maintenance at 1 30 am he came twice to the room and we waited have an hour in between for him to finish and the next morning no one apologized for that or even mention it and we asked if we can check out late they said they are fully booked and they can t, location
276195,Barcelona Princess, The only negative was a little flaw in the cistern , The building was amazing with a transparent elevator The view of the roof top and of the high floors was incredible The room was clean with a big window with view 
276196,Barcelona Princess, With such a spacious room it s weird to have only one chair available It would have been nicer with two chairs , This hotel is magnificent more like a five star hotel Every detail was considered every staff member was gracious and friendly The rooms are a great size wonderful bath products cozy robes comfortable beds and QUIET 
276197,Barcelona Princess, Instructions about car drip off could have been clearer It costs Euro 23 to have valet parking , Near the excellent metro to get into town but easy to drive to from France Friendly helpful staff Slightly quirky rooms with great use of blinds Be aware bathroom sort of part of the bedroom Free soft drinks in minibar 
276198,Barcelona Princess, Room could be cleaned a bit better Airco made a lot of noise and didn t cool that good, Pools were amazing Room with a view at the sea is a must imo Breakfast was delicious and varied Staff were friendly Metro only 250m away
276199,Barcelona Princess, Had to ask for gluten free bread and pastries even though I d requested this with my booking The first day it didn t even arrive even though the staff confirmed it ll be with me in 10 minutes I was pretty full by the end of the brekkie so didn t bother chasing All good the second day and they were very apologetic about the first morning , Proximity to the beach the facilities comfort posh factor at the hotel which felt more like that in a 5 star hotel the lovely staff front desk security restaurant housekeeping all of them

276203,Barcelona Princess, The lifts in the morning were quite busy so at times it took a while to get down from our room which was on the 21st floor , Breakfast was fantastic lots of choice Good location close to metro stop and tram line Hotel was clean and all the staff were very helpful Our room was lovely with a great view overlooking the sea The rooftop pool was fantastic and although we didn t use the gym or sauna it looked great All the facilities were great Although the hotel is little way out of the centre don t let this put you off as it is a great hotel right next door to a very large shopping centre and with bars and restaurants across the road 
276204,Barcelona Princess, Could do with two chairs in room, Great breakfast Lots of choice Comfy bed Good shower Great location next to mall with lots of shops and restaurants All staff were friendly and helpful
276205,Barcelona Princess, I did not experience bad feelings maybe I was lucky , comfortable nice hotel with impressive view on the city especially at night room was comfortable interesting idea with a glass wall between a room and a bathroom lifts with a glass wall nice experience sauna was a nice option tasty breakfast with several meal options location is convenient approx 50 m to metro station and slightly more than 100 m to the coast not very close to the city centre but you may get there by metro in 10 minutes or on foot in approx 25 minutes
276206,Barcelona Princess, All good apart from a 3am wake up due to noisy plumbing and very bad smell coming from shower The bathroom being split from main room by glass partition took some getting used to , Good location excellent staff lovely view from 25th floor complimentary drinks in mini bar 
276207,Barcelona Princess, It would not be your choice if visiting Barcelona to see the sights of the old town Also it was a bit disappointing that there was no restaurant for dinner We went to the shopping centre next door one evening and had the snack style food at the hotel bar on another evening , This is the perfect position if you are attending the congress centre opposite this hotel The rooms were comfortable We had great views across to the Mediteranean Sea Watching the sunrise was amazing

276209,Barcelona Princess, The main restaurants were not open and if you were in the pool on the 3rd floor you could have been ambushed by delegates attending seminars , All the staff were friendly and helpful and the room had a good view of the sea We would book again 
276210,Barcelona Princess, We checked in and they gave us a room in which you could not use the bathroom The door actually touched the toilet and you couldn t even squeeze in past the door Crazy Totally unusable Why Changed room and had better view and nice size bathroom We traveled all night therefore missing breakfast that was prepaid They would not give credit or refund They could have been a little more accommodating Not pleasant either , Location was great Next to shopping mall and general area was great 
276211,Barcelona Princess, This hotel is far from the city center so you d have to take a cab or use the metro each time you want to go sightseeing If you are in Barcelona for the beach only or for a conference then this is your hotel as this hotel is across the street from the beach and conference center , This hotel is a good value for the money The staff is very attentive and our room was well appointed 
276212,Barcelona Princess, No coffee machine in the room It s a pity there was not a proper evening restaurant Food was good but it s a great location they could have a really great restaurant on the roof with sea view city views , The rooms were lovely especially the glass wall between the wash area and window Also lovely desk and chair for working Auto blinds were great as well 
276213,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, Excellent location for the Primavera sound festival Friendly staff free mini bar and wifi Modern and design style of the bedroom View from the bedroom
276214,Barcelona Princess, The isolations in the room is not very good as I couldn t sleep for couple of days due to the noise from the room next to me which was annoying it felt like they are sitting with me in the same room only 3 lifts to the rooms which are busy at peak times, Good location next to the metro clean room with good breakfast great value for money Next to CCIB just 2 minutes walk free minibar
276215,Barcelona Princess, nothing, Hotel is close to the metro reception person was nice and very helpful The room simply amazing spacious nice design very clean big windows balcony with a table chairs and see view shampoo bath gel was of a good quality Breakfast a lot of meat vegetables fruits strawberries apricots watermelon melon etc waffels very tasty Pools two pools on the 3rd and 23rd floor On the 3rd floor there is also a gym and sauna strong advice to go there And a massage one of the best ever
276216,Barcelona Princess, Toilets are big but there isn t any bidet The barrier of the bath tub doesn t stop the water and you find the floor completely wet There is no way to change the height of the shower The rooms are very dark , Panoramic view Location Mini bar drinks and soft drinks are included in the price of the room 
276217,Barcelona Princess, Bathroom was confusing Not quite sure why there is a glass wall open to the bedroom I know there is a curtain that comes down to obstruct the view but not quite sure who leaves it up Not me is all I know Also there is no place in the shower to put your shampoo when you are showering Not sure how a person is supposed to hold onto the shampoo and shower also , I liked the location best of all I was very convenient to stay there and explore Barcelona The room was clean and most of the staff were very friendly One guy at the door was very efficient but he seemed to have an attitude or perhaps just a more subdued personality than most of the staff 
276218,Barcelona Princess, Expensive breakfast for what you get No coffee machines in the room, Location to conference center and close proximity to metro line The free drinks in the mini bar 
276219,Barcelona Princess, Bathroom not a discreet room opens to lobby of room This doesn t work well when sharing with another person who is not your partner Shower door not watertight flooded other areas of the room with every shower , Views were amazing Bed comfortable Very clean Very convenient for the conference centre

276221,Barcelona Princess, No evening restaurant Member of staff entered our room at 3am very odd Room cleaning timing very variable anytime from 8am to 4pm Elderly parents not keen on the open plan bathroom arrangement But overall good quality rooms and clean , Very quiet part of town 15 minute taxi ride to Las Ramblas Breakfast quality overall good more choice on some days than others Handy for large modern shopping mall next door food court rather variable Swimming pool nice and warm and adequate gym 
276222,Barcelona Princess, The mattress could be a bit more comfy There was was no concierge and a small reception for a hotel of that size , Nice hotel close to the beach and the tube station Great shower the roof top swimming pool has a sea view Delicious breakfast

276225,Barcelona Princess, It was an hours walk to the town but you had public transport links and a 24 7 taxi rank outside the hotel, This hotel was luxurious from the ultra comfy bed through to the electric black out blinds to the amazing waterfall shower and finally the roof top pool If you are looking for somewhere nice stay here 
276226,Barcelona Princess, Failure to respond to my email after checking out Possible probable cleanliness issues with crockery on last morning Oh Boy did I get ill later that day Await their reply , Staff breakfast Bar almost limitless Miguel at front desk is a good operator and a people person well done Miguel 
276227,Barcelona Princess, No coffee making facilities in the room and little space to hang wet swimwear but that s being picky , The pools the v friendly staff the Desigual lounge the separate sleeping area for the children the v comfy beds the breakfast easy walk to beach playpark metro and tram the dressing gowns and slippers 
276228,Barcelona Princess, False advertising on the booking page Jacuzzi shown in photos but no jacuzzi to be found 2 pools both very shallow and the rooftop pool was very dirty and looked nothing like the photos Our first room s shower flooded to the door of the room as the drainage was terrible this is one of the complaints that they upgraded me for The original room was defiantly not worth the money paid , the upgrade to a superior room on 3rd day after complaining 2ce most the staff were v nice and helpful other than one or 2 rooms cleaned to perfection The views were beautiful They also gave us a complimentary bottle of cava and some small cakes to make up for the faulse advertising and the flooding shower 
276229,Barcelona Princess, Terrible plumbing in bathroom caused room to be flooded with water very terribly stink in bathroom even though I asked hotel reception to do something about terrible rooftop pool quality with obvious outdated finishes that looks old no basic amenities for coffee and tea which I have to pay for and caused Inconvenience terrible bar selection room way too small and bad layout with bedroom and bathroom having virtually no partition staff reception very inconsistent some are good some are bad Terrible value for money for the couple days we stayed in especially four stars rating Not recommended , Location and access to mall and metro 
276230,Barcelona Princess, There is no kettle and iron provided we asked and were informed it is so for safety reason But since it was cold we really could use it for hot noodles , The location is very convenient since it is near the Convention Center and a mall The bus and tram as well as the Metro can be so easily accessed The view of the Mediterranean sea was great 
276231,Barcelona Princess, Nothing really , Travelling regularly for business I get to stay in a variety of hotels This hotel sets itself apart from the rest by providing updated modern rooms not excessive but the details are noticed Rooms are comfortable and quiet Breakfast has a good and tasty variety 
276232,Barcelona Princess, Surrounded by hoardes of rude Aggressive and unpleasant Asian travellers who monopolised lifts and breakfast Lifts need re programming I carried bags down 26 flights after waiting 20 mins Staff are friendly and helpful when not overwhelmed by Asian group , Modern hotel
276233,Barcelona Princess, The pools are very very small , Easy to navigate to and from the city center we walked mostly as the paths are beautiful The hotel is clean the staff is fantastic close to the beach

276235,Barcelona Princess, nothing, Very relaxing rooms were very good and big bathroom and shower was great staff are very friendly close to train station tour buses beaches taxis next to huge shopping centre air conditioning and wifi was very good
276236,Barcelona Princess, So many knocks on the door staff seemed to be duplicating efforts and came to the room multiple times sometimes for reasons I did not understand ie breakfast sent 3 times cleaning coming 4 times in a row A few times they unlocked the door without knocking Dining service while I know I m in a Spanish speaking country and it is my responsibility to learn the language if you are interested in them also supporting English speakers as the menu is also in English this needs work The team could not understand even the most simple of my requests although they were super sweet and tried , I was extremely impressed for the value As an English speaker the staff went above and beyond to accommodate me I had flown in from Indonesia so upon checking in my bank froze my account in response to protect fraudulent charges This caused my card to come through as declined upon check in While many hotels would refuse me access to my room the hotel was more than understanding and let me check in get to my room and call my bank to release the hold In the room after a nearly 30 hour flight it was a relief to come to a hotel room equipped with everything I needed razor toothpaste etc to shower and relax right away things I would traditionally need to run down to a store for I also loved how you use the hotel card to turn on the lights to conserve energy As a tourist having access to a free printer was an incredible perk Dry cleaning and laundry was incredibly expensive but your drycleaning team was able to remove stains other dry cleaners had not while also turning it around much quicker than expected I didn t get to use the pool or gym but this is wonderful for the price Location wish it was closer to the city but being right next to the mall amusement park and taxis at any hour was great for the price All of your staff seemed happy to help even when they did not speak English this is huge for a tourist who s trying to find their way around 
276237,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, We were on th 25th floor with spectacular views and staff were amazing and we re used to 5 star service but they booked us into the restaurant we wanted and advised on several matters 
276238,Barcelona Princess, Food in hotel wasn t great and of low quality when you could walk along the promenade 15 minutes or go directlyacross the road and have food of better quality for half the price Few more variety in TV channels could have been of use I e more channels for visitors , The spa facilities were good Location was perfect if not wanting to be in centre of barcelona but within 40 minute stroll Shopping centre next door was great Nice area of Barcelona Free WIFI was a bonus 
276239,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, Lovely experience We had a sea and city view room which was unreal sun all day long and views to die for Staff where friendly and room was amazing 
276240,Barcelona Princess, Some minor problems with elevators very occupied in the morning There should be like 2 3 more , Very professional staff at the hotel very tasty food clean rooms Tier 1 
276241,Barcelona Princess, Reception queues staff multi tasking sometimes not always paying attention to customer needs which caused mistakes further delays male reception staff were a bit dismissive and a little more smiling genuine interest would have improved overall score , Rooms modern clean comfy beds beautiful views from higher level rooms First room smelled of smoke but lady on reception dealt with this superbly and alternative room was great Felt that female reception staff had good customer empathy were genuine 
276242,Barcelona Princess, Rooms too hot No air conditioning that worked Asked twice to have it checked but still didn t work Free mini bar 1 bottle of beer per day between 2 people , Close to lots of different transport networks

276249,Barcelona Princess, Bathroom wasn t really suitable for a couple of oldies Safe at floor level was almost impossible for us to access Power points at desk were poor plug kept falling out No coffee making facilities Light needed in closet, Room was comfortable if a little small Breakfasts were excellent Staff very friendly and helpful

276252,Barcelona Princess, The reception staff did not have much personality they let the rest of the staff within the hotel down as it felt as if they didn t care too much Location not central but perfect for our trip , The bar staff were all lovely the room was clean every day with the free mini bar re stocked the hotel had a friendly feel and location was perfect with the shopping mall right next door with the outside restaurants open till late at night Location to the center was further away however the metro was easy to navigate throughout the city Both pool s were lovely with bartenders being very attentive although when its windy getting out of the pool was cold not the hotels fault obviously 
276253,Barcelona Princess, The lock did not work and it took the staff almost 24 hours to fix it The small in the room it was not possible to open windows for fresh air only airco and it was very unpleasant , Location The hotel is very closed to Congress Centre 
276254,Barcelona Princess, Nothing at all , The hotel was in a very good location It was a 2 minute walk from the El Maresme Forum Metro station The views from our room were amazing We could see Tibidabo and Sagrada Familia through our enormous window The electronic blinds including a blackout blind ensured a good nights sleep The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly The shower was amazing out of this world and always had a constant supply of hot water Mini bar always well stocked and Room service was outstanding We increased our stay from 2 nights to 6 nights while we were there We would definitely return here for a stay 
276255,Barcelona Princess, Far away from city takes a long time by metro or taxi to get anywhere Leasure room could have something like drinks snacks or maybe music, Nice hotel view from the pool is great Nice leasure room
276256,Barcelona Princess, The metro station nearby was closed during the time we travelled so we had to take a bus to another metro station , Though the hotel is a bit far from the city centre it is relatively convenient to go shopping and have meals since there is a big shopping mall near the hotel The outdoor swimming pool is great for relaxing at nights

276259,Barcelona Princess, The restaurant is sad for dinner For such a fabulous food town the restaurant is lacking courage vision selection and quality , Very convenient location for the convention center Nice view Good breakfast 
276260,Barcelona Princess, The service cost to service location Breakfast is same everyday The hotel doesn t even have a iron box in the room They want to make money out of it by giving the clothes to the hotel to do the ironing, Location in relation to the convention center
276261,Barcelona Princess, The location was the only downside to me, Loved the hotel room and the bed was really comfy The hotel was modern very clean and tidy and particularly loved the electronic blinds to shut out the bathroom and outside window

276265,Barcelona Princess, Needed ceiling lights in the bedroom as it appeared very dark Shower door had a gap so water went all over the floor but otherwise lovely bathroom robes slippers and toiletries included which were great , Breakfast was cold meats fruits pastries cereals buffet style and plentiful The Barcelona tourist bus stops right outside which you can hop on off a must to see everything 3 mins from metro station around 5 stopsand you re in the place catalunya city centre from here you could always get the aerobus 5 90 back to the airport it took us 20 mins although in peak months prob half an hour 
276266,Barcelona Princess, Aircon wasn t working in the room for the first two nights so uncomfortable nights sleep for one of the party Only had our room cleaned once but when it was done it was perfect and thorough , Great sized rooms with an amazing view Very modern looking and perfect for a short stay getaway Far away from attractions but perfect for a quiet stay to chill by the pool and a short walk to the beach 
276267,Barcelona Princess, Noisy neighbours , The view from our window was perfect We were very glad to get a room on the 14th floor The Hotel has a good position due to a transport system 50 meters to the nearest underground station Forum and a tram stop It is also amazing place for people who loves jogging Right behind the hotel there is an access to the seacoast 
276268,Barcelona Princess, The pillows were not great but after asking for a change at the front desk we got different pillows delivered to the room straight away, The location although a little out of downtown the subway is right outside which takes 10 minutes to bring you to the heart of the city Free minibar and spacious room
276269,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, At first I was disappointed because I couldn t open the window to my room huge pet peeve of mine when staying at a hotel I asked if I could move or check out early Then I was able to upgrade to a junior suite with an add on fee for the upgrade which I accepted and very glad I did The room was perfect with small balcony and amazing views It was a perfect stay 
276270,Barcelona Princess, They have doorman but I don t know what they do they don t open the door and they don t hail taxis or help with luggage , Very nice modern hotel clean and classy with a free minibar stocked with water sodas and 2 free alcoholic drinks

276272,Barcelona Princess, on our second day our room was never cleaned we spoke to the reception that night who said we could not even get the complimentary water without paying room service for it and told us to speak to the manager the next day the following day the manager offered us breakfast for our last 2 days complimentary and said the room would be cleaned right away but it still wasn t cleaned until 6pm If you have the breakfast complimentary then I would eat it however at 20 the quality is really poor In Spain you can get a decent breakfast for 5 so they are really taking advantage of people with this Gym is poor only cardio machines so don t waste your time even going unless you plan to do cardio Saunas are separated by sex clearly not interesting if you are a couple on a romantic weekend Pools are very small Hotel bar closes at 11pm , The view is good Location next to the beach is nice but it is a bit far out if you are in the city to do the touristy things

276275,Barcelona Princess, There is no jacuzzi like it shows on the website apparently it has been dismantled , Super beds Excellent breakfast We thought it would be further from the center from the map but it is close and the hotel neighborhood itself is pleasant to walk in Right next to a giant mall with all amenities if you choose 10 minute walk to the beach Would stay there again 
276276,Barcelona Princess, They provide either heating or aircon at a time This week it is heating Had to get maintenance to unlock the wndow as it was stiflingly hot Ridiculous not to have aircon Location is far out of town but public transport system is good , Comfortable room friendly staff Public transport is very cheap easy to get around Impressive views from the rooftop swimming pool
276277,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, The hotel is off the busy city center with good connections by metro tram bus Nice pretty quiet and modern area Stunning view over the city from the 21st floor room couldn t have been better Interesting solution to separate the bathroom from the room by a glass wall Nice breakfast too 
276278,Barcelona Princess, There is nothing we didn t like, The hotel was in a very good location It was a 2 minute walk from the El Maresme Forum Metro station The views from our room were amazing We could see Tibidabo and Sagrada Familia through our enormous window The electronic blinds including a blackout blind ensured a good nights sleep The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly The shower was amazing out of this world and always had a constant supply of hot water Mini bar always well stocked and Room service was outstanding We increased our stay from 2 nights to 6 nights while we were there We would definitely return here for a stay 
276279,Barcelona Princess, Some of the fixtures and fittings were a bit tired I think the hotel cld do with some upgrades, The breakfast and the friendly helpful staff The free mimi bar was also a bonus 
276280,Barcelona Princess, Nothing was right The room size the bfast the lack of response from room service the air conditioning which did not work you could only heat up the room the lifts were slow and chaotic too mich waiting , The people at the reception were nice 
276281,Barcelona Princess, There is nothing we didn t like about the hotel , The hotel was in a very good location It was a 2 minute walk from the El Maresme Forum Metro station The views from our room were amazing We could see Tibidabo and Sagrada Familia through our enormous window The electronic blinds including a blackout blind ensured a good nights sleep The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly 
276282,Barcelona Princess, Our bathroom door was poorly constructed which lead to a room flood we moved rooms and the same happened The pools were lovely but not as clean as I would ve hoped There was a bloody plaster in the 3rd floor pool over a 2 day period which prevented me from enjoying this , The staff were very homely had plenty of time for their visitors the room was comfortable clean and the breakfast buffet had plenty to offer It is coveniently locaded next to the shopping center a short walk to the beach Metro was also close by and easy to use 
276283,Barcelona Princess, Our room had a bad smell coming from the sewer pipes , The Staff was very accomodating they gave us a room with an amazing view We love the breakfast buffet location and the pool was well maintained and heated up Also free drinks from the snack bar 
276284,Barcelona Princess, Could have more english channels on TV Top pool not as clean as the lower level pool , Hotel was amazing Excellent food Enjoyed the free massage very much good to have a choice of two heated pools Staff very friendly and helpful 
276285,Barcelona Princess, In the room was very hot Air condition was very loud whole night Parking is missing I had to park under shopingcenter next to hotel 30euros per day , Breakfast good location spectacular view from room 
276286,Barcelona Princess, Nothing in the room worked TV air con was pre set to a temp that was just too hot Air con had a constant dripping noise ALL night Shower leaked into the room and wet our clothes Front Desk was just not interested in any of these concerns Companies seeking hotels close to the Convention Centre should give this hotel a big miss Next conference in Barcelona we will NOT be staying at the Barcelona Pronces , Proximity to Convention Centre was the only saving grace of this hotel 
276287,Barcelona Princess,No Negative, Everything about this hotel was great The little sun trap by the pool was beautiful sauna was really nice Staff very friendly Was an amazing long weekend Right next door to shopping centre Walking distance from city centre
276288,Barcelona Princess, The hot food for breakfast was too greasy, The views from the hotel were amazing and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly The location was perfect for the beach but was a few metro trains away from the centre of Barcelona this is something I didnt mind as I m not someone who goes out to bars at night 
276289,Barcelona Princess, Nothing really I suppose making up the room was a bit slow but that s only being really piccy, The room and facilities were excellent and the breakfast was superb The location was really good and the city view from our top floor window was spectacular 
276290,Barcelona Princess, The reason I book this hotel was due to the nice pics they have on the web but unfortunately as I arrive I didn t like the reception area it make it look like a cheap hotel it looks very boring nothing fun to see even my friends 3star hotel that they book was more impressive The hotel is huge only needs an elegant and more decoration at the reception area and the smell coming from the toilet Was horrible swiming pools were ok because of the sea view I wouldn t be so sure to recommend the hotel to my friends,No Positive
276291,Barcelona Princess, Sound isolation between rooms is totally forgotten You hear everything on the next room If your neighbors fight each other then you ll have huge problems whenever trying to sleep Our neighbors firstly listened music very very loudly then we asked to the reception to warn them Then they started to fight each other and the fight continues during all night We called reception again and they sent security but next day we learned that guest were still staying in the hotel and they still listening music very very loudly again so we asked to change our rooms Finally they changed our room However if somebody makes you a problem their reservation should be canceled This is totally wrong management , Location room design and room clean up
276292,Barcelona Princess, Swimming pools are only in open spaces In case of bad weather you cannot enjoy the right feeling , Breakfast was amazing The best way to start a day Nice staff I liked the waterfall shower 
276293,Barcelona Princess, The window leaked like the window to the outside One of the days rained all night and we woke up and the ledge was soaked in water Luckily we only had clothes near it so it wasn t a big deal Also the glass in and around the faucet had mold in it It was obviously a poor design b c you cannot get in between the panes of glass to clean around the faucet Last the pipe to our sink was fixed with duct tape Granted it didn t leak but it looked tacky , The front desk staff were EXTREMELY friendly and helpful Very personable Also I thought the location as great Just a block from the metro right on the beach Next to a huge mall Great for when it s raining in the evening 
276294,Barcelona Princess, TV signal poor Could have done with a proper resteraunt rather than pool bars Would have been nice to have a sports bar or screen in one of the bars to see major football, Good breakfast choice and facilities Friendly staff Great view of sea and close to subway and taxi ranks
276295,Barcelona Princess, I walked from the taxi with 3 big bags and baby trolly in high wind and no body came to pick up the my luggage until I reached the reception, Comfortable room and reasonable breakfast buffet
276296,Barcelona Princess, Check out staff were a little short with us Shower door didn t seal entirely so you had to be careful that the base didn t overflow , We were allowed to check in early the staff were amazingly friendly Our room was HUGE had a beautiful view of the ocean Viewing the sunrise from our room was simply unbelievable The shower was great The breakfast was lovely and had a huge selection of healthy and hot options The outdoor pool was gorgeous warm and stayed open until 10 pm I was sick one night unfortunately and made it as far as the bin we called down to reception to ask could the bag be taken away not only was the lady sympathetic she sent up a member of staff immediately who was willing to clean up but we gratefully refused The staff for the most part could not have made us feel more welcome or been more helpful

276298,Barcelona Princess, No atmosphere in the hotel bars , Lovely hotel outside the city centre but bus station 2 mins away to take you to the main city Staff helpful and friendly hotel rooms small but very modern and clean 
276299,Barcelona Princess, 1 Front desk staff did not pay attention to who he should serve first He ignore that I was waiting to be served Only serve a rude guy come straight to the counter Did not even applogise after I reminded him 2 I asked to use a vacuum machine for couple minutes for packing my luggage I was blindly refused first Only after I said I need to talk to your manager and I have always able to borrow from other hotels He then contacted house keeper for me , Like the bed and the room in general 
276300,Barcelona Princess, Leaving , Excellent hotel Staff friendly rooms superb My thirteen year old son and I went for the football and with metro just across the road this was perfect Unbelievable views over Barcelona 
276301,Barcelona Princess, That a drug deal was taking place in Reception when we checked in The stains on our sofa in our bedroom Paying for breakfast and then being turned away because staff in the restaurant said we hadn t paid Rude staff A rock hard bed , Nothing It was dreadful 
276302,Barcelona Princess, WiFi authentication did not allow my connecting to my company s VPN TV did not have option for original language in any dubbed channel During MWC week price was very high as many hotels in Barcelona actually , Great staff Very nice and comfortable place Situated a bit far from City Center and places I need to go to but very conveniently close to subway L4 and bus H16 Beautiful views of city and the Mediterranean 
276303,Barcelona Princess, room is not very large the bathroom door is closed by magnetic pads and makes noise in the night , very comfortable mattress great city view at 23rd floor great breakfast buffet near to the subway station bus station BTW a bus stop is just outside the hotel Bus N7 goes directly to the city center a better choice for people with baby and stroller 
276304,Barcelona Princess, I will give the right review when my issue is resolved, I am not happy about the no show comment and money taken from my sons account he paid cash on arrival and stay on 9th floor room number 10 so may I suggest you get the mix up sorted out asap

276314,Barcelona Princess, The hotel is located near the sea so it isn t ideal for the city centre bars and clubs That said the Metro underground station is very is close by and travel is cheap Unfortunately I had to amend my booking from 2 nights to 1 night The system would not let me do this without trying to charge me around 200 for my existing room for 1 night more than the cost for the 2 nights so I had to cancel my room and re book On arrival the cancellation of the room for 2 nights did not show on the system Barcelona Princess please note I do not want or expect to be charged for 2 nights as one of the 2 rooms I booked was definitely cancelled Thank you , Lovely modern hotel immaculately clean with very chic rooms and all the mod cons you d expect from a hotel this grand I felt like a celebrity staying at the Barcelona Princess the place is very showbiz The staff were really friendly and helpful and we loved the bar and the swimming pool just fabulous Absolutely gorgeous place to stay in Barcelona highly recommended

276339,Barcelona Princess, There were small things which indicated maintenance was not as important as it should be for instance the swimming pool was dirty the shower doors didn t close properly which caused large quantities of water to lay on the floor the towels were not correctly restocked too many too few not the right kind , The room was spectacular on the 22nd floor with a view on the Mediterranean The shower was a joy to use The staff was very friendly and informative It was a newly built and most things worked

276342,Barcelona Princess, The only downside is the minus of tea making facilities in the room this is pretty standard in most other places so was disappointed this wasn t an option , Facilities of the hotel are amazing The 2 pools are fantastic and very peaceful away from the hussle and bussle of the streets The staff are extremely helpful and have all the information you could possibly need

276348,Barcelona Princess, My room smelled really bad I had to buy a candle to try to mask the smell The elevators were always slow or took forever to hail Experiencing Barcelona is limited from this part of the city the center seemed to be a 10 15 minute cab ride away , I liked how close this was to the venue I had to be at for work and ease to access the taxi s train 
276349,Barcelona Princess, Shower had a bad leak A bit far from main centre but lots of transport around and 11 in a taxi No English Channel on TV, Nice sea view from balcony pools really nice tho a bit small staff in gym bar very friendly and helpful shower in room was amazing Free bar in room was a nice touch Close to shopping mall
276350,Barcelona Princess, No Bad remarks everything was perfect the entire six days we stayed at the Princesse Hotel , The Barcelona Princess Hotel is one of the best Hotels we have stayed in the location is 10 15 walk from the beach where you can rent chair umbrella s for 8 euro s Hop on Hop off stop just outside the hotel Pool on 3rd floor w bar Pool and tanning area on 26th floor Barcelona Mall is 5 min walk from front door plenty of place to eat and shops The rooms are outstanding the service that is provided in great Upon checking In the Front Desk Receptionist Ausma was absolutely unbelievable in the help she provided amazing city view on the 25th floor the lights over the city at night can not be described she also was very helpful in the tours and direction to difference sights hopefully you will be served by her professionalism or someone with the same cheerful attitude We will differently be returning for another stay 
276351,Barcelona Princess, We arrived early so we could check in but our room wasn t available so they told us to come back in a couple hours So we went to the beach Came back 3 hours later and were still waiting for our room 15 mins later our room was ready but they needed to still send housekeeping up to make the bed a full bed instead of two seperate twin beds The design of the bathroom is just stupid The shower leaks into the toilet area which is divided by a glass wall So no privacy The toilet smelled of old sour mildew and had mold We left for the city one day and put the sign on for room service We were gone for about 6 hours or so When we came back we saw they had taken the sign off but hadn t actually cleaned the room nor made the bed We called for room service waited about 20mins they still hadn t came to clean Then we called the front desk and waited another 10 mins before someone showed up Needless to say this hotel needs a serious upgrade and better communication , The hotel is situated in a great location with easy access to the beach and the tram to take you into the city 
276352,Barcelona Princess, Really nothing, Olla The very best hotel in barcelona the staff are more than excellent specially Marta the breakfast choices very good our room was with terrace amazing city and sea view Definitely next year will be there

276355,Barcelona Princess, The pillows at the hotel were not great there was a huge cushion and a very slim thin pillow we asked for alternatives but it was just more of what was already available We had a double bed which was 2 singles put together which meant there was a gap down the middle Swimming pool was too small to service a hotel of 26 floors and 200 guests and was mainly used for smokers which isnt great if you dont smoke , Hotel was convenient for Open Top Bus Tour stop was right outside the hotel Shopping Centre was convenient for food shopping etc
276356,Barcelona Princess, Bit far from town , Very good hotel modern bright spacious Friendly staff near the beach but 4km too far to walk to town Plenty of cheap taxis though 
276357,Barcelona Princess, I think reception try to encourage you to use services they get commission from rather than what is best suited to you I asked to book a taxi to Sitges and they quoted 137 50 but I got licenced taxi outside hotel for 70 on the meter , Very stylish hotel very clean
