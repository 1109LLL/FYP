316447,Hotel Casa Camper,No Negative, Starting with the excellent staff we felt very welcome Very nice room and great terrace with bar Also very welcome snacks Hotel is very well located but we arrived in Barcelona during the taxi strike Not pleasant to take public transportation after a very long flight But once we were greeted at the hotel everything was great Only place to stay in Barcelona 
316448,Hotel Casa Camper,No Negative, The 24 hour buffet in the reception area is a very nice touch Breakfast was very relaxed with the option of cooked food The rooftop terrace with the honesty bar was great for relaxing and the cocktail bar in the basement was staffed by a very knowledgeable and entertaining barman 
316449,Hotel Casa Camper, I liked every thing, We liked the 24 hour self service kitchen you can get drinks non alcholic snacks all included in your room cost as well as a great breakfast The hotel is a very trendy and very different to most conservative hotels this has been my second visit to camper I would highly recommend it
316450,Hotel Casa Camper,No Negative, The staff is extremely knowledgeable friendly and efficient The breakfast was delicious and the all day availability of snacks and beverages is a plus The location is perfect 
316451,Hotel Casa Camper, I like it all, Staff impressive team All of them Night Shift Morning Shift From Brazil from Portugal from Spain all of them Very Service Oriented Example My flight was very delayed and they guys just wanted me to take it easy enjoy the stay with them and forget about the delay They care about making me happy at their Hotel The room was impeccable spacious modern the BED that is their secret weapon LOVE THAT BED Location is excellent 
316452,Hotel Casa Camper, Made the assumption that as guests we could dine at dos palillos restaurant It might be helpful to highlight on Casa Camper website that reservations for the restaurant are necessary , Location rooftop terrace views option to take a refreshment at any time during the stay simple and luxurious comfort in room wall garden artwork on roof level and stairwell walls option to take breakfast on the roof terrace friendly staff dos palillos bar 
316453,Hotel Casa Camper, Nothing, Excellent facilities in the heart of the city in easy walking distance of main attractions and exploring the old city Extremely helpful and friendly staff who went out of their way to help with local knowledge booking tickets etc Access to drinks and snacks throughout the day was very useful 
316454,Hotel Casa Camper,No Negative, I booked this hotel for myself and 7 others based on reviews I had read It was wonderful everyone loved it The service was so friendly and super efficient and everything else about it was just delightful 
316455,Hotel Casa Camper, Next time I would request a room on the quiet side of the building We had a lovely room on the 3rd floor but it overlooked the street which tended to be on the noisy side , Location was great Staff was amazing The daily breakfast offered many choices On top of that they had substantial snacks out during the entire day We were gone most of the time since this was our first visit to Spain so we didn t partake but what a nice touch Having an honor bar was a wonderful idea as well 
316456,Hotel Casa Camper, The chair in the mini lounge could have been a more suitable height for working at the small table prolonged periods are a bit uncomfortable This is a minor point , Immensely helpful and genial staff and an impeccably maintained property it was an absolute pleasure to stay there The generosity of offer in terms of WiFi snacks and drinks make Casa Camper stand out from normal hotels that aim to charge for everything 
316457,Hotel Casa Camper, I can t think of anything I didn t like This is a great hotel , The location was excellent many sites were within walking distance The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful in terms of making reservations and what not The bed was very comfortable The shower was roomy and had nice water pressure We especially loved the all day snacks as well as the rooftop patio 
316458,Hotel Casa Camper, Breakfast could have been better but the complimentary food drink during the day was fantastic , Fantastic location The room was large with a very comfortable bed relaxing sitting area and gorgeous balcony The roof terrace was an added bonus with an honest bar and great views over Barcelona The staff were very helpful before and during our stay 
316459,Hotel Casa Camper,No Negative, Great concept in an excellent location on a quiet street in the heart of the city Very friendly staff Clean rooms with excellent design ours looked out on a leafy interior courtyard and had a lounge room annex on the opposite side of the hall just for our use with a couch and hammock All day free dining with breakfast light bites and snacks 
316460,Hotel Casa Camper,No Negative, This was our second stat at this property The hotel is extremely well located within walking distance to many attractions They offer an excellent breakfast and around the clock drinks and snacks The honor bar on the roof offers a relaxing interlude We had one of the rooms with a bonus sitting room across the hall This type of room is excellent for couples that keep different sleeping hours I think this is the best choice in Barcelona 
316461,Hotel Casa Camper, Wish there was a rooftop pool and the terrace wasn t so empty and lonely The prices are too high for the type of people that would love this hotel cool millennium travelers , Loved the canteen being open to guests all day and night very useful for late night snacks Great simple breakfast Large rooms Friendly and knowledgeable staff 
316462,Hotel Casa Camper, I feel the rooftop terrace could have a little updating maybe some more comfortable furniture to make this space a more relaxing environment to chill out at after a hot day , From the convenient location which is close to the Ramblas and not a far walk from the ocean either the hotel has a lot to offer The interiors are simple and sophisticated the staff are friendly and courteous speaking in multiple languages including French English and of course Spanish We also thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast and sitting to enjoy a drink on the rooftop terrace 
316463,Hotel Casa Camper, Can t think of anything we would complain about , Garden view from the bedroom extremely private and exceptionally quiet even with a Spanish Holiday involving a barrage of fireworks all night Sitting room overlooked the street On the 3rd floor the street noise was nothing unexpected A block off the Ramblas 24 hr snack bar is excellent Honour system for the terrace bar was an unexpected surprise Took advantage of the terrace to watch the fireworks actually 
316464,Hotel Casa Camper, The house keeping was a little awkward timing but otherwise it was great , The availability of food was great the service was incredible very personalized Very big spacious rooms The location is excellent very close and within walking distance to everything They let us check in early so we could explore the city and leave our bags in the rooms 
316465,Hotel Casa Camper, Nothing, Great location 3 minutes to Los Ramblas and about 5 to the metro Staff were all genuinely helpful Complimentary refreshments and snacks available 24 hours a day A unique boutique hotel which we would recommend to anyone 
316466,Hotel Casa Camper,No Negative, Wonderful hotel Our corner room was very spacious and had a large bathroom with separate tub and shower Great location just off the Rambla near Plaza Catalunya We had stayed at Casa Camper in Berlin so we were prepared for the cantina for breakfast and other goodies The rooftop honor bar was a great place to unwind after a day of touring The staff is very friendly and helpful The hotel made our visit to Barcelona unforgettable 
316467,Hotel Casa Camper, Leaving , The pillows and sheets were amazing I took pictures of the tags to see if I can buy them The snack bar is great We arrived in midday and took the airport shuttle to the universidad stop which was an easy 10 min walk to the hotel We were hungry and tired when we got in and just wanted to sit for a few minutes The snack bar provided complimentary sandwiches snacks and water soda Also the included breakfast was great eggs made to order got a veggie omelette one day and eggs with breakfast sausage the next and lots of pastries and other continental breakfast items The rooftop lounge was great including the honor bar The basement bar with pool tables had incredible and strong cocktails But above all else we LOVED the neighborhood We explorer every alley we could find and tried to eat a few tapas and have a drink at several places each night There were upscale options casual eateries and bars with 1 50 Beers all day in the college area We spent every night of our 5 night stay exploring our neighborhood We saw other areas during the day but always wanted to stay around the hotel in the evening cause we loved it so much Also super close to catalunya the main plaza where the buses pick up and at the top of la rambla the most famous street Very convenient for being touristy but in a neighborhood that makes you really want to not be touristy As I m sure you can tell we loved this place I have no complaints 
316468,Hotel Casa Camper, Nothing Some say the camper rooms are a bit dark and the separate lounge across the corridor seems pointless I found the arrangement worked really well coming back in the evening one could read or listen to music while the sounds and smells drift up from the street below giving a feel as though you are getting the best of both worlds Meanwhile your partner can sleep soundly in the bedroom without being disturbed , Good happy staff clean and comfortable hotel Location is within a 5 minute walk of Pl de Catalunya where the airport shuttle comes in Any help with orientation bookings etc all dealt with superbly Carter was particularly good so special mention but all the staff were good The food snacks available after breakfast and all day long were of good quality and a great idea The roof terrace still gets a little ambience from the street below plus a great view over the rooftops A handy and relaxing place to chill for half an hour or more particularly with the honesty bar being available 
316469,Hotel Casa Camper,No Negative, Great breakfast and nice to have some sandwiches etc during the day if you need Nice view from the roofterrace Very good location Greta restaurant Palillon next door

316474,Hotel Casa Camper, We didn t utilize the mini salon , Loved the honesty bar on the roof and billiards bar on the ground floor Great shower Breakfast was superb and staff great 
316475,Hotel Casa Camper, I thought it was excellent They did have a rooftop honor bar that you helped yourself and wrote down what you took and your room would be charged I did think the alcohol prices were high drinks much cheaper if you went to local bars and restaraunts , This place was awesome Bed was comfortable room good size and even had extra lounge room with couch TV and hammock Food and snacks and drinks not alcohol were available for free 24 hours and hot breakfast They had umbrellas and bicycles to use if you needed them 
316476,Hotel Casa Camper, Nothing an exceptional experience for our first time in Barcelona , The staff were exceptional breakfast excellent and the terrace was great to come back too and relax after a long day night There is a honesty bar which was good Wine spirits you paid for snacks were free The bedroom was a good size shower excellent Across the hall was a lounge room which you could relax in watch telly read a book sleep in a hammock this was part of your room for only you to enjoy Clara Mie gave me a restaurant for the last 3 nights of our stay booked them for us and a truly unforgettable experience in all My wife s birthday was at 1881 the top floor of Museu d Historia de Catalunya The view over the port is fabulous 
316477,Hotel Casa Camper, Liked everything , Design of room as well as extremely helpful staff who obviously enjoy their job room efficient not cluttered great natural light privacy even at night as no need to pull shades also separate room across hall with couch hammock for relaxing if other person wants to sleep Breakfast was prepared presented with same attention personalization as other services Didn t use exercise room as enough exercise walking riding bikes available at hotel Highly recommend for those who also value above amenities

316487,Hotel Casa Camper, The only downside was I requested a king size bed what I got was two twin size beds next to each other , The staff was absolutely incredible they were knowledgeable very helpful and super pleasant I ve stayed in many hotels this staff is the best by far 
316488,Hotel Casa Camper, I only wish I had had more time to enjoy my stay , I called ahead and asked about parking I was directed to a lot very close to the hotel which I found easily But my GPS was having trouble giving me walking directions from there I called again and the gentleman who answered went outside found me several blocks away and escorted me back to the hotel Now that s service It was late and I really appreciated the complimentary food and drink in the lobby The room layout with its separate living space is one of my favorite features Great people watching from the French doors to the street below and yet the bedroom is quiet and private Lovely rooftop bar too 
316489,Hotel Casa Camper, None, Wr have stayed in both properties and we love both locations as well as our overall experience The property is quite innovative in catering to its customers experience Wish they open more hotels

316492,Hotel Casa Camper, Nothing to complain about If I was being really picky the aircon is maybe a little too noisy but that is a very very small issue amongst all the other excellent facilities and service , Every single one of the staff were extremely helpful and friendly without being obtrusive The room itself with the lounge across the corridor and the roof terrace were all fantastic The all day snack facility was also very good 
316493,Hotel Casa Camper, A bit inconvenient for a business stay No room service Had to pick up a coffee each morning and take it up to the room Since hot items are on request freshness being an advantage here not ideal for a quick brekkie before heading out for meetings But the hot food was worth the few minutes of wait The lobby felt a bit rudimentary and dark , super friendly and helpful staff truly warm and kind EXCELLENT location for my work but also super convenient for a bit of added tourism and shopping if you had the time A very unique concept though would recommend it more for leisure tourism than for a business trip The all day self service cafe was a great concept The honesty bar is such a great idea and nice views from there too 
316494,Hotel Casa Camper,No Negative, There was not one thing to dislike in this awesome hotel The staff the breakfast and the room were everything we expected and more T The location was great If you can snag a room here you will be glad you stayed 
316495,Hotel Casa Camper, The only negative I could say would be maybe a little more shelf space for storage but I am really nit picking We were extremely happy with this property , The staff were all so nice friendly and extremely efficient The room was perfect Nice size Comfortable bed Great shower Lots of nice fluffy towels Air conditioning 
316496,Hotel Casa Camper, Rooms were a little too dark We prefer more sunlight, Very chic boutique hotel Excellent location and very welcoming helpful staff Always ready to help out snacks in lobby a major plus

316502,Hotel Casa Camper, Stay too short , The staff make you feel welcome all the time not just on arrival The best introduction to facilities available was given to me on arrival Very comfy bed and amazing pillows Food and drink availability set up is great IMHO raises the bar forgive the expression for other hotels Extra room for blobbing out private lounge opposite bedroom a plus and also has a Hammock Ideally situated centrally in this extremely cultural historic and relaxed city What is not to like By the way posts I read about taxi drivers charging above rate fares proved to be incorrect 
316503,Hotel Casa Camper, The colour of the walls which is deep red makes the room seem smaller when it is actually decent sized Also it makes the room feel darker , The hotel stands out because of the uniquely helpful staff They don t leave any stone unturned to make the stay comfortable No trouble is too much Special mention of Francesco and Caramie I hope m getting the spellings right Would definitely want to go back and stay there 
316504,Hotel Casa Camper, We loved everything , Everything was beyond perfect the service the food the free wifi the clean the silence It seemed like we are the only guests The crew was super nice and helpful That s the top we could ever ask for in a vacation We stronghly recommend

316516,Hotel Casa Camper, Having the bedroom and sitting room areas separated is a bit weird , Very friendly and helpful staff Great location Very good breakfast and snack service Rooftop deck is fabulous 
316517,Hotel Casa Camper, There is nothing we did not like , Loved the staff the accommodations the location and the breakfast as well as snacks all day Would recommend d to anyone traveling to Barcelona Would book again

316532,Hotel Casa Camper,No Negative, We liked the availability of food and beverages all day In addition the staff made us feel like family They were sincere and extremely helpful For us we preferred a regular room which was quite large rather than the bedroom sitting room option The hotel was very clean and well situated We would return in a heartbeat 
316533,Hotel Casa Camper, Nothing , This was our favourite hotel in Spain Firstly the service was exceptional The front desk staff bent over backwards to help in any way The room was spotlessly clean chic and well appointed We enjoyed the separate room with the hammock couch and balcony We saw the value in the separate room in that the bedroom was very quiet yet you could enjoy the street scene from the bonus room The all day evening tapas was excellent as was the made to order breakfast The rooftop terrace was a beautiful relaxing spot in a busy city The location was perfect a very short walk to Las Ramblas We would definitely stay there again We had read the reviews and were not disappointed It is a modern chic boutique style hotel 
316534,Hotel Casa Camper, Not a thing , The people were all warm friendly and helpful The rooftop terrace with a view of the city and an honor bar was a standout attraction Rooms were great as well 
316535,Hotel Casa Camper, The lounge area is separated from the actual bedroom and had to leave the room to access the sitting area I am not complaining about this extra area because it was very nice and very cute with a hammock and a window overseeing the street but it was not convenient having to get fully dressed to get out of the room just to sit and watch TV, The hotel is conveniently located a few blocks away from La Rambla and plaza Cataluya The staff was always ready to help and guided us to a few of our destinations The honesty bar I found to be a great addition to the all day open snack bar

316541,Hotel Casa Camper, Not all can drivers willing to drive down Carrer D Elisabets Wish there was a toaster or microwave to heat up the snacks in the kitchen, The entire decor and room set up was cool modern and spacious The kitchen access to snacks made it very convenient The staff anticipated out arrival and sent our stored luggage ahead to our room before we arrived
