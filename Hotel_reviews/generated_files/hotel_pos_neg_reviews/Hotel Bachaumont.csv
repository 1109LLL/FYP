77829,Hotel Bachaumont, Disclaimer I am a sensitive sleeper we were on a lower floor where I felt the vibrations of the subway even though it was not too bad they weren t able to switch the rooms , Location is in a very lively neighborhood with restaurants and charming boutiques immediately to left and right when you step out Convenient location walkable distance to Louvre Saint Honore and department stores The hotel design is beautiful modern and clean room decently sized 
77830,Hotel Bachaumont, We had come to the hotel previously and had an incredible stay This time however we were incredibly disappointed with the unprofessionalism of the front desk staff We were told our room would be ready by the check in time but were left waiting over an hour and a half past the check in time The staff was hardly apologetic and didn t even seem to care about their blatant breakdown in communication This hotel was always our go to place when we visited Paris but from now on we will take our business elsewhere ,No Positive
77831,Hotel Bachaumont, the room was a bit small in my opinion The bed fills most of it , great location very friendly and helpful staff room very clean and with good atmosphere 
77832,Hotel Bachaumont, The breakfast buffet is too expensive at 25 Euros And the rooms are pretty small Other than that everything was very nice , The staff was exceptionally friendly 
77833,Hotel Bachaumont, Can t think of anything negative Did not eat here so can t comment on that , New modern hotel in excellent location Stayed in superior room which was a fine size by Paris standards D cor was beautiful hotel was very clean staff were very welcoming location was quiet beds were very comfortable bathroom was lovely All in all a very enjoyable stay and I would definitely stay here again 
77834,Hotel Bachaumont, Our room faced the street with a small Juliette balcony Picturesque but the street noise and restaurant noise kept us up most of the night Get an INSIDE room if you value sleep There is no lobby to wait in only a bar that is closed until evening a restaurant that closes in between meals and a hall with a tiny alcove I thought breakfast was included with the booking but they said no Not a problem as there are beautiful pastries at the end of the street , Chic Nice bathroom with a large shower Very polite and helpful staff A wonderful restaurant loaded street is at the end of the street Monteguell 
77835,Hotel Bachaumont, Rooms are a little small Not much free anything other than water I think No chocolates or fruit for 450 Euros a night there should be a few extras frills , Staff were hip sharp and responsive 
77836,Hotel Bachaumont, Staff are okay didn t really offer much more then your check in check out experience which makes it hard when you don t speak the language as you don t feel they will give much however the staff in the reasturant and bar are incredible and the breakfast and food is amazing , Stunning Parisian Hotel Loved the rooms view of the courtyard is beautiful Location is perfect straight outside your surrounded by cafe s reasturants deli s and more If your looking for a Parisian experience this is the one 
77837,Hotel Bachaumont, Staff were a bit too cool to provide good service especially during breakfast one day they were more interested in talking to their friends than attending to customers , Clean and stylish
77838,Hotel Bachaumont, Although friendly and welcoming staff seemed quite inexperienced and gave a vague impression At an upscale place like this you d express staff to make you feel at ease , Beautiful design at a great location A great restaurant both for breakfast and dinner 
77839,Hotel Bachaumont, Breakfast was limited choice and the hot scrambled eggs presented in a cooper pot were lovely looking but always luke warm, The hotel is immaculate nice and quiet location beds are incredibly comfortable and the cocktail bar was great With a friendly accomadating bar man
77840,Hotel Bachaumont, Breakfast is the only weak aspect to my mind Don t recommend to buy it , Excellent hotel very modern and sophisticated The rooms are fabulous however we had a lot of luggage so would appreciate more space The street is quiet but very vibrant at the same time if you turn around the corner with multiple shops and restaurants 
77841,Hotel Bachaumont, The wifi isn t great but that s honestly the only complaint , The staff are excellent as are the rooms and the food And you can t beat the location if you want to live more like a local 
77842,Hotel Bachaumont, I ve expected better food for the price We ve asked to clean the room because of a broken glass but it was not done when we came back in the night , I liked the decoration the bed quality and the suite Very good cocktail Free water cookies tea and coffee 
77843,Hotel Bachaumont, Housekeeping was appalling Amenities were not replaced on a daily basis The room was not ready and we only manage to check in past 3 30pm and this is after insisting on going into the room We had to hang around at the lobby and we would have felt better had we been offered a cup of tea or water while waiting , I enjoyed staying at the location 
77844,Hotel Bachaumont,No Negative, The hotel rooms are stylish and modern as is the rest of the establishment The beds are SUPER comfortable too There is an excellent restaurant and bar and the staff are really friendly 
77845,Hotel Bachaumont,No Negative, A travel journalist friend recommended this property and she nailed it amazing location and a great restaurant and we will be stay there the next time we are in Paris 
77846,Hotel Bachaumont, The rooms were very small and there was hardly space to put your clothes and using the wardrobe resulted in not being able to close the doors Also the rooms at the front are terribly noisy and when you have a room downstairs you can feel the vibration of the Metro and hear the noise , We liked the staff the food and location of the hotel 
77847,Hotel Bachaumont, The scrambled eggs could have been warmer , Excellent location friendly staff tasteful decor cosy rooms and great coffee Really liked the shampoo brand too 
77848,Hotel Bachaumont, The hotel is based in a very vibrant part of Paris and is therefore noisy at night The windows do an excellent job of shutting the noise out however our room was very hot and stuffy because of having to close them , Right in the heart of the city Couldn t be better and the bed was soooo comfy following a days sightseeing 
77849,Hotel Bachaumont,No Negative, Very charming hotel with really excellent restaurant where we had a delicious meal in the evening Breakfast was well worth the money Would definitely like to stay there again

77852,Hotel Bachaumont, There really wasn t anything we didn t like about this hotel It was perfect , The staff was extremely nice and helpful The breakfast was very good and the rooms were clean They helped us to make dinner reservations and called cabs for us when necessary The room we were in had several nice balconies which we were able to sit at and have a drink after a day of sight seeing The rooms were extremely sound proof we could not hear street noise or the neighbors which is unusual in Paris where the street noise can often be unbearable at night

77872,Hotel Bachaumont, Rooms and bathroom rather small No window no ventilation in the bathroom maybe my mistake but I assumed breakfast was included in the standard price which I was wrong , Perfect location 
77873,Hotel Bachaumont, This is a 4 star hotel yet the cost of wifi access is on top of the cost of the room rate Rooms are small as are most in Paris but we expected 4 star to be slightly larger The bathroom is roomy though , Well positioned location very popular bar and restaurant usable gym space friendly staff

77878,Hotel Bachaumont, We were on a low floor so noise and cigarette smoke filtered up from the bar But hey that s Paris , Great location for walking around Paris or catching the Metro And the restaurants and market on Rue Montorgueil are right around the corner we could have eaten there every day 
77879,Hotel Bachaumont, My room was street side and sometimes a bit noisy Still loved that room location though There are also rooms that are quieter overlooking a courtyard , This hotel was located in a nice neighborhood within walking distance to several major Paris attractions I liked being able to capture pieces of typical Paris life from my hotel window 
77880,Hotel Bachaumont, The free internet was only in the lobby If you want it in your room it s 10 euros more per day , This was the best of the four various hotels we used while in France Very comfortable clean and the location is fabulous We even had a small but adorable little terrace with 2 seats
