474226,Hotel Marconi, All good but very traditional decor , Marconi is an easy walk easy to find from the central station where we arrived from Malpensa Airport by bus Our rental car when we moved on was again an easy walk two blocks away Hertz supplied the great little Toyota which was booked through rentalcars com brilliant
474227,Hotel Marconi, Slow elevator which can be stopped on every floor and living on 5th makes some inconvinience, Classic interior with a very good bathroom Smarttv with YouTube Broad lobby 
474228,Hotel Marconi, The breakfast isn t as fabulous as it is written in other reviews It was very crowded on Sunday morning and all the tables were full so we even did t bother with it On the other day we came to have a breakfast a bit later but during breakfast serving time and almost all the food was already gone , The location is very good Big room with good air conditioning 
474229,Hotel Marconi, Short stay , The breakfast was amazing with eggs ham yogurt pastries and fruit There was anything you would want to eat The nearby restaurants and hotel were well managed The hotel representatives were helpful when recommending places to go They all has a good sense of humor I would recommend this hotel for the location to public transportation It is located off on a side road which is less traveled for a quiet place to stay 
474230,Hotel Marconi, Room is very small and everything is old The quality is also very low The price is very high compare to the quality, Nothing to like this hotel This is not 4 star hotel It is rather 1 star hotel 
474231,Hotel Marconi, Perhaps include a body lotion in their toiletries set, Staff were courteous efficient helpful Room was squeaky clean Location is close to Central station and Repubblica Metro Excellent for transport from Malpensa Airport metro lines Lots of F B outlets including chinese restaurants I give the hotel a 10 10 
474232,Hotel Marconi, there is nothing , The room is so nice well decorated It has comfortable beds We stayed for 1 night and there was nothing that we claim about Very close to central station and subway It is worth for the money If i will come to Milano i would like to stay again 
474233,Hotel Marconi, We rented two rooms mine was fine but my parents accommodation had some problems The air conditioning wasn t working and it wasn t easy to convince the staff that it wasn t a matter of not knowing how to use it They changed rooms in the following day and provided a fan for the first one but if they believed them sooner they would probably have a room in the same day and to be fair they wouldn t have to endure the not so polite complains from my father Their second room had great AC but was turned to the street and the noise from the public transportation was heard until late hours Overall If you re a big person bathroom s douche is going to be small for you The extra blanket for winter was super itchy The tv is small and in a strange position Just one room key card per room , The location is really great next to a subway and eight minutes from the central station by foot Easy to find Twenty something from the Duomo also by foot 12min by subway and away from the crowd The room had a really nice size the bathroom as a whole was huge It was very clean Great WiFi The hotel is beautiful the flooring blew my mind It has a market in front of it and a pharmacy nearby If you don t get a room facing the street it s really quiet Check out at 12h is really great compared to the 10am of a lot of other places in italy 
474234,Hotel Marconi, There were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room , We used metered parking on the street outside while checking in then paid to have the car taken to a private garage which was a bit expensive but worth it for peace of mind as we had to leave a lot of luggage in it There is a metro station nearby and various restaurants and a well stocked mini market shop opposite Comfortable clean room and we slept well Good buffet breakfast although the tea and coffee service was a little slow 
474235,Hotel Marconi, speed of elevator are too slow, I prefer that location and some good restaurant around this location also near by central station to almost destinations
474236,Hotel Marconi,No Negative, Perfect to visit Milan Close to the train station and 15 min walk from the center Good value for money Staff was very friendly and helped us out We could leave our luggage in the hotel the last day before going to the airport 
474237,Hotel Marconi,No Negative, The room overlooked the lake and we had wonderful weather Our stay at Hotel Pallanza was made special by the staff who were very friendly and helpful 
474238,Hotel Marconi, Nothing , We stayed in room 302 and it was quite big and comfortable The room was very clean and the bathroom decently big The red marble floor in the bathroom was gorgeous I was a bit worried after reading some of the earlier reviews but honestly I couldn t find anything that bad about the property Also the property is very close to Centrale and Republica stations Walk to duomo will take about 25 min it s a pleasant walk though 
474239,Hotel Marconi, no parking costs 28 euro per night no facilities room is tight for family, special thanks to the staff of the restaurant serving breakfast very much kind and helpfull this had made the breakfast better location good close to restaurants and Centrak Station 
474240,Hotel Marconi, The shower kept switching from scalding hot to cool water couldn t adjust to one temp The breakfast bread was just white bread rolls But the rest of breakfast was quite good , Elegantly appointed hotel yet very comfortable Wifi worked great Super location near train station yet quiet 
474241,Hotel Marconi, The restaurant for breakfast is too small I stayed two nights but I always had to wait for the table There are only 10 12 table The second day I couldn t have a breakfast because it took long time to get a table The menu is not very good , The Location is good close to Milano Central Station and Subway A supermarket is in front of hotel 
474242,Hotel Marconi, Limited seating in the restaurant at breakfast , I believe the best way to explore any city is to walk the location of this hotel is great as it is within walking distance to most tourist sites Wifi connectivity is good Great deco at the lobby and the room Buffet breakfast is a bonus with a decent selection pastries yogurt fruits Good water pressure in the shower 
474243,Hotel Marconi, Some noise due to renovations , The female bar person was exceptional serving us Sofia in the breakfast room was also wonderful I liked the decor of the lobby Close to Milan Central Station 
474244,Hotel Marconi, Everything was good It was one of the loveliest stay in Milan , Beds were amazing bed spreads gave a royal feel to the room Toiletries were good too included many stuff It was an awesome stay there 
474245,Hotel Marconi, The shower because it was very difficult to keep the water warm either it was too hot or too cold The size of the bedroom could be better specially when we compare with the photos , It was very clean and the bed was very comfortable

474247,Hotel Marconi, Although it wasn t a problem for us the location might be a little less convenient for those who are not 100 fit and mobile it s a 15 minute walk from the Central Station and a 5 10 minute walk to the nearest Metro station which has lots of steps Although a tram runs past the front door the routes don t go directly to the city centre Having said that the M3 Metro from Piazza Repubblica once you ve got there whisks you to the middle of Milan in a few minutes , A really nice traditional hotel with elegant public areas and spacious bedrooms Very friendly and helpful staff and modest prices for a big city hotel 
474248,Hotel Marconi, Asked for extra pillows which weren t there on arrival Breakfast was average at best with not many choices for example bread had only small rolls Sent an email asking with walking directions from the train station which they never replied to Construction going on which started at 8 am but for construction wasn t too bad , Location was good close to the Milano Centrale train station Across from the hotel was a supermarket I decent location to walk or take public transportation to the Center of town and close to a new shopping complex 
474249,Hotel Marconi, Noise caused by tram and lifts Reception full of lazy idiots Easter passion play in many ways not only bloody whip movie on lounge but also they let an young boy to terror his mother and visit behind reception desk Maybe he was owner of the place or just inspired by tv spectacle , Breakfast was ok
474250,Hotel Marconi, In 10 days we stayed there twice First time we got a room with a really hard bed The second time one was fine There is no tea maker in a room , 10 mins walking from Milano Centrale easy to find 30 mins walking from the city center Quiet area but in 5 mins on foot you can find many places to eat Professional staff Nice and convinient hotel and rooms Nice breakfast with boiled and hot scrambled eggs We would stay there again 
474251,Hotel Marconi, We have booked a triple room but were given a double room with an extra bed which could hardly be called a bed While listening to my complaint the receptionist shrugged his shoulders and said he could do nothing , Breakfast and the staff in the breakfast area was excellent
474252,Hotel Marconi, Kettle could have been provided in the room Water in the shower keeps fluctuating between cold to warm , Location is close to the Milano Central Station and the Repubblica metro station Super market is across the street Front desk Staff provided the local tourist information The ladies serving the breakfast were very professional and friendly it is also very close to the Gardini Publicci my kids enjoyed visiting it daily during our stay 
474253,Hotel Marconi, Very very bad beds oldschool bed matrass and blankets and pillow Sleeping very bad Extra charges on several things which you thought are included Very slow internet No airco so very hot rooms as well Please find a better hotel Because there are , Breakfast was ok Bathroom very good fast and good warm water Hotel looks fancy and the location is very good and easy to reach by public transport
474254,Hotel Marconi, If you come late at night the door is closed and you have to wait until the security opens it , Location was perfect for me just walking distance from Central station 2 stops from Duomo Breakfast was amazing Staff was very friendly Definitely recommended 
474255,Hotel Marconi, The decor is old and tacky , Hotel walking distance to main train station and Isola Good breakfast with plenty to choose from feel free to ask for a fresh orange juice to the service Strong WiFi I could use it freely over three devices 
474256,Hotel Marconi, We traveled with 2 year old baby and got room with window towards main road and it was very noisy window was no soundproof so tram voice and other vehicles voice coming most of the night early morning and baby could not sleep so it was not good for all of us , Location breakfast and room was very clean
474257,Hotel Marconi, very very thin walls you can hear everything from neighbors The water at the shower is fluctuating from cold to warm depends on the position of your hand , Excellent location very closed to Central Station which is very important because as tourist not much to do in Milan but very nice places around to be visited i e Como The bad sheets were changed daily very very clean in the room warm enough space excellent breakfast excellent cappuccino and very nice ladies serving the breakfast 
474258,Hotel Marconi, The staff could have been a bit more proactive letting us know if the rooms were ready as we arrived earlier and waiting in the lobby A bit noisy in the night if you are facing the street , nice clean and comfortable hotel very close to public transport helpful staff and good breakfast 
474259,Hotel Marconi, nothing basicly , I enjoyed my stay here I was in Milan to watch Ac Milan an Napoli game and the hotel was in a great location only 25 minutes away from San Siro stadium by train Staff are helpful and facilities are in a good condition I liked that they lock the front door late at night for the guests safety 
474260,Hotel Marconi, The hot food at breakfast ran out quickly , Great location walking distance to trains and easy to get around to Milan s sights Good breakfast nice variety and selection Nicely sized rooms staff accommodated our request for adjoining rooms and early check in 
474261,Hotel Marconi, Some of the receptionist is not so good in English and do not know too much about the nearest shops markets Very thin walls you can hear your neighbours talking Repairs in the hotel were very noisy and started very early every morning Only cheap plastic tumblers to drink no glass AC didn t work and it was very cold at nights in the room and no quilt just a blanket wrapped in a sheet Temperature of the water is not constant City tax 5 EUR per person is not included into Booking reservation You have to pay it on check out , The hotel is very close to Centrale and also to the city centre Good public transport accessibility Reception staff were friendly and helpful Good internet wireless connection Youtube channel on the tv Great breakfast We needed to leave early 5 AM so we asked about a breakfast package and we got it it was very poor 
474262,Hotel Marconi, It was a bit cold in the room without a blanket that warmed , The location was really good Close to the metro and walking distance to downtown One could not complain about the breakfast either 
474263,Hotel Marconi, I needed to leave early before 7 o clock It turned out that it was absolutely not possible to have any kind of brakefest before 7 AM neither to have a coffee There was even no basic facilities in the room to prepare instant coffee Second thing no iron and ironing boadr at disposal Generally facilities disappointing as forn 4 stars, Good location close to the central station
474264,Hotel Marconi, Breakfast restaurant was a bit cramped and gets really crowded after 9 am More choice for breakfast would have been nice , Room was very spacious Good access to 2 metro stations Had great coffee during breakfast
474265,Hotel Marconi, Nothing The hotel was great, The staff was very helpful Really nice guys Couldn t stay for breakfast as there was an impending rail strike and I had a flight out the next morning
474266,Hotel Marconi, WiFi is not as perfect as stated in the comments Use the hotspot of TV in the room not the general one It is faster and has better signal You are not informed by the staff about the existence of it at first Open your TV and use the password on top right position , Very close to main train station Centrale so easy access from to airport Very close to metro station Repubblica so easy access to Duomo etc Good restaurants around the hotel No noise in the room very good for sleeping Good breakfast

474268,Hotel Marconi, Beds were uncomfortable and rooms cramped for the price a c already turned off for the season although rooms were very warm, Breakfast was delicious with excellent caffe and croissants The staff were very professional and accommodating
474269,Hotel Marconi, Directions to hotel not very good our fault we walked parallel street and went to far along Had to back track , The gentlemen at the front desk were very helpful and wonderful I wanted to leave my suitcase for a few days and they were more than obliging And they helped my Mother when she arrived Great breakfast So many things to choose from 
474270,Hotel Marconi, The trains cable cars going by at night was somewhat loud but it s good they have public transportation The rooms were small but I expected that , the bed was nice staff were decent and helpful I did not get the chance to have any breakfast because I had to leave early to catch my flight 
474271,Hotel Marconi, The member of staff on at night was reluctant to help asking for some tea seemed to be a whole world of trouble Other than that this would have been a score of 10 We did get our tea but it was served under sufferance , Most Staff were very helpful Location was great only a 30 min walk right into the center of Milan Very quiet at night and if you can request the top floor you get some great views as you wait on the lift Desk staff on the day shift recommend IL Tavoli restaurant Take them up on it it s excellent

474274,Hotel Marconi, Reception staff unfriendly felt unwelcome and unimportant Had to ask for things missing in room such as extra pillows and glasses for water , The clean sheets daily The decor in the lounge reception 
474275,Hotel Marconi, Did not find the staff very friendly Would have preferred that it was closer to the center of the town , The breakfast was good and the hotel was close to where our friends live We also enjoyed the restaurant next door The room was a little too snug for three people

474282,Hotel Marconi, Front desk staff not friendly Continental breakfast not much variety compared to other 4 hotels in Milan but shout out to the breakfast staff very cheerful and efficient Missing some 4 room amenities we expected such as a kettle and iron , Great location convenient for the city center and Centrale train station Excellent triple room ask for the corner room on the first floor with lots of space and sunlight A C works well important in July 
474283,Hotel Marconi, I did not get a reply from my message when I booked and this was annoying at first Once sorted and understood staff were happy to help us out with our request Info given to us about train times and platforms and how to get tickets is not current so really put pressure on us when we went to the station and we had to work out how to get our tickets and then were to catch the train Hotel needs to update this if they are going to give this info out to travellers , Really liked this accommodation Easy access to the train station and you could walk int the centre Room was very comfortable and spacious and breakfast adequate Staff were really helpful 
474284,Hotel Marconi, The staff of management and reception is absolutely rude ineffective and disorganized liar and unsympathetic Hotel is not in city center but near metro Breakfast is very poor Building is old Rooms are not clean enough It was totally Waste time and money BE CAREFUL , Wifi 
474285,Hotel Marconi,No Negative, The property was clean comfortable and convenient to the central station The air conditioning worked well as did the wifi The staff was very nice as well I would definitely stay here again

474287,Hotel Marconi,No Negative, Great location just a few blocks from Milano Centrale train station and a block and a half from Metro subway stop Didn t want to stay at a big chain hotel Beautiful Church right down the block with daily Mass and Ave Maria bells Enough English spoken to make transaction easy and excellent customer service from breakfast staff Incredible substantial fresh daily breakfast buffet Kept us going in lieu of lunch Great little market across the street for fresh groceries and prepared take out foods or little things you might need Very good ambience and pleased with roomy bathroom Wi Fi worked fine and air conditioning worked perfectly as it was record heat during the week in late June we visited Excellent value for price and we would recommend to others and would stay here again

474290,Hotel Marconi, The wi fi was not working until we had to leave , Perfect location close to the central station and to metro station Friendly stuff speaking English Clean and comfortable room 
474291,Hotel Marconi, Shower wasn t working properly No cooked food available when went to breakfast 30 mins before the end of serving Air conditioning wasn t brilliant, Good location Wifi good
474292,Hotel Marconi, A common denominator with all the other Italian hotels is the limited service of coffee in an open buffet breakfast Coffee has to be served more liberally and asking for the favor of a waiter for coffee was not good in a four star hotel , This hotel is conveniently located between the Central Train Station and Piazza Duomo Tram passing by connects Central Station with Porta Genoa Navigli District 
474293,Hotel Marconi, The locks on the doors seem old and sometimes it can be difficult to close the bathroom door or the room door , The breakfast is great and room is clean The price is reasonable
474294,Hotel Marconi, The recepcionist aka the girl with curly hair in the front desk She was very disrespectful i do not recommend this hotel because of her and her nasty attitude Very poor , Croissants were extra flaky

474298,Hotel Marconi, If only visiting Milan maybe stay nearer in but 4 5 euro daily ticket means not a problem, Great location for train stations airport links to lakes even Verona Venice Right on tram line to centre good breakfast
474299,Hotel Marconi, While this hotel is very convenient for those using the nearby train and metro stations its business district location is not ideal for weekend stays Restaurant options in the immediate vicinity are limited , We were placed on the top floor with a balcony overlooking the street which we enjoyed The room was bright and clean with room darkening curtains which ensured a good night s sleep Beautiful marble bathroom Breakfast was more than adequate 
474300,Hotel Marconi, 1 Breakfast buffet a Food that should be kept cooled is not being kept cool Hotel perhaps needs to review its HACCP food management controls b Safety issues The location of the buffet at the entrance to the breakfast room is completely impractical and its layout is rather cramped Being located at the entrance to the room actually impedes guests access to and from the room safety issue fire issue practical issue This results in hotel guests bumping into one another at breakfast time or being unable to pass one another to access the breakfast fare It is easy to knock over items accidentally too because everything is tightly packed into a relatively small space Some items such as fruit juice glasses are placed well out of reach of shorter hotel guests The room is split level and you could just miss seeing the steps that lead down into the main area of tables and fall down safety issue c The stainless steel scrambled egg container contained a huge congealed mass of egg resembling a gigantic omelette very unappetising No one seems to come and stir it up and make it look like proper scrambled eggs d Breakfast staff perfunctory No one greets you with a good morning 2 Room a Needs upgrading Change the heavy sheets for lighter duvets b Beds are too low for older guests they need to be higher c Black fungal growth mould in bathroom around shower shower doors and where shower unit is attached to floor unsightly unhygienic The white sealant in bathroom needs spraying and or replacing d Shower units have clearly reached the end of their economic life e Height of room toilets is too low typical of Italian hotels 3 Hotel facilities No lunch dinner or spa facilities No pool Business centre some equipment was out of order All this seems rather unusual for a hotel claiming to have a 4 star rating 4 Bar No price list of drinks displayed in bar area 5 , 1 Reception staff were friendly helpful and professional 2 The hotel had the necessary paperwork which I could sign refusing to pay the city s tourist tax 3 Barman available for evening drinks in the lounge area of hotel on ground floor 4 Hotel is only 1 km from Milan Central Station and can be reached by Trams 5 9 or you could walk there 
474301,Hotel Marconi, Nothing at all, The location was excellant Easy access to the Metro and walking distance to Central Station Supermarket just accross the street Nice quiet neighborhood Fantastic seafood restaurant few doors away called Limone and another on the street behind called Trattoria il Paiolo Very fresh and tasty seafood
474302,Hotel Marconi, Avoid this hotel I wish I had I cannot believe this joint claims 4 stars 2 would be closer the mark on a good day At first it looks good has been refurbished but its a front I am glad we were only here en route for 1 night otherwise I would have been looking to find an alternative Air con as we found out is only turned on with the seasons do not think you can control the comfort level for your taste as that is dictated by the front desk who when asked refused to change it and told us to open a window which we did onto a street filled with heavy traffic trams and NOISE all night I think it is appalling and downright rude not to allow guests to create their own comfort level something which is falsely advertised as being offered on their web site The bathrooms are poor there is one difficult to use hand held shower situated half way down the wall so ladies if like my wife you have long hair expect a struggle No peep hole in the room door for security something to consider breakfast was ok but they will not open the door until exactly 07 00 hrs so if like us you are on the move do not expect to have a breakfast Most hotels offer breakfast for early travellers at 6 00hrs or at least 6 30hrs We spoke to another guest who like us was a 1 night stay and he was not one bit happy One female staff member on the desk was ok but she is outnumbered by others who are little better than rude and indifferent the beds were so so but on wheels which on a wooden floor move from the wall on the whole one very long uncomfortable night prior to an 8 hour train ride booking com should remove them from the website save others the hassle We have travelled a lot over the years and this place would be in the top spot for failed expectations, In proximity to Central station
474303,Hotel Marconi, No tea making facilities in the room Noise travels easily through the walls , Close to train station and walking distance to Milan Cathedral and great shopping A great breakfast spread Continental and eggs and bacon 
474304,Hotel Marconi, Room was quite late being made up , Friendly helpful staff We arrived early but were able to check in Good location near the central station About a 40 min walk into the city centre but near the metro so not a problem 
474305,Hotel Marconi, Bit disappointing there was no coffee tea making facilities in room, Hard to judge We stayed overnight on way to airport Staff were very helpful in organising us Transport to Hotel 
474306,Hotel Marconi, Could use face cloths in the bathroom and perhaps a different smelling cleaner for the room There was some kind of unusual scent in the room and bath when we entered that was too strong like it was used heavily to cover up another smell Also as it was end of April beginning of May it would have been nice to see real plants in the lobby instead of the plastic greenery and the worn out poinsettias from Christmas Window to balcony was cracked quite a long break and should be fixed in case someone closes the window too hard , Breakfast selection was great with fresh fruit and eggs in addition to standard pastries Good coffee and service from wait staff Desk staff were helpful with directions and information Room colors tile colors were nice Good linens on bed and nice towels Close to the subway and several restaurants 
474307,Hotel Marconi, Our room especially the bathroom required a degree of upgrading No tea or coffee making facilities , It was close to the station and convenient for walking to the centre of Milan Wifi was good Breakfast was good 
474308,Hotel Marconi, The tram line is next to the hotel The trams running in the early hours of the morning are noisy and may wake you up, Good location close to train station 
474309,Hotel Marconi, AC didnt work and it was very cold at nights I stayed 6 nights and all the time it was cold in the room The bed was not very soft and comfortable , The breakfast was good and location was close to Centrale and my working place Staff was good especially the young guy at the reception was brilliant 
474310,Hotel Marconi,No Negative, Nice hotel with nice atmosphere Very kind staff good breakfast The room was clean and quiet with nice view Good location close to the central station metro station Republica is 3 minutes walk Definetly will stay here again 
474311,Hotel Marconi, Nothing, Accomodating hotel very clean and with nice furniture the room was lovely and gave off a luxurious air with marble in bathroom and the gold colour of the furniture Breakfast was also quite rich and rich a variety of sweet and salty choices as well as espresso and cappuccino Quite close to Milan central station and to metro stations that proved quite handy for excursions outside Milan All in all a great place to stay in Milan Highly recommended 
474312,Hotel Marconi, There wasn t room service at night the room decoration and furniture was a bit old fashioned we had to discover how to use the phone because there was no explanation or number list It would ve been good to know that there s a church nearby that starts to ring bells early in the morning , The breakfast and kindness of the personal 
474313,Hotel Marconi, have the pool hour open earlier and stay open later did not get to use it with the schedule they have in place, WOW everything Fantastic breakfast buffet great room great service great help with everything and any thing 
474314,Hotel Marconi, Nothing I can think of , The room was clean nice and comfortable The breakfast was very good The location is near the central station so it was convenient to arrive and to move around with the subway The hotel staff was kind I would go there again 
474315,Hotel Marconi, Small rooms Very thin walls you can hear your neighbours talking, Convenient location neat the train station Relatively quiet place Friendly staff
474316,Hotel Marconi, Not appreciated that we had to pay 10 euro a night as tourist tax Should have been included in the price when booking An unpleasant surprise, Close to railway station
474317,Hotel Marconi, the lady in the breakfast room could smile time to time , hotel is very close to the Stazione Centrale very nice and helpful personal at the reception quite and clean room everything was ok
474318,Hotel Marconi, Main problem is that the area has a lack of small restaurants and shops There are expensive bars and restaurants and very wide streets so for this reason we think it would suit the business visitor better than the leisure traveller , Location was very convenient to central station Room was very nice and staff cordial General cleanliness was good and we very much enjoyed the breakfast 
474319,Hotel Marconi, Insufficient soundproofing A lot of noise all night long from the adjacent and upper rooms voices moving furniture and from the tram down the street ask a room away from the street , Good location 5 walk to Stazione Centrale or metro in Piazza Repubblica 30 walk to centre Duomo or 15 with metro Clean room nice bathroom Bed is OK but bed linen should be renewed Breakfast is OK but not exceptionnal 
474320,Hotel Marconi, The bar was quite and didn t seem to be used much by guests , The hotel was a haven in a busy city It was located within easy walking distance to the train station and a number of restaurants It was easy to get to and from the sights of Milano either by term or from the train station 
474321,Hotel Marconi, The pillows were so flat and it wasn t the most comfortable bed Tough night of sleep unfortunately , Not far from the train station good staff good breakfast spread attractive room
474322,Hotel Marconi, Noiseproff is not the best, Gorgeous hotel well furnished and cozy Quite attentive stuff Satisfying breakfast The night receptionist recommended to visit local trattoria it was very useful 
474323,Hotel Marconi, I cannot find sth negative for the hotel , I was very happy with the staff Whatever and whenever i needed sth and asked for it i had a prompt assistance The staff was very polite Also very good signal to WIFI 
474324,Hotel Marconi, they gave us another room cheaper than we booked they changed only after we clearly asked for this and we insist it my girlfriend arrived before me and nobody help her to carry her luggage to the room only after she insist and they told her this is a big favour the rooms are very small ugly with old furniture there is a smell from the canalization in all our 3 rooms in our room and our friends rooms the rooms are not soundproof and it is very difficult to sleep because of the noise from the street and the other rooms the staff is not very friendly we asked them to help us with a corkscrew but they told us they cannot give one just to came to the front desk with the bottle to open it it is the first time when this happened in a 4 hotel to us the breakfast is very poor not any vegetables and just a few salami and sweets the ironing services was extremely bad we gave them 4 shirts and all of them was pressed very bad the cleaning was not very good we found a long hair in our bad and the sheets was not very clean there was no services that we are used like restaurant bar pool etc and the actually services was bad Clearly this hotel doesn t deserve 4 and the prices are too high for the services that they provided , Nothing really maybe it is close to the Central Station but we don t travel by train or by bus
474325,Hotel Marconi, It was the worst hotel among 4 stars hotels in our last stay which covered 4 hotels in different cities of Italy in total It is maximum 2 stars hotel with poor facilities , Nothing
474326,Hotel Marconi, The standard room was an inside room overlooking a small courtyard no daylight a problem when trying to wake up Room very hot in November took a day to cool it , Clean and good choice for breakfast with coffee top ups if required The bathroom had a small automatic dim light at night just enough to see where you were going without needing the full light Plenty of bedding if needed we had to remove it as it was so hot Very quiet 
474327,Hotel Marconi, The reception I call the hotel for booking and he said it was full and no available rooms I checked it through website booking and I made the booking ,No Positive
474328,Hotel Marconi, The hotel is farther from the main tourist attractions than we had thought about 20 25 minute walk However the metro is very accessible and the staff were helpful with providing guidance , The hotel was very close to the train station on a lovely tree lined street Staff were helpful and available 24 hours and breakfast was plentiful Hotel has a nice little bar and seating area Computer printer available for printing boarding passes Clean and comfortable room
