192504,Le Tsuba Hotel, Not many room options offer a view of the city , This is my second time staying the weekend at Tsuba with my partner We ve stayed at several other 4 star Parisian hotels in this price range and this is the best The staff are very welcoming and helpful The decor of the hotel is modern and very well done The rooms are a good size and the beds are incredibly comfortable The bathrooms with a tub are a good size The rooms are well furnished and about 18 20 sq m which is great for Paris The sauna hammam was amazing and clean The whole hotel is serenity an easy escape from the masses but still centrally located 
192505,Le Tsuba Hotel, If champagne for breakfast was included can be ordered complimentary at the bar as well solid 10 , New hotel located just at the Triumph arc with an exceptionally pet friendly policy 
192506,Le Tsuba Hotel, Wifi was a little slow and sometimes difficult to access , Some of the nicest hotel staff we have ever encountered Beautiful hotel quiet but well located Very comfortable beds Wonderful spa amenities Breakfast is expensive but with many choices very delicious and nicely presented worth the expense 
192507,Le Tsuba Hotel, Unexpected hotel alarm turned on in the middle of the day and waked us up through our siesta , Staff were extremely nice food was fresh and delicious and location was perfect 5 minutes walk from arc the triumph 
192508,Le Tsuba Hotel, Cheaper breakfast , The hotel was lovely the staff were very friendly and helpful The hotel reception smells great Lovely decor I would highly recommend staying here I do not have anything bad to say about this property 
192509,Le Tsuba Hotel, Room service the woke us up 2 times in the morning and wouldn t go away before opening the door and talking to them , Very nice property clean and excellent location
192510,Le Tsuba Hotel,No Negative, BEAUTIFUL new hotel near Arc de Triomphe Luxurious centrally located beautifully comfortable rooms friendly and extremely professional staff Huge breakfast buffet was good not more Great spa gym sauna hammam below I would stay here again in a second 
192511,Le Tsuba Hotel, Staff at the bar restaurant needs more practice , Nice decoration and atmosphere very welcoming and helpful staff at reception nice quiet terrace and great location hotel is new
192512,Le Tsuba Hotel, The speed of check out and the flexibility of the staff at check out I had booked for 2 people on booking com although I was only one person the check out staff insisted that I had to pay taxes for 2 people even though I was only one person The amount is dismal but just out of principle Inflexibility of the staff or of the French system , Brand new feeling Very nice light Great design and furniture Great location cute neighbourhood Great linen and towels Comfortable bed New electronics and enough plugs 
192513,Le Tsuba Hotel, Nothing The stay was great just too short , Le Tsuba was a beautiful hotel and in a great location It was very near the Arc de Triomphe and both Metro and RER transit connections The staff was incredibly friendly and they were very accommodating throughout I was supposed to be staying for 6 nights with my wife and 4 month old daughter However I had to adjust my stay at the last minute shortened from 6 nights to 2 nights due to my daughter not receiving her visa in time They let me modify even after the Booking com deadline which was greatly appreciated They were also very child friendly providing a portable crib and kid friendly bathroom soaps etc even though I didn t use them The room was bright clean and comfortable with a great bathroom Highly recommended 
192514,Le Tsuba Hotel, Overall very happy with our stay and I would definitely recommend it to others but as the hotel is new they need to still work on improving the service I m sure this will improve with time and it will become my perfect hotel for Paris , The hotel is brand new and great value for the location the size of the rooms and the hotel facilities It s extremely difficult to find such a great hotel in Paris in this price range 
192515,Le Tsuba Hotel, Breakfast is not the usual wonderful spread at upscale European hotels I don t know why they are scrimping on this , Lovely small hotel in great neighborhood with lots of restaurants Easy walk to main avenues with shops Quiet side street Helpful staff especially the welcoming front desk person Fatima Small but perfectly appointed rooms and bathrooms Nice new firm beds Large skylighted lounge 
192516,Le Tsuba Hotel, The room was very too small It did not have any space the put the luggage The room wasn t prepared for the night Absolutely no view The hotel is under staffed , The hotel was brand new and clean 
192517,Le Tsuba Hotel,No Negative, Everything is excellent Room bathroom cleaning hotel facilities breakfast very nice staff Best place in Paris close to all kinds of restaurants shops super markets and sightseeing spots Thank you 
192518,Le Tsuba Hotel, Room is not big if you have bigger luggage but it is Paris we cannot complain that , Good location and near to l Arc de triomphe de l toile Also it is convenient for you to take different metros to those famous scenic spots The female staff to do check in for us is warmhearted In the corner of the street there is a shop to offer many kinds of bread and desserts for local people We tried one time and the chocolate croissant is very delicious And there is a small restaurant opposite the hotel which can provide some simple Chinese food if you miss your country food The owner is kind and hospitable 
192519,Le Tsuba Hotel, The room was really small but it is Paris so I was expecting that , It is a new place super clean super comfy the staff was super friendly Breakfast timing was perfect their coffee was tasty The room was very clean with a big window The location was great for everything What ever your need is around you I have to say I felt like home
192520,Le Tsuba Hotel, There should be a parking place for this hotel otherwise I will deduct one star from this location , The location was great the hotel is new but the parking and the enterence is a problem
192521,Le Tsuba Hotel, The rooms were very clean but the housekeeping could be a little improved more attention to detail , The hotel is tastefully decorated and the location is excellent
192522,Le Tsuba Hotel, The breakfast was a little bit disappointing lack of choice However the croissants were still quite decent, We booked the hotel without asking for a cot in the room but the staffs were more than happy to accommodate us and fit a cot There is a spa in the hotel but unfortunately we did not have the chance to use it Would definitely come back 
192523,Le Tsuba Hotel, The check out was a bit difficult perhaps a little bit of language barrier , Great location great price has a luxurious feel too it even though fairly priced

192527,Le Tsuba Hotel, Staff is not very knowledgeable about the vicinity of the hotel e g for recommending restaurants , This is a brand new hotel tastefully decorated and with well appointed spotless rooms Great location few minutes walking to Place Charles de Gaulle Etoile and to 2 Metro stations including the important line 1 Despite the proximity to the Etoile and Champs lys es the neighborhood feels local rather than touristic Breakfast is good and the staff is very friendly 
192528,Le Tsuba Hotel, The breakfast lacks a bit of variety , We were there in April 2017 the hotel was open for only 2 months everything smells new and the staff is super nice We adored the hotel s decorations just amazing taste the colours of the finishings and the furniture is top quality The room was big for Paris standards and the bathroom very beautiful 
192529,Le Tsuba Hotel, Add a trash can to the room itself not just the bathroom , I m a hard sell but this hotel is new modern had a great breakfast and responsive staff Also enjoyed the quality linens and towels always appreciated A good size room for Paris Front desk staff Fatima was super 
192530,Le Tsuba Hotel, As with all new hotels you are bound to come up against small glitches When I pointed out one or two to the front desk clerk my remarks went unheeded Training needed in that aspect , Very courteous staff ready to help out and offer solutions The hotel is less than a month old so everything is new and shiny rooms well lit well equipped wifi signal very good hotel location very close to means of transportation and to Arc de Triomphe
