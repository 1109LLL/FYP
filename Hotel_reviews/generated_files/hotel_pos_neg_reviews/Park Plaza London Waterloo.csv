218669,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Our 2 rooms were not well lit and directly faced other rooms opposite in an open space in the middle of the hotel above the breakfast lounge Ask for rooms above 3rd floor if possible Because of high season breakfast lounge worked on overbooking so they improvised alternatives in adjacent restaurant or in a large conference room unfortunately in the alternative locations some menu items were missing and in all breakfast locations they were very slow to refill empty bowls or simply said they were out of that menu item or dish , Modern rooms Nice amenities Good location right in front of tube and 5 minutes walk from Westminster bridge London Eye Nice area lots of dining options within 1 10 minutes walk Completely safe Good breakfast choice in a rich buffet Good Wifi all over the premises 
218670,Park Plaza London Waterloo, We don t ask for clean towels There was a coupon for 10 off offered to guests who signed up The restaurant didn t know anything about the promotion And it was for one meal one day Not much incentive and not well informed , The mattress was wonderful 
218671,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Didn t like the bathroom There is a sliding door which is heavy and awkward to move and blocks out no sound I won t go in to details I would have liked some drinking water in the room , Lovely big comfortable bed Lovely complimentary toiletries Friendly staff Ate breakfast in the restaurant we didn t book ahead and it was cheaper not to Room was very quiet Close to an underground station 
218672,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Very packed a hotel so getting into a lift during peak period is a challenge We needed to wait for 5 lifts before managing to get into one there was a long queue each morning for breakfast and sometimes the food was finished when I went for breakfast But good thing is it s quickly replenished , Love the friendly staff when we checked in Room was great and clean The toilet was huge too and I like the vanity table in the toilet There are places to put your stuff so it wouldn t get wet Pillows n bedding were of great quality too which allowed a good night sleep 
218673,Park Plaza London Waterloo, More efforts on House keeping To provide rooms to customers at the given time of check in without giving ridiculous excuses and make them wait for hours , Big Clean room with all facilities Extremely good bed for a sound sleep Nice Bath rooms with all toiletries Good location and view 
218674,Park Plaza London Waterloo, the dis organised check in Long queue people passing in front of the queue employees chating in the back office while the queue for check in was getting worse , very spacious and confortable room
218675,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Same breakfast for 4 days is very bad new hotel but many things need to be fixed the light system in the room has problems, Good location by bus and tube
218676,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Would have liked a bath in the bathroom Restuarant was very poor Choice on Menu was uninspiring food presentation and quality was very poor Steak and Chips how far wrong can you go Served a thin fatty steak with luke warm chips on a plate that was too small small pot of bearnaise sauce but no vegetable garnish at all Over 50 of steak fat overall a very cheap cut of meat used , Location is excellent facilities are good Anna on Reception at Check in is excellent professional and friendly
218677,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Very poor service Very low level of maintenance No real manager on location Devastating breakfast after 0930 am Junior managers keep apologizing but not fixing stuff In 5 nights and two rooms we had to deal with unfunctional minibar unfunctional electric curtain blinking spot lilghts that freaks your mind when trying to relax or read , This could ve been a good hotel It s a shame that management spent a lot of money of good facilities but no money on maintenance and staff or it s just that all workers and personnel are just sad because they are underpaid The overall experience is just horrible not going back never 
218678,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The staff needed more training in customer service if they want to keep their star rating , Perfect location close to public transport restaurants cafes and 5 10 minute walk to the London Eye 
218679,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Room was small for a family of four Need to plan activities at hotel Even though it was non smoking it would smell like cigarette smoke in hallways , Food was good Waiters and bar staff were excellent Liked that it was non smoking Very close to lambeth station and bus stops Hotel is new and really nice inside 
218680,Park Plaza London Waterloo, I stayed for a whole week At least 3 or 4 days the room was not cleaned at 4 00 pm it was quite uncomfortable for this reason The fridge was a little bit noisy , It is a new hotel Excellent view from my room with a huge window Good bed and a sofa Clean bathroom 
218681,Park Plaza London Waterloo,No Negative, Excellent location just across the street from Lambeth north underground station Very convenient to go to central london for sight seeing We are a family of 4 so they arrange free extra beds for us Restaurant is nice good atmosphere 
218682,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The hotel was very pricey for the rooms and services they offer We called several times for sugar and other items and they say they are sending it but they never come and you have to keep calling again and again Also the rooms weren t cleaned properly every night water and tea weren t refilled properly and water bottles were charged in the minibar They provided us with some sparkling water bottles that didn t taste like water at all , The reception was big and the hotel was located at a very nice location very close to London Eye and West Minister Big Ben 
218683,Park Plaza London Waterloo, 1 Firstly I asked quiet room but I was placed at room with railway side so it was very noisy from early morning till night Then I asked to move to another room and it was much better 2 Maybe to change breakfast menu every week so those guests who are stay longer they have diversity at breakfast but breakfast is anyway good, Hotel is new location and size of room are good smart home options tea and kettle within the room everything you need during very busy business trip
218684,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Nothing that we disliked about this location , Staff was friendly and welcoming even though we checked in super late that night The hotel is BEAUTIFUL and looks brand new with very modern fixtures The bed was super comfortable and the hotel was in a great location for exploring London 
218685,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Not a grumble at all but the coffee bar didn t open until 7 00 , The whole experience was outstanding from swimming with the kids to our family meal 
218686,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Tee staff at night could not help me on charges and had to wait for finance department No one from hotel has communicated to me , Hi I was doubled charged on my credit card and when i called him i told them this They still have not replied to my emails but have charged my card as a no show yet i was there 
218687,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The Service Staff were very rude Had to ask 3 or 4 times to get am extra blanket took them 2 days to deliver it , The service was terrible The staff were rude 
218688,Park Plaza London Waterloo, What they consider a Family Studio is a bad joke I ve stayed in single rooms in Tokyo that were significantly larger Just adding a cheap sofa bed to a small room does not make it a studio suitable for families I agreed with the front desk that they would at least close and open it every day as otherwise we could barely move around the room use the desk or open the refrigerator They failed to do so EVERY single day without our going to reception to complain and then wait a further half hour People were pleasant and apologized profusely but service is horrible The restaurant is also way too small for the volume of people with waits up to 15 20 minutes to seat for breakfast even with overflow to the lounge areas I learned an important lesson about putting too much faith in online reviews which seemed mostly positive I assume those will drop quickly once more guests share their experiences , Decent wifi coverage though without any security I was only stuck in the lift once during an entire week 
218689,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Breakfast was bit insufficient compare to hotel quality but except this I think everything was perfect , Great bed I booked twin room and beds are really huge Clean toilet Fast wifi service nice staff 
218690,Park Plaza London Waterloo, For nearly 300 we would expect breakfast included full Breakfast was 21 per person, Nice quiet location in the heart of london facilities in the room were excellent a d very modern 
218691,Park Plaza London Waterloo, More food varieties could be provided on the breakfast buffet , The staff had been good and well trained Check in had been smooth and hasslefree loved the 24 7 gym facility 
218692,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Important information that is not stated anywhere till you get there If you dont have a credit card you get charged the full amount of one night on top of what you already paid when you get there which they call a deposit This is really inconvenient No hotel I have been through does that Other hotels just make extra charges on your card that you pay when you vacate the room like any other hotel They do refund the left over amount that you didnt use at the hotel but its the inconvenience and lack of being informed , Visuals of the hotel and bedrooms are amazing 
218693,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Not much to do in the close environment good Italian restaurant, Very good location 7 8 min walk from Westminster good breakfast convenient room good pool and fitness room
218694,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The room was a little dusty The room was not serviced completely The next morning beds were made but fresh towels not provided and tea cups not washed , Very good breakfasts especially the scrambled egg Very comfortable beds 
218695,Park Plaza London Waterloo,No Negative, Very good location as the tube is just opposite the hotel Walking distance to London Eyes and Big Ben etc Next to the hotel are some souvenir shops and cafes Staffs are friendly Room are clean and modern Kids friendly hotel Very satisfied with my stay 
218696,Park Plaza London Waterloo, See above , Breakfast full marks excellent Bed comfort yep tick there too Thats where it the ticks Finnish Its dark inside The reception staff are not attentive just take ur details then fob u off on to the next no info or tell even where lift is Nowt The clean room nope just a poor job too Concierge not up to much either Had a question with room service had a bl dy awful job getting it sorted No one owned up until I mentioned an area it was not theres then everyone said Nothing to do with me Then the reception staff management did not even ring me back to dress it So had to go down to do The room has a daft electric light system it has a daft bathroom too No plug so cant have a wash or shave properly That will do for now without going into more detail 
218697,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Very little, Modern fresh feel in an excellent position for walking or the tube Mishel at reception made us feel very welcome and was extremely helpful 
218698,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Lighting in corridors was awful like a nightclub No mirror for drying hair Poor lighting for doing make up in room, Close to Waterloo line for access to twickenham
218699,Park Plaza London Waterloo, There are no toilet brushes what I found a bit annoying And the light in the bathroom is quite dark so a women can t really see when she is applying her make up But this are only small things over whole the hotel is great and the staff is very friendly and helpful , It s new modern hotel with an excellent location and near tube station Lambert North Rooms are spacious clean and well decorate The breakfast buffet is also very nice and breakfast time is till 11 o clock Also check out is till 12 o clock and the hotel can storage your luggage till you re leaving 
218700,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Minor isdue T V too sophistivcated , The excellent location 100 meters from lambeth north underground and 7 minutes walk from the London eye and Big Ben A very new super modern hotel 
218701,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The staff was not very helpful and overall I had the feeling that they couldn t care less about our needs We had to ask 3 times the day we checked in to make the sofa for our daughter to sleep and only at 12 at midnight somebody came to the room to bring sheets Had to wait 1 hour to the concierge to find a package that was delivered for us nobody seemed to know where is was , Excellent location just 1 min walk from underground station Very clean Spacious room 
218702,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The blind did not work and when we asked someone to come and fix it they did not turn up We had to get the children to sleep so cancelled the call for someone to come and check however they still turned up at 10 o clock in the evening waking us up Next day even though the room said do not disturb site staff entered the room while we were swimming to fix the blind and then phoned when we were back to see if they could come and fix it Breakfast choice was good but most of the food was not kept warm enough View of train tracks going into Waterloo Not good value for money , Modern facilities and location near to city centre
218703,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Unfortunately my stay wasn t ling enough to find any faults If there were any that is , Excellent location and facilities Wish my stay had been longer
218704,Park Plaza London Waterloo, I honestly have to say there was nothing that I didn t like about the hotel , All the staff were 1st class a credit to the hotel Hotel perfectly situated for getting around all the main attractions Room was very clean Everything that was required from Iron Hairdryer T V with free Sky Fridge Safe Beds very comfortable We also had the breakfast which I have to say lovely continental to full buffet everything excellent 
218705,Park Plaza London Waterloo, When our room key stopped working we asked a maid to allow us in to get the other key Despite having the card with my name and room number on she would not and we had to then return to the reception in wet swimming gear Not major but frustrating and the poor English led to confusion , Breakfast was nice Reception were welcoming Style was cool Pool steam room and sauna were a great bonus 
218706,Park Plaza London Waterloo, No refrigerator, Air conditioner safe lovely staff clean comfortable high tech convenience of finger touch controls complete room darkening shade beautiful view of London 
218707,Park Plaza London Waterloo,No Negative, I booked this hotel to celebrate my mum s birthday and booked 3 months in advance with a very small request i e a little surprise in the room on arrival and also i booked a twin room I made my request through booking com and i reconfirmed by reservation with the hotel 2 days before and they said everything was noted and would be accomadated for on arrival the staff were friendly and the hotel entrance was impressive but when i was talking to the checking staff i was then told that the little surprise for my mum would not be ready in the room when we arrived in the room it was lovley but unfortuntley it was not the room we had booked as this was a double bed and not a twin bed so i went back down to check in and they said they would get housing keeping to sort this out The maid who came didn t understand what to do and looked extremley exhausted and tired so i helped her to split the bed and make the bed up as twin beds as i felt quite sorry for her Also the bathroom there was a sliding door you had to move to go into the toilet and shower this was extremely heavy to move i did ask the maid how to move it and she demonstated at holding one end of the door and just push very difficult especially for my mum By now i couldn t be bothered to go back downstairs and complain as this was for my mum birthday The little suprise that should of been in the room was delivered later in the day while we were in the room so the surprise was not really as i planned it I would like to say the breakfast staff were excellent especially Jennifer who was so friendly and knowing it was my mum s birthday organised something with the chef for my mum this was so sweet of her great customer service excellent memeber of staff should be awarded a Reward and Recognition for her hard work and great customer service overall the hotel was lovley the pool and sauna was clean and the gym was well equipped with up to date equipment 
218708,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Everything was fine except that I could not recognize I needed towels and free coffee every day Sometimes I get it sometimes I do not Every day was like a surprise from the hotel , The spa is really fine 
218709,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Couldn t find parking tariffs on website so had to settle with cost on arrival We were in room 1103 and the room was great however bedding was a funny material which made a lot of noise when one of us moved during the night Light above the sofa kept flickering may have been a loose connection Could have done with a couple more milk sachets for tea and coffee in the room , Good Facilities Great location very modern and friendly staff Food was good in the restaurant and reasonable prices Room technology was great having everything at your fingertips 
218710,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Within two hours of being in the hotel room the television needed to be repaired and the toilet leaked water all over the bathroom floor We were switched to a new room The new room had free chocolates and a welcome card addressed to the name of another hotel guest The ceiling lights flickered every night One of the room control panels did not work The blackout curtain had to be repaired There were a lot of dust piles under the bed The bed squeaked a lot There were long waits for the lift even though there are six lifts Daily housekeeping service was extremely inconsistent The old room did not have slippers nor robes but the new room did One day housekeeping did not restock the bathroom with toilet paper Most days housekeeping did not restock the bathroom with hand towels Another day housekeeping did not restock the tea bags sugar cups etc Another day the room wasn t cleaned until 6pm , The hotel location is great and very close to a tube station The free Wi Fi was excellent There is a large lounge area nice cafe and good restaurant on the ground floor 
218711,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Stayed in a twin studio Would have liked a small table in front of the sofa Main problem for me though as a woman was that although the hairdryer was a good one there was nowhere for me to plug it in and have a mirror in front of me A real problem as I was going to an important ceremony Had to get on my knees and use the the shiny tissue box not ideal Also where are you meant to place the ironing board , The friendliness of the staff they could not do enough to help even though it was very busy The breakfast was excellent 
218712,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Room not very large, Great Breakfast Great Position near to Westminster tube and public transportation Very comfortable bed and silent room Staff is available and efficient The internal swimming pool is very welcome after a day walking around London 
218713,Park Plaza London Waterloo, See above, Hotel is new modern clean Staff are friendly helpful nice warm people pool area nice very clean everywhere restaurant and Illy coffee good and reasonably priced problems were we rented 3 rooms and could smell remnants of cigarette smoke in one room hotel also has perfumed smell in rooms and towels we did not like and we re sensitive to
218714,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Room cleaning could be better 2 cups for 4 people as well as glasses 3 sets of towels for 4 people , Overall experience was very good Location personnel breakfast shower all on a good level Tasty coffee in the morning what is quite rare for hotels 
218715,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The room was smaller than the photos made out and I would have liked a room with a view and I did put this as a request But we didn t spend a lot of time in the room so it s wasnt a major issue The bed was comfy that was all that mattered after a long day of travelling and sight seeing , I liked that even though we couldn t check in until 2pm and we had arrived at 12 30 we were allowed to use the pool and spa facilities until our room was ready The staff were lovely and the hotel was imaculately clean We chose to walk from Kings cross to the hotel so we could take in the sights not once did we use a tube or bus or taxi Really close to London eye which we had tickets for and also not a bad walking distance from the theatre at the savoy where went to see a show Breakfast was great lovely and fresh and plenty of choice We went down at nearly 10am expecting it to be really busy with nothing left but we were seated atraight away and there was staff filling up the buffett breakfast all the time Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would deffinately book this hotel again 
218716,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Electronic lighting controls were non intuitive and error prone Could not shut off the overly bright bathroom night light without first turning on all room lights then hitting the master off switch , Clean comfortable rooms helpful friendly staff 
218717,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Parking was valet and a bit expensive at 40 a night but the car was safe , opt for the breakfast buffet in the morning food was fresh and a large variety with no wait Great way to fuel up before heading out to sight see London and a quick 7 minute walk to Big Ben Pool was super for relaxing after a day of exploring and plenty of restaurants to choose from nearby 
218718,Park Plaza London Waterloo, I don t know why the reception area and lifts were as dark as they were , The room was lovely beds very comfortable No noise Staff very friendly and helpful 
218719,Park Plaza London Waterloo, My only criticisms the giant shower was weak and the water pressure needs looking at and the TV sound quality is very poor , The room facilities are great very clean and high spec The fridge is the best hotel fridge very cold I used room service three times consistently great service well done Staff in public areas are also attentive 
218720,Park Plaza London Waterloo, We could not find any form of information on how things worked in the room and the staff gave no instructions when we were shown into the room The lighting throughout the accommodation areas especially in the room was appalling Without any information on how the control systems worked it took quite a while to work things out by trial and error The bare wooden plastic floor in the main part of the room gave a feeling of austerity rather than comfort and certainly did not help any cosy ambiance It was also noisy and we could hear people moving around in the room above When we first tried to close the blind it did not work It just made a mechanical grinding noise An engineer arrived quickly to repair it but even then it did not always work properly with one side sometimes failing to come down This required the process to be stopped reversed and re started to get the blind down Not everybody would have realised this but I saw the engineer do it The shower leaked out into the hand basin area but fortunately the bath mat absorbed most of it The sliding door that closed off either the shower area or toilet area was very heavy and not easy to move There was no door to close off the bathroom area completely a lack of privacy not enjoyed by everyone There was clearly some confusion among the staff on when rooms should be serviced On the first day it was being done when we returned from breakfast On the second day it had not been done at all when we returned to our room at about 4 30pm However soon after that somebody came in without knocking apparently to do it then We were getting ready to go out again so it was not convenient and as we had made the bed and did not want the towels changed we asked them not to bother We did leave a hand written critique along these lines when we checked out , Not much The bed was comfortable but then it should be 
218721,Park Plaza London Waterloo, I cannot think of a single thing this hotel could to do improve They were great , I m a reasonably seasoned traveler but this hotel gave me several very pleasant surprises When I checked in at the end of a somewhat stressful day it was a great surprise to get a free upgrade to a king studio room The room was superbly appointed right down to wine glasses slippers and a bathroom scale and the in room technology surpassed anything I ve ever experienced everything operating from very intuitive touch pads make sure you try the mood lighting and enjoy the electronic blinds The service at very single point front desk restaurant concierge was exceptional The restaurant food was great And the location is great I highly recommend this hotel 
218722,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Missed a couple things in cleaning like four towels for family of four or new Kleenex box, They treated our kids like rock stars They brought cookies and water for them first night 
218723,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Very expensive breakfast however there are several caf s and a Tesco nearby which is a good alternative The hotel is located near a hospital so ambulances with sirens are quite common both day and night I can t say it bothered me too much though The rooms are a bit pricy but considering it s London I d say it s quite good value for money , Excellent modern hotel with lovely rooms 
218724,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Staff were very rude at reception take money for nothing then take over a week to give back made a few requests that were ignored Room cleaning woke us up at 7 am on both mornings Shocking View of a brick wall when requested nice view Not what you expect for 250 a night , Leaving 
218725,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Room bit small for 2 adults and kids However was comfortable , Location breakfast staff Tube and bus very near to hotel All amenities and restaurants nearby Waterloo London eye walkable Room on 8th floor View of trains and bit of London eye 
218726,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The two Park Plazas in Waterloo are very close and i was dropped at the wrong one My friend came to visit the next day and also went to the wrong one No fault of the hotel i guess but was quite frustrating Very unusual to have the same name hotel so close together , Bed was very comfortable after a 30 hr flight had the best sleep Awoke to a wonderful buffet breakfast with lashings of hot tea 
218727,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Everything was perfect , The room was beautiful modern new The staff very friendly The hotel was close to the Big Ben London Eye the Parliament etc I enjoyed my stay 
218728,Park Plaza London Waterloo,No Negative, Excellent location just opposite to the Lambeth North Station Very near to the London Eye Nice room with fully digitalised Smart TV Few meters away from Water Loo station
218729,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The air con was not working very well and the sun coming through the window made the room very hot, I liked the layout of the room and the tv was very modern
218730,Park Plaza London Waterloo, i am a clening freak so i was looking to every detail and in the bathroom i like everything to be sparkling clean here wasn t so perfect some fingerprints on the glass door some dust here and there , The hotel has a fantastic location 10 min waking to Big Ben and London Eye a lot of restaurants and supermarkets around and best of all YOU HAVE LAMBETH NORD TUBE STATION ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE HOTEL If you take Bakerloo line you will be 4 5 tube stations away from City centre The hotel is fantastic brand new building brand new modern furniture in the room everything has a digital command we had an immense smart TV and very comfy bed Breakfast was fantastic everything you need the ILLY coffee was delicious fresh fruits and so much more We had also dinner in the Florence restaurant in the hotel and we eat very very well the atmosphere and design is also superb in the hotel They have a Spa on the last floor indoor pool and sauna We felt fantastic i can t wait to get back 
218731,Park Plaza London Waterloo,No Negative, Great location a 2 minute walk to the nearest tube station and 10 minute walk to the ever busy Waterloo Station Convenient train rides to popular destinations like Piccadilly Circus and Oxford Circus 
218732,Park Plaza London Waterloo, We had no milk in the room I asked reception on my way out returning 3 hours later still no milk rang reception and a man appeared with coffee I had to show him an empty sachet before he understood not good enough,No Positive
218733,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Can t find anything to complain about , Everything It s a very modern hotel located centrally but in a quiet area You can walk to the London Eye or Westminster Bridge take the bus or metro right next to the hotel Staff was welcoming and attentive room was just perfect Breakfast was good and varied and the price was excellent for its value Would definitely return 
218734,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Noise coming from outside the room that I couldn t locate Woke me up a couple of times during the night Sounded like a washing machine on spin in the room Definitely wouldn t want to stay in the same room again , Nice and clean rooms Friendly staff 
218735,Park Plaza London Waterloo, They charged my credit card TWICE and did not inform me the room safe was a BIG issue that kept on locking by itself every other day and our little daughters milk was in it was a big nuisance, Very nice location very clean room
218736,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The breakfast arrangements are absolutely third rate with too many guests crammed into a small impractical space , Beautiful fit out of rooms and general ambience of passages and lifts
218737,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The staff needs improvement in customer care There were no free water bottles provided and so I thought the water in the mini bar was the free water that is typically provided everywhere but Reception said no that will cost you It really should have been free , Comfortable rooms big bathroom
218738,Park Plaza London Waterloo, We had a room on the 9 th floor very nice but We had people next door who had music blaring from 7 am until 2 pm Complained very little done , Coffee snack very good staff very friendly always smiling sitting areas very good
218739,Park Plaza London Waterloo, No net curtains TV didn t function correctly Day 1 had no hot water like warm This was corrected for Day 2 New hotel teething problems is all , Good location 
218740,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Although the bathroom was very modern I found the shared sliding door for the toilet and shower a bit strange and the floor flooded when showering as the door didn t slide to the wall , The bed was very comfortable and the room was very modern and the sound proofing was excellent 
218741,Park Plaza London Waterloo, I wasn t happy with the service charge that was automatically applied to drinks bill in the bar Otherwise the stay was Perfect , Eventhough I thought it was quiet expensive to stay at this hotel I was very impressed with it from a hotel point of view and also it s location The hotel was spotless Stayed in a similar priced hotel in Brighton after this stay and it was a totally different experience sadly I would definitely stay here again the next time I am in London and would definitely recommend it to anyone 
218742,Park Plaza London Waterloo, I have to say there was nothing I didn t like , Great location Room facilities Reasonable price for the area Easy check in and checking out Friendly and helpful staff 
218743,Park Plaza London Waterloo, 1 hotel lights are too dark i guess it is a matter of taste 2 no real view from rooms i guess some rooms do have a view but i bet most of them don t they mainly view each other, 1 there is a tube station across the street lambeth 2 the hotel seems new and the rooms are somewhat sophisticated control many things with a touch 3 rooms were relatively big 4 the restaurant was fine 5 free wifi 6 many channels on tv 7 
218744,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Our room didn t get cleaned on the first day , The bed was very comfortable and the control pad for the lighting and air conditioning in the room was very clever Very close to an underground station Lambert North and also a 5 minute walk to London Waterloo 
218745,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Nothing , Great hotel Only problem is that it is in a really really busy part of London Waterloo is pretty crazy Cool but a bit gritty Lambeth North Station is almost opposite the hotel Waterloo busier and a little further London eye stones throw away 159 bus takes you in to central London and the stop is right outside the hotel 
218746,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Decoration style too much black and dark in public spaces heavy glass door in Bathroom need force to move cannot be 100 closed noise smart room so smart that it is not so simple to use it including TV it should be more freindly for the avarage visitor not to mention those that do not know english , new modern hotel close to underground station good breakfast 
218747,Park Plaza London Waterloo,No Negative, This hotel is in an excellent location for sightseeing we thought that we would be using the tube throughout our stay but in fact we only used it once Staff were friendly and helpful and dealt with any problems we had promptly andwith a smile 
218748,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The housekeeping could do with some tightening Our room was supposed to have a special a bed ready on arrival and didn t They quickly did this but it should have been prepped in advance The bathroom wasn t cleaned perfectly every day and our dirty coffee cups weren t replaced , Hotel is gorgeous and very central The rooms are super modern and clean on arrival Breakfast was plentiful and varied and the bed was awesome 
218749,Park Plaza London Waterloo,No Negative, This hotel is new and very modern and comfortable The location so near to Waterloo station was a bit of a worry but the hotel is very quiet and we never heard a train It is across a crossroads from North Lambeth tube station and on several major bus lines so it was very easy to get around London You can also easily walk to the Thames near Westminster Bridge and the London Eye The staff was professional pleasant and helpful and the buffet breakfast is terrific There is a very nice pool and spa 
218750,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Can t open windows at all so air con controls room temperature Air con was good but this is just a personal dislike , Great location very friendly staff good facilities 
218751,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The cocked breakfast was cold everything from the sausages to the egg I also rang the following day to report leaving a dress behind they were going to ring me back I m still waiting , Shower was excellent
218752,Park Plaza London Waterloo, There was a small glitch with the electrical system which set off an alarm in the middle of the night however Maintenance fixed this very quickly , The property is walking distance from Big Ben Westminster London eye and the Tate Britain and Tate Modern so we were able to walk to everything we wanted to see and do in London The rooms are modern and very clean with very comfy beds and pillows Much better than other hotels we stayed on our trip Highly recommend this Hotel if you are looking for something in Central London as it is close to most tourist attractions and the Tube station is just across the road 
218753,Park Plaza London Waterloo, View not as described on booking i e both rooms were to be a city view Ended up 1 looking out at other rooms so not comfortable sitting relaxing as aware could be seen by others 2 Looking out at rubbish and overlooked by multicoloured flats so had the blind down all the time as conscious could be seen , Really BIG comfy bed and so fresh clean Refreshments provided in room Digital finger touch controls for lights air con electrically operated blind SMART TV Elemis toiletries Fluffy fresh towels So close handy to Lambert North tube station you literally come out of the station cross the road and it s just round the corner to your left Great dining room for families where adults can eat while children play In play area and adults can see them Cool pool fabulous changing facilities 
218754,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The breakfast buffet was not the best The eggs were soggy and there wasn t a huge variety The fruit was canned as opposed to fresh and there was always a tremendously long wait on simple coffee as the self serve machine only had coffee styled drinks , The restaurant had absolutely incredible food The two minute walk to the underground station was so convenient especially when it was raining The hotel overall was very clean and modern 
218755,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The hotel was a little tricky to find would be useful to mention the Lambeth tube stop Although our room looked onto a brick wall this was no problem for us as we drew the blackout blinds and had the best nights sleep ever , The hotel was amazing modern friendly staff lovely restaurant menu and bar would definitely recommend
218756,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Put us in a room within tub location is very convenient to Tube but only near London Eye Would stay in a different area , Modern overall functionality automated lighting flat screen

218760,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Had to put bathroom door back on its runners before we got into shower Only 1 bedside box would work so had to use phone to see to get to main lighting controls , Staff
218761,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Toilet and shower shared one door One or the other could be closed private at a time but not both , Location is incredibly convenient to tube and an easy walk to Thames and Parliament 
218762,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Reception was quite busy with just enough staff to cope causing a slight delay at check in , The room was well prepared and very comfortable allowing for a relaxing but short stay 
218763,Park Plaza London Waterloo, On Booking they mention you have to pay a deposit of 50 GBP what they don t tell you is that you pay that amount for each day you stay So be prepared to have your money locked away from you for a while we are still waiting The sound proofing is not the greatest we could hear the elevators the people next door and the outside traffic We strongly suggest that they install a glass window door to the shower because it s hard not to make a mess everywhere , We loved the view we got a lucky room at the 10th floor The room has big windows so you can enjoy the scenery It s very close to the tube and bus station but you can also get to the Westminster bridge in 15 minutes by foot We also got lunch one time it was very good it s not expensive and the staff were nice The best part of the room were the touch controls for the window shutter air conditioning and lights You did not have to hang a do not disturb clean the room sign you had a special button to signal those needs However they cleaned the room daily so you should not worry about it Breakfast is very good lots of options but it is the same every day It could use some variation from time to time 
218764,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Nothing to dislike , Good location close to Lambeth north underground and Westminster bridge Staff were friendly helpful and quick to respond Check in and check out was quick and accurate Great restaurant and illy coffee shop inside hotel
218765,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The room I was given 829 was a nice room however the waste water soil pipe from the room above passes through the room and every time the shower basin toilet was used i could hear it going down the waste soil pipe I did report it on checking out It was almost as if the waste pipe was leaking The music in the bar restaurant area is way too loud and people have to talk louder to make themselves heard consequently it s impossible to have a quiet meal or drink The breakfast area is way too cramped a space I noticed an overflow area in the bar seating area adjacent breakfast hunched over a low table isn t the way to start the day , Good location 
218766,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The decor is lovely but geez there just weren t enough lights The lobby was DARK the hallways were DARK and the staff seemed to think it was the style of the hotel I thought it wasn t safe , These were the best fluffiest scrambled eggs I ve ever had Very new clean and swanky hotel Very modern and well decorated All staff were attentive and respectful The concierge was very helpful in getting us to and from everywhere we wanted to be and gave good recommendations for dinner at a close by pub

218770,Park Plaza London Waterloo, we live in the 3rd floor but the view is nothing worth viewing , friendly reception clean room and bathroom well quality of room cleaning The hotel is very closing to the underground station Lambeth north 
218771,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Can t open the window for fresh air the door to the bathroom in Number 128 can t be closed if it was completed open because of the mirror on the door breakfast in the lounge is not a good idea for comfortable seating , Everything is for electronic handling
218772,Park Plaza London Waterloo, All info on smart tv No bedside lights just one spot between two Just a few teabags, Everything controlled by smart pad Lights etc no paper info at all and oh soo hard to find info on smart tv ie spa and swimming details Great staff especially domestic ladies comfy beds n pillows Only 3teabags and when asked front desk if we could have more it didnt materialise Breakfast was very good well cooked and good choice Swimming pool really nice but no info for it that i could find i just took lift to spa and found it Whole place very modern but then it is only 5 mths old

218774,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Temperature of the hot shower was not always consistent Sometimes lukewarm and sometimes cold The temperature of the room was also too warm even at the lowest temperature setting at 16c Perhaps there was a fault , The bed was comfortable The room was spacious Great location The hotel restaurant was also very nice 
218775,Park Plaza London Waterloo, each day something was wrong with the housekeeping very high price and breakfast was not even included offered at GBP19 per person per day for simple buffet staff was friendly gave conflicting info and lacked proacrivity in resolving issues, new facility subway station nearby
218776,Park Plaza London Waterloo, I didn t like the lighting in the hotel corridors and lifts dingy with fluorescent colours I prefer natural light On the way to the hotel my credit card got left in the cab from the airport When I realised this and told the hotel staff at check in and the concierge desk I got an indifferent response Would expect more help and responsiveness and interest to begin with in a situation like that , Breakfast was good staff was quite friendly rooms had nice large beds for us and our kids The Lambeth North tube station being right next to the hotel is very convenient to get around Main attractions and the Waterloo station are all within 15mins walking distance
218777,Park Plaza London Waterloo,No Negative, Friendly staff Great location Fantastic facilities Children loved the pool the cookies It was a great base for our sightseeing in London we will stay again on our next visit to the city

218781,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Breakfast was not reflecting the standard of the rest of the hotel Also the breakfast room was not so nice as it had no windows Hotel had much nicer areas restaurants where the breakfast should be served , Very nice clean and spacious room Staff extremely helpful and friendly Convenient location Underground station bus stop Tesco supermarket and many nice restaurants near by 
218782,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Warning to all The proximity of this hotel to the Waterloo station means that if your hotel room has a view of the railroad tracks you risk being kept awake all through the night as the rail workmen do all kinds of banging and sawing and shouting at each other My last night in this hotel I had constant noise between midnight and 4 00 AM The opposite of how a business traveler wants to spend a night ,No Positive
218783,Park Plaza London Waterloo, water were not hot enough in the shower was a bit of a problem since we were traveling with a baby We talked about it with the hotel but the problem was not solved and we were not informed in anyway regarding the issue seem like they ignored we also booked a taxi to the airport using the concierge service we explicitly asked and confirmed with them to bring a baby car seat which of course they haven t they brought a booster for a 4 years old and we had to carry the baby in our arms on the way back , great location the tube is one minute walk clean and modern rooms

218789,Park Plaza London Waterloo, While the staff at the reception was amazing the staff st the concierge desk was a true disaster Major attitude problem not listening to needs and even complained to us We had a room on the 3rd floor with a terrible view The adjesent building was literally 3 meters away and those working there could look into our rooms The room view was NOTHING like in the picture where we could see the Big Ben In fact it was a photo of their partner hotel that they advertised with , The staff at the reception was really great Friendly and accommodating While the view was really not good the location was very convenient Only 2 min walk to the tube or 15 min walk to Big Ben 
218790,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Ordered champagne on arrival to the hotel seeming that it was a 21st birthday celebration for my girlfriend however it wasn t in the room on arrival We got told it would be up within the hour but never came In the end it managed to get sent to the room late on into the evening It did disappoint seeming that everything else was spot on was just a shame because it would of made it that extra bit surprising , First impressions were amazing Staff were extremely friendly and warming to our stay They were extremely professional 
218791,Park Plaza London Waterloo, More cocktail selections needed in the bar Payment for our room was made in advance via a BACS payment and this had not been recorded on the system and we were asked to pay again The reception informed us they would look into it and even at the point of checking out we were still having to request they check with their finance team , Happy with the size of the rooms very spacious and clean hotel staff lovely and accommodating 
218792,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The hotel is advertised as fully serviced yet our tea station did not get cleaned or replenished for a few days This only occurred after a visit to the reception followed by a phone call to housekeeping an hour later Some variation on the breakfast buffet would be appreciated , The room was well equipped neat and clean We were grateful for the proximity to the underground when getting exhausted children back to the hotel after a busy day out Overall a really good deal for London 
218793,Park Plaza London Waterloo, We had no water in our room to shower flush toilet or get washed for the full morning on Sunday 30th April so we had to go to a friends room and 4 adults had to shower in one small room which made us late to our event as we did not know this was going to happen when we woke up to get ready The staff where not very helpful or apologetic and this is not good enough for the price we paid ,No Positive
218794,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The shower was leaking into toilet very badly There was cold draft coming into the room from the window so my younger son who is 10 years old slept with me and the Mrs I asked for some sugar at 10am from reception I checked out at 11 30am no sugar sent to room , The TV and bed
218795,Park Plaza London Waterloo, maybe the only little thing to be improved is the concierge we try to ask information to have dinner on some tipical pub and was quite difficult to have precise information , the hotel was brand new with a quite modern design rooms were nice and clean although a bit small but considering we were in the downtown it was ok all the same the position of the hotel is excellent 10 minutes walking from Westminster bridge and 50m from Lambeth north underground station break fast is very well served with international dishes of a good level although with a bit cahotic organization anyway the waiters are super kind and compensate that 
218796,Park Plaza London Waterloo,No Negative, Weekend trip to London with the family as I was running London marathon The sofa bed was really comfy and ideal for a full size adult Excellent customer service by Amber at the front desk

218798,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Cleaning of room was not to our standard and even needed to ask for the room to be cleaned towel changed Two times in the middle of the night the fire alarm woke us up and no information from the hotel what was going on , Gym spa was very good Staff at Illy restaurant bar the concierge was excellent 
218799,Park Plaza London Waterloo, poor staff non cooperative management rigid lacks hospitality the staff is new and not hostile , nice and new hotel bed is perfect breakfast is nice
218800,Park Plaza London Waterloo, 1 Be careful if you have an inside room as everything can be seen from the opposite room But this is easily solved by pressing a button that brings the blinds down 2 If you are not familiar with intelligent rooms it is possibly to press the wrong button like instead of clean my room can become don t disturb or you may spend ten minutes to discover how to switch off a specific light etc But since this was the second time for us it was very easy, The common breakfast buffet is not so great but the custom breakfast offered at the restaurant is superb Food at the restaurant is delicious a real value for money The bar is equipped with a reasonably broad range of alcohols People at the bar and restaurant are extremely friendly always willing to tailor the services to your need Reception house keeping and all staff are extremely friendly The location is reasonably decent Quality of room bed bathroom just too good A real value for money This is the second time we stayed there All the feedback from the first time was January this year has been incorporated by the hotel management in just three months Very impressive indeed 
218801,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Bathroom lacked privacy as sliding door across either toilet or shower not both and no entrance door to bathroom We didn t mind however other member of party commented , Modern and clean Staff friendly 
218802,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Fire alarm went of at 4am for unknown reason , Reception staff was so thoughtful and nice and offered me a free upgrade after a very long day On entering the room there was an Easter good bag with popcorn cookies Easter eggs Such a sweet ending
218803,Park Plaza London Waterloo,No Negative, Beautiful new hotel Excellent chain Have stayed with them in Beijing so was happy to find them in London Hosted 5 business colleagues in London and put them in Park Plaza Westminster Bridge and it was excellent as well and very much appreciated by my guests 
218804,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The firealarm went of two of the nights around 4 am and the kids had trouble to fall asleep again That ruined quite some hours good sleep One night is a coincident but 2 out of 3 is far to much The sofa bed has a very thin madras and the kids complained when they went to bed the first night it helped with an extra duvet over the madrass the next night Went to the reception Sunday evening with the kids and asked when the pool opned Monday morning and was told it opned at 06 30 When we got there at 06 30 kids has trouble to sleep after the fire alarm went off at 4 am we were not allowed to enter as kids was only allowed to swim between 8 am and 8 pm two very dissapointed kids with tired parents checked out a couple of hours later , Very velcomming staff and a nice location only two minutes walf from Lambeth North station Dinner served in the restaurant was good and with reasonable prices 
218805,Park Plaza London Waterloo, They have ongoing problems with the fire alarm I noticed in other people s reviews on my first night there the alarm went off at 3am Even for an alarm it is way too loud It sounded like a car alarm right in the room My ears were hurting afterwards and so couldn t go back to sleep The bathroom was very tiny and the water pressure is not good The staff were professional but cold , Bed was nice and comfortable Location is great 
218806,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Not all rooms as ready so its hard to get a change of room if you don t like the view Valet parking at 45 a night is a little steep Sauna and steam room not hot enough , Staff were great location is perfect 
218807,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Staff on arrival didn t give a good impression and wasn t very helpful 2 out of the 3 mornings we were there the fire alarm went off at 5 30am and 4 30am which wasn t great And our room wasn t cleaned on the day before departure, Really nice hotel and very modern and the location is first class to what we required 
218808,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The room was rather small for family of 4 children aged 11 14 We had to ask for extra towels as they had only given for 3 including the wash products We also had to ask for the complimentary robes as they too were not in the room Breakfast on the second morning was disappointing i don t think they were prepared for the volume of people They placed us in the overflow part which was the restaurant nice enough however there were no cutlery mugs and although not too far from the breakfast serving area it was far enough when you had to make several journeys because when you did go there was was no bread beans and a large que for the coffee machine The swimming pool was lovely not big but nice enough However there was no hairdryers in the ladies changing room which meant we had to go back to our rooms to dry our hair which was a bit inconvenient when you had brought everything else with you to go straight for lunch the lady on reception did offer to get one from house keeping which was lovely but there was no where in the changing room to plug it in a bit bizarre Finally I think the fire alarm went off at 04 25 we didn t need to leave the room after we had all got up and dressed but this we only found out by ringing reception No apologies , It was the perfect location for us to watch the London marathon from Westminster Bridge The door man was very nice and helpful and the bar was very reasonably priced watch out for the service charge one barman charged per drink even though I went to the bar to get it 
218809,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Unfortunately it was not possible in the Bathroom to use the fan as the plug socket was not usable for the plug in of the fan This must be a misconstruction of the bathroom I assume witha specific adapter it should be possible o use the fan in the bathroom But anyway it was possible to use the fan outside of the bathroom, I liked the location of the hotel in the middle of the heart of London which was very close to public transportation like the tube or bus My room was big enough and I enjoyed the breakfast
218810,Park Plaza London Waterloo,No Negative, This was the most modern hotel I have ever stayed Everything in he room was controled my a remote control The hotel was just a few minutes from thhe london eye and the metro 
218811,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Our room didnt have possibility to open window since I am klaustrofobic it was terrible also pay attention to room softvare service my kids switched off housekeeping, Bathroom was fantastic as well as the comfort of the bed Hotel has 6 elevators so eventhough it was full one never waits bar and restaurant are great if you dont have breakfast included in the room price try breakfast in the restaurant it is great and prices are much cheaper then in centre 
218812,Park Plaza London Waterloo,No Negative, One of the best breakfast buff s we have experienced And a special acknowledgement to the fantastic people at the bell desk By the way the staff was terrific in general the bell desk just stood out as the 10

218815,Park Plaza London Waterloo,No Negative, We travelled with our two children The hotel is just fantastic the rooms look great very modern no curtain but a button to pull down a black out blind which worked a treat Our super king bed was very comfy The kids shared the sofa bed which I would say is not comfortable for an adult to use but the kids were happy with it Staff were fantastic with the kids goodie bags on arrival plaza dollars to get treats into he cafe The best bit is breakfast in a family friendly area with kids TV and games breakfast was so calm it was great Literally out of the hotel and 2 min walk to Lambert North just be careful there is another Park Plaza just around the corner our taxi took us there first For adults minus kids the walk to the London Eye Southbank will be 10 minutes 
218816,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The view from our room but to be honest it was not that bad if I wanted view I could of stayed somewhere else for a lot more money So not really a big problem , The friendly staff plus the modern look of the rooms plus hotel
218817,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The aircon was making a noise all the time even when turned off or could have been pipes so was abit disturbing they also had a volume block on the TV , The room and hotel was very clean Really friendly staff and good location 
218818,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The price I stayed at your Westminster Bridge branch a couple of weeks earlier and there appeared to be more space in the room and it costed less Thanks , The staff location and breakfast

218820,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Wished we could have stayed longer This hotel was gorgeous and the staff were amazing , The staff were always so helpful Called taxis whenever we needed them The hotel room was beautiful and the spa was so relaxing Definitely will be returning in the future 
218821,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Nothing Very very minor niggle is the sliding door on the shower was quite stiff But that s grasping at straws , Staff are incredibly friendly and facilities are great including leisure and fitness suite Super location being right beside Lambeth North tube station and the many great things London South Bank has to offer 
218822,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Check In and Check Out extremely slow and disorganised Booking ignored requested double bed on a high floor but I was given a twin single room on a lower floor No information given at Check In regarding breakfast or Check Out time No information in room regarding same Breakfast is a buffet though you can pay extra to order other items if you manage to attract the attention of a waiter waitress Good luck Breakfast room is small Shower in room 442 smells of mould mildew damp , The black out blind Soundproofing of room could barely hear outside sound or neighbours unless someone was directly outside door or sirens of emergency services blaring Chocolates card and bottles of still and sparkling water in room to welcome me though the card in the room said Dear Nicole Lots of power points around the room convenient 
218823,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Staff were appalling and rude in particular the reception staff The hotel had a fire alarm and woke us up abruptly and no compensation for the guests Receptionist girl needs re training and to learn some manners , The room was nice very unique and spacious 
218824,Park Plaza London Waterloo, An overall good experience was marred on the last morning of my departure when the water stopped coming in the bathroom Upon complaining I was told that the matter will be resolved within a couple of hours I didn t use the Spa baths as I had to finish packing and rush to check out The housekeeping staff doesn t understand English My 10 nights were not rewarded on my Club Carlson card since I had booked via booking com and not directly , Location opposite Lambeth North underground was very convenient Clean rooms excellent wifi Smart TV was fun as well The staff in the lobby Concierge were quite friendly 
218825,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Did not find the food very good in the restaurant for the price and breakfast was only ok , A super hotel with excellent facilities Rooms very modern and clean Security is excellent staff very good and a really nice buzz to the hotel 
218826,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The bathroom area wasn t well lit not just due to an overhead bulb failure impossible to see well enough to use make up This was also the case in the bedroom I had to make do with my own hand held mirror by the window not clever A well lit magnifying mirror would have been useful Good hairdryer was provided but metres away from the nearest and only mirror albeit a large full length one we don t all have 20 20 vision I found it strange that the carpeted area was in the walking areas only I personally like carpet underfoot when getting in and out of bed Perhaps slippers could have been provided Only one teaspoon with the drinks facility An oversight I m sure I think some people may find the very modern chrome handles on the bathroom doors difficult to grip I consider myself fit and healthy but am of the mature age group and I didn t find them easy to use to pull the door open Similarly the door leading to and from the Ladies off the reception area was awkward Being glass it s heavy but more importantly on leaving the area the approach to the door is underlit so that the black vertical door handle against the black glass door is virtually invisible some lighting would be most helpful Although I found the hi tech control system for the room very novel for me there was a lack of general information of the old fashioned printed type There was info re room service meals but I was unaware of anything to do with the restaurant or other facilities that the hotel provided Maybe it was all there on screen but I wasn t in the room long enough to avail myself of the TV service and I wasn t advised to do so In spite of these criticisms my friend and I enjoyed our stay and may well return , Spacious room upgrade due to standard room not ready by 2pm very modern design especially the bathroom Comfortable bed excellent shower touch pad lighting air con electric curtain control very hi tech once you realise there are no normal switches Good use of subdued light for the bathroom at night Lovely toiletries All the staff we met were excellent extremely helpful and professionally friendly Loved the d cor of the reception area 
218827,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Honestly there is nothing I could fault Our mini bar wasn t working so I missed my glass of vino before bed at night but I didn t make the hotel aware of it until my 2nd day they would have delivered to the room but I just didn t bother Not a complaint at all I m sure if I had said it in my first night it would have been rectified , Location was great So convenient with Tube station so near Beds were very comfy our kids loved the TV Games were great to keep them entertained while in the room Staff were super friendly Bathroom was great size again my kids thought it was cool Box of popcorn cookies sweets was such a lovely touch Would definitely stay again

218834,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Because it was an established building not new build the room was smaller than other Park Plazas so the large television rather overwhelmed it but it didn t spoil enjoyment of the visit , Dinner in the restaurant was excellent and the staff were very attentive as also breakfast 
218835,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The remote control to the TV didn t work well Also the water drained really slow in the shower and flooded the bathroom twice , All the technology in the room was a nice touch

218847,Park Plaza London Waterloo, There is currently some building work going on outside the window which we could hear in the afternoon and early in the morning It would have been nice to have received a small discount and being notified when booking But still a lovely stay , The bed was so comfy The whole room was beautiful
218848,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The view from our room was somewhat dissapointing and so we moved rooms the staff were great and arranged this straight away the view was slightly better in that we could see a little more of London and the top of the London Eye The hotel is not in the best position if a view is what your looking for For the short time we were in the room we just kept the blind down the majority of the time , The location was perfect 2 minutes from Lambeth North underground which gives great access for getting all over London The room was great with lots of mod cons and a fancy control panel to work them all At check in the lady on reception asked why we were travelling I explained it was our anniversary weekend and when we arrived back at the room after being out for the day we recieved a knock at the door and they had brought us a bottle of prosecco a dessert platter and a card wishing us a happy anniversary which was a lovely personal touch The prosecco was lovely 
218849,Park Plaza London Waterloo, TV was a challenge Not sure if the remote needed replacing but we could not switch on the channels and kept having to switch it off and on Only 2 teabags for an overnight stay for 2 people Asked for some more which wasnt a problem , Close proximity of the tube station The bed was so comfortable the best I have ever slept in in a hotel Great Illy cafe for lovely coffee and snacks Room was modern clean and spacious Elemis products nice touch Quite room at the back so no road noise a bonus in the City Would definitely stay again just need to look out for deals

218851,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The room got quite warm at night so I would recommend putting the air con on during the day before you sleep , The hotel upgraded us to another room for free because it was my partners birthday they also came to our room with a free bottle of wine The atmosphere and the staff were amazing they were so helpful and so friendly The location was great everything was walking distance I would definitely recommend this hotel and I would definitely return here I would also suggest getting breakfast included in your stay as we did Perfect hotel for couples too 
218852,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Alarm clock call on Saturday morning 8am Fire alarm went off and hotel was evacuated once off event I m sure and was just precautionary , Hotel was spotless and modern Reception staff lovely got a free upgrade to bigger room for checking in on St Patricks day cause we re Irish without even asking or expecting it Remote Control both sides of bed for everything in the room such as lights heat air conditioning electric curtains do not disturb sign on door Hotel right opposite Subway and walking distance to London eye and Westminster etc 
218853,Park Plaza London Waterloo, It was a little further from the south bank than I thought I should have studied the map more The shower water went over the floor as the shower screen didn t cover it enough so used the shower mat to mop up No biggie though the shower was fab , A lovely calming atmosphere Great room comfy bed good food from room service Lovely bathroom products and shower Sadly ran out of time to use the spa 
218854,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The swimming pool at the spa could have been a touch warmer There was no information regarding the spa or other hotel facilities in the room Didn t enjoy the Saturday 8am fire alarm but that s no reflection on the hotel They got everyone back inside ASAP once the fire brigade had attended , Extremely modern and comfortable hotel Staff were eager to please with good attention to detail Our TV remote was out of batteries but that was resolved within minutes even though it was late at night Great breakfast and very cool bar made for a great stay Super close to the tube 100m from Lambeth North on the Bakerloo line made trips into the centre a breeze 
218855,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The breakfast room was very crowded and the staff found it hard to keep up with demand for hot food , The room was great All facilities and breakfast was excellent 
218856,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The tv was tricky to work a bit too high tech , The spa like aroma as you enter reception the contemporary decor the mood lighting great base for exploring Waterloo south bank area 
218857,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Music far too loud in the bar , Blackout blind Air conditioning Excellent shower and free Elemis products Help yourself ice machine Good breakfast choices Easy to check in and out 
218858,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The bathroom was awkward shared a sliding door that was used for the shower and the toilet and it did not have a main door into the bathroom , 5 Star to the Staff polite and courteous Breakfast buffet is worth the whirl 
218859,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The room was so warm and whilst the hotel was lovely I did feel like I was living in a world without daylight , Kids loved the pool and the breakfast Room facilities were great bed was comfy and huge and was very quiet 
218860,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The TV lighting and air con were very modern but as a result quite difficult for my elderly parents to master , Friendly and helpful staff Great bar with reasonable prices

218863,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The bed was very uncomfortable the mood lighting in the room would only stay on for a maximum of 30 seconds The overground trains were loud and I could hear this from my room There was also a fire alarm on one of the nights I stayed as I was playing music in my room it was only until someone called me and stopped my music playing I heard faint beeping Where even without the music the alarm was faint so I decided to open the door of the room to then discover that faint beeping was actually a fire warning to exit the building If an entire hotel needs to be evacuated I suggest putting these alarms in the rooms as well as in the hallway If it was a serious emergency where the hotel was really in danger if someone hadn t rang me to stop my music I wouldn t have heard it , The room was really modern and the staff were very attentive
218864,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The location it was in a very dodgy area of Lambeth I had to look over my shoulder , Everything except the location Clean well organised modern pleasant quiet connected and the breakfast was very very good 
218865,Park Plaza London Waterloo,No Negative, This hotel was one of the best I stayed at The staff were extremely helpful and even upgraded us as it was my boyfriends birthday The bar staff and restaurant staff were absolutely lovely people The pool and spa area are so relaxing and the staff there also extremely helpful The location was so central and we only used the tube once as we were able to walk everywhere Overall we loved our stay here at the park plaza and will definitely be booking to stay here again on our next trip too London 
218866,Park Plaza London Waterloo, need to make the location clear even the taxi man thought it was Plaza westminster, once we found it all was good and staff were great and very helpful
218867,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Walk to Waterloo was quite inconvenient but Lambeth North station was directly opposite , Room was not ready upon arrival was offered a complimentary drink at the bar and didn t have to wait a long time Swimming pool was spectacular open from 6 30am to 9pm Hotel only opened for 3 months but everything was lovely Short walk to the London eye and south bank which is lively 24 hours a day 
218868,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The television was very quiet and we couldn t turn it up at all And the bathroom mirror was not ideal , Lovely room very comfy bed and lovely duvet great to have a face flannel too Excellent breakfast High staff ratio all helpful and smiley

218871,Park Plaza London Waterloo, We booked the Superior King Room with city view and upon check in we were told that we got upgraded Unfortunately the upgrade meant getting a couch and a room on the 3rd floor with a view to a passage with people walking in from of the window After complaining we got transferred to a higher room from the second night , Super friendly and available staff Good location we walked everywhere Nice pool and sauna 
218872,Park Plaza London Waterloo, When booking via booking com I booked a Superior King Double room with a city view when I got to my room it was a small double room with an internal view on the 2nd floor This was disappointing based on what was advertised I asked reception about the room and the view and they were supposed to contact me later that evening about potentially moving but I did not hear back from them The price of the breakfast advertised on booking com was also not accurate and much more expensive then the price at the hotel ,No Positive
218873,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The city view was on to a railway line which was noisy even through the shutter , The breakfast was great with a good choice Reception staff were friendly 
218874,Park Plaza London Waterloo, While booking I had asked for room with view I got the darkerst room in hotel Please don t bother to respond that U R sorry and next time bla bla Hotels make mistakes by giving booking com customers worse rooms we share our opinions with many others, Very good location tube across the street Good restaurants around or in walking distance Good brakfast but artificial scrumbled eggs Large bed clean bathroom empty swimming pool
218875,Park Plaza London Waterloo, There wasn t anything that I we didn t like , I enjoyed the whole experience in particular the front of house greeting staff Kim she was very welcoming and attentive the SPA and the staff in the SPA were also very nice The restaurant staff and quality of food was of a high standard 
218876,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Check in was a bit slow but there was free cookies , Very close to the tube Great pool sauna and steam room Nice cafe attached Rooms are really modern 
218877,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Room on 1st floor looking out on to a wall and ac units but we were moved without a fuss Windows can t be opened Having to go home , The friendly staff who made us welcome and did everything they could to make our stay enjoyable Good location 10 mins walk from Waterloo The room on 9th floor we were moved to The pool The food The decor Comfy bed The wine delivered to our room for my partner s birthday which was a lovely surprise 
218878,Park Plaza London Waterloo, No Bath in room Breakfast was great but one staff member let the service down unfortunately , Well equipped rooms Great breakfast and overall value for money
218879,Park Plaza London Waterloo, They want 50 Pounds extra per Person for taxes An absolutely no go It s nowhere noted at the bocking site , Top modern hotel Great bar great cocktails Spa is good too Very friendly staff The rooms are beautiful Sleeping like a baby 
218880,Park Plaza London Waterloo, No much of a view but this was compensated by the fact that it was a good central location near a tube station, The bed was really comfortable The spa was clean and you got free towels and slippers to use 
218881,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Tv wasn t working when we arrived which caused a little disturbance as 2 technicians had to come into the room for 20 or so mins , Next to tube station Very modern clean hotel
218882,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Because it was new on one knew what was going on Swimming times at pool for children only reason I went there was said by pool staff to be 10 12 and 3 6 which was ridiculous Front of desk said it had changed to all day Restaurant breakfast said or was 20 for adults and 20 for children Then front of desk confirmed our was free for children I dk not like it when I m given the bill for a meal 5 mins after I did down The suggestion is that I go There was no hairdryer or swim wear ringer in the changing rooms Service in cafe exceptional , Room good Front of desk good 
218883,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Couldn t find my booking when we tried to check in Room was freezing cold and the heating only stays on if the lights are on so had to sleep with the light on just to warm up Same with plug sockets you can charge your phone overnight cos as soon as the lights are off it all shuts off Really annoying , Breakfast was amazing And breakfast staff were great really helpful
218884,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Could have had some more information on food options that were available the bar and restaurant spa facilities could have had a jacuzzi , The interior and decor was beautiful
218885,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Nothing springs to mind, Scrambled eggs were really nice even though it was a buffet breakfast there were light and soft The leisure facilities were lovely and a pleasant afternoon for my husband and I sheltering from Storm Doris after our train was cancelled and we had to stay and extra night in London 
218886,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The design of the hotel is inferior to the other Park Plaza hotels I have stayed at I went to the wrong Park Plaza it should have this more clearly marked on the site as NEW LOCATION as I am used to staying in either County Hall or Westminster and this was the Waterloo location All very confusing The colour scheme yellow and grey is painful as are the references to cities around the world so dated The rooms are much smaller than other PP s and the feeling style was more in line with an IBIS hotel Remote batteries were critically low so couldn t use the TV very well The screen was welcoming some other person not me The tea set was positioned where there wasn t a plug when asked the staff about this they said some have plugs and some don t Great Answer Not all together a great stay ,No Positive
218887,Park Plaza London Waterloo, I didn t have breakfast at the hotel as 19 95 for Full English is a little expensive, Great location and great selection of TV channels when your in the room
218888,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Did ask for a high floor but was given the 2nd floor Plus when booking room it said with a view and the view I had was straight into offices or flats , Room gadgets was cool and the bed was really comfy
218889,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Didnt know if the tea coffee facilities in the cupboard were free so we never had any should let you whats in with room price, Amazing hotel and so welcoming the bed was so comfortable i didnt want to get out of it and for our anniversary they made the room look lovely couldn t thank them enough x
218890,Park Plaza London Waterloo, I booked a city View room only to be told that no such room exists Guest services let down the rest of the team here We had to call for some toilet roll as this wasn t replaced breakfast order completely incorrect and half hour spent trying to rectify for it to still be wrong Upon having our room cleaned 2 champagne glasses we took on the trip ourselves had been taken later replaced as we were given 2 new ones to keep Iron was not available in our room so again had to call for one Let s just say I didn t like having to call guest services as often as I did Such a shame , Hotel was Very Modern and service upon arrival was fantastic Reception team very professional and very friendly Facilities on site were fantastic Spa and pool were very clean and beautifully kept 
218891,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Staff Not a good welcoming and when complained staff did not seemed bothered When booking I asked for an upper storey room I get there and they gave me a level 2 out of 13 room my view was some flats Considering when paying 144 per night without breakfast and not even get asked how was your stay , The hotel itself was nice at a high standard
218892,Park Plaza London Waterloo, We were booked in as a superior double and were given a twin room We changed the room but had no view Receptionist needs to smile a bit more , Modern and easy location for the Embankment 
218893,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The shower wasnt the greatest but it did the job , We really enjoyed our night break away in the hotel friendly staff very clean they couldnt do enough for you already booked up again for April
218894,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The door to the shower and toilet was a bit strange It was sliding and could only have the shower part closed or toilet which I wasn t keen on not having the door open when I was in the toilet , From the moment we walked in the staff were very friendly it was very well located next to the tube and within walking distance to the eye which we were going too Room was very very clean and modern free tea and coffee comfy big bed and came with iron and hairdryer so didn t need to be lugging my hair dryer in my bag Lifts to all floors and hotel was very quite evern though it was quite full which was a bonus Would highly recommend this hotel and the price I paid was good just came in my budget and glad I found it
218895,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Building work next door started early my room on 1st floor overlooked the bins and building work next door so no view , The hotel was brand new and therefore clean and fresh The SPA was also immaculately clean with plenty of clean towels slippers Also gown and slippers in room Tea and coffee making facilities 
218896,Park Plaza London Waterloo, On booking I was asked for a ETA which was provided and we arrived within the provided window Then arriving at the hotel they told us the room won t be ready for another 2 and a half hours When we got to the room 3 hours later the room was set up incorrectly as a twin room This combines with a early checkout time left us feeling like we hadn t got our money s worth , There was 1 member of staff that was helpful and really the only person that seemed to have made an effort to help us out I believe he was the bar manager besides the doormen 
218897,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Checkout later is 10 an hour from 12 o clock breakfast is quite expensive at 18pp per stay nice food though , mood lighting electric blind sky TV YouTube stylish rooms furniture free WiFi comfortable beds helpful staff free tea and coffee in your room hotel bar breakfast
218898,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Put in the wrong room at first Booked and paid for a king sized superior room and given a double Moved from the 2nd to the 6th floor Would have liked a higher floor room as it was for my partners 50th birthday Had a poor view We were supposed to have been given a little something for the occasion but we were not Very disappointed , Good breakfast 
218899,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Location but most of all the bedroom chair fell off its legs and almost broke my foot and someone entered our room and took the phone without a note or our consent which caused me severe anxiety Staff were apologetic and great, Staff and decor
218900,Park Plaza London Waterloo, I paid for a room with a view as it was my fianc birthday and didn t get on We were looking out to rubbish bins The first room we went into had dirty sheets and blood on the pillow , The staff were really pleasant
218901,Park Plaza London Waterloo, I liked everything about it, The hotel facilities were amazing The staff were willing to help at every point The location was perfect for sight seeing Wonderful stay The room very very clean 
218902,Park Plaza London Waterloo,No Negative, Stayed with my girlfriend Location was spot on Right next to Lambeth North tube station 3 minute walk from the London eye Cleanest hotel I ve ever stayed in and our room was spot on Bed was massive and mood changing lights was the game changer Brekfast was wicked too and the swimming pool with steam and Suana was amazing peaceful Highly recommend this hotel 
218903,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The AC fan in the room was quite loud and whenever someone flushed the plumbing was also loud making the overall feel of the room not as premium as it would seem The lobby smelled good but it was like going into a florist If i had been allergic I am sure I would have gone insane It felt like they put as many smells as possible in there Maybe to cover something up ,No Positive
218904,Park Plaza London Waterloo, I don t think I could say anything that I didn t like other than the price You get what you pay for you are in Central London right next to Waterloo so the price was actually pretty reasonable , Everything about this hotel was on point The staff were so welcoming even before I got to the door It was Valentines day and I was offered a cookie and a mini bottle of Prosecco on arrival Everything was explained to me perfectly The hotel is beautiful the room was fantastic and I have nothing that I think could be better I am not used to the posh life so this was a definite treat and I can t wait to come back 
218905,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The bathroom was not completely clean and the layout was a bit strange with sliding doors which meant that the doors never properly shut and so there wasn t much privacy The room was quite cold Even though we would increase the temperature of the room the default setting was quite low so everytime we came to our room it was cold The spa was not what we expected It was just an indoor pool a sauna and a steam room We were expecting warm pools with jets etc but they did not have these The hotel in general is quite cold ie in the hallways entrance hall and in the spa area It would have certainly been nice to heat the spa areas to make it feel more comfortable and less like a swimming pool , Breakfast was very good and the staff were very friendly and helpful They really went out of their way to help you The TV system and the controller for the room lights curtains thermostat etc was very useful and very cool The design of the hotel is very colourful and makes it a great place to have cocktails and meet friends 
218906,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Not a sound proof room , The rooms where we ll done a little bit of trouble with the tv and remote Not a soundproof room as I heard doors closing drilling up stairs Pool was brilliant spa 10 10 The area is good only 10 minute walk to London Waterloo station Staff was brilliant 
218907,Park Plaza London Waterloo,No Negative, the room was very sleek and stylish the bed was spacious and comfy cool pads to control lighting and heating etc and had full sky tv the staff were very friendly and helpful didnt get a chance to go to the restaurant or pool but they looked delightful overall fantastic hotel in a great location
218908,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Breakfast was absolutely shocking we was not served any drinks or toast with breakfast and I did not get what I asked for The price of breakfast was 43 but I would say was only worth round 3 It was awful and an absolute rip off I also booked this hotel for me and my partner sadly he could not get the time off of his new job to attend so I tried to change the date of the booking to the following weekend and I was happy to pay any additional cost To my disgust I was advise I am not allowed to change the date and if I do not attend I will be charged the full amount of the room I understand this was no cancellation but I should of been able to change the date of the booking due to unforeseen circumstances so in turn I had to bring my mother , The fact there was sky in the room the spa facilities and dinner was amazing 
218909,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Double Superior room was smaller than a normal twin room no door to the bathroom in a double room very noisy ventilation in a bathroom poor restaurant menu TV management was very nonuser friendly Bath tube is offered but in realty the hotel does not have rooms with a bath tube City view is very poor , Nice interiors and design comfortable bed twin room was very comfortable for two guests nice continental breakfast SPA
218910,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The room service menu could have been better Less is more my partner didn t like majority things on it There could have been less horseradish on the steak The menu could have been simpler , We loved the modern feel of the hotel We loved the lights that lit the place up inside It was an overall excellent experience 
218911,Park Plaza London Waterloo, There was no where to park the car for a reasonable price only a valet parking service offered for 40 for 24 hours , The room was extra nice and was super Modern I couldn t fault anything about the room or the staff was amazing 
218912,Park Plaza London Waterloo, No one took my luggage when i arrived the hotel especially when the main entrance was out of order The receptionist Ana was not friendly and she even did not check my preference and arrange me stay in Level 1 The room was absolutely good with all remote devices however the heater was somehow not working and I felt really cold at night The previous customer name was listed on the smart TV and I could see his checking details and bills This is absolutely unprofessional I can t imagine my personal details was released to strangers , Facilities are cool with smart TV and remote curtain 
218913,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The fire alarm waking us up after a late night and having to throw our clothes on and evacuate wasn t much fun just glad we didn t go for our morning swim Some instructions in the room on how to work lights and blinds would have been helpful but got there in the end Also the key pads on the lockers in the pool area were impossible when going swimming as they were far too small to work out without glasses , The pool and facilities were lovely and nice to get a decent ale at the bar 
218914,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Our stay was ruined by the fire alarm I know there s nothing the staff can do about this but it was a false alarm and certainly put a downer on our stay at this hotel Particularly as we were in the spa had been there only a few minutes and the fire alarms were so loud I had ringing in my ears and a headache for the rest of the day which was certainly not good when exploring London for the day If you re looking to go to the London eye and other attractions and plan on walking like we did Both the other park plaza hotels Westminster bridge and county hall are much much closer, Comfy bed being able to change the lights room temperature and open close the blinds all whilst in bed was great 
218915,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The pad at the side of the bed that controlled the lights AC etc made an awful high pitch noise constantly kept me awake Luckily I unplugged it on the second night , Excellent concierge staff relaxing bar area and best room service food 
218916,Park Plaza London Waterloo, I was expecting a superior bed but when I got there its was 2 singles pushed together This was a little disappointing But overall very good hotel, Loved the room it was a stylist and modern room I have to say the person in the lobby that looked after bags was very good I didn t get her name but she was a small Chinese women and she was lovely I would say she made my trip to your hotel
218917,Park Plaza London Waterloo, I did ask for a room with a view maybe on the top floor and somewhere quiet We got the opposite Room next to the lift ground floor and no view Room was lovely though although some noisy people at night which wasn t the hotels fault but rude people , The restaurant and staff were great 
218918,Park Plaza London Waterloo, I requested a room with a view and didn t get this even when I spoke directly to receptionist as had to change rooms from double to superior twin as previously requested,No Positive
218919,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The parking was not explained Car was taken after opening hours and then car was refused when requested due to it being out of hours Which caused a delay and stressful time, Service and hotel was very nice
218920,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Lacks a bit of atmosphere It s new so maybe the art pictures are yet to arrive The bedroom was a good size clean nice but not cosy , High standard of public areas and bedroom shower Good gym Nice pool too 
218921,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The information about city view was not correct at least in booking com The best view is to the street in bad case under the railway Location was too far from main shops coffees and theatres but public transport was quite close , The staff was very friendly and helpful Breakfast was good and in nice peaceful atmosphere Specially liked smoked fish what is not often in hotels breakfast choice Room was large and comfortable
218922,Park Plaza London Waterloo, No mention that not all facilities were available during our stay Was very surprised to find the bar closed at 11 15 on a Saturday night when we returned to the hotel for drinks after a night out , Very clean good location nice staff
218923,Park Plaza London Waterloo, N A, Newly opened hotel so everything in pristine condition Modern feel and good decor Electronic controls at room entrance and at each bedside for curtains lighting AirCon etc Very cool illuminated artwork on one wall and large smart TV on another wall Good size desk Nice walk in shower All of the staff are very friendly and most helpful Breakfast is superb Bus and tube stops close by Short walk to Westminster Bridge 
218924,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The view was not nice in the room had breakfast the tea was very watery not strong and all breakfast should include toast instead of 3 for toest, Very modern and pleasant rooms the lifts were very nice and injoyed the pool but no spa
218925,Park Plaza London Waterloo, I had booked breakfast with my stay and was challenged on at least four separate occasions to say breakfast wasn t included despite showing them my booking receipt Once was while I was actually eating the breakfast That and part of the shower was broken in my room The bar staff whilst very friendly did have to ask for my drinks order 4 times as well a theme despite the other 5 in my party getting their drinks about 10 minutes before me The staff were very apologetic but one drink from their cocktail menu shouldn t be too difficult to make , Bed was very comfy staff in the bar were extremely helpful The hotel has a very nice vibe relaxed and family friendly The lounge space was very well laid out around the bar and enabled my group of six to chat easily The bathrooms were very cleverly designed and the room was great Despite being less than 30 metres from the Waterloo train tracks I heard no rail noise at all nice thick windows remote controls for everything in the room and the electric blind were nice features The breakfast was a really good buffet style and the dining room was very relaxed and well laid out Even when busy it didn t seem cramped
218926,Park Plaza London Waterloo, There is only a sliding door on toilets in the room could be a bit awkward for very new couples , Great lads at the bar They went out of their way to be as helpful as possible The hotel looks modern and is clean Loved the control panel for lights blinds do not disturb
218927,Park Plaza London Waterloo, was very surprised that my Carlson Gold card seemed to have no impact whatsoever regarding my room type nor no offer whatsoever linked to upgrade any other potential benefit , staff very helpful and attentive reception area and bar in a particular
218928,Park Plaza London Waterloo, First the hotel design is very modern dark and disorienting I would have thought I d like it but walking down the halls and using elevators and lobby rest room is a very odd experience The light creates distortion and makes depth perception difficult It feels like a Las Vegas casino where you have no sense of time or space Second this hotel is just not ready to be open yet The simplest things in most hotels became a monumental task The hotel seems designed by some one who has never actually experienced it So things that may seem cool on paper simply don t work in reality for real hotel guests When we checked in I tried to plug in my lap top and the socket fell out of the wall I called guest services and they sent an engineer who came and went 2 3 times and finally said he can t fix it and went away Meanwhile I tried to iron my business clothes for my next day s meeting The ironing board was also broken I was able to jerry rig it back together but it sat on the desk rather then stood on legs so didn t work well at all Very cheap design by someone who must not ever actually iron their clothes and too small for functionality When I got back to the room I tried to take a shower The water pressure was very low and the water luke warm I ran it for a long time no change It was difficult to get my hair fully rinsed from the shampoo Providing a bathrobe was a nice touch but it was so small it would only fit a small sized person I called and asked for a bigger one but none ever arrived I ordered some room service lobster mac and cheese There was not one piece of lobster in the entire dish and it cost 19 pounds Later in my stay I tried a hamburger Although the food came on a rolling table equipped with a hot box the waiter had the food on top of the table and so it was cold by the time it arrived The waiter didn t seem to know the hot box was there even when I asked , The location was very convenient for the work I needed to do The bed was comfy and the breakfast was pretty good about what you d expect for a hotel buffet although over priced Employees are making an effort but they seem to receive no training and are therefore overwhelmed by the most basic tasks They must have apologized about 15 times and explained that the hotel just opened last month but that doesn t explain why they seem so befuddled 
218929,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Advertised sauna and spa are not yet ready I have photos of the situation These show the unattended spot entrance surely a violation of health and safety regulations even if these are sometimes unnecessary I showed this for the morning of the second day when it was true the first evening The timing is visible on my Photos Weirdly the staff seem I don t wear the only the pool is operative The pool is OK The sauna is not listed as out of order but as a fellow visitor confirmed it is basically an ordinary warm room Show a photo with my hand on the heating facility The steam room is posted as out of order A woman who joined me at the spot in the morning was deeply disappointed as she had booked solely to handle her sinus problems I marked the hotel is not clean which is unfair It is due solely to disgusting damp paper towel s lying about near the swimming pool which put me off swimming The treatment rooms which are advertised even in the key card Exist solely as a sign on the door I have shown the sign and the rather disturbingly unsanitary and messy inside storage area I am sure it will be a very nice hotel when it is finished And so I don t blame the individual staff even the young man who rang my bell to be sure that I didn t want to be disturbed waking me , There are a number of things but you missed them would be to detract from my outrage at being cheated what a fraudulent advertisement that there were small facilities that is at least a salon and see bath and wellness facility that was not simply under construction
218930,Park Plaza London Waterloo, They should have complimentary bottled water as a 4 star hotel, Bed was super comfy with what felt like memory foam mattress topper Check in was not supposed to be until 2pm but I arrived early and checked in straight away at 12pm 
218931,Park Plaza London Waterloo, False advertising as treatment rooms not yet available The hotel have prioritised style over practicalitys, Clean but it s a very new building Location
218932,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The shower floor slope was even with the bathroom floor so if you tried to use the rain type showerhead on the ceiling the bathroom floor would flood ,No Positive
218933,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Breakfast was just too expensive, Impressive hotel with a clean ultra modern setting Really impressed by the control panel in the room there was a lovely fragrance throughout the hotel Incredibly impressed
218934,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The smart lighting was a bit of a nuisance it kept switching off while we were in the room So having restored the lighting we would have to go to turn off the bathroom light as it was activated at the same time I hate the noise of extractor fans , The location is extremely quiet yet just a short walk from Westminster Bridge You don t hear the sound of the almost constant emergency vehicle sirens nearby The hotel is quiet too Choice of small eateries within a few yards 
218935,Park Plaza London Waterloo, They said they had a spa and there was no spa room service food was never right and knowledge of the staff of facilities and surrounding area was very poor, I like the location and the style in the bar was nice friendly
218936,Park Plaza London Waterloo, When I booked my room I booked a city view top floor kings suite I was very unhappy to not get this as I was planing on taking photos and posting them on my blog and Instagram of the beautiful city view so the fact that I didn t totally get what I payed for made me unhappy but as I was visiting galleries all day and it was raining my feet were wet and I was tired so I therefore didn t address it other wise I could not fault the service The view really wasn t worth taking a picture off , Enjoyed a lovely meal couldn t fault it ox cheek with truffles the meat was beautiful so tender and the truffles added that extra flavour as well as a luxurious feel to the dish To top it off I also had the chocolate moose with pecans and caramel sauce which complimented the main course The staff at the Park Plaza have been courteous and welcoming informing me of their brand new facilities only opened 2 months ago impeccable service would definitely recommend it to friends family and my followers Just when you need that break enjoy the spa and pool which I did Or even if it s a business trip or a romantic getaway 
218937,Park Plaza London Waterloo, There was a slight confusion with our breakfast booking but it was resolved , The reception staff were really friendly and always on hand to help immediately 
218938,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The rudeness of the staff the reception staff didn t know either how to check in or to check out Held my money for an extra week not even an apology if I hadn t call my money would have been gone twice the cost of my stay Pay attention if you recently separated the security staff will know how not to be welcome And do NOT try to be different if you dress slightly quirky the staff will look at you head to toe and judge any of your movement, Not much
218939,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Like many establishments they have the Coca Cola monopoly some of its rivals such as Pepsi would have been eagerly received Also the difference of the three buildings around Waterloo is not fully obvious but that s on us rather than Park Plaza s Would have been nice to have an up to date on the minute bill the one they had on the smart TV showed nothing , Lovely hotel great room service and mini bar Lovely room with tablets to control lights A C and blinds Loved the Sky channels made available 
218940,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The spa the swimming pool is tiny to say the hotel is huge and is open to children therefore is not a relaxing environment , Rooms were spotless and plenty of facilities inc powerful hairdryer and iron Showers were lovely and bed very comfortable The gym facilities are also excellent
218941,Park Plaza London Waterloo, First room had a draft coming through from under cupboards but given its a new hotel expect teething issues Manager was great and moved us straight away to a new room which was lovely Old room took a while to warm up so not sure if AC isn t working as should Small cleanliness issues such as wrappers under drawer and window ledge stains First room minibar was half empty Second room still things missing Also as the hotel is next to a train station the room can be noisy I don t think it s built in a way to keep our the train and road vehicle noise The other point walls and doors are thin so thin that each time someone in hotel rooms next to us are opening their door we thought someone is opening out door Also opening and closing doors as well as talking is easily heard from your room bed , Manager of the hotel was great Post issues she resolved also had complimentary treats which was nice In the new room bed was comfortable and TV screen placed infront of the bed is fairly large and has sky movies which was good Room was fairly tidy and clean but house keeping were very responsive Didn t have to wait at all for any extras needed Room service was prompt 
218942,Park Plaza London Waterloo, The window outside was blocked so not much natural light could come in the room was either too hot or too cold as there was setting for automatic, it was a new hotel
218943,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Toothbrush toothpaste was not provided A bit unusual as all the hotels I ve been provided these two , The location is very good because you can walk to the Westminister Embankment to take pictures of the Big Ben and the London Eye The distance is around 10 15 minutes it is not long as you get carried away looking the views whilst you walk When arrived to the Big Ben area you can then proceed walk the whole london such as the Piccaddly circus where the M Ms and Lego shop is And then Soho Chinatown for food etc The hotel inside is very pretty and the rooms too Have funky lighting such as full light where the room is bright moody lighting which is a little romantic with a blue neon lighting wall or just go pitch black to sleep Also have a TV too that we listened to music everynight until we fell asleep Have basic needs like towels soaps robes shower cap Has a gym and a spa but I didn t go because no time Also a bar and a resturant The price for 2 nights roughly 350 pounds for 2 people so 175 per night It is London and it was near central so it was an appropiate price Free WIFI too 
218944,Park Plaza London Waterloo, Not really long enough stay to experience any dislikes, The welcome and the whole experience was always first class The staff were always cheerful and couldn t do enough for you
