196788,Best Western Premier Trocadero La Tour, The hotel was full so we had a room right in the eaves Great view but tiny and slow lift , The bed WAS extra comfy The breakfast was the usual but nicely presented and tasty 
196789,Best Western Premier Trocadero La Tour, When we returned to our room late one afternoon the room had not been cleaned no reason offered Also they were reluctant to re stock the tea and coffee for some odd reason When we complained we were given 1 tea bag and 1 sachet of coffee , location was ok if you know paris
196790,Best Western Premier Trocadero La Tour, Noise from other apartment building all night affected our sleep but hotel management solved this issue, Bed was comfortable Room nicely appointed but small 
196791,Best Western Premier Trocadero La Tour, Small elevator A sign indicates that they have an historical stairway therefore not possible to modify to accommodate a bigger elevator , Cozy hotel family friendly quiet room very confortable The staff was welcoming and fun to deal with The location close to Paris main attractions was just perfect for us as the kids didn t have to walk too much 
196792,Best Western Premier Trocadero La Tour, noisy sound from construction near my room and the room may need extra lock otherwise the key card, Nice location close to shopping area and easy to get metro

196795,Best Western Premier Trocadero La Tour, Do not leave your valuables behind when leaving the room My mom left behind a 100 Euro bill in her wallet which was in the closet and it was missing when we came back I reported to the reception but they didn t do much about it and their response was that the manager was on leave and is not responding to voicemail , The location is quite good walk able distance to the Eiffel Tower 
196796,Best Western Premier Trocadero La Tour,No Negative, Fantastic location clean excellent staff lovely family room with large bathroom Very comfortable Will stay here again Highly recommended The cafes shops and neighborhood is a hidden diamond

196804,Best Western Premier Trocadero La Tour, Mould in the bathrooms Go buy some mould killer get a scrubbing brush get rid of the mould Install a fan in the bathroom to help get the steam out That s the cause of the mould The mould is completely unacceptable , Staff were extremely helpful friendly The hotel is located in a very fashionable part of Paris is easily accessible to some absolute icons of Paris So many good qualities for this little gem Make no mistake it is not a Four Seasons hotel It is Best Western It is a small hard working little hotel they try to do a good job I give them 99 out of a 100 for delivering the best they can with what they have to work with The dining area is pretty the buffet was well done The express breakfast was very good value The elevator is tiny but quite quick between floors Ask for a lower floor if you don t want a long hike The decor in the lobby is timber which is lovely but makes the area dark but it s clean polished so looks impressive Same goes for the rooms Older style French decor It sits well with the overall ambiance 
196805,Best Western Premier Trocadero La Tour, Could not think of anything some might consider the rooms and lift a bit petite but that justs adds to the character of a memorable trip, This Hotel is set in the nice authentically French district of Passy and is very convient for the Metro and the Eiffel Tower We found a very good restaurant nearby for our Saturday night dinner and a good crepe restaurant for lunch This is a small character hotel located off the main rue but very good We had a double room for my wife and I and a triple room for our 3 adult children The staff were all very polite and all spoke good English We were able to leave our luggage whilst we went site seeing which was very helpfull
