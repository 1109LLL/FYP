444563,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn,No Negative, Great location for visiting the Palace and for access to the underground Staff were brilliant and very helpful Will stay there again on my next visit to Vienna 
444564,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, the hotel blocks an additional amount of money as deposit a bit overpriced for a pretty basic room , the hotel is clean rooms are comfortable Air condition and wifi work good 
444565,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, Nothing to complain about , All staff we were in contact with were extremely pleasant and helpful Rooms were of a decent size and were very quiet Firm bed which was very comfortable Hotel was in a great location for visiting the palace and easy access to the underground for visiting the city centre Trains were very frequent with one every four or five minutes 
444566,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, I ve been there 2 years ago and the rooms looked far better than now Now it looks like a cheap motel Someone needs to do some refurbishing , The locations is great Secure parking 
444567,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, Very strange that with the cost of rooms at 250 300 Euro there is no Slippers and robe not even shoehorn Not nice The same evening in the restaurant why only one person works He is also a waiter and a bartender The order to wait for 20 30 minutes Disgrace Here s the German of greed , 
444568,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, Think that only being offered the buffet breakfast at 19 euros was expensive I only wanted tea and croissant and would have basically liked to purchase only that Second day I went out for breakfast at schonnebrun castle at 8 50 euros which gave me exactly what I wanted,No Positive
444569,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, Parking spaces on the street are very limited , Location close to Palace and the park Very tasty dinner Silent rooms however street view Coffee and tea making facilities in the room 
444570,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, damaged curtain not very attractive part of Viena GO GO clubs sex shops Erotic Cinemas almost 10 stops with metro to reach city center still about 10 15 minutes , very good breakfast quiet calm room private guided parking you can borrow an umbrella so close to Schonbrunn 2 steps away from Metro there was ironing stuff in room also kettle with tea and express coffee
444571,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, The cleaning lady were knocking three times in the morning We were still sleeping that s not ok At one moment she opened the door , So quet perfect for relaxing 
444572,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, Two things for poor rating and you should consider the first when reading this 1 The hotel refused to cancel my reservation free of charge even I canceled 24h before arriving which was aligned with the terms and conditions 2 There is no Free WiFi in the rooms which I believe to be essential and and must have, Access to subway Good room 
444573,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, Lacking of English tv channels at the same time 20 Arabic was strange also although interior is outdated it could be better maintained , Great location and friendly staff Good breakfast 
444574,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, For this amount of money paid for a night would be reasonable to have a breakfast included Additional price of 19euro person 19 euros parking 8 euro internet fee is charging the whole accommodation with additional 50 Missing beauty kit in the bath, Quiet and very comfortable room located on the 5th floor clean and equipped with everything that you need ironing plate and iron machine Lovely minibar corner with coffee machine and champagne bucket with bag for ice cubes If you are a runner on the hotel entrance are prepared fresh water apples and a small towel running map full on your need for free Shonbrunn is on 7 min walk distance 
444575,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn,No Negative, When we arrived they offered us a great solution for secure parking and wifi just a bit over the price i reserved our rooms We arrived by 2 in the night and still we got great service by really nice people Breakfast was great thanks Gy rgy for helping us out with our problems and morning coffees Having tea and coffee in the room was great in this season The location is also a must why you have to rent your rooms here 
444576,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, Nothing comes to mind, Breakfast selection very good excellent coffee We were also given a complimentary upgrade to a business room which was spacious and super quiet just what was needed after a 14 hour flight 
444577,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, Cannot find any fault with the hotel, The staff are very friendly and helpful and bed is ver comfortable we have stayed here the last four times when visiting Vienna 
444578,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, Wifi is free at the lobby only but not in the room , Staff is very helpful as they helped arranging a room for us when we arrived early in the morning after 14 hour flight That s marvellous 
444579,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, we stayed room 601 and at the aisle aircondition was very noisy electric noise reception said can not change or stop and In the room big spiders in the room we need to catch them and put out from the window , location is good just next to the sch nbrunn If there was no noise in the room then want to come back again 
444580,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn,No Negative, Very close to the tube station for quick access to the city centre Immediate area was fine and you can walk to the city centre in 40 mins Good facilities although bar staff very slow Breakfast was good value for money and waiting staff were lovely Only complaint was the bed which was too soft but that s personal preference Overall a fine place to stay for a long weekend 
444581,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, Everything was fine, I looked for a hotel close to the Schoenbrunn and I think I found the best Luxurious hotel with amazing service Receptionists served me in great Luxury rooms are very well kept and clean Next time when i will come back to Vienna i will return to this hotel Thank you very much for your hospitality and professionalism
444582,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, Restaurant and small bar area on the ground floor but that s pretty much it But if you just need a good room with a good bed this is great , Nice room good bed and a full size desk Very good value 
444583,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, The carpet in the room was stained , The staff is friendly and helpful The hotel is just a short walk from Schoenbrunn Palace and from the U4 subway that takes you quickly to the historic city center The building is nice 
444584,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, Large tourist groups multiple times per week Long lines for breakfast Staff keeps up is professional and friendly but just too many people , Great Staff good location to Schloss Schoenbrunn conventions conferences not very close to city i e shopping etc Good price for Vienna 
444585,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn,No Negative, This tourist hotel represented very good value and the breakfast was excellent The staff were friendly and effecient and could not be faulted Whilst the facilities were good it is a three star hotel and not a four star 
444586,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, Cleaness below every standard Ignorant and useless staff at reception desk The hotel cost me 30 more than was shown on booking site 4 star hotel I don t think so barely 2 This hotel is a shame for Marriott wich has excellent hotels and services around the world , The wifi internet was excellent good bads good breakfast 
444587,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn,No Negative, For business in Schoenbrunn excellent location 5 min walk from U4 Schoenbrunn Very comfortable business category room with large bed wifi and breakfast Breakfast buffet was really good fresh and delicious Service and friendliness of staff deserves extra bonus If you are looking for some Vienna traditional restaurant don t choose anything than the famous Plachutta in Hietzing which is less than 2 km away and try the Tafelspitz nowhere else ever found better than there 
444588,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, Very basic and somewhat tired The staff is indifferent We needed some formal confirmation of our booking from the hotel and contacted them several times with no reply Breakfast is too expensive , Quite close to the train station and Schoenbrunn palace Was not overcrouded in December The kettle fridge and iron in the room were very useful 
444589,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, We did not like the waiter at the restaurant who served us dinner on December 30 2015 evening He did not change the table cloth which had food stains looked unhygienic When pointed out he just scratched on the stain blew some air from his mouth and left like that He was not courteous and his etiquette was not befitting his role as a waiter of a decent restaurant Our opinion is that this person was not of Austrian origin he has not received proper training he does not know does not care about the values and customs of Austria Western Europe It is good that immigrants are given jobs but this cannot happen at the cost of not ensuring that they are fit for the job and without adequate and proper training It should be emphasized that the person who attended to us during our breakfasts was just the opposite He was excellent courteous friendly with a smile and service minded He spoke German and English too and was of European origin We are not prejudiced so we hope our criticism and remarks will be understood and taken in a positive way The room It was too hot and thus very uncomfortable and difficult to sleep at night The air temperature control did not function This is a waste of energy which one should be concerned about in the context of climate change problems Furthermore think of the energy savings that can be achieved Courtyard by Marriot must do something in this respect , Location close to the Metro station Ramp at the entrance facilitates transport of luggage very much appreciated The room cleaning personnel Housekeeping were very service minded and do deserve praise and appreciation 
444590,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, We asked for double bed but we got a twin room instead without any explanation or excuse The elevator is slow the parking is 19 eur per day and the garage is very complicated to use The room is not very clean for example there was mold on a shower holder and stains on the bathroom door I had some problems with internet in the room as well even though you mostly pay extra for it , The location is good for Vienna near Schoenbrunn and near metro station 6 stops to the city centre The beds were comfortable and the room was spacious 
444591,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, We usually go to small family run hotels or bed and breakfasts but thought we would treat ourselves to something upmarket and go to a Marriott This hotel was not at all what we were expecting It was more like a UK Travel Lodge or Premiere Inn where we have had great stays it is just that this was not what we were expecting Staff were generally somewhat grumpy though we understand this is not unusual in Vienna Our bed was broken and could not be used There was no alternative room for us and no manager available to speak to As the next day was a Saturday we were told there would still be no manager to speak to We were offered camp beds We were understandably unhappy about this so the bed was fixed late in the evening by putting boxes underneath it This worked and the staff dealing with this were very friendly but again it is not what should have been expected Internet was only free in public areas and did not work well there In general we were very disappointed after looking forward so much to our visit to this hotel We visit Austria fairly often but will not go back to this hotel There are plenty others to choose from , The location was good for our needs as we were visiting family nearby It was also good for the Schoenbrunn Christmas Market and the underground for getting into the centre of Vienna There were tea and coffee making facilities in the room which we have not been used to in Austria which was good and the room was very clean and quiet 
444592,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, Rooms would do with some facelift Insulation is not appropriate You could hear the mechanics of the elevator in the rooftop rooms , Breakfast is value for money 
444593,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, We traveled as a family with 2 girls The beds in the room were not what I paid for on booking I chose 2 single beds and one large double and when I got at the hotel I was told that such an option doesn t exist so I received a room with one large double and a sofa for our 2 girls The room was at the 6th floor last one and didn t looked as in pictures presented on booking , The staff from the reception location and breakfast
444594,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, 1 Hotel requests a deposit of 50 they say as a guarantee what for a credit card was used to make a reservation 2 Expensive breakfast 3 Internet fee, Location cleanliness U bahn access
444595,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, There was no assitance or amenity provided to carry three bags of luggage to the room at check in or from the room at check out Limited lunch menu No room with a view , Proximity to the Schonbrunn Palace makes this accomodation comfortable for tourists keen on exploring the Palace or attending music concerts at the Palace Excellent orthopaedic mattresses 
444596,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, I was checked in a small roomo as I requested a handicap during my booking So disappointed The male in the reception is not friendly at all very sarcastic to every question asked , Property is close for my main factor u
444597,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, After doing the booking I had repeatedly requested early check in but the hotel didn t respond to my requests As expected I reached the hotel a few hours earlier than the check in time I was weary after a long travel my spouse was sick But we had to wait for quite some time before getting the room Though this was technically before regular check in time my experience at various other destinations has been better than that here , This hotel balances what you pay with what you get U bahn local train network stop Schonbrunn palace and supermarket are each about 7 8min walk You can reach Ringstrasse in about 10min by U bahn The hotel area and the rooms were very clean quiet And yes there IS a coffee maker in the room which though basic was hard to find in several Austrian Swiss hotels I visited recently

444599,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn,No Negative, The staff is impressively helpful and very accessible They helped us with everything from directions to narrowing down the best places to visit Kudos The location is far enough from the main city to miss the crowd but close enough to get to the main city centre within a couple of stops on the underground 
444600,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, Being 4star it did not offer potter service so if u travel with loads of luggage be aware Thou it did it cause much of a problem for us but it s a service mostly need my people traveling with kids , Best part of this Hotel is its location it s walking distance from schonburnn palace and metro station Room are comfortable and very clean there initiative to save water is appreciated Reception staff are very helpful and courteous 
444601,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, There were heavy and constant construction works in the nearby plot and we could actually not enjoy even one single late morning sleep Works were starting 8 AM and noise was immense Moreover those guys were shoving huge steel poles in the ground so we could feel our bed shivering Awful and I am confident the hotel should had warned us for this seeing we explicitly asked for a quiet room , The main goal was to get a hotel close to the Schoenbrunn park and we got it no doubt It was also 3 minutes walk from the train station so this came as a bonus 
444602,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, There is no self service laundrette and neither quick laundry service at the hotel A very big disadvantage for a family travelling with young children on a holiday Very less options for the vegetarians at the restaurant , The front desk service was excellent and would like to especially thank Ms Suzzana Nadova for her help and support to make our stay so enjoyable and comfortable in Vienna The underground train station was within minutes of walking distance from the hotel 
444603,Courtyard by Marriott Vienna Schoenbrunn, Receptionist on duty when we arrived was unpleasant to deal with She wasn t very welcoming and gave the impression that we were inconveniencing her by checking in , Very close to Schonbrunn Palace waiters were great and food very good Our room was very nice and comfortable
