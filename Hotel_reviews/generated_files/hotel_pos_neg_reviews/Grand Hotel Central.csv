478819,Grand Hotel Central, Room was a little small and noisy housekeeping kept their trolley outside the room so we were woken a few times by their chatter in the mornings , Location was amazing all the sights on our doorstep beautiful hotel helpful friendly staff lovely roof terrace pool open until late in the evening small compact gym that had everything you needed to work out and free mini bar not something you see in hotels of this standard so a nice touch 
478820,Grand Hotel Central, The food menus could possibly of also catered for people who aren t as adventurous with their food , The staff were all happy and went above and beyond Their response to requests was increadiably fast they could not do enough for us Hotel facilities were second to none 
478821,Grand Hotel Central, Wifi was a bit inconsistent in the room and only one could use the network at a time Worked well in common areas of hotel though Coffee machine didn t work too well and would not stop pouring out Did not raise these with hotel staff and I know they would have helped resolve these issues had we have brought them up , The staff were incredible From the moment we checked in until check out Very helpful with making bookings and resolving issues we had The sky bar is great Views pool drinks and service were all fantastic When our air conditioning wasn t working one night the staff were accomodating at moving us to another room in the middle of the night 
478822,Grand Hotel Central, The room was SO dark Ladies if you put on make up this is the wrong place for you Modern clean but DARK In the lobby I heard other guests talking about how dark their rooms were Oddly outside of our window was a light single light bulb which was on and very bright till around 3 in the morning Shone into our faces hard to sleep Could not be turned off We could have pulled down the roller but I can t sleep in pitch dark room I need a little bit of the blinds open I had asked to be away from elevators and they gave me a room right next to the employee elevators which was extremely noisy , Great location Comfortable bed Nice shower

478828,Grand Hotel Central, Wi Fi in room was really really slow Not sure why my telephone manner presented a higher image than seeing me with longish hair but I guess some people are more judgemental on appearance Will be going back as that is the only comment , Very attentive staff Alonso Hermo Marcal and Herman all made for a warm greeting and the excellent staff on the rooftop area apologies for not getting your names made that personal touch Nice upgrade for our 25th Anniversary as the first room was not quite suitable Thank you for that
478829,Grand Hotel Central, Nothing the place is amazing , room was amazing staff incredibly efficient and friendly The roof top bar is to die for There is nothing to dislike about this place really just need to be careful about dropping off luggage if you drive but most people don t as we nearly had a handbag snatched by a passing cylist

478845,Grand Hotel Central, The staff at the rooftop bar needed a bit more training They always seemed to be taking orders to the wrong tables and missing parts of orders , This hotel just has everything you need for a luxury city break Rooftop bar and pool were big plus points for us Concierge gave us fantastic restaurant recommendations booked for us Staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the breakfast was excellent 
478846,Grand Hotel Central, Sauna has to be booked for an extra charge 50 euros p h , While the hotel itself is certainly among the best ones I have ever seen breath taking view from the rooftop delicious breakfast spacious rooms comfy lobby free cava champagne in the mornings among other things the service quality was absolutely beyond anything I had ever experienced From the initial pre check in reception all the way to post check out assistance all crew members were going the extra mile at all times to make sure our stay was a delight I would like to give my special thanks to Alonso the Doorman who s full of excellent tourism ideas that are unlikely to be found in travel guides every time he saw us he was always so positive and proactive and on multiple occasions suggested fantastic ways to spend our time in Barcelona his humor and enthusiasm are unique and contagious Overall by far the best hotel choice in Catalonia and great value for money 
478847,Grand Hotel Central,No Negative, The staff were absolutely wonderful They were extremely professional and helpful The hotel was also in the best location It was a 10 minute walk to all the major sites

478854,Grand Hotel Central, Nothing to say was simply fantastic , Beautiful looking hotel in perfect location Staff looked after us from the first to the last minute Roof terrece has a fantastic view of Barcelona a must see Will definitely be returning 
478855,Grand Hotel Central, Shower in the room just ok nicer version of the typical European hotel shower Everything in the bathroom was updated and adequate but other hotels we have stayed at in different cities at the same price range had nicer bathrooms Rooftop bar is only open until 9pm during the winter months, Exceptional service and location This was the most comfortable bed we slept in during our 3 city tour of Spain I was pleasantly surprised by the multi course dinner special at the restaurant for hotel guests 39 pp it was advertised as 3 courses and a drink for 39 euro per person we ended up getting 2 extra snacks and an extra glass of wine given to us and the free drink was any cocktail on their list not some cheap Cava that you might expect as the freebie at a lot of the restaurants in town 
478856,Grand Hotel Central, The rooms we are little too dark and the walls outside the rooms were dark grey which gave me a little depressed feeling , Staff that remembers who you are what you like and assist where possible
478857,Grand Hotel Central, Nast rude female staff, The front desk female staff is obnoxious and rude We witnessed them being rude to other guests and then rude to us as we were departing They also spoke bad about customers in Spanish they didn t realize that we speak the language too I m disgusted with the female staff I expected better
478858,Grand Hotel Central, We asked for a room with a view which was facing the street however while minor you could hear some traffic in the mornings We suggest you ask for a room at the rear , This hotel is in a great location between the port and Gothic area which is loved walking through each day The staff were really very friendly and helpful They even provided a room on the day we were leaving late to take a quick shower and freshen up for our flight home The quality of the breakfast was exceptional and overall 10 out of 10 for this hotel 
478859,Grand Hotel Central, Lighting in the room made it a bit hard to read at night , The concierge was very helpful recommending restaurants The breakfast buffet was terrific Location is excellent 
478860,Grand Hotel Central, Main lobby lighting must sparkle and invite Clients, Front desk staff were very cordial and took care of each transfer tour pick up and directions
478861,Grand Hotel Central, Steam room or sauna actually costs an additional SEVENTY EUROS per bath Plus requires booking in advance Unbelievable Swimming pool seems to be home to a number pigeons and sea gulls who like to drink from and bathe in the water If you don t mind the wildlife the views are actually very good Rooms are good but very small Have had more spacious rooms in even 2 star hotels Some of the mini bar costs are enough to make even regular 5 star hotel guests spit out their coffee Save yourself 5 for a tiny bottle of still water and get about 10 litres of the stuff literally across the road , Very good location friendly staff good roof top bar 
478862,Grand Hotel Central,No Negative, The bed was so comfortable and the rooftop bar was a really cool place to go night or day The staff were all really helpful and very friendly Excellent hotel 
478863,Grand Hotel Central, My friends gave me a gift massage for my birthday and the hotel delivered the invoice with the cost and only later delivered the actual gift certificate That should not have happened , Loved the impeccable service The room and bathroom size were great I had friends staying at the more expensive Cotton House and the rooms and service at Grand Hotel Central were far better 
478864,Grand Hotel Central, Wish I d checked that there wasn t any parking Parking was an added extra expense Also room was rather disappointing small and no view , We loved the rooftop facilities The staff were wonderful 
478865,Grand Hotel Central, Can t think of anything, Very comfortable hotel Smart clean and quiet room Good housekeeping staff Excellent concierge and assistance for restaurant bookings and directions Great central location could walk to everything Would highly recommend this hotel 
478866,Grand Hotel Central, Foam pillows , Good location in the Gothic District of Barcelona This hotel caters to a hip chic traveler The room was basic but comfortable with all amenities you would expect at an upscale 4 plus star hotel The sky bar on the rooftop was relaxing place to sit and view the city with an infinity pool and lounge area The restaurant downstairs was very good and inexpensive for the quality of the food 
478867,Grand Hotel Central, One of the guys at reception looked at me like I didn t belong there because I m young and had a skateboard in my hand, Bar staff were really friendly
478868,Grand Hotel Central, Plastic wine glasses at pool bar not cleaned properly lipstick and fingerprints from previous user Obviously had not been washed properly For such a nice area you need to find better shatter proof glasses The ones you are using are basic picnic glasses which were very poor quality and difficult to keep clean and look scratched and dirty , Staff were great concierge was great bed was great pool bar was great
478869,Grand Hotel Central, The only thing that could have been better was there wasn t any storage for toiletries in the bathroom It is a gorgeous modern look but not very functional However very easy to overlook given how incredible the room as a whole was , This hotel was in an excellent location adjacent to the El Born neighborhood The staff was all very friendly and they all spoke English Upon check in the manager upgraded our room which we thought was fabulous The room was fantastic and had incredible roll down shades inside the windows to block out all the city light The room was super spacious even compared to US standards We had a separate tub and shower area The rooftop pool and lounge area with bar was an added bonus with an incredible view of the city We had cocktails there twice during our stay I highly recommend this hotel 
478870,Grand Hotel Central, we were disappointed that the children s beds had not been made up when they said they would rather than us arriving back from dinner and having to ask the maids to come at 10pm the hotel itself is a bit dark and gloomy we found it difficult to get the lights to properly illuminate the room , the staff were lovely when my son was ill on our last day he was unable to sightsee and the concierge allowed us to delay our check out until it was almost time for us to leave for the airport Staff also helped point out the bus stops for the tourist bus recommended child friendly restaurants and flagged down many taxis for us we loved the food the breakfasts the lunch in particular was amazing quality and a fantastic set price the bar snacks were similar and of course the roof top bar with its amazing views seating and swimming pool we spend two lovely evenings up there before going to dinner
478871,Grand Hotel Central, So many kids there which surprised me for the style of hotel it is Very luxurious and classy and ruined by many kids charging around and bombing in the pool Nothing worst then relaxing and sunbathing to be getting wet every time a kid dives into the pool I ve got no problem with kids just felt like either the staff or there parents should have more control over them , Hotel vibe was perfect Very luxurious great location lovely pool area and great staff Very efficient with how they work 
478872,Grand Hotel Central, Superior room was very tiny for the price For 300 euros a night you should be able to expect the door to be more than 2 3 meters from the edge of the bed ,No Positive
478873,Grand Hotel Central, Lack of sunbeds on terrace Unreliable towel supply on pool terrace No duvet on bed Concierge lack of knowledge Coffee at breakfast luke warm Dirty plastic glasses at terrace bar, Front of house staff Pool Cleanliness
478874,Grand Hotel Central, Room was too small to feel relaxed there metal bed frame took away from an otherwise luxurious 5 star feeing, Location friendly and helpful staff rooftop pool shower and bath products built in international adapter
478875,Grand Hotel Central, The only thing we really didn t like was that one day staff was smoking in the rooftop pantry kitchen and that a chef was seen picking sliced fruit from containers and putting it in his mouth with his bare hands and licking fingers Despite the fact that the roof wasn t open to just everyone from the street it did get a bit crowded up there and we feel personnel should help a bit more to keep people from hogging the beds and the sofa s with towels while not actually using them for sometimes an hour or longer on end We had to wait and couldn t sit to eat and drink while others had left their towels to reserve a space I guess the waiters were just too nice to remove them , The hotel was small enough for staff to recognize you as a guest and to have nice conversations They took excellent care of anyone who d enter the lobby and were very helpful There are some very nice spaces like the library one of our kids needed to study a bit and this was a great space there was also the nice and light breakfast restaurant and the rooftop terrace with infinity pool There was always fresh cold lemon water in the lobby available and there were apples and sweets as well Personnel on all floors were helpful and genuinely smiling 
478876,Grand Hotel Central, The only thing that constantly was nagging us was the actions of the staff during breakfast They missed the order quite often i e bringing black tea or even coffee instead of ordered green bringing hard boiled instead of soft boiled eggs bringing two eggs on several occasions even though we explicitly ordered one etc Not a big deal especially that otherwise the selection of food was excellent , The terrace and the pool on the top offers breathtaking views while relaxing in the sun Although limited amount of places was occasionally challenging The reception staff is polite attentive and professional Location provides easy walk access to most of the things in the city 
478877,Grand Hotel Central, Pool was packed so packed that there were no seats anywhere Asked how it was so packed and they indicated non hotel guests were using the pool We tried 3 4 different times to use it with the same results No seats so we left We waited for a while just standing to get a drink with no luck Staff there was swamped We did get to use it the last day and it was wonderful The views drinks and food Disappointed though that we got ready to swim and relax multiple times and had to come back to the rooms immediately , Liked location Friendly staff at the front desk and concierge The front desk people were happy knowledgeable extremely helpful and always had great recommendations That was the best front desk out of all the hotels we stayed on our vacation in Spain 
478878,Grand Hotel Central, Breakfast was not up to five star hotel standard very unhappy about the sky bar the day we arrived went for pre dinner drinks unable to get a seat as other guests were using all the main bar seating area for sunbathing Went back later for night cap the bar haven t been tidied up with rubbish and towels lying all over the place the young bar staff appear to have no control on stopping guests hogging bar seating area for hours on end other thing that really annoyed me was the 70 euro charge to use the steam room and sauna for 45 minutes , Location and the area staff were most helpful rooms were good 
478879,Grand Hotel Central, The price fore food water and coffee was to high I live at better hotels whit lover prices 5 EURO for 0 33 Cl of water is to high Get a grip Hotel central Barcelona , The bed was good to sleep in Personal was grate and the pool at that the 7 floor was nice 
478880,Grand Hotel Central, Thought we had breakfast included but didn t an extremely expensive hotel so did expect to have something like breakfast inlcuded rather than paying so much for a room Exchange rate changed by the time we were there and the difference was HUGE also so pay upfront when booking Not allowed to reserve a table for drinks at the rooftop meaning both nights we went up we could not sit down and therefore weren t allowed to have a drink whilst standing Staff tried to accommodate but we went elsewhere after waiting as we were a group of 11 , Beautiful rooftop very comfortable beds and shutters over windows meaning the rooms stayed very dark Good location 
478881,Grand Hotel Central, the pool deck was always a little crowded and the cost of the drinks were a pretty high for Barcelona, the pool deck was beautiful and that s the reason why we chose this hotel the location was prime and it was very clean and well maintained
478882,Grand Hotel Central,No Negative, Our whole experience was delightful The hotel was a dream Everything is run like clockwork we had no need to contact staff about anything The location is excellent the hotel is beautifully presented It is glamorous yet understated and not pretentious I travelled with my 16 year old and we both felt very comfortable The room was great the bathroom was top notch The highlight will always be the roof and pool but the whole package is excellent I cannot fault a thing 
478883,Grand Hotel Central, The rooms are very basic and small but clean, the roof top bar is amazing and the staff are really polite and welcoming Perfect location I cannot wait to return 
478884,Grand Hotel Central, Awful The most terrible hotel experience Due to the papery walls every wc using of the next rooms is audible The staff dont know the customare care There is not natural ventilation in the rooms You cant open the windows I have got genius rank at the booking com but due to this hotel I will not book by the booking com never more No longer I delete my profile ,No Positive
478885,Grand Hotel Central, One of the check in staff was very rude to me I did not deal with him again , The breakfast was exceptional and the higher members of staff were very professional and went to great lengths to assisted me with my stay Leaving me very happy The pool bar was great and dinner menu was great but book ahead of time I will stay here again when I return to Barcelona 
478886,Grand Hotel Central, No sound insulation You hear all your neighbours snoring Executive rooms are tiny The pictures do not represent the reality The toilet and the bedroom are in the same space You partner hears how you go on toilet Horrible Lifts smell like someone has died in them No privacy Housekeeping comes 3 times a day starting from 9am to wake you up and even if you hang do not disturb sign they knock on neighbours door and you hear everything because there is no sound insulation Then they start banging the floor of the neighbour with vacum cleaner so forget getting any sleep in the morning the key card was getting reset everyday So every time you have to go to reception and ask for new one No toilet brush Internet only 3 devices per room , Possibly the best location in Barcelona The roof terrace has a great view and good cocktails 
478887,Grand Hotel Central, The foor and wall so thin we can hear everything out side especially room above us we can hear men wear his shoe or woman in heel walking back and ford in the room quite frustrated , The location
478888,Grand Hotel Central, I wished they offered Breakfast on the roof terrace , Gorgeous modern design and wonderful luxury appointments in every room Staff is superb The location is the best in the old quarter of Barcelona all of the major sights are within a few blocks The rooftop infinity swimming pool is too too beautiful and you ll want that pool during the warm days of Spring and Summer 
478889,Grand Hotel Central, the window in my room did not close fully hence the sounds of Barcelona at night seeped in, the swimming pool bar wonderful location with a vista to boot 
478890,Grand Hotel Central, Not a major issue but I did inform the hotel in advance that the stay was part of our honeymoon but there was no mention of this during our stay which was a little disappointing, Rooftop bar pool
478891,Grand Hotel Central,No Negative, Helpful staff clean room but small in size and good Wi Fi facility one on the reception called Hermo was really helpful and provide us the right advise where to go Excellent hotel location 
478892,Grand Hotel Central,No Negative, Beds were amazingly comfortable Sky bar and pool area nothing but exceptional Ideal location in the gothic district walking distance to the beach and most main attractions I would go back in a heartbeat 
478893,Grand Hotel Central, The room was dark and smaller than it seemed in the photos Overall the hotel was very dark The pool was cold and had no shallow end for our kids to swim in Also I booked an extra night by accident and was refused a refund , The food and service was excellent Staff were very friendly and helpful 
478894,Grand Hotel Central, When we arrived at the hotel the receptionist was a bit too friendly and asked my boyfriend to carry the bags in the room by himself which is very bad We are a young couple however we re used to attend 5 hotels and this never happened anywhere else before I think this should not happen as it s a minimum service to carry the luggage and show us the room When we arrived in the room we where suprised because there was a wall right in front of our window with a man smoking his cigarette and looking at us No intimicy Of course we asked to change the room immediatly and we were offered another room which was fine According to me the staff should anticipate more the client s needs especially if you pretend to be a 5 hotel In addition the rooms are not isolated which means that you litterally hear the other clients flushing the toilet , We liked the design of the Hotel in general and of course the pool However it s smaller than on the pics and not heated which is a no go for a 5 hotel with rooftop pool 
478895,Grand Hotel Central, Getting into the hotel was a challenge as there is no street access and we were driving We had to stop in the street with flashers on to get the car unloaded and get directions to the parking structure Dinner at the hotel was very pricey for what was offered Also our rooms were facing the main street and it was noisy until the wee hours , The staff was excellent Very helpful and accommodating The rooms were clean and the breakfast choices were good We were able to walk to the waterfront easily for dinner 
478896,Grand Hotel Central, The shower leaked The cleaner didn t remove a dirty glass from our room , Great location Lovely smell Helpful and polite staff Superb pool bar on the roof terrace 
478897,Grand Hotel Central, The service at the pool bar could be slow I would also recommend a more organized check out area as the wait was too long , The location in the Gothic area has close access to La Rambla Passeig Gracia and several historic sites The Concierge staff were friendly and helpful 
478898,Grand Hotel Central, Sorry couldn t fault it , The room was amazing very clean and spacious and lovely view Large comfy bed and electronic blackout blinds The infinity pool left me speechless Very tasty breakfast lots of choice Go on you re worth it 
478899,Grand Hotel Central, Nothing at all , All the staff were very friendly and helpful We arrived into Barcelona early in the morning and went straight to the hotel to drop our bags off On arrival we were allowed to check in early which was really appreciated The location of the hotel is perfect for exploring the city The views from the roof bar were lovely and I really liked the modern decor inside The bed was really comfy with a good bathroom too The breakfast although pricey was probably the best hotel breakfast my husband and I have had A huge variety of foods and all fresh and well cooked preserved The cocktails in the bar were excellent too Our flight home to Geneva was cancelled at the last minute and we couldn t rebook our flights until two days later so we returned to the hotel to check in for another two nights On our return the staff were very sympathetic and treated us to an upgrade which was fantastic We also used the hotel s car service to the airport and the driver was very friendly too The hotel really went along way to ensuring my husband and I had a lovely decadent few days away 
478900,Grand Hotel Central, Lovely champagne buffet breakfast however on some occasions the food was cold cool and would have been much tastier if warm i e the fried scrambled eggs the pancakes the croissants View from the room wasn t the best Overlooked a children s play area however this did not effect our stay Wifi connection in the room was intermittent , Very friendly and helpful staff Excellent location Amazing rooftop bar and pool Very comfy beds Very stylish modern hotel We loved our stay here and will 100 stay here again 
478901,Grand Hotel Central, Dim lighting in rooms is atmospheric but can make it difficult to see Overdoes the moody dark grey theme , Excellent breakfast Friendly and helpful staff Great location Cool rooftop bar Welcomed our 3 boys who had a great time 
478902,Grand Hotel Central, Very slow wi fi, Excellent location and a very chic room we were in the junior suite Apart from the wi fi being a bit slow I can t fault the place The staff were great and the hotel had a brilliant sky bar at the roof Pity the pool was not in use when we were staying
478903,Grand Hotel Central, You need to call and have some one over to open and close the windows They are normally sealed , Exceptional staff and great location Very good breakfast buffet 
478904,Grand Hotel Central, Hotel is great but expensive Lighting in the hotel is weak in the rooms in the corridors and in the lobby this need to be improved , The staff was so great and helpful and I would like to thank Jaime for being the best hotel staff during my stay very helpful and always gave us the good advise about our tour in Barcelona
478905,Grand Hotel Central, Noisy from main road and metro despite being upgraded Room not cleaned from 10 to 4 whilst we we were out No hot water last day , The staff Very friendly anyway but also no hot water on last day Staff deducted money from bill 
478906,Grand Hotel Central, The Breakfast unfortunately the breakfast was a little weak in selection It would benefit greatly by having a cooked selection on offer regarding how you want your eggs etc Also in a hotel such as this I would have expected fresh salmon to be on the buffet and or more local produce such as found in the Market at Los Rambolas , The Staff were excellent very helpful and proactive The location of the hotel was wonderful The general ambience of the hotel was comfortable and not so pretentious I have recommended this hotel to many of my friends as an ideal location for visiting Barcelona 
478907,Grand Hotel Central, Nothing at all everything was perfect and awesome, Hotel customer service was fabulous and for sure I will recommend it to who ever travel to Barcelona
478908,Grand Hotel Central, Gym is too small, Really friendly and attentive staff on the front desk lovely and comfortable room awesome roof terrace Great central location for getting round the city Can t recommend this hotel highly enough 
478909,Grand Hotel Central, Lovely room but the noise from lift forced us to wear ear plugs No problem as room was top notch, The staff were fantastic from the guys on the door who couldn t do enough to help to the reception staff They were extremely helpful and provided excellent recommendations for restaurants and bars 
478910,Grand Hotel Central, First off when we arrived in the room the extra bed for our 13yr old was in the corridor in the room but you had to walk like a crab to edge round it It was moved later that day to beside our bed but really there wasn t space then between the beds and the desk to make coffee We made the best of it Only a few nights there and the hotel was full I checked or I would have paid for upgrade , Staff location bed all good Infact staff were great
478911,Grand Hotel Central, The king bed was actually two twins connected No proper blanket Housekeeping moving the stuff which they are not supposed to You can feel cost saving everyday something missed towel or chocolate or tea , Location obviously was an advantage Staff was very polite and helpful Rooms were clean View was very nice Loved the rooftop 
478912,Grand Hotel Central, The pillows were not good we would suggest them to offer a pillow program we have seen that in many hotels before and that was an advantage , Rooms were good and the location perfect 
478913,Grand Hotel Central, staff in the Restaurant and the bar not always attentive we waited for more than 25 minutes in the City Bar for the order also the staff during our dinner was not really fast attentive Rooms are not very big, great location beautiful pool very nice staff at the reception breakfast was really good very nice bathroom
478914,Grand Hotel Central,No Negative, what a great hotel location room s amenities and and awesome roof top bar and one of the top ten roof top bars in the world Can t wait to go back in the spring and summer 
478915,Grand Hotel Central, there s nothing not to like about The Grand Central, friendly staff excellent location in heart of city beautiful breakfast very well appointed large room 
478916,Grand Hotel Central, Roof top view not as advertised but ok , great location very clean and modern style easy access to main attractions City tour bus stop only a few minutes away 
478917,Grand Hotel Central,No Negative, A delay on check in was compensated by a free cocktail on the pool terrace and an upgrade Very quick and good room service Excellent breakfast quality buffet with the enough variety and avoiding huge mountains of food
478918,Grand Hotel Central, The deluxe King room has a nice city view but the noise from the street is something which cannot be ignored despite the double sealed window On top of that the window cannot be opened luckily we brought with us ear plugs so we slept just fine , The amazing rooftop and the city view leaves you breathless the room was in general very comfortable and the bed was excellent the service provided by the staff was nothing but perfect A problem with the coffee machine in our room was solved immediately We also received a bottle of Cava from the staff as a birthday gift The hotel restaurant was also excellent and maintains the same high level of service 
478919,Grand Hotel Central, The room overall was a bit small Although the bed was large it sort of filled most of the room The bathroom had glass doors so no real privacy when you went to the toilet , Really nice Hotel in a good location Close to bars and main attractions Friendly and helpful staff Had one of the most comfortable beds i ve stayed in excellent pillows and really spacious
478920,Grand Hotel Central, room was a bit too small mainly due to the huge king size bed put in the middle room and bathroom are separated by a sliding door which does not totally insulate the two rooms, Location high standard attention to details
478921,Grand Hotel Central, 1 Breakfast is very symbolic i e nothing to eat at all and fit only for a dire 3 vegetarian diet though elegantly arranged 2 VERY limited space to arrange your garment in the room and no good place to storage your luggage i e your feel like on a provincial railway station relates to deluxe king room 3 Though booked over a month in advance on a cancellation tariff i e no deposits presumed the story is this 3 1 Deposit was immediately preauthorised and in USD on a Euro card 3 2 I already left the hotel and fully paid for stay in cash but Euro 200 of pre auth in still there and the hotel people insist it is a problem with MY BANK which ALWAYS releases money in MAX 3 minutes after cancellation operation and confirms it by SMS Guess if you want to credit the hotel for couple of months your help would not even be confirmed and thanked for , Location staff elegant design and generally VERY CAREFUL attempt to look like 5 
478922,Grand Hotel Central, Room was a bit smaller than I had expected and there was only one window so it could be a bit dingey even in the day The bathroom was not fully seperated and you could see the toilet from the bed even when the door was shut which was strange Although our room was non smoking there was a strong smoke smell occasionally I think coming through ventilation When we went there was works going on throughout the hotel and the skybar was closed which was disapointing , Fantastic location Nice vybe in the hotel with a great city bar lounge area and fantastic views of city from roof terrace Staff were very friendly and helpful Gym facilities were good i would imagine that it is a bit small during periods though Bed was very comfortable and blackout blinds made for a great nights sleep 
478923,Grand Hotel Central, The deluxe king room offers a basic comfort and without a good separation with the bathroom area The room although on the seventh floor was a bit noisy from the street Generally it seems to not be in a 5 stars hotel , The hotel location is perfect to reach many places of interest just walking The City Bar at the ground floor even if small offers a good breakfast and a good relaxing area 
478924,Grand Hotel Central, nothing, This is one of the most inspiring hotels one could ever stay in Amazing views beautifully appointed rooms interesting art Very friendly and helpful staff a perfect spot and a fantastic pool on the roof terrace 
478925,Grand Hotel Central, Only issue was with quality of the cocktails on one of the nights that we stayed But that was just a minor bump in an otherwise excellent stay , Great location friendly and efficient staff A superb relaxing stay Just what we needed 
478926,Grand Hotel Central, These are quibbles rather than major issues but Poor design of room and bathroom No full length mirror Lighting in wrong place Window blind arrangement not ideal , Huge comfortable bed Friendly helpful staff Decent wardrobe space roof top space and pool
478927,Grand Hotel Central, Nothing really although the location is a little noises but that s to be expected in city centre location , Great location very friendly and helpful staff and lovely roof terrace 
478928,Grand Hotel Central, We stayed in room 101 which although was very comfortable was next to a waste water pipe which we could hear every so often , The staff could not do enough for you provided very good recommendations for local tapas bars Roof top bar was a great way to end an afternoon evening 
478929,Grand Hotel Central,No Negative, fabulous hotel which has been refurbished to a high modern standard but still friendly and very helpful also felt that additional services such as drinks in the hotel were reasonable especially given the standard and the location which was excellent
478930,Grand Hotel Central,No Negative, A true 5 star experience but with a very homely feel thanks to the welcoming and helpful staff Location of the hotel was perfect for all quarters of the City and easy to access the Metro Excellent food City Bar very relaxing and good value whilst the rooftop Skybar offered fabulous views over the illuminated if rather chilly late October after all pool Nothing is too much trouble for the staff at the front desk in the bars or at the front door The quality of the hotel made a great holiday even better 
478931,Grand Hotel Central, Not much really A bit mean with tea and coffee supplies in the room but delivered promptly when we asked Maybe the cocktail menu could be a bit more extensive Bathrobes were thin small , This is a great hotel near the old town It has a lovely roof terrace just for residents so not too busy when we were there October The staff were really attentive very hardworking friendly and helpful We had breakfast some evening meals tapas in the bar all very good This is obviously a really well managed hotel where customer service is a priority

478934,Grand Hotel Central, Not very close to centre , We were so late but Bill is a really nice person He welcomed us very politely though he got sick The room is clean and comfortable So pity we have no time to take the breakfast hope can see Bill again 
478935,Grand Hotel Central, No full length mirror in my room which was annoying room 216 and on 2nd night very noisy drunk next door guests not the hotels fault and the staff were very apologetic and acted quickly and moved me to another room upgrade so problem sorted, Lovely staff helpful friendly and professional Sky Bar on rooftop is a fabulous retreat at any time of the day but especially at sunset Super location for this classy hotel

478941,Grand Hotel Central, the Skybar was very very disappointing the view is beautiful however it felt as if the staff were unwilling to work incompetent and it s sad to have such a unique spot and not doing your best to give the best experience possible , Front office staff reception porters were absolutely great kind and their propositions for places to go and restaurants to eat at were excellent 
478942,Grand Hotel Central, Wifi was not available many times which was a problem for me Breakfast is expensive here There are many cafes restaurants right next door that offer excellent options , The hotel is pricey but that s what you pay for the great location the helpful staff the crisp clean bed and bath linen I loved the turn down service at night with the little chocolates and the bottles of water We ve stayed here twice and service is consistently great
