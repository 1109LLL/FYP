503486,Good Hotel London, Elevator was broken throughout stay Carpet in room could use a clean , Stayed an extra day after business conference to go sightseeing Fun location close to Emirates Airline Easy access to public transport 
503487,Good Hotel London, The rooms were tiny and compact but there was lots of space in the corridors which was wasted The walls were really thin so you could here the people next door and the door alarms kept going off to the room which was very irritating , Perfect location for what we wanted as we did the prudential ride London 
503488,Good Hotel London, Would of been nice to of had a TV in the room Had to boil the kettle on the floor Toilet was extremely loud also you could hear people in the next room and their toilet The toilet nd shower was very small For 169 00 for one night was a rip off the room was supposed to of been a delux one just because it had a view of the river There was people in the river on water shoots so that was right outside the room Not impressed at all very disappointed won t be staying there again The ibis was more luxurious then the good hotel , Didn t have breakfast as it was to expensive
503489,Good Hotel London,No Negative, I really liked the hotel and it s ethos The only thing I would comment on was the acoustics I think it would be better to have a proper wooden door on the bathroom so that you didn t have to listen to what was going on in there x
503490,Good Hotel London, Nightmare visit The noise of the regular aeroplanes taking off in the morning from about 5am is unbearable I thought the first one was about to crash it was so shockingly loud A dodgy adapter was plugged in when we first arrived and so I blew all the fuses for our room and next door within minutes of arriving so after sitting in the dark for ages we were moved to another room when they decided it couldn t be fixed Staff were unprofessional and promised us they would serve us at the bar in 5 minutes after the floor had dried but after 5 mins of us waiting and them socialising loudly they closed up and went home for the night When we told reception about our electricity problem there were chefs drinking cocktails at the desk who couldn t help us , It was a quirky hotel which was the reason we booked it being an old floating prison It is right next to the cable car over to the O2 which is great fun and helpful for getting to the O2 After problems with our room s electricity we were given a free breakfast which was really good 
503491,Good Hotel London,No Negative, Comfort was amazing the staff were lovely the layout is really awkward though as you can easily get lost as everything is the same the stairs were really steep and with an eledely lady with us it was really good for tbat I wouldn t even like young children to use the stairs cleanliness was really good only stayed 1 night for Celine Dion concert at o2 the transport air shuttle to o2 is amazing though so easy
503492,Good Hotel London, We had a suite No wardrobe at all They had coat hangers hanging on the wall on nails The bathroom was one corner of the rectangular room It was like living in a box with zero design input It was a corner room but it only had a window on one side Very poor value for 233 a night plus 15 for parking , The hotel was close to Olympic Park
503493,Good Hotel London, very very very thin walls I could hear the person next door on the toilet and full conversations A private party so unable to use terrace bar which one of the reasons for choosing this hotels rather than others in the area Also went to the bar at 11 15pm to be told it was closed and we d have to wait for night staff not sure why they couldn t cross over so no disruption to guests , breakfast was lovely reception staff friendly and very helpful
503494,Good Hotel London, If i had to be really picky the only thing that wasnt great was that the pillows were too big and puffy for my liking but thats just personal preference , In a great area Really quiet and away from the hustle and bustle of the city 
503495,Good Hotel London,No Negative, The room was very large for a London hotel shower excellent and bed superb Really like the fact there is no TV I always seem to get the drunken idiot next door watching Star Wars loudly at 3 am Roof terrace bar very nice shame it does not open past 9 30 pm 
503496,Good Hotel London,No Negative, The hotel was very modern and stylish the staff very helpful and kind which I loved The breakfast was lovely and fresh Beds are very comfy I did feel the room I wasn t aware prior the room was that size or layout and the bathroom as well was quite small It would ve been nice to see pictures too but overall good experience 
503497,Good Hotel London,No Negative, I had booked a room with a river view and the views from the hotel room window were magnificent In the morning you could see some people swimming in the Royal Victoria Dock I loved the decor and the room was very comfortable I also recommend taking the river bus and the cable car to get to the hotel from central London you get a whole new perspective on London 
503498,Good Hotel London, Staff need to be a more focused if doing table service in the bar area Asked if they did it told they did took ages for someone to come over and only did after asking a member of staff Had to go to the barr o pay as no one cleared my table after I had finished Staff friendly though ,No Positive
503499,Good Hotel London, Hair dryer in the room Toilet to be more private I e Not a glass door, I loved the room It was perfect for the two of us The idea of the roof garden was a lovely idea 
503500,Good Hotel London, room was super small but only stopped one night and had everything we needed am thinking they have bigger rooms for longer stops, location for the 02 was really good clean and modern
503501,Good Hotel London, Lift was out of action Not enough power points in room , Very good location for the o2 arena or London city airport Right next to the sky rail and close 100m to the light rail 
503502,Good Hotel London, Nothing It was spot on , It was very accommodating of the staff to allow us to order takeaway and eat it in the lounge while we played scrabble at 1am after we got back from the O2 
503503,Good Hotel London, Elevator never worked the room was on the small side Bar prices were a bit steep Carpet in room was dirty , Unique location on the water by docks Property was unique and comfortable Roof top bar area and sitting area inside Lot more interesting than other hotels in area 
503504,Good Hotel London,No Negative, loved the bed If I could have gotten away with it I d have left with one strapped to my back Easy access to the o2 arena Loved the staff really friendly and helpful Loved the location 
503505,Good Hotel London, Cannot think of anything that could be better, The staff were attentive location fabulous facilities excellent air bus to O2 water taxis or river boat nearby
503506,Good Hotel London, We were given two single beds although booked a double It was rectified after we spoke to a staff member The room was quite small hence my reply for value for money, The bed was comfortable 
503507,Good Hotel London, Simple stuff no hair dryer in room and I was promised a receipt via email but had to chase , Like the novelty of staying on a boat that is what made me travel out of town 
503508,Good Hotel London, Lifts were not working on ALL 5 days not difficult normally but I specifically booked on checking lifts availability as I have limited mobility Late check out not entertained even for Genius membership of Bookings com strictly one hour extra Shower drain not efficient making the bath room floor a mini pool not so useful comfortable plug points Yet to receive the receipt printer was not working still awaiting email receipt , Comfortable bed Good WiFi Helpful staff who even helped with Luggage as lifts were not working free Handy phone to use with in city very useful Neat and modern hotel Ease of access with DLR with in walking distance Cafe shops Tesco very nearby Next door to Emirates line Very close to London City airport 
503509,Good Hotel London, The rooms at least the our one are very small so do not take big luggage or many shirts there is no cabinet This is not a negative comment just count with that , The Good Hotel is really good although it looks like a container barge and it is really floating Everything is new nice and modern We spent two nights there during a hot week in June and I have to admit that the air conditioning was able to keep the room cool Note the room safe which was not only present but really worked The staff is very friendly and helpful they manage everything with a smile Really enjoying stay And with the non profit idea you can say that you re helping a bit 
503510,Good Hotel London, the problem is my bed did Dip in the middle that is the only problem i found, food very good staff at the Hotel are very nice Easy to get on with every body will go out of their way to help you i will be booking with GOOD HOTEL AGAIN very nice stay there also eating out nice places to eat at a good price
503511,Good Hotel London, Lift was broken and stairs quite steep Room was compact but functional No chance of a lie in due to planes from City Airport , The bed was super comfortable and the whole hotel very clean and well kept Friendly and helpful staff Very convenient for ExCel 
503512,Good Hotel London, Not enough bed pillowS that s just me being picky btw, really cool hotel staff are lovely rooftop bar is very nice Very clean and clever use of space Short walk to emirates cable car and tube station HIGHLY recommended 
503513,Good Hotel London, Free breakfast would ve rounded the stay off nicely , Very handy location great design and cool rooms on the small side but all you need for a one night stay 
503514,Good Hotel London, The room and bathroom were very small with little space for our bags etc Parking is difficult with no space allocated for bag drop off , The bed was comfortable and the staff were exceptionally helpful The public space was very pleasant 
503515,Good Hotel London, Didn t like how when we got back to the hotel you couldn t purchase anything with cash had to be card Although recpetion did order us a dominos which had in our room , Staff were lovely Let us check out an hour later than usual Rooms great and fab location Would stay again 
503516,Good Hotel London, Do note though that the hotel is directly under the flight path for London City Airport So you get quite a bit of aircraft noise during the day from 6 30am until 10 pm when flights stop , located around a 10 min walk to Excel London I arrived late night and the staff were very friendly and welcoming The room was very clean and nice The worry doll on my pillow was and unexpected and cute touch No hairdryer in room can be requested No screens either really is just a nice clean calm space to sleep I loved the community ethos of this hotel I would stay again 
503517,Good Hotel London, Lifts were not working and we have to climb the stairs , Their concept is very interesting The staff were happy On the front office Abdul was really helpful 
503518,Good Hotel London, Lift not working Restaurant service abysmal Accommodation like a rabbit hutch Hotel is a converted prison ship Hence gangways are steep Not suitable for people with mobility issues such as myself , Nothing
503519,Good Hotel London, The walls between the rooms are a little thin and you can overhear the muffled sound of conversation or even snoring of your neighbours But this is minor it s a bit like in your own home , The room was extremely comfortable with all the facilities you may need for your stay available if not in the room itself then by request including the use of an iron I made specific requests during my booking and found that they were all available for me fantastic I also needed the hotel to be close to the London Excell centre and it was as directed about 200m from door to door 
503520,Good Hotel London, Rooms are really small and there is no privacy when going to the bathroom Due to lack of proper air flow in the bathroom everything feel wet constantly Make sure you leave the sign to clean the room when going out if you want service It seems that if you don t there is no service and with the above issue in the bathroom you most probably will want to have the room cleaned every day The walls are also quite thin so you can hear everything your neighbors are doing or saying Breakfast is quite sad for the price requested especially the coffee seems to be drawn directly from the Thames river and the air conditioning in that area blows air directly from the North Pole I also highly recommend that a notice is given before the windows are cleaned so that the customers will not present themselves au naturel to the window cleaners , The hotel looks really nice The concept of profit going to helping people in need is also a BIG plus It is also close to DRL meaning that it is easy to reach the city center and you have a Tesco right in front of the hotel European plugs and USB chargers in the room are also a welcomed surprise 
503521,Good Hotel London, Staff failed to give wake up call one day and were a few minutes late on another Lift out of action for full 3 days of my stay A member of staff carried my large case to my 2nd floor room but even so the staircase really a fire escape was far too steep and narrow for a76yr old man with an arthritic hip Suggest another back up lift installed , Huge comfortable bed friendly staff unbeatable location very pleasant sun deck bar on roof with amazing views 
503522,Good Hotel London, Dirty smudged mirror on arrival in room Kettle didn t reach any surface could only use it on the floor or the bin see photos Room was conciderably smaller than it appeared in adverts Lift was working had to use and carry very heavy bags up quite steep stairs , The location was top notch for our stay as we were going to the O2 to see a band Hotel was clean and pleasing to the eye Helpful and very friendly staff
503523,Good Hotel London, Room was very small but view and cleanliness made up for that, Very clean staff extremely helpful and friendly room had a great view bed was very comfortable and the roof top bar was lovely food good too Would definitely stay again
503524,Good Hotel London, One of the cups in our room was dirty had a long strand of hair inside of it and it had tea coffee stains on the inside We could only find one plug so charging our laptop and phones was difficult Not enough signs in the hotel telling us where things are worked around for a while trying to find the roof top bar and if our room wasn t next to the ironing room we wouldn t have known it existed , The rooftop bar was lovely however the service was really slow had to wait about 15 minutes for a drink 
503525,Good Hotel London, The welcome from check in could be better It took a while to find our reservation but no small talk or were you travelling from ect The curtains were stained with what looked like chocolate and pen marks When we told the staff and check out the respons was usually housekeeping notes these things Weird to let it sit I missed a bedside lamp and I am not a fan of bathroom doors which can t close and there is no TV or radio , The bed was comfy The room was hip modern decorated Nice quilt Location was great out of the busy center but very easy to travel to the center via DLR or Canning Town Tube USB outlet and other power outlets The rooftop bar had a great view Also they had a Handy s free smartphone you can use during your stay 
503526,Good Hotel London, Poor breakfast Ran out of bacon at 9am on a sat Not a very good hot selection and poorly presented Cold selection was ok tho But for the price of breakfast which was extra it wasn t the best , Location to o2 it was a cool hotel Good staff
503527,Good Hotel London, we stayed for 2 nights but they didn t clean the room after 1 night Bad organisation we were not foreseen for breakfast and this was included in the price elevator didn t work too small rooms, breakfast
503528,Good Hotel London, It was not really a big problem for me but it would be better if the room numbers are made bigger It would be especially helpful for older guests , The staff are very helpful accomodating and friendly 
503529,Good Hotel London, Nothing, The hotel was very clean the staff were helpful and friendly Ideally situated to travel around London Right on the doorstep was the Emirates Air Line cable car 
503530,Good Hotel London, Facilities like hair dryer was not available in room had to go to reception to get it The wire for kettle was too short Not enough power points to do tea plus laptop etc , The hotel was very clean The bed was comfortable 
503531,Good Hotel London, There was no hair dryer in the room but really it s the only weak point , I absolutely recommend it The rooms are not huge but light and well equipped The hotel s style is minimal but really stylish and fresh I loved it The room comes with a free to use uk sim phone with unlimited internet usage so in case you have no time to charge your own it s really handy I was a bit wary of the transportation but I must say the location is perfect with easy access to the city by always good service of DLR I have to add as other reviewers have also mentioned that the bathroom doors are sort of semi transparent and symbolic If privacy matters for you and you re travelling with somenone else than your sibling or partner it s better two book two rooms PS The hotel is literally shipped from the Netherlands and it s suited with both UK electrical sockets and the original EU standard ones So if you re travelling from EU you don t need to carry an adapter 
503532,Good Hotel London, The double room was small normal for London and was ok for me on my own but I think it would have been cramped for two people , The location was excellent and the staff were very friendly The hotel is right next to the Emirates Air Line chair lift which is fantastic for sightseeing and getting To the O2 in North Greenwich 
503533,Good Hotel London, I wrote a not on my booking that it was my girlfriends birthday and asked if there was any chance we could have some kind of decoration put in the room but nobody read this note until we checked in We were then told that we were given a free upgrade however we were still in the room that I booked , The staff were very friendly I was fascinated by the history of the hotel and it was great that there were still original features There was a little handy phone in the room which can be used for finding your way around London Apart from being so close to the airport the location is perfect for a London break It s fairly quiet Apart from the planes but still very easy access to central 
503534,Good Hotel London, The people in the room next to us where noisy and up until 2am However after notifying reception they went up and spoke to them about their noise , Great views and friendly staff
503535,Good Hotel London,No Negative, It was value for money very modern but the room was very small Great value compared to the surrounding hotels very suitable if you just need a room to crash and not a space to spend any real time in 
503536,Good Hotel London, Elevator was broken for two days my room was two flights up Not a lot of fun dragging the bags up and down the stairs , The sweet potato fries in the restaurant are amazing
503537,Good Hotel London, Can t think of anything I didn t like but be aware of the fact that the landing strip of London City Airport is just at the end of the dock, Great location on the water DLR line just 2 minutes walking
503538,Good Hotel London, However the staff tend to assume you are a tourist when you do not look English Not a good thing to do as it can appear quite condescending The bathroom area was disgusting The tile in the shower room had someone s bogie stuck onto the tile and the toilet area had splashes of brown on the tile behind the toilet and soap marks on the tile of the sink Disgusting The room carpet had not been hovered as I saw the same dirt when I first came to the room and when I left I thought it was a permanent mark but it wasn t It was actually a dirt on the carpet Don t know why they cannot keep the room clean as the room is not even big The maid is very mean with the milk sachets Gave two sachets when she should be leaving four i e two coffee and two teas The phone never worked and the maid never checked to see if this is working There are no tvs in the room so no entertainment in the room , Bed was very comfortable 
503539,Good Hotel London, the door for the bathroom was also the same door for the shower i would rather them be two different doors, It was just amazing the staff were fab The person checking me in apologise about my room not quite being ready not that i had an issue with that but even so she treated me very well and offered me a drink while i waited i also love the idea of a mobile phone coming with each room which is perfect to take as a back up phone incase your one goes down and you need to contact someone in an emergency the rooms were small but still felt very roomy 
503540,Good Hotel London, I think that just because someone looks foreign it does not mean that they are The staff here has a tendency to generalise this which is very disconcerting The cleanliness of the room is least to be desired My room was not clean on the first day and the carpets have never been hovered The tiles in the bathroom are absolutely disgusting You can even see a bogie in the bathroom tile Behind the toilet seat the wall has brown splash and by the sink the walls have old splashes of soapy water Disgraceful Although they give you coffee and tea to drink the maid only leaves you two milk sachets Amazing On the whole the staff are very pleasant although,No Positive
503541,Good Hotel London, Size of room no tv lift not working no parking roof top bar shuts at 9pm Had to ask for milk to make drink as none was provided in room with tea and coffee hardly any space to hang your clothes , Bed comfy 
503542,Good Hotel London, Irritated that my tapas dish not cooked as described on menu Disappointed in off milk sachets bith just little things that coukd be imoroved to make an okay stay an excellent one , Quirky location in the docks crissing a gangway to enter hotel Efficient check in Lift not working but not a problem for us Relieved to find a restaurant on board as travel weary Good interesting menu with burgers and tapas etc Slightly disappointed one of my tapas dishes 3 fir 16 garlic king prawns with grilled pineapple and popcorn came without either pineapple or popcorn and when asked about was brought a bowl of cold pineapple chunks obviously from a tin Too tired to make any more if it Ither two dishes were good Halloumi and vegetabke temoura skewer on soucy cous cous and chirizo and popcorb chicken cone Daughter s burger was okay katsu chicken She said a bit dry Whatvwas delightful about dinner was the view from the restaurant over the docks to the O2 and Emirates Air Ride Room very good Bed very comfortable and free wifi welcomed Bathroom is compact but has all you need There was a hand held devuce in the room Handy which is fir guests use to access the internet etc Ours wasn t working which was a shame as would have been useful Only other bad thing was the uht milk in the tube sachets provided in the room was off and curdled our bedtime tea meaning we had to throw them and go without As freshly showered and in pyjamas didn t fancy going to reception to request more and there isn t a ohone in the room to call them Didn t have time for breakfast next morning but what I saw if it looked great Bug bowls of apples around public areas so grabbed a couple of those for later 
503543,Good Hotel London, The room and bathroom were very small ok for us as weren t spending much time there but for the price we expected it to be a little bigger I do understand it is part of the experience of being in a cabin but it did feel a bit too compact , It was in an excellent location for O2 and Olympic Park and we enjoyed getting the cable car Emirates Air there Staff were friendly and breakfast was delicious It was amazing eating breakfast over looking the River Thames where people were swimming past And as it was a sweltering day we were so thankful for the air conditioning in the room and a powerful shower 
503544,Good Hotel London, We turned up at 4 45pm very hot and stressed as transport of due to cancelling of tube meant it took 2 hours to get to hotel upon arrival we thought we could book in at 3pm which was late anyway compared to most hotels to be told at 4 45 our rooms were not ready When I asked about this and displayed my frustration was then told we could have both of our rooms not the best start The rooms were very very small we booked a double room at 130 for one night If I had to stay there for more than one night I would feel it would be too small not enough room to swing a cat No air con and it was 31 outside No TV No hairdryer and no wardrobe Just 5 hooks on the wall with a hanger from it Toilet door swings inside and outside toilet area to ensure space to move but no privacy Rooms just far far too small The cost of the breakfast at 13 a head was very disappointing for the offer Breakfast hot option which only offered scrabbled egg and beans I do not eat meat was not what I expected missing the hash browns mushroom and tomatoes would I stay there again for value no , The location perfect for the O2 arena The weather was great so sitting outside was lovely as I did not want to be cooped up inside my cabin room Bed was comfortable Love being next to Emirate cable cars 
503545,Good Hotel London, The rooms are very small and look like converted prison cells We had a free upgrade to a deluxe room so I wouldnt have wanted a standard room if the deluxe was as small as it was but as only for an overnight stay it was acceptable , Good location All transport services within a 3 minute walk Nice touch that all the staff are from long term out of work so the company have a retraining programme 
503546,Good Hotel London, Rooms a little cramped poor location of plugs No hairdryer for my partner , Good value for money very friendly and helpful staff Enjoyed the bar restaurant area very stylish and clean 
503547,Good Hotel London, The price and breakfast selection Definitely not worth buying There is cafe within a minutes walk, The view from the room was amazing I was shocked at what I was actually getting
503548,Good Hotel London, No tv in room Hot in the room as you couldn t open the windows Queued for a beer at midnight to be told that they were closing the bar as they were short staffed Opened it after complaints , Nice looking hotel Good location 
503549,Good Hotel London, Came out of O2 cable car closed and also tube station Nightmare trying to get to Hotel it took two hours so for that reason alone I would not go to that side of the river again , Cleanliness of rooms and helpfulness of staff Able to access by Emirate air cable car 
503550,Good Hotel London,No Negative, You do not tell people that a there was no TV in the room and b booked it specifically for the roof top garden which wasn t even open Very disappointed in your mis advertised information

503552,Good Hotel London, Absolutely nothing to not like , The whole hotel was so friendly and welcoming from the staff to the decor we were treated well as soon as we walked through the doors until the moment we left And the bed was incredibly comfy 
503553,Good Hotel London, The only downside was the water in front of the hotel did have rubbish in it but next day a member of staff was fishing out as much as possible , Could not fault really Such friendly and welcoming staff Disappointed that roof garden was not open but Health and Safety checks had to be made which is good to know Hope I can visit later in the year Lovely to see some wildlife ie Geese with their baby goslings walking past hotel 
503554,Good Hotel London, No tv I think this would be a great hotel if you re on business or just need somewhere nice to sleep but not spend time , We were upgraded by the hotel to a view over the Thames which was beautiful 
503555,Good Hotel London, The breakfast , We ve stayed at the good hotel in Amsterdam and now also London Love it and would come again was a little disappointed at the breakfast so had to go elsewhere
503556,Good Hotel London, Nothing Just disappointed that the roof terrace wasn t finished in time for our stay oh well we ll just have to go back , A lovely welcome from reception on arrival and helping us with transport arrangements We enjoyed a water side room with a view over to the O2 arena The rooms are small but extremely clean modern and a lovely shower The tube station Royal Victoria is a 1 minute walk away use Seagull Lane exit very convenient plus the Emirates cable cars station is on the doorstep too We loved the bar area and relaxing sofas dotted around it had a very modern feel 
503557,Good Hotel London, I liked the fact there was no tv in the room especially as it was the night of the terrorist attack on London Bridge but would ve liked a hairdryer or to be told there would be one available on request , When the hotel knew it was my birthday I was treated to a hand written note with tokens for complimentary drinks at the bar A lovely touch thank you The staff were all so obliging 
503558,Good Hotel London, The fact the website said feather pillows and bath robes but neither were there , The style and atmosphere Staff were very friendly and accommodating 
503559,Good Hotel London, Very expensive drinks 5 for a small bottle of beer The bar closes extremely early for a London hotel and no where local is open for late night drinks , Very cool vibe very relaxing atmosphere 
503560,Good Hotel London, Rooms bit small and basic but easy to ask for anything via intercom which was brought up to room immediately , Comfy bed clean and staff were very helpful and pleasant Location was beautiful and peaceful and easy to get to on DLR 
503561,Good Hotel London, asked for a double and got two singles told it was a double just push them together but they kept on pulling apart very unconformable night sleep glad it was only for one night a little far away from main london roof terrace not open was not told rooms are very small would not go again, modern
503562,Good Hotel London, Very basic not even a TV in the room and incredibly small rooms Kettle provided but had to get down on my hands knees plug it in under a desk as that was the only available point it had a very short lead No wardrobe only a few hooks on the wall to hang clothes, It was in a good location

503565,Good Hotel London, The rooms were too small and basic cold have been made a little more cosier , Breakfast amazing staff v friendly hotel lounge etc fabulous but rooms were pretty basic and small Would go back 
503566,Good Hotel London,No Negative, The interior was chic staff were amazing Fauve on reception on the last night was ever so helpful she managed to lend me her personal phone charger went out of her way to help give this girl a promotion knows how to deal with people very professional The room was a little small but amazing very clean and comfortable 
503567,Good Hotel London, There was nothing we didn t like , This hotel was very easily accessible once you knew hoe to find it The nearest tube station is Royal Victoria and then you cross the road and follow the path to towards the Emirate Docks where the cable cars start terminate It took us a while because we got off the tube at Canning Town and walked but when we found it GREAT The girl that checked us in was efficient and helpful The whole experience was stressfree The facilities are excellent and for the price we paid we couldn t have got better value for money It was a last minute booking and I would go again I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel

503572,Good Hotel London, Our group had 2 rooms for a 3 night stay As soon as money was taken as we checked in they no longer cared Rooms are a lot smaller than average No tv in room no fridge or hairdryer either I had to phone reception the first morning and ask where the hairdryer was was informed she d bring one up to me but this never happened I left the room 90 mins later No roof top terrance even thought the weather was 25 all weekend Upon arrival I discovered menstral stains on the duvet on my bed didnt go looking could see it from the desk asked housekeeping to change it which they did without a single apology On the Saturday one room wasnt cleaned at all and on the sunday when we returned from our event at 5 30pm housekeeping knocked on the door to clean the room with them in it One of the showers were cellotaped to stop it leaking and the restaurant felt more like a bar with a burger you could order with your drink if you fancied Apparently staff think it acceptable to lie to you as well the hairdryer issue included in this Spoke to Alex with a couple of issues on the saturday evening and he informed me they didnt have a manager in and that they wouldnt be in until after the bank holiday convinient as ive checked out by then He also said that it mentions on their website that the terrance wouldnt be open however I cant find any mention if it myself Upon check out he informed me that he d emailed his manager who would get back to me today monday They didnt , Modern reception area interesting concept being on water We re happy to store our luggage before check in ad we arrived early and gave us a drinks token at the bar when we did check in ad they were training a new staff member and it took a little longer than usual 
503573,Good Hotel London, Rooms were tiny and poorly equipped with the only desk space being ruined because the phone had been stuck to the middle of it Bathroom was small with no privacy and toilet didnt flush properly soundproofing was poor with the hotel being directly in the flight path to the City airport and could hear conversations and toilet flushing from other rooms Would not return ,No Positive
503574,Good Hotel London, The toilet wouldn t flush properly and wasn t cleaned before our arrival Room service did not come to clean our room on Sunday Breakfast is expensive for what you get I ended up going to the hotel across the road for breakfast The bar is also very expensive , Great location Amazing river view
503575,Good Hotel London, Everything apart from the free wifi Plug sockets were hidden rooms were too small everytime you opened your room door an alarm went off toilets in the bathrooms didn t flush properly there were no obvious handle on the toilet to flush there not having any TVs in the rooms as I prefer to watch tv by myself and not in the guest lounge so I prefer to have personal viewing to myself the bar on the curtain rail was slanted and the wifi connection wasn t all that good so could have been better So will be staying in a different hotel next time I visit London, The politeness of staff and breakfast 
503576,Good Hotel London, The beer garden advertise in my hotel wasn t open till june , The beds were very comfortable and the temperature of the rooms was nice and cool even when it was roasting outside 
503577,Good Hotel London, Planes flying low overhead no noise cancelling windows Room VERY small and basic no TV only 2 plug sockets in the room , Friendly staff close to tube station
503578,Good Hotel London, No television in the room not hugely important but it is nice when traveling alone to have one , Very modern and clean Bedrooms good size and beds comfy Great value for money Nice views over the river Exactly what you need when travelling alone Would definitely stay again 
503579,Good Hotel London, The rooms are a bit too small , Beautiful designed hotel brilliant concept of the floating very welcoming helpful staff great rich breakfast Warm cosy rooms beautifully designed very comfortable bed Location is very good for ExCel conference visitors 
503580,Good Hotel London, Very little I didn t like Rooms are small was expected given the look of the hotel like it s made of shipping containers but they are perfectly adequate for a short stay , Love the ethical purpose of this hotel Is well run spacious public areas fantastic location and even more fantastic breakfast 
503581,Good Hotel London, It would have been helpful to have more than one plug socket in the room to cope with boiling kettle charging phone Laptop etc Apart from that it was great Will definitely return ,No Positive
503582,Good Hotel London, Room very small okay for a single person and shower room tiny Okay I guess for one or two night stay no longer We were woken 6 30 by hotel staff taking bins out directly below are room would advise anyone staying there not to stay in rooms 105 103 107 which are above the staff exist, Bed was comfortable and the was a room for ironing which is great
503583,Good Hotel London, Lack of electric points in room, Rooms were small but clean and bed very comfortable Hotel location is fabulous on the Thames and public transport very close hotel is quirky and interesting loved the innovative shower and wardrobe staff are friendly and so helpful asked for a hairdryer and was delivered to room in two minutes Must do Thames river bus boarding close by hotel 
503584,Good Hotel London, Toilet wouldn t flush away solids This also happened last time I was there , Simple clean room and public spaces Staff very friendly and helpful 
503585,Good Hotel London, The room is big as a shoe box There is no room for your bags and the window is drafty so you can feel the cold air coming through while you sleep On our first day the shower gel compartment was empty which I found out after getting wet in the shower The staff was cooperative but told us that we had to wait for 15 minutes because they are busy at the moment After dressing up and going to the reception myself I found the 3 of them talking and nobody else at the reception Also for a 4 star hotel I would expect a hair dryer in the room and not having to get one from the front desk One outlet in the toilet was not wired completely so there were wires tucked in a plastic box without a protective cover on it The walls between the rooms are pretty thin so the acoustic insulation is pretty bad you can just hope that your neighbours are not noisy The location is pretty good 2 minutes from the train station but it still takes around 40 minutes to get to the touristy center of London , Handy the travel companion was very helpful during our visit 
503586,Good Hotel London, Didn t think there was enough beer lager choice in the bar We had intended to stay for dinner and drinks in the hotel , Staff were friendly and very helpful The views of the Cable cars were amazing especially at night also to wake up in the morning to watch the water sports out of our window 
503587,Good Hotel London,No Negative, The uniqueness of the overall experience Being able to eatvand look out at the river I really liked the idea of not having TV s in the room which is a first for me The hotel was peaceful and calm 
503588,Good Hotel London, Restaurant staff were rude and told me I had 1 minutes to decide what to eat even though it was supposed to be open for another 15 mins Paper thin walls had to call reception and complain about next door So good if you don t need to be up early next morning but won t go back for business, Clean friendly reception modern convenient location for east London city airport
503589,Good Hotel London, This hotel doesn t have a TV in the room which was a down thing for me because I was there for work and wanted to watch a bit of TV night staff weren t hugely welcoming however the morning staff were very happy to help Other than that this hotel has a great location very modern and great value for money , This hotel is super modern and swanky they have a mobile phone in your room for you to use free of charge which is amazing for anyone who is travelling from international locations I think it was an iPhone Very clean and fresh the room has air con that you can control if you need to contact reception they have intercom in the room by the door which is a cool feature Overall a really nice hotel 
503590,Good Hotel London, Bathroom toilet doors glass couldn t close I understand the design but I m afraid lack of privacy could be a potential issue Let s just say I wouldn t want to have those on a romantic weekend , Fantastic weekend with a friend we went to see a concert at O2 Location Facilities Staff all perfect Tiny remark on the bathroom door but even that does not affect the overall experience Would Recommend 
503591,Good Hotel London, Nothing , Great location cable cars to the 02 and DLR station two minutes away Staff very friendly clean rooms and the food was great in the restaurant Thank you 
503592,Good Hotel London, Another couple were eating breakfast and a member of staff started cleaning the table while they were eating Some staff may need a bit of upskilling, Upgraded room lovely view 
503593,Good Hotel London, On arrival 2 staff stood at reception desk and ignored us completely while the 3rd was serving a customer they appeared to be having technical issues as there was a lot of gesturing and muttering in another language while pointing at the screen Would have been nice to have been greeted on arrival Had to wait until other desk was free to sign in sound proofing terrible could her upstairs flush their toilet the upstairs to left snoring like a train and the neighbours chatting packing at sill AM the following morning Not a good nights rest sadly , the style and design of the property was great and we loved the premise of helping the community The room was compact but to be expected in London toilet door doubled as shower door Breakfast selection was adequate and the coffee was lovely Evening and morning staff very helpful 
503594,Good Hotel London, The room was smaller than expected The towels and other provisions in the room toiletries tea facilities etc gave it the feel of a budget hotel You can hear sounds from neighbouring rooms more than I liked , Clean Room nice foyer and front desk area it s a very design y place very modern Staff were friendly and helpful Love the social community engagement aspect 
503595,Good Hotel London, Would ve liked a bath in the room however in London it is probably slightly optimistic to expect this , Fantastic staff and excellent location breakfast and coffee in the morning was great 
503596,Good Hotel London, The rooms are extremely small and have limited facilities I would mind if it was cheap but it isn t We couldn t move around the room with having to step aside for each other There were only 2 power sockets that I could find not enough if you want to have the lamp on boil a kettle charge both phones The kettle had to be boiled on the floor because the lead was too short to reach the desk The lighting is harsh eg when you want to read in bed and the other person wants to sleep , The Staff were very friendly and genuinely eager to help The breakfast was very nice if a bit pricey 
503597,Good Hotel London, The walls are very thin and could hear a conversation next door There was also a very noisy pump from about 08 30 , Breakfast was great and a lovely member of staff even made a Bloody Mary on request Bed very comfy 
503598,Good Hotel London, No bar or coffee facilities after 11 pm It would be nice if the bar was open a bit later , Excellent location if visiting the 02 Arena Right next to the Emirates cable car which is a lovely scenic ride over the river to the 02 be aware this closes at 11 pm if you intend to take the trip back to the hotel We were on a whistle stop tour for one night to see John Mayer and this is the ideal spot to stay Hotel is comfortable and the staff are very friendly There is a quirky boat bar worth a visit just a short walk around the dockside and a nice Thai restaurant just a bit further along which we would recommend 
503599,Good Hotel London, Slightly erratic flush in the loo , Excellent value in a great location lovely views of the river Really liked the sleek modern design staff exceptional Highly recommended 
503600,Good Hotel London, Rooms not sound proof at all Could clearly hear people talking in side room to the flush sound Everthing ok except the privacy factor Had to speak slowly conscious of neighbouring room Tip to the hotel Please make walls sound proof , Location Customers Service 
503601,Good Hotel London, rooms were not acoustically isolated sound traveled easily from one room to another You can hear exactly what your neighbors next door are doing No TV no dryer the room safe just lay there and could have been easily carried away No cupboard just afew hooks on the wall The room is only a few cm inches wider than the bed Felt like a prison cell , staff was very friendly and always tried to help but seemed not very competent and confident I heard that it s a social project so that makes sense I can easily live with a bit less competence when it s compensated by friendliness and a positive attitude Those young folks were doing good 
503602,Good Hotel London, The toilet door didn t have a lock and it was also the shower door Not recommended if staying with friends, Good hotel staff were very helpful Helped us order a pizza We were drunk 
503603,Good Hotel London, The bathroom didn t have a real door and no lock the shower door swung open to make the door but didn t touch the floor have a rubber seal so the whole bathroom got wet after a shower too It was a little noisy You could hear the people next door etc , The location was great for 02 we took the Emirates cable car over which was great as right next door There s a tesco express opposite Staff were very friendly and helpful Everywhere inside was very clean Very affordable pretty basic and perfect for my trip The WiFi was very quick I was able to watch Netflix without buffering blurry picture I liked the environmentally friendly ethos and ethical fair trade toiletries in the bathroom 
503604,Good Hotel London, The rooms are very small but still lovely and very clean , A great concept a brilliant find in London at an incredibly resonable price We would definitely go back 
503605,Good Hotel London, A T V in the room would have been nice , The staff were amazing and extremely helpful Me and my sister paid for the breakfast in the morning We found it a little pricey however the selection was really good and very tasty We will definitely be going back again and have planned another trip in a couple of months The staff were also very knowledgable about the history of the hotel 
503606,Good Hotel London, No TVs in the rooms, Great views of the river good service Great scheme giving back to the community Comfy bed Good location Unique venue Staff went the extra mile to make the stay special for my mum n dads birthdays by upgrading them for free 
503607,Good Hotel London, Being an engineer The Noise from the plumbing was not good if someone flushed the toilet in the room above you knew it some acoustic treatment to the SVP runs and a bit of insulation and pressure management to the water services would go a long way to cure the noise Also the fire alarm had 2 bright LEDs which flashed every now and again which was a bit annoying Being an Architect The Wayfinding in the hotel looked good but was quite difficult to read especially as the day turned into night as the brushed stainless steel and the low level lighting with reflective grey paint made it hard to read and easy to miss especially as I was new to the building hey my eyes aren t getting any younger The latout of the toilet door and its combine use as a shower screen was novel but was a bit of a fail in my book it also did not offer a feeling of security when you were sitting on the loo All of these points are fairly picky but I m an Architectural Engineering Consultant so , The style was good location excellent and great value for money Can t complain about the Cleanliness of the rooms it was superb 
503608,Good Hotel London, The room and en suite were particularly small The two pillows were very small I had a deluxe room booking which simply meant I had a water front view I didn t feel it was value for money considering it cost an extra 30 for the night and didn t include breakfast which would have been an extra 13 , The bed was comfortable
503609,Good Hotel London, The shower toilet cubicle was a little odd but still cool Didn t like the fact the floors easily got wet once you had a shower though , Great atmosphere cool staff fantastic location clean rooms
503610,Good Hotel London, Very basic very noisy draft at window end so hot feet cold head lack of plugs Had to lift a kettle of boiling water off the floor from under the desk You get what you pay for this was expensive for what it was No tv very loud music in the bar, Bed pillow wifi
503611,Good Hotel London, Rooms like small Posh Cells with no TV or Radio Poor acoustics between rooms could clearly hear people talking next door , Friendly staff clean facilities a good location 
503612,Good Hotel London, I had requested a refund form as i had checked out a day early They promised to send me a day s refund but they have t sent any information regarding this as of yet ,No Positive
503613,Good Hotel London, Although we were only at the hotel for a small percentage of our stay in London the staff were could have been a bit warmer At breakfast the hostess wasn t too welcoming even which was lost points especially when the breakfast was 13 50 per person , Room was very comfortable with very pleasant views of the waterfront We were excited to hear of the rooftop bar but unfortunately it was under construction and not accessible during our stay Love the dockside location Allows you to travel into the centre of London in a variety of modes we opted for Emirate Air Cable Car and Ferry to Tower London Very pleasant 
503614,Good Hotel London, The hotel is under London City Airport flight path so quite noisy when a plane is coming into land Flights stop at 10 pm and restart at 6 30 am so unless you go to bed early should not be much of a problem , Friendly staff who looked after me well Ideally located to Excel with Car parking nearby 
503615,Good Hotel London, The only thing we didn t like was the lack of English breakfast tea in our room Staff said that if we d asked for some then we could of had it but we felt that it should have been provided anyway That s the only thing we had negative to say , We loved the location of the hotel We travelled over to the O2 for our concert and we took the Emirates Air line across and then the tube on the return journey which was just 2 stops There was no parking on site but there s a multi story across the road and it s a flat rate of 15 for 24hrs which is great We loved the quirkiness of the hotel and the story behind how it was made and how it arrived in London The staff were extremely friendly very welcoming and always ready to help We chose a river view room which was wonderful and I had one of the best nights sleep I ve ever had when staying in a hotel room and I ve stayed in quite a few We didn t eat here so I cannot comment on the food 
503616,Good Hotel London, The water around the front of the entrance had a lot of rubbish in it Some could have been hooked up quite easily Shame as it spoilt the view towards the DLR , The staff were so helpful I love the fact that it is a training ground for many young and older staff Brilliant concept and hopefully there will be many more 
503617,Good Hotel London, The room is very basic such as having no TV but we came for a night s stay to rest our heads in a comfortable place and that was exactly what we got although I m aware others may want more than the minimum , The place was a really cheap stay for a London hotel but did not surpass on quality The staff were really helpful and approachable and accommodated us so well The location is amazing with restaurants within the hotel and close by and the DLR and Emirates airline within a two minutes walk Cannot recommend this place more 
503618,Good Hotel London, Nothing loved it, Brilliant hotel Really really impressed would definitely go back Thank you for the drinks on arrival to felt extremely spoilt Perfect location
503619,Good Hotel London, The window doesn t open which made the room stuffy at night despite ventilation It s not worth paying extra for the river view unless you are on 2nd floor our room was on 1st floor facing a walkway The shower toilet doesn t have a key and the door doesn t shut properly The information on the room facilities was scanty we didn t discover the temperature control panel until just before we checked out The choice of tea provided in the room Twinings Earl Grey and Green Tea was good but the coffee was standard Nestl not only is it poor quality but also incongruous with the hotel s ethics , Excellent location for our purpose visiting Excel friendly and helpful staff comfortable bed good range of breakfast 
503620,Good Hotel London, Room too small Extremly expensive consideringcharacteristics of the room No closet smallest bathroom ever no space to be in the room rather than the bed ,No Positive
503621,Good Hotel London, We had terrible service in the restaurant and ended up leaving without any food because the waitress couldn t handle more than 1 table at a time and we didn t even manage to place a drinks order in 30 min The bedrooms are not sound proofed in any way and I was kept awake by the guy in the next room chatting on facetime all night Also the bathroom only had a glass swinging door which was highly impractical as the light would shine through into the room waking my husband up Finally the tea and coffee facilities were extremely stingy which didn t go down very well after a poor nights sleep thanks to all the noise , The interior looked great and it was very clean Every staff member we spoke to had a smile on their face
503622,Good Hotel London, There was no tv or hairdryer We were only there for one night so that didn t bother us but if you re going to spend a bit of time in your room there s nothing to do , I love the style of the hotel and its furnishings The staff were very friendly and it has a really nice relaxing atmosphere 
503623,Good Hotel London, Parking is across the road in a public car park which is fine but not great for vans , Wow what a great place Location near to ExCel was perfect Views over the water were beautiful Staff were brilliant 
503624,Good Hotel London, Hot breakfast was cold beans eggs bacon and quite expensive the bread was very hard and difficult to cut Rooms are very small not enough space for 2 people and the bathroom is tiny , Hotel was very modern clean with great views of the river staff were very friendly and helpful 
503625,Good Hotel London, We had booked a twin beds At reception when checking in the lady assistant mentioned that the room was not set up as twins but was a double She asked if we would like that changing or if we d be happy with it staying double As we had booked for twins beds we asked if they could change them She said it was absolutely fine Said house keeping would go set twin beds up when we left our room at 6 for the evening She said to let them know at reception when we left for the eveing She wrote it down When we were leaving at 6 we went down to reception to let them know the room was free The lady who said she would still be working at that time was no longer there the gentle said she had finished work for the day and so had housekeeping It was not possible to get it done Small issue but makes you think if we had asked had another issue how helpful she would have been,No Positive
503626,Good Hotel London, Blood stains all over the floor and on the mattress I requested a room change and the mattress in the second room also had stains unidentifiable brown stains Major health hazard Found out the Good Hotel is an ex detention centre Not worth the money paid I wouldn t stay here again even if it was free , Staff were friendly and helpful 
503627,Good Hotel London, Room was very small so putting on the kettle sounded like a jet engine and the bathroom door also double as the shower doo so again it was difficult for my girlfriend to lie in while I got ready, Mainly the staff but outer appearance and its location were pretty cool also proximity to Emirates cable car which is well worth a go 
503628,Good Hotel London, Room size to small maybe 7 9 square meters when you making a booking it is not possible to see the room size Breakfast poor and expensive 13 5 pounds only for cold dishes and disgusting coffe , Design of the Hotel and friendly environment very good WiFi
503629,Good Hotel London, There was no Tv in the room Not enough milk sachets to make decent tea or coffee in the room , The pastries for breakfast were still warm Loved the style and young vibe Bed was really comfy 
503630,Good Hotel London, We would liked to have been able to get some food on our return but were unable to do so however it was about 10 30 pm But snacks apart from crisps would have been good , We liked the location as we were there for a visit to the O2 arena Perfect for that SImple small room which was just a bed for the night So all good there 
503631,Good Hotel London, Room we had was very small but on the other hand it had everything that you need , Great location next to the cable car and short walk from dlr Very modern and clean Staff helpful Good value for money
503632,Good Hotel London, The noise It was like you were all in one big room all of the sound travelled I have never heard toilets flush so loudly So we didn t get much sleep , The staff were exceptionally helpful
503633,Good Hotel London, Not a major criticism but it seems the air conditioning in our room did not work as we could not warm the room sufficiently during the cold night of our stay , The hotel name describes it perfectly Good quality hotel with quiet and relaxing atmosphere and friendly attentive staff 
503634,Good Hotel London, A minor detail The shower control was tricky to interpret and water rather cold as a result just stayed one night so no point in asking for help , Perfect place to spend a night or two as a base for sightseeing Right next to Emirates cable car London City Airport Not a luxury hotel Quirky A floating hotel in a dock has a nautical feel to it One that makes good use of space saving fittings eg no wardrobe but hooks and hangers arranged on the wall in compact IKEA living style No bedside table but an accommodating window ledge at the head of the bed 
503635,Good Hotel London, Lack of finish in the room, Great concept and fantastic staff but paid for a suite and it was lacking No sofa no tv Just a large room with a bed No wardrobe no where to sit other than the bed or a small desk The staff are what make this place and I hope are highly valued
503636,Good Hotel London, The beds were awful just two single beds slid together Mattresses were awful which is why they tried to put an aftermarket memory foam on top Pillows were poor quality No tv in room , Modern
503637,Good Hotel London, I moved rooms to a suite as the bathroom in the first room was so small i banged my head on a shelf trying to use the sink to brush my teeth The rooms were cold, junior suite lovely great view and fantastic staff
503638,Good Hotel London, I feel the price of breakfast was a little steep , The beds were so comfy I wanted to take them home The staff were all super friendly id definitely stay here again 
503639,Good Hotel London, A minor disadvantage I could spot was that there isn t a TV in the hotel room As a solo traveller while this wasn t ideal it made me more inclined to go and explore the local area With only one available socket in the room perhaps it might be worth packing an extension lead if staying there in a group , Stayed here on a visit to the O2 Part of its appeal to me was the quirkiness of the hotel being on the river The hotel is much more than that though The room is very aesthetically pleasing and clean The price of the room for London was very good value The bed was super comfortable staff were on hand 24 7 and the location was superb I found the Emirates cable car the best way to reach the hotel because the hotel is in clear view from the cars I d make sure to visit again 
503640,Good Hotel London, Rooms are small but ok for 1 night or 2, Decor very friendly staff food conveniently located beautiful location cheap for London a few steps from Emirates Airlines and underground O2 10 mins The fact that it is a not for profit hotel and that it gives opportunities to the locals 
503641,Good Hotel London, The en suite door was just a frosted glass divider that didn t lock or even fully seal a little awkward Kinda cold in the room at night fine once you re under the covers but still I m quite tall so the sink was a little low for me but that s just nitpicking , The river view was delightful The location was ideally situated for many travel options including the skyline The aesthetic of the hotel enhanced the experience 
503642,Good Hotel London, Breakfast at 13 50 per person was very expensive as there limited options Probably need to improve this side to justify the price , Room clean and bed very comfortable Staff really friendly Hotel in a great setting 
503643,Good Hotel London, There were 2 new receptionists on duty and check in was slow could have done with having a trained member of staff with them , Was in London to see Bruno Mars at the O2 so the hotel was in perfect location Staff friendly Rooms clean and tidy maybe could do with more plug sockets though 
503644,Good Hotel London, Getting back from the o2 was not fun as it was late and the cable car was closed trains were full and a can cost 30, The fact that it was ideally situated for the o2 which was the only reason I booked it however will definitely come back again as I loved using the cable which was right next door 
503645,Good Hotel London, The rooms are tiny litertly tiny would be fine for one night but not more than that The bathroom door is glass and doesnt completely close so not much privacy and the walls are pretty thin Rooms have no tv or wardrope drawers they do have hangers on the wall , Good Location Friendly Staff Lobby area is really nice and a bit different 
503646,Good Hotel London, The assistance was very poor We spend 4 nights without light in our room and I asked them to replace the lamp because the light was unstable but they did nothing Last night the lamp was about to explode and we smelled a smoke from the lamp What a disappointment , The location is nice as you can have a view to Thames river and cable cars Easy access to royal victoria station where you can go to london bridge and westminster in 30 35 minutes 
503647,Good Hotel London,No Negative, Excellent location friendly staff and great room for a few days stay Would stay here again and recommend to anyone looking for a hotel ion this area 
503648,Good Hotel London, Breakfast was appalling for the price decent cafe right outside too Beds wernt overly comfortable No TV didn t bother us really but even background noise while getting ready to go out is good Rooms very cosy Bathrooms even cosier, Location right on doorstep of emmerates cable cars for access to the o2 stadium
503649,Good Hotel London, The soundproofing wasn t so good Would appreciate it if some basic dining tools spoons forks could be found , The space arrangement is applaudible Cosy bed and nice view Basic facilities available Comfortable and interactive public area Very convenient to local transportation Emirates Royal Dock highly recommended 
503650,Good Hotel London, No parking on site You re able to park in Crown Plaza only across the hotel , Bed rooms are very small and boxy We didn t spend much time in it so it was fine 
503651,Good Hotel London, No TV small rooms single beds pushed together to make a double cleaner walking in after a single on the door with no time to answer she walked in Awful Not good customer service , Decor
503652,Good Hotel London, Two separated bed to make a 2 seat bed was uncomfortable The toilets flush with low flow The noise You can hear your neighbor snoring in the next room , Excel london not too far Emirates cable car next to the hotel A beautiful view of the thames river in the living room
503653,Good Hotel London, No place to park vans but there is a public car park opposite for standard cars etc , Just a 5 minute walk from ExCel means this is in a perfect location Staff are great Junior suites are massive and the view over the river is brilliant 
503654,Good Hotel London, Bathrooms are a bit tiny that s true Not a problem for shorter stays though , A truly incredible place to stay Friendly helpful people ready to support you in every possible way including finding food for you at 1AM A delightful atmosphere everywhere in the structure the customer is allowed to be as free as one can be and at the same time the staff is always there to help even for the smallest details The location is excellent and waking up in the morning with the sun s rays reflecting on the waves of the dock is an experience to die for Or to be more precise to live for I ll be coming back soon Thank you guys and girls for making my stay as easy and lovely as it could possibly be Thanx Rob for your friendship and support thank you everyone for sharing your thoughts as human beings with a stranger 
503655,Good Hotel London, Room far too small had to leave day earlier loosing 100 pound as was ill due to being clostrophobic bathroom was a joke no privacy or room to move overall appalling, The bed
503656,Good Hotel London, Acoustic between rooms is quite poor but with earplugs it is fine and room rather small boat cabin alike , Very nice hotel quite trendy and different from the very traditional business hotel around Shared equipment make you feel like home Food and staff are great too View on water makes you feel like you are on a boat
503657,Good Hotel London, The pillow , The room was clean and the staff were lovely It had the perfect amenities for the price The hotel was close to the tube station so easy to get into central London 
503658,Good Hotel London, The restaurant could not provide food at 10pm and was not able to deal with sudden arrival of multiple guests from the nearby conference, awesome staff nice room
503659,Good Hotel London, Room size Tv opening of windows honesty when booking the room If you could not cater a double room for a couple they should have said so we could go else where Ruined my birthday aswel ,No Positive
503660,Good Hotel London, Blood on the curtains poo on the throw dinner was atrocious order wasn t taken to the kitchen then the wrong food came out staff were unhelpful ,No Positive
503661,Good Hotel London, It was generally great The nature of the hotel is that the rooms are very small that was not a problem for us but if you need space this is not the place for you It was a shame that the rooftop bar was not open until the end of April we were looking forward to drinks on the Thames in the sunshine , The staff were so friendly and had a great sense of humour They were a real highlight of our overnight stay The breakfast lounge bar area was really comfortable with lovely river views stunning on a sunny day 
503662,Good Hotel London, Didn t have the breakfast as it was just continental samey stuff , Fantastic Location and really quirky No the norm which made it all the better
503663,Good Hotel London,No Negative, Very nice unique interior with a nice view of the water front Great value for the location and again real beautiful rooms and social areas Very nice staff too 
503664,Good Hotel London, The toilet flush pressure is inadequate I was told this is because they pull the water out of The Thames and they need a bigger pump to make it better The rooms are a quite small certainly not ideal if you want to spend any length of time there Think along the lines of a cruise liner bedroom and you ll get the idea Not the hotel s fault but the parking is a rip off Beware staying more than 24 hours or they charge you another 15 flat rate The ticket machine is plastered with signs stating they don t accept abuse I d suggest many people have been caught out by this sharp practice and voiced their dissatisfaction to the operator , Location is on the correct side of Excel if you want to find places to eat it s a fantastic view each morning the staff were really excellent in every way The WiFi is fast lets you use VPN and resolves quickly I like the ethics of the hotel it s well equipped and has everything you d ever need even European sockets Shower pressure was good hot water always available The quality of the hotel provided soaps is also very good I would book again 
503665,Good Hotel London, Breakfast 30pounds per person Crazy Rooms the smaller I have seen ever in a hotel Bed not very confortable WC didn t work very well you had to twist your body to get out of the toilet Defenitely not a hotel for long stays , Location 2 minutes walking to Excel Olimpia Good linked to the city center through the Jubilee line from Canning Town 10 minutes walking there is Victoria on DLR closer but then you have to change to Julilee line in Cnning Town Personel and Wifi The scoop of the Hotel Non profit organization that reinvest benefits on the rea 
503666,Good Hotel London, I didn t like how small the rooms are slightly claustrophobic Similarly with the bathroom No tv sadly , Love how modern the hotel is and the simplicity ties in really well together Loved the views both during the day and night 24 hour front desk was really helpful and the staff were just beautifully spoken 
503667,Good Hotel London, Everything was perfect , Lovely location by the Thames classy modern and simple look giving it a glamorous style Lovely staff very friendly and some nachos to die for Briefly you don t need to go out of the hotel as you ll be entertained enough in it 
503668,Good Hotel London, Room was very small lot of wasted space in hotel room tiny for two people , Bed was comfortable Room was very hot As the thermostat did not Work Staff were very good 
503669,Good Hotel London, Room temperature No TV or radio in the room Tiny room Tiny bathroom Everything was an extra but that s hotels, Can t think of anything I liked
503670,Good Hotel London, No television in the room Wasn t prepared to rent an iPad , Staff were very helpful Food good Comfortable bed Great location for London Excel Exhibition Centre and for the Emirates Cable Car and Up at O2 experiences 
503671,Good Hotel London, The bed was a little on the small side but good value for money all the same, Really close to a car park the hotel was unique and cosy the rooms had everything you needed 
503672,Good Hotel London, Surprised that the bar was closed at 11 when we got back from an event couldnt get a drink and chill in the communal areas Everything else was great , Rooms were minimalistic great views and the decor was fab Bed was super comfy The whole vibe of the hotel was very relaxed 
503673,Good Hotel London,No Negative, The hotel was spotlessly clean throughout Small and compact bedroom with crisp white bed linen No tv but had iPad and phone and good wifi connection meant that a tv was not necessary Unusual design and concept for a hotel with the feel of being on a boat or barge but it worked really well as it was situated on water with great visual surroundings Emirates cable car a stones throw away and DLR minutes away made this a perfect location to get to any entertainment venue The living room and lounge area was spacious and modern The food was good Friendly staff Perfect hotel for a stop over on a night out Will definitely return back 
503674,Good Hotel London, It was cheap But that does not justify the failings below Lift was out of order Air conditioning in all our rooms 3 was not working I spoke to other guests and theirs wasn t working either It was a very uncomfortable night No opening window in room No toilet extract fan Lots of staff present at breakfast but very disorganised Had to ask for cutlery milk yogurt Poor selection for a continental breakfast , It was cheap 
503675,Good Hotel London, Room was ok but design was a little too sparse no TV and it wasn t as clean as I would have expected , Great location for Excel nice position on the dock Tesco Express across the road 
503676,Good Hotel London, The ac wasnt working in the rooms as there had been a power cut which messed them all up and the windows in the room do not open there is a vent that opens if the widows opened it would have been ok the ac not working but as they didnt open the room became very stuffy This is when Mo kicked into action though and searched everywherr to find us fan to keep the air in the room circulating , The staff especially Mo who was part of the night staf were very friendly Mo went above and beyond to help us with any problems that we had He deserves to be recognised for his customer service skills and the job that he does 
503677,Good Hotel London, new concept of 4 star hotel no TV small room the smallest bathroom I ever see you need to jump to go in the other side of bed , nice people in reception
503678,Good Hotel London, To summarize our experience even though the idea and design is cool we didn t really feel welcome The main problem is staff that from the guest perspective reminds of a sect where they act as if they possess some kind of superior knowledge of things Examples at breakfast an employee was explaining things in an arrogant way and loud to her new colleague She told her that if the guests are not happy with the breakfast it is their own problem as they the guests are so stupid quote that they in most cases don t even know what continental breakfast is Another guest was having an argument with an employee next morning claiming that she is rude and could smile at least once The employee did not agree react in a nice manner and they had a lengthy discussion As far as we understand the concept of the hotel includes hiring long term unemployed However we felt that they literally hire anyone from the street and these specific people have been unemployed by a reason Even though we liked a lot about the hotel and some of the staff at some points we had a feeling that anything can happen with you in such a place that it can burn down or sink And this is not really what you expect from a hotel You want to be able to rely on the personnel If the hotel manages changing staff policies and focuses more on democratic and inclusive style rather than pseudo hipster things such as DJ in the lobby and design it will be a great place for everyone , Great value for money if you are going to ExCel Comfortable bed and decent breakfast Interesting concept Great area with cable car close 
503679,Good Hotel London, I found the numbering and layout of the rooms very confusing and I would have liked a TV in my room, The bed was very comfy and I love the overall quirky decor of the hotel
503680,Good Hotel London, The rooms are very very small We had a twin room and was almost sleeping on top of each other If you are a couple in a double I do not think the room size would be a problem The bathroom is also very small and no ideal for a larger person at all , The staff were very friendly and nothing was a problem for them One saw I was struggling with my bags and carried them to my room A very clean and quirky hotel with lovely views It was so easy to get into the center of London too 2 mins to the DLR and about 20 mins tube to central Westminster It was also only a 2 min walk to the Virgin cable cars leading to the O2 
503681,Good Hotel London, Breakfast was slightly limited Rooms were a bit small , Very good location good value Nice and simple Reception communal area is well presented and nice to work in for a few hours Excellent views over the river the O2 canary Wharf 
503682,Good Hotel London, Yes the cabins could have been bigger and if there were two people it could be a pain having to climb over the other person to get into bed but for a single traveller it was perfect , Fabulous location really friendly and efficient staff and the d cor is just so cool I thought the free fruit and water on the tables in and around the reception breakout areas was a lovely touch 
503683,Good Hotel London,No Negative, Really enjoyed our stay Everything was great from the Moscow mules to the bed which was very comfy Staff were really friendly and helpful We ll be back 
503684,Good Hotel London, Not enough coat hangers and storage space to hang up clothes Especially with 2 people sharing a room together , Bed was comfortable and the room was nice and clean 
503685,Good Hotel London, The air conditioning didn t work and i told them about it they said some one was going to have a look at it but no one came windows were sealed was stuffy Full breakfast would of been better than continental , I liked the fact of it being so close to the emirate
503686,Good Hotel London, Rooms are extremely small You can only get into the double bed from one side walls on the other 3 so you have to climb over or wake your partner if you want to get up in the night First room we were given was next to a unbelievably loud generator we were moved to the only other available room which was quiet but stank of cigarette smoke Breakfast was awful Not what you expect when you see the photos on the web site , Location for the O2 is very good and while the hotel has no parking there are lots of parking options about Easy access to DLR and Cable Car
503687,Good Hotel London, Toilet brush was covered in toilet roll WiFi a little flaky but just little things , Location near to the emirates cable car Quirky hotel nice lounge space staff very friendly Lovely latte x
503688,Good Hotel London, We had to go to reception 4 times because key to room didn t open door No forks to eat breakfast when I asked staff it took 10 minutes for them to bring forks Cups were not very clean , Bed was comfortable and staff were very nice at reception
503689,Good Hotel London, Evening drinks and coffee very expensive But I suppose that s normal for London , Bed comfy Breakfast adequate Bedroom well designed Staff outstanding could not do enough for us 
503690,Good Hotel London, The walls are thin so it is very noisy They wanted to take my credit card and charge a security deposit on check in which was not mentioned in the booking Breakfast was overpriced There s no tv in the room not a problem for me but could be an issue for longer stays , The rooms are stylish and comfy and the location is excellent if you are working at ExCeL The staff were friendly and the ethos of the place helping the local community using Fairtrade products is great 
503691,Good Hotel London, Breakfast was quite poor Sound insulation between rooms is insufficient , Superb location for ExCel and Canary Wharf Shop just across the road Friendly staff Clean and cozy 
503692,Good Hotel London, The only negative was the noise from the planes taking off at London City Airport in the morning but I imagine that would be the case at any hotel in the area , Simple small rooms but with everything you need and really nice social spaces downstairs All this plus on a boat and right near Excel but the biggest plus was the social good that the company does helping train the long term unemployed for careers in hospitality A win win 
503693,Good Hotel London, Poor service and communication from staff there was a faulty wire in the room which sparked the pictures on the website do not reflect the size of the actual ROOMS which where Tiny and cramped ,No Positive
503694,Good Hotel London, Sound proofing is really bad so not easy to get a great nights sleep Could hear people in neighbouring rooms as well as people stood outside the entrance smoking Corridor space is really generous room space is not Not a great design decision , Interesting room design and lobby space Helpful staff
503695,Good Hotel London, Rooms very basic and small, Bed was very comfortable room very basic and small but great location for concerts at the 02 staff were very helpful and very close to public transport 
503696,Good Hotel London, The room was smaller than most hotels and the bathroom just has a thin glass door which isn t sound proof and doesn t have a lock Didn t bother us but it may bother others , Really cool looking place inside and out comfy bed friendly staff eco friendly Close to the DLR and Excel 
503697,Good Hotel London, I was woken at 6 30am by pipes clanking I guess it was the heating although not sure Shame really because apart from that the hotel was great Room is really small and so was the bathroom But fine for just a 1 night stay , It was a really nice hotel Very clean Great location Right by tube station 
503698,Good Hotel London, The window didn t open and the air con wouldn t work so it got a bit stuffy There was a gap somewhere in the window though because the wind was coming in just enough to make the room door keep wobbling all night It was annoying but I d stay again, The bed was extremely comfortable and the room and hotel were very clean Glad to have a plug on both sides of the bed too There wasn t any noise from other guests either
503699,Good Hotel London, Breakfast pricing was crazy my flight ex Switzerland cost less Later that morning I had a full english in the shadow of St Pauls at a nice french cafe again cheaper than Good Hotel offered , The staff were highly motivated and helpful to a fault wonderful 
503700,Good Hotel London, Toilet didn t flush properly and the facilities were very basic , A great hotel in a good location Staff were very friendly Excellent value for money Perfect for a short stay in London 
503701,Good Hotel London, Sound proofing could be improved as you could hear people in other rooms along the corridor There are a couple of finishing touches which could be attended to such as light fittings held on with tape and blown light bulbs , Well presented hotel with very friendly and helpful staff Clean and tidy room with a comfy bed overlooking to docklands Good location for the Excel and tube services 
503702,Good Hotel London, Tiny room One UK socket and one German socket German socket was faulty Kettle had a German plug and a short lead so I had to hold the plug in the faulty socket The kettle had to be on the floor Only one coffee sachet each Booked a double but got given a twin Changed rooms and got given another twin Third was a double but it is two single mattresses pushed together which is uncomfortable Key was only activated for one night so it didn t work day two more walking back to reception Smoke alarm right over the bed has two bright red flashing LED s which is annoying No TV Not very soundproof No bathroom extract fan Breakfast is expensive twice the price of the cafe up the road , Great value compared to others in the area Room was OK if you are only going to sleep in it 
503703,Good Hotel London, No television but didn t really matter to us just think it should be mentioned Breakfast is an expensive extra at 13 50 per person for continental but it was delicious with a great view , The whole feel of the place very European basic furniture but really well done great concept location brilliant literally next to the cross river cable car Only a 2 mins walk to the DLR and tubes in to central london we were at Green Park within 30 mins The place has a modern feel spacious areas small rooms though Even the weather was good Also little touches like fresh water and fruit available in the common areas at all times 
503704,Good Hotel London, The room was a bit too small along with the bathroom for the price of the hotel You d also expect more facilities TV fridge etc to be found , The WiFi was great and the staff were really friendly and helpful
503705,Good Hotel London, I found navigating my way to my room a little confusing as the numbering suddenly jumped around but once i worked it out was very easy to find Also the Shower Bathroom was a little small for my liking and I personally found it a wee bit tricky moving around from the shower to the bathroom , We both had a lovely nights sleep and would stay again if we needed somewhere for the night and even better was late check out wasn t an issue so we had a lovely lie in looking over the river thames There was no in room entertainment which was a refreshing change meaning we weren t looking at a TV hanging over the bed The rooms were minimalist yet cozy and well furnished for the style with convenient storage solutions I would say this hotel is ideal for one or two nights but the rooms wouldn t suffice for any more than this as i think cabin fever could be an issue 
503706,Good Hotel London, the room was too small the breakfast was not good at all no TV i had to change my room due to a problem with the toilet it wss not flushing and the new room had the same problem with the toilet when i changed my room i was sure that i forgot 2 itmes in the previous room but when i ask the staff all of them where confused and dont know what to tell me all their ansewrs was we will ask the cleaners manager they havent found my stuff and i was pretty sure that i forgot it there i dont no where they go , nothing
503707,Good Hotel London, The room was really hot which couldn t be changed Even with the little vent opened above the window , Very modern and friendly staff My mum comes to London all the time for concerts at the O2 will 100 be recommending 
503708,Good Hotel London, Toilet would not flush properly and room so small But other than that gorgeous hotel Great if your goingo concert in the o2 only 5 minutes on a cable cart across the river , Clean wonderful staff gorgeous hotel Right by a train station and tesco
503709,Good Hotel London, No television didn t realise when booked had to change rooms twice due to noisy corridor and then lights not working in room and a huge wet stain on the carpet But after the 3 room was a good stay Also asked for a room looking into the Thames and there was none available when checking in so disappointed with that also breakfast was very expensive not included , Very clean hotel great location not for central but for London overall 
503710,Good Hotel London, Staff where extremely rude to my partner who meet me from work he got a lot of judgemental looks staff where unhelpful to him and rude But completely different to me when I arrived I do t not appreciate this service, The funky decor
503711,Good Hotel London, Wasn t sure about the quality of the food one night and the portions on some of the meals seemed quite stingy , I loved sitting at breakfast and dinner looking out over the water I felt very safe in my room probably as it used to be a prison cell The Wi Fi was brilliant Didn t miss a beat 
503712,Good Hotel London, The rooms were so basic and very cramped with no tv s it felt more like a hostel You could hear the other room s toilets flushing and all the other rooms doors vibrate when closed ,No Positive
503713,Good Hotel London, 1 Just one power outlet in whole room And not one in bathroom So if you need to dry your hair or use electric shaver you can sit under the table 2 Pretty strong and cold wind coming from windows closing the ventilation did not help one bit 3 I stayed 4 nights Trash wasn t taken out one time 4 Last day housekeeping popped in at 7 30PM Really , 1 Location For what I needed 2 Wifi was pretty good most of the time 3 Staff was cool

503715,Good Hotel London, The bed is really terrible if you are alone they put 2 matresses together and you really cant sleep in the middle Also the wifi is good but the signal is not optimal depending of where you are in the room , The staff is nice and the hotel very clean the space in the room is quiet enough if you are a solo traveller Its very close to the Excel by walk 
503716,Good Hotel London, Not alot of choice for breakfast only bread rolls left cold baked beans we were asked if we wanted eggs but could only have fried as boiled took too long Fried eggs very undercooked Coffee machine out of order This was at 9 45am ,No Positive
503717,Good Hotel London, we were told the Bar closed at 11 but they were still serving other people at midnight, Rooms were compact but very comfortable everything you need for one or two night stay

503719,Good Hotel London, Extremely small rooms No wardrobe or real storage space in the room Pegs on wall as a replacement for wardrobe were awkward to use as all places above each other so clothes hang over each other Bed sheets for a double bed were two single duvets Also no television in the room , The staff were great and the location was ideal for anyone attending events at the 02
503720,Good Hotel London, Coffee machine wasn t working correctly I would struggle with lack of storage for a longer stay, This is a very modern hotel rooms are small for a double and minimalistic no wardrobe or drawers just hangers on hooks on the wall great for 1 or 2 nights Staff were friendly and helpful great location
503721,Good Hotel London, Lack of understanding of Gluten Free foods via the staff and Chef The menu states that some items are Gluten Free but the restaurant staff and Chef didn t seem to know this led to me eating elsewhere as I didn t want to risk getting poorly Roof terrace bar not yet open , Very clean and the reception staff were super friendly Comfortable beds and great showers Plenty of room for a weekend trip 
503722,Good Hotel London, Noise from airplanes breakfast was very expensive so decided to eat elsewhere and no toilet paper , Location was excellent and staff very professional and friendly

503724,Good Hotel London, The rooms are tiny No Television Way over priced for what you get The cleaning service did not clean the room properly for example my empty mcdonalds packet was not removed from the room I mean really The beds were uncomfortable The wake up calls were late The bathroom crystal glasses were dirty The breakfast is WAY over priced, Not much The location was convenient 
503725,Good Hotel London, No double bed when booked one so give a room with 2 singles pushed together no double quilt for the bed terrible pillows and I would just never stay there again it s absolutely awful I heard so many people complaining it was unreal , Nothing at All the hotel couldn t even give us a double quilt after paying 95 pounds for a room
503726,Good Hotel London, The rooms were small and quite basic but considering what you pay its still great value , Such an excellent location with beautiful views of the river The emirates air ride is right next door and the o2 very easily accessible To stay on a floating hotel was a nice different experience 
503727,Good Hotel London,No Negative, The hotel is very pleasant and it was perfect for our one night stay It had everything we needed The staff were helpful and friendly Would definitely recommend this hotel if you re seeing a show at the o2 Cable carts right next to hotel which take you to and from o2 We ll be staying again in the future 
503728,Good Hotel London, Window of room was dirty on the outside, All staff members we met were very welcoming and friendly and did their utmost to ensure the guests were happy

503730,Good Hotel London, Could do with a couple more creature comforts like a TV although they have good wifi and most people probably watch telly online these days, OK so the room is tiny but it is quiet and comfortable The public areas are nice and relaxed and the food is very good and well priced 
503731,Good Hotel London, Very small rooms We had to ask for a different room as there was a continuous noise due to a generator The cleanliness was very poor hairs in the sink and shower in both rooms Very thin walls badly insulated Flashing red light above the bed Not enough room for any luggage, Good breakfast nice croissant Ok for one night not for more
503732,Good Hotel London, Breakfast included is only a cold continental breakfast for which they still charge 13 50 If you want a cooked English breakfast there are a number of local cafes charging between 4 95 and 5 95 Rooms are very small as you expect in budget London hotels in addition the walls are VERY thin so you can enjoy your drunk neighbors attempt at singing when they come in at midnight TEA making facilities are provided in the room no coffee or milk don t bother trying to ask reception for any coffee or milk either they don t have any Mattresse was VERY soft felt like memory foam type some people may like this some may not The river view room for which they charged extra actually had the view of the back of a fence a pile of wood and a ladder I guess there was a river the other side of the fence ,No Positive
503733,Good Hotel London, No TV Int the room No Atmosphere in the building at all Whilst the receptionist was checking me in although she was ignoring him another member of staff was tying to flirt with her The place has a potential to be something special but lack atmosphere and thought Also they are the smallest bathrooms I have ever been in, I liked the queerness of the fittings
503734,Good Hotel London, Very basic room No TV and not even a radio Couldnt work out how to set heating below 20 degrees so very hot at night Cord on kettle was too short to reach plug unless the kettle was placed on the floor and boiled there not very safe Also only tea provided was green or lemon tea ordinary tea bags and some milk would have been nice , Location perfect for trip to boatshow Felt safe to be walking about alone Lovely entrance lobby and unusual location Staff very professional and friendly

503738,Good Hotel London, 1 Fire alarm has been off 2 times early in the morning and there has been no single communication from the hotel staff Bear in mind this is a floating hotel 2 If you wanna be told off just stay at Good Hotel as staff extremely successful telling guests off 3 Oh forgot to add tea and coffee making facilities in the room means NO TEA NO COFFEE NO MILK instead herbal tea This hotel dictates that Guest MUST PAY for coffee and tea in the reception cafe Never coming back to this dungeon again Travelled 63 countries stayed in tons of hotels as a Booking com genious and London Guru one word for this property and staff INCOMPETENT Don t try to call Booking com customer service as they are non existent too , Not a single thing can be liked about this dump

503748,Good Hotel London, Took 3 room changes to actually get a room without any major issues The first had aircon heating issues so it wouldn t work this along with no hot water was an instant problem at this time of year The next room we had also had no hot water but we were told it would soon be fixed we went out for the evening and when we got back the lights wouldn t work and still no hot water Changed room again and ended up on the other side of the hotel as it would seem there was heating and water issues with the river side we wanted to stay on Ended up with two single beds pushed together on the non river side overlooking road works However the staff were pleasant and helped out as best they could every time , Hotel is really nicely designed very modern and sleek Nice shower and quirky room layouts to see out the window Staff helpful and friendly Shame about the issues we ended up having but hopefully this was a one time thing
