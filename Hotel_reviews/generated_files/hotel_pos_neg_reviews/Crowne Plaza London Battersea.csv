289560,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Location, Great quality and food room was of s great standard but the location was quite far from bus and train stations and had to walk through a built up area dark st night
289561,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, I had booked this hotel for my partners birthday weeks in advance I had asked them for an upgrade in room and a bigger room they reassured me that the room was going to be big when we got there the room was extremely small and they did not offer room service at night some of the staff were extremely rude never again , Nice view
289562,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Nil parking for guests And far too much local building work And the car dealership invades everyone s right to pass on entry to the road to the hotel , Central to our needs Clean large rooms 
289563,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Nothing Perhaps the swimming pool could stay open a little later Even until 9 as didn t have time to use this, Service was amazing rooms really modern and nice
289564,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Breakfast could have been better with more fresh and healthy food , The bed was very comfortable the staff superb and the food in the restaurant really good The room was quiet the views of the river and London amazing Really nice to have access to a gym and a spa

289566,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The location was poor we could not access the hotel by any public transport and it was hidden away down a very busy street , The bathroom was a very high standard and was well equipped 
289567,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Not that easy to find as works going on around so no road signage assume this only a temporary glitch , Lovely room and facilities View from restaurants very nice overlooking the river Staff very friendly 
289568,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Not close enough to rail station Clapham Junction 20 mins walk or underground 2 miles walk to Fulham Broadway , Excellent breakfast lovely room and large bathroom with bath and shower staff really helpful located right by the Thames
289569,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The hotel is located in a residential and industrial area far away from an tourist attractions or airport especially STN airport It taxi cost from the STN to this hotel is 120 pound one way and it took us 1 and half hour to get to the hotel The closest public transportation is 16 minutes walking The closest restaurant pub is 16 min walking as well and it is pretty shabby It is actually a local bar which serves burgers and fries and some other fast food The neighborhood does not look clean or safe Some hotel staffs were new and not well prepared to answer question about hotel amenity There wasn t much to do around the hotel When I wanted to use the gym at a little pass 8 30 I was told it was on 1 floor When I got there it is a spa but the door was locked I returned to the front desk to inquire about how to access the gym and pool I was told the operation hour is from 8 30 am 8 30 pm As such I didn t do much for the rest of the day The next morning I went to the front desk again to ask about the gym usage I was surprised to find out it open 24 hours a day She seems to be more knowledgeable about the hotel amenity She told me to access the gym and pool after 8 30pm you need to use 2 floor and a special key to access it Unfortunately I had to leave for the airport without enjoying the facility My recommendation for the tourists is to find a hotel close to the attraction like I did the first time when I visited London Apex city hotel is way better It is less than 5 minutes walking from the Tower of London but is still very quiet because it is on a back street You can beat the tourist by visiting the tower at 8 00 am Loved that experience , The hotel is clean and comfortable Great breakfast options and very helpful restaurant staff 
289570,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The air conditioning was not working for the first night I was stuck in a boiling hot room with no opening windows and absolutely no fresh air It was awful The hotel only offered me 50 discount off my first night when I am sure they should have given me a full refund off the first night I don t even think it was legal to allow us to stay in those rooms ,No Positive
289571,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, No access to the London underground nearby You have to take bus or the overground from Clapham Junction , Nice room If you need a train in out of London the Clapham Junction is only a 15 min walk away 
289572,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The restaurant staff were terrible not trained and the food was below average The room was lovely but in a terrible location cab drivers couldn t find it and lots of construction around it, The bed was comfortable
289573,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Very difficult to find no signs Was charged 2 81 for an americano at breakfast because only instant type coffee included in rate , Lovely comfortable bed with quality bedding soundproof rooms Staff were very helpful and friendly Only a ten minute walk from Clapham Junction 
289574,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The location is a bit industrial don t expect to walk anywhere much At the price I paid I m struggling to find anything else a couple of fixtures needed maintenance but everything worked fine , A five 4 Star hotel in Battersea where the staff were brilliant Huge bed and bath in the executive suite which was a fabulous complimentary upgrade Big TV with the inputs available for your own devices Great breakfast 
289575,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, There was no room dine in further the hotel restaurant closes bit early at night Expect hotel to provide room dine in service as well including at mid nights , Since there is no Tube connections and distance from nearest train station Clapham is bit away hotel has been providing chauffeur services to Clapham station This is very much appreciated 
289576,Crowne Plaza London Battersea,No Negative, We had such excellent customer service whilst we stayed here They were so accomodating to our pregnant friend They brought her the pillows she needed to be comfortable They also were so apologetic when the aircon wasn t working in her room They upgraded her to a bigger room with working aircon and offered free drinks Great attentive staff
289577,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Children can not access the pool and the spa area Parking is expensive 20 pounds a day It charges 3 5 GBP to deliver food from the restaurant to the room have to pickup directly The location is in a walking distance to the near metro 10 min but the surroundings are not interesting It may take from 30 min to 1 hour to reach city centre by train , The staff is very helpful and ready to assist you anytime We did know much of them by the name and vice versa You feel very well supported it s a not standard cold hotel assistance at all Congrats to Mr Sumeet and all his team Neel Sergio Tony Fabrizio etc The free shuttle to the nearest train station is convenient when close to the full hours otherwise better walk or pick up a Uber They dont charge you for drinking water there are free bottles in the lobby and also in the room Nespresso machine in the room with replacement of capsules makes us feel at home Very big room and bathroom with both bathtub and separate shower The food from the inside restaurant is very tasty especially the cheese burger Very equipped room with hairdryer coffee machine Nespresso safe 2 TVs 1 in the bathtub Comfortable bed zero noise at night Excellent breakfast in a nice place with a nice view of the river and the heliport 
289578,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The staff i met when collecting my luggage in the evening were ignoring me and answered the phone instead of tending to myself The bathroom fitting was falling off and the waterproof seal around the bath was coming off , The staff members i met intially on check in were wonderful very helpful and let me Check in earlier than 2 The staff at the spa were also very helpful and polite The hydropool is fantantic however the sauna and steam facilities need to be upkept more
289579,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, There wasn t anything we didn t like the service was excellent but the staff were the best there Can t thank them enough , Me and my partner loved it so much that we won t stop recommending this place View facilities staff food and everything overall was just a perfect The staff are very friendly and come across very genuine and polite really enjoyed our stay would definitely come back 
289580,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The breakfast which I paid extra for was quite poor Very small selection and did not taste good at all I felt that id of been better off leaving the hotel and going to a local caf for a fraction of the price , Lovely modern room very spacious Neil at the front desk was polite helpful Full use of the spa and gym was included in the booking price and the option to leave luggage behind desk and use facilities after checkout was given which was a bonus The room was quite I didn t hear any outside noise or noise from other rooms Bathroom in the executive suite was quite extravagant with a large walk in shower and reasonable sized bathtub with an integrated tv 
289581,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The location is a little tricky as there is no tube nearby The hotel has a shuttle which takes you to the nearest train but if you want Central London this may not be the right hotel for you , Friendly reception and concierge staff Lovely room beautiful complimentary toiletries and bottled water in the room Tv in the bathtub Huge bed and pillows Breakfast was very good lots of choice and good quality too 
289582,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The male receptionist when checking out Other than that is was a lovely nights stay, The bed warmth in the room TV in the bathroom and lovely shower 
289583,Crowne Plaza London Battersea,No Negative, Very clean and comfortable hotel Room was very nice and equipped with everything you need Staff are amazing very friendly and can t help enough 
289584,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Computers were playing up at check in which made it difficult and a long procedure especially late at night when I just wanted to get to my room The staff were great though and very apologetic , The room wan clean and very relaxing 
289585,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The only thing is I wish the restaurant menu was a little more diverse especially for those that might have special dietary requirements larger portions would also be great for what you pay in the restaurant , I enjoyed my stay here I booked treatments at the spa as well and that was also superb I would definitely come back here the room was lovely bed was so comfy bathroom was a delight with heated flooring Breakfast was a great spread with fresh fruit and veg available to make a freshly squeezed juice to your liking As I said I would come back here either by myself or with a companion 
289586,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, We really didn t like that we couldn t get picked up from the train station and that the shuttle was not 24 hours The neighbourhood was a little bit sketchy and the hotel is well hidden in between buildings and back alleys so it would have been nice to get a ride We eventually figured out the bus system but it was a pain the first couple of days We went to the hotel restaurant one of the nights and it was awful They had one waiter on which would have been fine considering there were only 3 or 4 tables to serve But he spent 15 minutes talking to the table next to us and then it took another 10 for him to come over to us to talk to us for the first time since we had been seated I ordered off of the kids menu a margarita pizza and fries which turned out to be half of a frozen store bought pizza which I figured out when I asked for less sauce on the pizza and he told me they were pre made My husband got a burger and the meat was the cheapest you could buy It was very fatty and very grey The whole dinner service for 2 meals 1 drink and a dessert took an hour a half We ordered one dessert to split and it turned out to be one tiny individual sized lava cake and the tiniest scoop of ice cream I ve ever seen It would have been nice for him to let us know how small it was since it wasn t really suitable to split The whole meal was around 50 pounds which for the poor service and the very bad quality of the food was a fortune The hallways were excruciatingly hot as well as the room when we first got in And the temperature in the room does not lower beyond 18 degrees Celsius which we found uncomfortable for sleeping Either the system in the room resets or the maid resets it every day as well so each evening when we came back we would have to wait for the temperature to lowered again The system they use for the tv was terrible It was very slow and and very glitchy and it took forever just to choose one channel to watch , The staff was really helpful and friendly and there was a shuttle weekday mornings that would take you to the train station if you asked for it I believe the shuttle continues into the afternoon and evening but it s only one way They will not pick you up from the train station The room was cleaned every day and it looked great The toiletries they leave smell wonderful Everything is geared towards a business atmosphere and is basically catered more towards a male audience The air con was very quiet and pretty effective Watching the helicopters come in was really neat and the sound was very dulled in the rooms we could tell there was one coming or leaving but it was more of a white noise if you were sleeping It was about a 5 minute train ride to get to the main London Victoria station which would then link up with the underground service and about a 5 minute bus ride to the train station closest to the hotel or a 15 minute walk 
289587,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Breakfast is 17 95 or 15 if you pay when you arrive You make your own tea from a pump flask which is very slow to fill teapot and quite cold I found the bacon to be rather thick and so keeping it warm made it hard but the worst bit is my husband asked for a latte and was told it would be 2 50 he declined ,No Positive
289588,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, A later checkout time 11am is still morning The staff were ringing the phone at 11 15 , The bed was amazing I had an excellent sleep The bathroom was well stocked up with towels and shower gels I could turn off all the lights with ease from the bed as I nodded off 
289589,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The bed was uncomfortable for me and so I didn t get much sleep , I loved everything about this hotel The bathroom was amazing and very spacious The spa facility and treatment was very good aswell
289590,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Not great transport links as there s no underground near by but cheap and easy to get an uber The food we ordered was overpriced for what we got , Hotel overall was excellent value for money it felt luxurious at every turn and only a 15min walk to Battersea Park Friendly helpful staff on hand at all times 
289591,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Only thing I wasn t keen on was that check out was at 11 however in the morning we called down to request a late check out This normally costs 10 per extra hour you stay but as we were IHG members it was free of charge , The pool and wellness centre was lovely great atmosphere and very relaxing The room was brilliant had everything we needed more 
289592,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The fact that one member of staff banged on our door 3 times at 11 30pm the first night we stayed which woke us up just to see if the room was occupied, The bed was extremely comfortable
289593,Crowne Plaza London Battersea,No Negative, It was a superb stay and I especially enjoyed being able to use the spa after a long train journey I appreciated the robe and slippers to wear down to the spa The bar and restaurant was gorgeously styled and we had a really good evening drinking at the bar
289594,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The first room I had was filthy and the lighting system didn t work at all I was upgraded to a suite which was cleaner but the lighting system there also didn t work well It needs a good bit of TLC to bring it up to the standard I ve come to expect from a Crowne Plaza hotel , Really responsive staff
289595,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The hotel is about a 10 to 15 minute walk from Clapham Junction the nearest point on Lonfon transport unless you count buses I defy any first time visitor to find their way without some trial and error through a housing estate and a park, We didn t eat in the hotel so I can t comment on that The staff were all exceptionally friendly and helpful I know it s their job but it struck us how charming the staff on the front desk were
289596,Crowne Plaza London Battersea,No Negative, The bed was amazing Best sleep I have ever had and the pillows The bath was also soo nice and the TV at the end was just an extra bonus The spa facilities included make this a must go

289598,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Small things really two lights did not work in our room That s it , We were lucky just for 15 we got upgraded to a river view It was stunning a huge amount of space and comfort TV in the tub was crazy 
289599,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, I was searching for a socket for the hairdryer and found it difficult to dry my hair using the mirrors on the side of the tv I feel a mirror could be placed over the dressing table running the length under the tv for drying hair whilst sitting down , Staff were very helpful and friendly They surprised my husband with a bottle of prosecco for his 60th birthday in our room We also received an upgrade as we are members of loyalty scheme which was a lovely treat We were delighted with the huge bathroom 
289600,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Duvet very hot would be great if transfers could go on the half hour if no one booked on the hour , Quiet smart place nice breakfast reception and breakfast staff great value for money on a Sunday night super spa great position on the river Very close to where our son lives We were given a wonderful quiet deluxe room which still had a side river view and extra space much appreciated Thanks we hope to come again and tell others If you leave by about 9 30am there is a river boat to take you bank to Embankment tube station on weekdays 
289601,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The TV in the bathroom wasnt working but advertised as functional when I brought the room Had to give a 50 charge incase of any damages used to this in london hotels but when checking out it wasnt refunded to me as promised I always get this back at the end once staying in london hotels I am still yet to recieve this back , The size of the room was really nice 
289602,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Over complicated technology in bedroom made turning a light switch on or off a huge challenge , Luxurious friendly hotel Great breakfast and bar area 
289603,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The temperature of the pool was a little cold also too much chlorine was added , Spa facilities are beautiful the interior soft furnishings are stunning We loved the small touches of sleep spray for pillows 
289604,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The Hydro pool was broken and very cold It was also very dark in the SPA and found it hard to see high chlorine really hurt our eyes and the smell was strong We had a service fee added to our bill after lunch in the restaurant Which I myself found appalling In Hampshire we do not add these 2 burgers and 2 half pints of Pepsi came to a whopping 42 00 I would suggest to eat out , The coffee was really nice we were both really pleasantly surprised with our breakfast each morning We had an afternoon tea from Wowcher com this was lovely The bed was very comfy We stayed in room 503 and had a direct river view and we looked down onto the Heli Pad I recommend this room There was a TV over the bath and the shower was a decent size 2 PAX we enjoyed our time in the Steam Room and because of a room mix up at the start of our trip we received a free drink token each which included a tray of appetisers Staff were great and helpful It was a friendly atmosphere and we enjoyed our short stay I had booked rooms far in advance so we paid a cheaper rate and I wouldn t have wanted to pay any more 300 for two nights we downloaded the Uber app and found this to be the cheapest way to travel 10 to London Victoria and 13 to London Hammersmith 
289605,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Breakfast was disappointing scrambled eggs were cold , Beautifully decorated amazing bathroom although plug in bath didn t work Loved all the one touch buttons for lights
289606,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The only negative of this hotel was the cold swimming pool I understand this was due to it being a hydrotherapy pool however it was a bit too chilly I think cold showers would suffice for the whole hot cold temperatures aspect a warm swimming pool would be much more comfortable , Everything about this hotel was excellent the room the staff the views the breakfast By far the best hotel I have ever stayed in 
289607,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The bed appeared to be two single beds pushed together We were sinking down the middle of the bed My partner and I were very uncomfortable Despite discussing with neel the receptionist after the first night we had yet another uncomfortable nights sleep as nothing had changed despite neel assuring me he would sort it Also we ordered a drink at the bar which was automatically added to our room bill However when we decided to settle the bill at the bar two drinks ended up costing us 21 and that was for a gin tonic and rum coke When my partner queried the cost the bar man explained standard measures we re double measures I have never heard anything so silly in my life If we wanted a double we would have asked Also the bar mans response was what s the matter short are you How rude Left my partner feeling belittled I believe this to be a dangerous providing people with double measures I was unaware I was drinking a standard double We did receive 10 discount off hotel price which was ok but I felt disheartened by the hotel which was the only disappointing part of our romantic trip to London , The spa was great The room was spacious Breakfast was fantastic Good location
289608,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Service at breakfast was poor Was offered coffee when being shown to table to be told that Cappuccino was an extra cost advised would look at menu but no one came back to again ask what I would like Very poor also can not believe that a charge of 2 is made for a simple cappuccino, Reception staff very help and knowledgeable Rooms are very quite due to quadruple glazing Mobile signal poor due to glazing but free wifi allows you to use phone without problems The lack of phones ringing is a blessing Had the fish and chips for supper before going out excellent 
289609,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The bed was very uncomfortable seen as the hotel states they are comfy They are two single beds pushed together which me and my partner were very disappointed with Didn t sleep very well at all,No Positive
289610,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The tv needs to been updated with a different system as its quite rigid and temperamental The tv in the bathroom took a few attempts to turn on and off Whilst i was having a relaxing bath there was a continuous high pitched noise i think it was the pipes maybe it was quite annoying The view from our deluxe room wasn t that great as it showed in the picture , Bed was large and comfy with fluffy pillows bathroom was laid out really well with a nice big bath and tv infront on the wall The mirror was so glamorous in the bathroom They supplied a mini sample of sleeping spray and a rub on oil that aids good sleep which i thought was a lovely idea The breakfast was yummy it was my husbands birthday so they made a little desert and wrapped it up so when we entered our room it was there waiting for him thoughtful

289615,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, There was no phone signal throughout the hotel but there was a sign explaining the reason why Wifi was good though , The overall standard of the hotel was immaculate The customer service and presentation of the staff were at a high standard Made to feel welcome from the get go The room I was given was perfect and great value for money so I definitely would recommend this hotel

289632,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The tv in bathroom didn t work apparently not many do but weren t told about this until complaining about it being broken the plug in bath was broken but they changed it for us very quickly For the money spent on that certain room I expected all facilities to work, The view was amazing the hotel was gorgeous the breakfast choices were amazing and staff were lovely and friendly

289649,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, I couldn t work the air con heating which in turn has left me with a sore throat and ear Difficult to find the entrance of the hotel unless you get dropped to the door by taxi The website is really difficult to navigate and even though all information was available in the hotel it would be more beneficial for potential customers to have this information easily accessible online , Rooms were lovely clean and had lovely extras Pillow sprays tv in the bathroom great storage gorgeous breakfast 
289650,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, At first tv in bathroom did not work dirty towels taken and not replaced breakfast was not five star fried eggs swimming in fat beans cold hash browns soft pastries not fresh very disappointing tried charging me 20 for car park when deal was 15 location poor behind industrial units local area not the most elegant to far out from the centre of London made a mistake staying here I have stayed in better 4 star hotels, The room was good fixtures and fittings good
289651,Crowne Plaza London Battersea,No Negative, Initially we were given a room over looking the heliport but we hardly heard a thing due to quadrupled glazing great to watch too Great staff attentive and professional It was a great base for London sight seeing and only a 10min walk from Clapham Junction Spa was superb too exeeded our expectations Would definitely re book 
289652,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, It s really in a difficult location for a London hotel you ll need to cab to a tube station when it s dark, It s a pretty nice hotel but a bit new and hard to work out the facilities etx
289653,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The first room I was given was very old dark and tired looking I finally stayed in other room which was just what I expected Specious and relaxing Thank you , It s my 4th stay in this hotel Very professional staff a bit grumpy and distant on reception tho Manager of the hotel took his time to show me better room Much appreciated I ll be back again very soon 
289654,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Over complicated room lights a manual would have been useful , Food in restaurant really good and not over priced Staff happy and friendly Courtesy car to Clapham junction need to book as it was only on the hour may be time of year 
289655,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, No breakfast included could not see 17 50 justification for breakfast Room service not daily for a level of hotel that it is poor had to chase reception to get room serviced and not told when booked in about services every 2 3 days, Great room position on the Thames good good lunch Staff good and attentive Tony went out of his way to help us on the Friday night when we were in a rush
289656,Crowne Plaza London Battersea,No Negative, Staff were excellent Very friendly and helpful There was a minor problem with a room downstairs which had a leak meaning that the staff had to check something in our room Even though it only took about 30 seconds they were very apologetic and gave us both breakfast on the house for the inconvenience We really did feel well looked after The room and facilities were all very good 
289657,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Location is bit far to nearest train station Room was next to housekeeping service even if we asked for quiet room , High quality supersized bed Room was nice for cleanest and personnel Cool was watching helicopters landing during breakfasts 
289658,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The food could have been better The cooked breakfast was cold The meal in restaurant tasted bland , The bed was super comfy Room was beautiful and clean with great views Staff were very friendly and helpful Excellent facilities 
289659,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Didn t like the room I was in as the room tv and bathroom tv had no reception I could hear the helicopter and the ppl next door, I like the staff and the location was hidden and the hotel was very clean
289660,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Hydropool in spa was not working The spa was one of the main reasons I booked the hotel so that was a shame The TV in bathroom didn t work either , Room lovely bed very comfortable Heated bathroom floor very nice

289663,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Dinner portions were tiny for the price room service was poor language barrier with some staff was difficult window was very dirty which ruined the paid for river view , Bed river view spa facilities breakfast
289664,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The Range Rover showroom parking their cars along the ENTIRE pedestrian access We had to ask how to operate the A C and the TV in the bathroom didn t work The alcohol was a little on the expensive side , Free use of the gym sauna and steam room Staff were really pleasant and helpful and the room was comfortable tastefully decorated and had plenty of functionality including a TV in the bathroom View of the helipad and down the Thames was unique and despite helicopters the room was almost silent Free WiFi shuttle service to the nearest subway excellent meals and affordable room service

289666,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, It s not very near any tube stations, Spacious rooms excellent breakfast friendly efficient staff good for river taxis great river view great pub short walk away
289667,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Location might be a tad out of the way for some but suited me to a tee as I was staying near friends who live in Battersea If you are happy to utilise their free shuttle to Clapham Junction station or catch buses everywhere which is what I did as it was very easy then this is excellent value price wise for the kind of standard that might be unaffordable right in central London , Super comfortable immaculate and extremely quiet room which was closer to 5 star than the 4 stars I think this Crowne Plaza is meant to be Bed was huge and superbly comfy Glam little bathroom Breakfast fabulous Friendly staff 
289668,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The room was not ready The staff lied to us and put us in a lower standard room than what we had paid for 1 hour late We missed our dinner reservation It is too far out for a London weekend break there is no direct route into the city centre , The Spa
289669,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Tad expensive but doesn t matter , Comfortable big bed Riverside views amazing Great breakfast Great dinner in the restaurant with excellent service Spa treatment was unbelievable best hotel I ve stayed in in London
289670,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Did not like the location too far away from city centre and not very close to tubes what so ever Ants were all over the dining bit where we ate breakfast Couldn t work the TV in the bath , I loved the room and the all inclusive breakfast Slept like a log the bed was massive the bathroom was lovely 
289671,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The location of the hotel was not very good The rate for the hotel would be much higher if the hotel located at better place , Very nice room and bathroom very updated and modern very comfortable bed and super bathroom but some wall fixtures needed repair like the access card holder and the light switch for the bathroom The restaurant at second level made a mistake with our order but the restaurant manager manage it very well thank you for him and for the entire staff
289672,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Hotel is a little out of the way if you want to walk it from Clapham Junction and there s considerable construction going on next door but it didn t bother us Lights in room super complicated but kinda fun with so many options , This is a proper hotel Excellent staff and service Heli pad should you need it Somehow I didn t No BS any problem they dealt with it promptly and professionally 
289673,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The price of the movies too expensive so we didn t use them at all , The room was beautiful We didn t have a view of the river but the free spa made up for that 
289674,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Air con wasn t working properly I couldn t control it in my room Apparently there were problems through the hotel and it made the room quite uncomfortable with cold air blowing on me all night , Lovely location by the river I could walk here from work 
289675,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Air con in the lifts and corridors was non existent so very hot Was tucked out of the way and not that easy to find for cabs and not close to any stations Nespresso machine in our room was broken , Bed was really comfy Easy to get onto the Thames Pathway 
289676,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Too isolated Not close to any tube stations for visiting London attractions , Lovely spacious room very comfortable bed great bathroom with inset TV bath and shower Good view of River Thames and helicopters flying in and out of London Heliport next door 
289677,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Room got very hot in the night and the temperature control wasn t working properly , Very clean We were welcomed with a complimentary chocolate brownie that read congratulations which was a nice surprise The shower was excellent bed was comfy too 
289678,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Very expensive drinks in the bar was offered breakfast for 15 which we excepted but was not told it was non refundable As one person in our group was poorly and couldn t have the breakfast Although it did say on the breakfast voucher But I should have been told when I said yes at the time , Comfy pillows nice and clean friendly staff shuttle bus was a bonus to get to and from train station 
289679,Crowne Plaza London Battersea,No Negative, The atmosphere and ambience was spot on The staff were very helpful polite and friendly they catered to our needs The buffet breakfast was very filling Cooked to perfection 
289680,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, It s a shame we can t open the balcony or Windows Also the spa closes too early , My husband and I really enjoy our stay We have been staying monthly since May 2016 Spa facilities are excellenthe breakfast is great and the beds are very comfortable Very pleased 
289681,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, 1 Someone at reception desk that could speak Spanish fluently although they understood us 2 Better views given that we asked for a room with a river view we had a view to the river from the corner but mostly facing the heliport , Full English breakfast was perfect a lot of variety of food muffins croissants juices ham cheese coffee and teas marmalades sausages bacon eggs beans etc The facilities at the Spa centre amazing The bed super comfy and the bathroom very nice and wide 
289682,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Once at the hotel the views across the river were lovely and the walks however the road to the hotel is awful and the building sites and industrial feel to the area does not do the hotel any favours , Bed comfy valet parking and very helpful staff
289683,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Why have such a complex tap system in the bathroom Took ages to work out how to run a bath Form over function I feel The second room I had two nights later didn t have this issue , The rooms were spacious and comfortable Staff were friendly helpful and efficient 
289684,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Shower leaked over floor some fittings showing wear Bathroom door difficult to close , Food excellent Position excellent although not easy to find as building works all around 
289685,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Booking mix up with booking com according to the hotel so room not ready until 6 30pm Fire alarm went off at 07 50 presumably a false alarm but no one told us what was going on Our room was o k but others air con Wasn t working and rooms far too hot , Comfortable room 
289686,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Ensuite toilet did not flush properly and water not hot enough Towel rack in bathrooms were not on and asked for them to be switched on only one was working and then the other was suppose to get fixed but after a week there stil not fixed Do not disturb sign falls off everytime door opened Light switch panel at entrance kept falling off Poached eggs often overcooked Master bedroom TV kept freezing, Breakfast yogurt was good Blonde waitress at cafe was by far the most friendly Complimentary toiletries were great
289687,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The hotel was really great The only downside I can think of is that it s quite tricky to get to at night without getting a taxi The hotel provided a great shuttle service taking you to Clapham Junction station on the hour though if going back in the other direction , The room was great I was upgraded to a spacious executive suite The spa and gym were well equipped and great to have within the hotel It was lovely to have a freshly cooked breakfast rather than just a buffet and the reception staff were very accommodating and arranged a later checkout so I could enjoy the spa after checking in later than expected the night before 
289688,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Too far away from the nearest station Hotel offered a shuttle but only from 8am 4pm To get to London had to take a bus then a train , Room was spacious and bed comfortable Pool was excellent
289689,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Just a little far from train tube but this reflects on the price, The bed was super comfy Love the little touches like the this works sleep set that I absolutely swear by Staff are really friendly Love the TV in the bathroom Fabulous spa facilities also
289690,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, I opted for eggs benedict with ham from the breakfast menu and it wasn t very nice, Staff were really friendly and welcoming Love the room and the view of the helipad and river
289691,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, I upgraded my room but would of loved to see what the standard looked like as I could not see any difference The room was tiny a travelodge is bigger couldn t even swing a cat On the page it said I paid for seating area but if you class a small table and a chair that s not even big enough for a dressing table a seating area then there s no hope Really disappointed,No Positive
289692,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Extremely difficult to find no signage etc Chauffuer has to ring hotel to find out where it was as post code on paperwork did not work on Sat Nav Hotel then gave us a different post code which was OK , The room was comfortable and the staff helpful 
289693,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The aircon didn t work one night stuck full on cold the other two stuck in off mode and the room got very hot Furniture is looking a little worn and dated The morning call computer system messed up and I got woken at 3 46am in error , Staff well very good with attention and service 
289694,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, I requested for something a little more as I took my partner for his birthday but I got a room right next door to the London Helipad Although the sound proofing was great I asked for them to make it a little more specia , Bed was comfy and breakfast was really nice
289695,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Location no signal in room next to helipad buffet breakfast cold poached eggs hard pancakes hard and chewy, Bed comfy nice bath shower once I worked out how to use them
289696,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The drinks and food were very overpriced but good quality We had major trouble trying to find the hotel as there was no street address on the booking which resulted in us paying more for a taxi The hotel also took 2 reservations from my account which took me into an unauthorised overdraft and won t go back into my account until 7 days , The staff were brilliant and made sure we didn t need for anything The room was beautiful with everything we needed 
289697,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The staffs lack of understanding of English Tried to charge again for prepaid breakfasts Shuttle bus only one way, Very nice room Very good food if a little prices Enjoyed our afternoon outside bar watching helicopters
289698,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, It s in shabby shape The bathtub wasn t well cleaned The carpets are heavily stained The digital air con was broken in one room Just needs uograding , The breakfast buffet was stellar
289699,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, carpets were a bit stained they were a light colour , Balcony overlooking the river The heated floors in bathroom The room itself was really nice and spacious 
289700,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Our room had a balcony but we were disappointed to discover that we couldn t go out onto it or even open a window The lighting in our room was bright white light and tricky to operate an option of softer lighting would have been good , We stayed in one of the deluxe rooms with views along the river The Chelsea Flower was the purpose of our stay which was a 20 minute stroll alongside the river away from the hotel Amazing room amazing views and the bed was possibly the most comfortable we have ever slept on when away from home We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant both mornings of our stay staff were friendly and attentive and the food was delicious The helipad outside the restaurant added another dimension it was great watching the helicopters arrive and leave Check in and out was a breeze and the reception staff friendly and informative We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again and recommend this hotel to others 
289701,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, It may have been the nearby construction but everything everywhere in the rooms and the breakfast hall seemed to be coated with a film of dust , Lovely breakfast buffet Loved the warmed bathroom floors Very thoughtful little details 
289702,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Are first night was a disaster we were kept awake most of the night by a coloured guy banging all the doors on are floor It was 4am before any staff came to calm him down , Location
289703,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, We had to wait over an hour to get room service during this time the phone was not answered on either the reception or the room service lines The only way I could get my order taken was to go down and deal with it directly at reception It still took more than three quarters an hour to arrive by which time our taxis had arrived to take us to the church for my daughter s wedding , The staff i the dining room were very helpful and efficient at breakfast time 
289704,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Was very hot just outside the rooms Service in the restaurant was slow and the pizza wasn t good , Extremely comfy bed and lovely E spa toiletries 
289705,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The signage to get to the hotel should be better Where net jets have a sign by the Land Rover garage so should you, The staff were fantastic as was the room
289706,Crowne Plaza London Battersea,No Negative, The helipad next to the hotel was great Your right next to it but with the quadruple glazing you can t hear a thing of them taking off and coming into land 
289707,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, While the hotel is relatively close to Kennsigton Chelsea and other parts of Central London it is not very well connected by public transport no Tube or train station nearby , Quite location on the riverbank of the Thames right next to the Battersea Heliport Nice boardwalk in front of the hotel with views across the river However the area behind the hotel is rather industrial The staff is very friendly and welcoming 
289708,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, As we only eat halal which the hotel doesn t accommodate which we knew we naturally turn to vegetarian options as I was waiting for some hash browns to come out I saw that they had been put on the same tray that bacon had been on so I had to ask for a fresh batch and only got 3 between me n my husband and we felt away to ask for more so I felt that ruined our breakfast on our last day Other then that food was good but was a bit of a wait nothing was out at the same time but was other stuff available while u wait waiting staff were very friendly and helpful and cheffs was a nice range of foods available yogurts and nuts fruits cereals and pastry cheeses salmon n juices was all good xxx would recommend, Realy lovely room with a sofa which was great beautiful bathroom and I loved thar there was a bath with tv and shower with 2 different shower head options was amazing and 2 sinks lots of channels on tv 1 biscuit which is minor but there was 2 of us so I just thought was odd that they only put 1 but no biggie lol great stay all in all very helpfully an friendly staff evan the the cheifs were helpfully thank you xxx was all so nice to see the helicopters flying off during breakfast was great to watch with our son xx good location to go to the children s zoo at battersea park nice park for picnic ect we got hungry late and missed the restaurant luckily the hotel provided us with a local pizza delivery place so we didn t go hungry xx
289709,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Having traced her steps back carefully my girlfriend realised she had left a new hat in a bag in the room When she phoned up the following day very little attention seemed to be payed to this despite her explaining that it was an expensive hat and she was sure it had to be there I didn t like being asked to hand over my car key and told that this would be an extra 15 per night A phrase like would you like to use the hotel s car park Would have made a better impression rather than being felt like I was being ordered to do so In the event I left my car directly across the road and it was just fine The next question was would I like to join your customer loyalty scheme It seemed very early to ask but given the issues with the lost hat I can see why We had to wait around 10 minutes before being able to check in as the man in front of us was engaged in a lengthy but circular argument about why he list discounts on his total package just because he has added a breakfast Overall what could have been a great experience in a well appointed hotel was marred by poor staff , Very good quality accommodation and I liked the firm bed 
289710,Crowne Plaza London Battersea,No Negative, Lovely room Staff unhelpful and rude Poor room service menu If we were treated nicer by the staff then we would of had a fantastic stay Hotel lovely and clean May come back if we were offered a better rate to reflect our first bad experience We were trying the crowne plaza group as we are frequent London commuters and want to find a hotel where we can stay every visit knowing we have good facilities and service This visit left us dissatisfied 
289711,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, No coffee capsules in the room took 2 calls to get them Hot water lukewarm in shower lots of bright lights in the room that couldn t be turned off when trying to sleep Pool not open till half past eight , Room was well laid out nice bathroom comfortable bed
289712,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Hotel was difficult to find even using sat nav The fact that it was next to the heliport would have been useful to know , Staff were very helpful particularly as I left some jewellery in the room They were able to arrange for this to be posted I have now received it 
289713,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, We hired a car at the airport and had a bit of a mare trying to find the hotel It would be great if clear instructions could be given about how to find the hotel once in Battersea particularly as the turn off to the road leading to the hotel looks like a dead end , We stayed at the hotel for 8 nights and were very impressed The room was great and had everything we needed in particular we liked the spaciousness and decor in the bathroom and the super comfy beds We booked a room with a river view which also overlooked the heliport no noise whatsoever as the windows are quadruple glazed but very interesting to see what was going on both on the river and the landing pad The gym is just a small studio but adequately equipped so we were able to have a good workout it would have been a bit of a squash if more people were to use it but at the times we went it was empty bar us The spa looked great unfortunately we were so busy visiting family and friends and sight seeing that we didn t find the time to use it The staff were extremely helpful and friendly We would definitely recommend this hotel 
289714,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Did not like when checking out being told that we had a drinks bill for the bar as my husband had paid cash for all drinks Did not like when went to use the gym went down by lift but could not get lift back up when I used other lift ended up in apartments next door Eventually a member of staff unlocked lift so I could get back upstairs Think there should have been some sort of sign explaining how you were supposed to get out of the basement , The nice room we were given and thought the breakfast was excellent Being able to get a lift to station
289715,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Shame that the Sloane Square option has been removed from the complementary transport facility , This hotel prides itself on relaxation the bed was incredible the room was first class we have used this hotel previously and on this occasion were upgraded to an executive room which made our stay even better the staff were very attentive as always the spa facilities are very good and enhance the relaxation experience 
289716,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, There s no tube station close by but there s not a lot you can do about that We took taxis to get around , The location of this hotel is brilliant it s right on the river our room over looked the heliport next door the windows are double glazed there s no noise and you can walk along the river boardwalk to battersea square in 5 10 mins The room was great spacious and airy with a huge window and view up the river see photo Plus the bathroom was a decent size you don t get that very often in London 
289717,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, I think the room service could have been better our bed sheets were not changed for the entire time we were there , We recently got married and stayed here and absolutely loved it was amazing breakfast was really nice and fresh the view was beautiful and everything was always tidy and clean we will be coming back here again
289718,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Some food was meant to be available 24 hours but they did not cook anything other than breakfast foods up until 12pm , Bed was very comfortable Decent size bath Room was spacious Decor was luxiourious
289719,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Nothing, The reception staff are extremely pleasant and very helpful Our room was superb and the bathroom was out of this world Wonderful breakfast Will definitely stay again 
289720,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Some of the dates of their items for sale in the rooms expired in April we stayed end of May , The bed was very comfortable the room was clean I did pay the extra for an upgrade larger bed and view over the river 
289721,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Nothing, Staff were very competent and friendly Food was very good Room was good with a nice view Clean Bed was very comfortable I just felt very relaxed during my stay Breakfast was very good I liked the decor and the bathroom was very nice
289722,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The food promotion ended up costing us extra money turning a great value into an average value , Room was excellent lots of storage and beautiful spacious well appointed bathroom Loved the walkway along the river and the surrounding neighborhood 
289723,Crowne Plaza London Battersea,No Negative, Very clean and highly furnished hotel Staff customer service was excellent throughout Bedroom had view of heliport which added a little something extra 
289724,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Staff were terrible Traveling on my own was check into a room with 2 single beds When called to change rooms was asked had I used all the facilities in the room No then asked to report to the front desk Given my new room allocation as I had booked yet it was the next to the room original assigned I ve never meet a lazier front office staff ,No Positive
289725,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The guy at the reception when we arrived was a bit difficult for us to understand since we are not British but Danish He did not speak slow and had a very strong accent as well There was no hairdryer in our bathroom , Beside what I already wrote that could have been better the hotel room view spa and food was just lovely I will definitely be back 
289726,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Not a lot of room to leave the car on arrival Swimming pool is far to small to warrant it being called a swimming pool , The hotel room was of great size it was a bonus to have the tv in the bathroom The food that was had from the lunch menu and breakfast was lovely and not too small Very happy to see the helicopter s land and take off Being able to check in early was the highlight for me 
289727,Crowne Plaza London Battersea,No Negative, the staff in the reception were more than great especially Michele Biatries and Mark in the restaurant They are friendly and helpful very quite hotel far from the crowd of the city 
289728,Crowne Plaza London Battersea,No Negative, Fabulous modern city hotel excellent facilities and great service all round The hotel staff were totally efficient and professional and very friendly and helpful and our room and facilities were perfect we couldn t fault the hotel whatsoever The location by the river is interesting and the river view from the room we had was beautiful particularly in the evening London heliport is next door and if your room is on that side of the hotel the infrequent arrivals and departures of helicopters add interest The hotel bar and restaurant are modern and welcoming and the food was very good and reasonably priced The service on the night we were there lacked a little in performance but the effort and desire to please could not be questioned so perhaps it was either down to new staff or an off night The location of the hotel is something of a challenge if you are staying to visit the city and some planning is needed It is located some way from the centre of the city and the nearest tube stations are around 35 minutes walk from the hotel however don t let that put you off Taxis are the obvious and easiest way of getting in and out of the city although we preferred to use the hotel s hourly courtesy car service to Clapham junction and then overground or national rail services in and out which were all easy to use with very regular trains The return leg from Clapham junction to the hotel is around 15 minutes by foot All round an excellent stay 
289729,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Some of the staff were less than impressive I was promised shuttle service to Clapham junction would be waiting for me when I returned from work Never happened and the staff then watched me sitting in the lobby for half an hour without even acknowledging my presence or offering an apology Not great after I spent 5 nights staying there How much effort would it have been to run me 4 minutes down the road with a car waiting outside , The beds Massive and very comfy Also a lovely view down the river of London 
289730,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Just a little bit far from central London but still easily accessible , The bed was really comfortable and lovely bathroom with huge bath and separate shower Loved the view of the river and helipad from our room 
289731,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Not a great location if you re exploring London about 15 minutes walk from Clapham Junction but not near any tube stations Breakfast was expensive , Very comfortable hotel We were only there for one night didn t use the leisure facilities as we were out most of the time visiting family but they looked good 
289732,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Customer care was poor Argumentative male at reception Gave same room to another couple who walked in on us an hour after we arrived Luckily we were just sat watching TV Gave out incorrect WiFi password When we returned from our night out our room card wouldn t work Reception called our room 5 times in the hour after the other guests walked in but hung up twice before we could answer , Fantastic room with view over the River Thames Lovely bathroom Great breakfast 
289733,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, There was no air freshener in the en suite A small thing but very annoying considering the door to the bathroom is only a step away from the bed , Everything was lovely and the hotel exceeded expectations The buffet breakfast was brilliant as was the service and the coffee Staff also helped us with buses and transport to London Victoria about 20 minutes on either 170 or 44 bus stop 2 minutes from the hotel Best of all though was the view from the restaurant Helicopter car parks are amazing to look at over scrambled eggs and coffee 
289734,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Water on table a nice touch but warm being picky there though, Emmanuelle on reception was excellent and helpful Room facilities were more than comfortable The river suites were amazing on my first visit Standard double this time and still a tv to watch whilst soaking in the bath 
289735,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, none, The customer service very important to mention that everyone at Crowne Plaza made me feel really welcomed the reception team were amazing I booked a small room without realising but at the checkin the lady at the reception Beatriz was very friendly and went extra mile upgrading my room and making sure the housekeeping had my room cleaned and even got some porter to drop my luggage in the room Later on I went to the spa which was about to close but Sara gave us some extra 15 minutes which I believe was after she finish work On the check out I had some issues with the pre authorisation payment but Michael sorted it out without any headache definitely will come back and highly recommend this hotel 
289736,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Room was far too hot and aircon made little difference Bathroom not to my taste at all Unable to use balcony as no key provided to the door to access , Staff welcome valet parking good breakfast selection
289737,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Would have been nice to have a swimming pool big enough to swim in , Really enjoyed our stay at the Crowne plaza the staff were very accommodating and pleasant nothing was to much trouble Would stay here again next time we are in London

289739,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Nothing , Breakfast was very good nice selection of hot and cold foods the hot food was replaced regularly so was always Hot and Fresh staff were friendly and helpful Bathroom and room excellent just a small point but if the A C doesn t work just contact reception and they ll sort it immediately it is next to Battersea Heliport but the soundproofing is fantastic so didn t hear a thing
289740,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, We had a slight problem with our room to begin with and when I went downstairs to resolve it I was rudely spoken to by a staff member named Frederico and not only was he rude to myself but undermined his staff member in front of me Did not like the way he spoke to me and I hope he isn t always like that with guests , The room was lovely and everything was clean Room had everything we could possibly need and the bathroom was spacious with a large bath The bed was comfortable Carolina who sorted out our rooms was really kind and welcoming

289743,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, I know it could possible be abit extreme but I think it would be a good idea to add the option to go onto the Internet using the TV to allow the chance to possibly use a Netflix etc account that some people may have This will allow people to be able to watch more things using the TV But like I said it may be abit extreme for all the rooms to have it so if it does not have that then it will not put me off what so ever, The bed was so comfortable the facilities in the room was really nice for the price I paid 
289744,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The corridor and room were excessively hot No easy access by underground, The hotel was good quality and staff were helpful The nearby helipad gave an additional viewing experience river views were amazing

289746,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, A couple of light switch buttons were broken there were a few stains on the carpet The balcony door has a metal strap to stop it opening too far but the part of the frame it s attached to is just a decor panel so falls off when you open the door , Lovely sized rooms beautiful bathroom Nice views across London

289748,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Location slightly further out of city, Beautifully furnished bathroom and bedroom Bathroom was luxurious and the bedroom had all you needed and avery comfortable nights sleep
289749,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, In retrospect it is a little too far from the city and it cost 25 each way for a taxi ride , This is a quality hotel and the staff are great Food is good service is good and it is a relaxing place to be It is right next to the river and you can see the water taxis flying back and forth The Heliport is right next door and you can see the celebs taking off and landing

289755,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, After double checking I was told by reception that the holding fee for damages would not be taken from my bank account unless needed However the funds were deducted from my balance so the funds were then unavailable to me to use during my stay so basically the money was taken then returned This was not made clear enough, The comfy bed beautiful bathroom
289756,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, the food offered in the restaurant was very limited We stayed for five days but if we were to dine in the restaurant every night we would have had to eat something we had already had they only had some 4 different items on the menu, the staff and the room was excellent
289757,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, A nice big sign for the hotel would be lovely, Put up a sign outside Thought the taxi driver was taking me round the back of the Landrover dealership to murder me so dark and nothing to say there was a hotel there
289758,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Being Accused of something and told ill be fined 150 infront of other guest checking in to Hotel To find out it wasnt me and was being wrongly accused No formal apology just verbal one on checking out Still made my weekend as enjoyable as i could As i have 2 young kids and The husband and I dont get time away , Bed Sheets Are Amazingly soft Like a Cloud Slept like a baby

289762,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Not enough staff on reception we had to wait 10 minutes to check in and then we had to wait 15 minutes later in the evening to ask somebody to book us a taxi I understand the hotel was unusually very busy that evening but surely it s not too much trouble to make sure enough staff are on duty to cope with a busy evening , The view over the heliport was stunning and the breakfast was very good 
289763,Crowne Plaza London Battersea,No Negative, Excellent Location on the river walking distance of Clapham Junction the River Bus and local bars restaurants without being a victim of the tourist predators Exceptional value

289765,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Room service was good but they took more money than they should off instead of offering giving change back, Very clean excellent quality polite staff Honestly I was very impressed
289766,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The hotel is a bit far from central London There is no Tube station within walking distance so one has to take bus bus stations are also not very close or taxi Uber offering the cheapest fares However this seems to be reflected in the price but not ideal if are planning to mainly hang out in central parts of London, I liked the welcome at check in already which is always a good start of one s stay Staff was very friendly in general The room was comfortable too and the food was good 
289767,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, I was put in a room with a broken door handle literally hanging off however was assured the door still worked properly Upon leaving the room and trying to re enter the handle completely broke off leaving us locked out Though the staff moved us into the room next door this inconvenience wasted a lot of time for me and my partner as we were celebrating his birthday We simply shouldn t have been put in a room with a broken door , The room was comfortable and had an okay view I expected it to be better seeing as I paid extra for a sea view but it was more of a view of the heliport Staff very friendly and helpful 
289768,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, 1 member of night staff was rude thinking I wasn t a guest and questioned why I was on the premises until he confirmed with another member of staff who I was even though I showed him my room key card Bad customer service , The spa was clean

289770,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Even though there was a TV in the bathroom I couldn t manage to turn it on no matter what I tried We ve also had dinner in the hotels restaurant but wasn t too impressed with this we first ordered a pizza that was hands on the worst pizza I ve ever had The base was smushy and looked like those cheap bases you can buy from a supermarket to make your own It also looked like it was a cake rather than a pizza with orange tomato sauce Also I could have gone without the random phonecall in the morning that almost gave me a heart attack as I was sleeping and have them hang up on me when answered I assume it was an honest mistake so I didn t bring it up when checking out Also I would recommend if you re walking from Clapham Junction to the hotel to think again Especially at night The area we walked through looks very very very shady and we were almost sure we were going to be robed or worse So definitely take a taxi or a bus 170 stops at York gardens which is right in front of the hotel , The room was very cozy and appropriate size Everyone at the hotel was really nice and accommodating The hydrotherapy pool was absolutely lovely Very relaxing and exactly what we needed 
289771,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, Had dinner in restaurant food was good and also the service but restaurant was freezing cold asked waitress about it but she was obviously unable to convince restaurant manager as when we mentioned it to him he shrugged it off with is it Don t like the fact that people who smoke can waltz out on to the verandah for a cigarette The door opening and closing did not help to keep what heat there was in the dining room Smokers should have to go out to the entrance to smoke not disturb diners , Bed was really comfortable breakfasts were excellent with plenty to chose from Really like this hotel
289772,Crowne Plaza London Battersea, The trainee receptionist did not exude the warmth of the rest of the staff but she was no doubt new and nervous She did the job very efficiently , Wonderful breakfast great room well appointed clean and quiet despite overlooking the heliport We used the spa which was a real delight at the end of a busy week
