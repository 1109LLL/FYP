152204,H tel D Aubusson, There was no view from the window but that wasn t a big problem , Friendly service beautiful room absolutely fantastic location away from crowds 
152205,H tel D Aubusson,No Negative, Excellent staff the service was brilliant and we got a free upgrade on our room and small bottle of wine The room features were beautiful all the facilities were spotless and of high spec Would highly recommend it and would definitely go back if I visited Paris again 
152206,H tel D Aubusson,No Negative, Each day offered a wonderful array of comforts and amenities from the delicious breakfast offerings to jazz at night The concierge had spot on recommendations And the location is outstanding Though the hotel feels old world my room was well appointed and modern 
152207,H tel D Aubusson, Can t think of a thing I guess maybe that breakfast was 25 Euro per person per day rather than being included in the cost of the room But we were happy to explore the neighborhood and get our coffee and croissants in any of the charming cafes around the hotel , Room was absolutely lovely and very quiet despite being in a lively neighborhood on the 2nd floor Personal touches like fresh roses in room and around the hotel fresh fruit and champagne in our room as a gift for our honeymoon nightly turn down service with chocolates and a very unique feature the use of a smartphone throughout our stay at no additional charge And Jean the concierge was very helpful buying museum tickets for us and providing great advice 
152208,H tel D Aubusson,No Negative, The physical structure and its setting are eye popping The nightly rate at the time we visited was very reasonable so much so that I expected a bait and switch of some kind upon our arrival which never came 
152209,H tel D Aubusson, I tip at the end of my stay I found the habit of the evening staff in leaving their calling card in the room every night annoying I discovered that there were three and sometimes I would get an extra card So unecessary , All in all excellent I personally prefer more berries as I prepare a berry medley for my breakfast 
152210,H tel D Aubusson, Had a bit of an issue trying to get a cab to the hotel at 8 30 in the morning Some thing to be aware of if you are on a tight schedule We were delayed getting away from the hotel to the airport by 20 minutes waiting for a taxi Other guests were delayed as well Not sure if that is a geographical issue rush hour traffic issue or a lack of cabs Just something to be aware of even though the staff was totally on top of getting the cab reservations made , The staff and the accommodations were first rate From the Conceirge Jacque to the front desk everyone could not have been more helpful with museum suggestions reservations and service Best value for the amount of space in a Parisian hotel Great bar area Breakfast provided was just the right amount of food and choices Love the Hermes amenities in the room 
152211,H tel D Aubusson,No Negative, We loved our room Good size room by Paris standards We had a quiet interior room The bed was very comfortable The bathroom was perfect for one person and a bit tight for two but perfectly appointed with a tub and a window One big perk was use of a smartphone during our stay for FREE calls to the United States and within Europe Concierge service was friendly and efficient We loved walking around the area of the hotel Lively cafes excellent coffee at Malongo and delicious food at KGB Conveniently located near Notre Dame and the Louvre We will stay here again next time we visit Paris 
152212,H tel D Aubusson, Bath a little high sided for easy access and with no separate shower this could be worth knowing , Very elegant public areas plus pretty internal terrace In a quiet location especially interior facing rooms In room mini suite facilities very good with lovely Hermes toiletries in bathroom 
152213,H tel D Aubusson,No Negative, The hotel staff was excellent the jazz in the bar was such a treat the room was clean and comfortable and the location was great I would recommend to anyone 
152214,H tel D Aubusson, The bar staff didn t really have the same welcome as the Head Concierge and reception staff Consequently we only went to the lounge the once , The welcome and efficient service given by reception staff and the Head Concierge was very well received by us The location of this hotel is brilliant close to shopping and restaurants and bars The decor and linens in the room were luxurious Bathroom was superb 
152215,H tel D Aubusson, Honestly I wouldn t change anything and look forward to returning , Very comfortable room including the bed Loved having cocktails in the courtyard Location was perfect 
152216,H tel D Aubusson, No one informed us that there were works carried out in the lobby which looked like a building site The bathrooms are very tired with old taps and mouldy corners on the bathroom Details of bathroom and bedroom are pretty average Overall it is a four star hotel and not a five star as advertised on the internet , The location was definitely the bonus of the hotel The use of Hermes toiletries is also showing the effort of the hotel to make up for its faults 
152217,H tel D Aubusson, Nothing , Amazing location Beautiful hotel and floral arrangements everywhere Helpful friendly staff Couldn t fault it and would recommend and certainly go back 
152218,H tel D Aubusson, There is no way to say something bad about this hotel Truly amazing experience , Champagne and flowers on the bed because our marriage proposal Beautiful room extra soft bed nice bathroom Best hotel we have ever been 
152219,H tel D Aubusson,No Negative, The staff were so lovely friendly and very helpful and informative We liked that we were offered coffee and croissants on our arrival at check in and told that the hotel was our home for the weekend The jazz in the evenings was fabulous and the courtyard was a great bonus to be able to sit outside by still be warm in Winter 
152220,H tel D Aubusson, I would ve liked to see a larger Gin selection at the bar but there is a great Gin bar called Tiger very close , Well appointed and tasteful decadence is how I would describe the hotel and our room The free Android mobile phone was a huge help and the live jazz can t be beat 
152221,H tel D Aubusson, The room was too hot even when we turned off the heat , There was a friendly atmosphere in the bar area at night The concierge and the doorman gave excellent recommendations 
152222,H tel D Aubusson,No Negative, Staff superb Hotel beautiful and tasteful The live jazz evening concerts were a bonus The room was well organized with a window that opened but as in much of Paris a larger room would have been more comfortable 
152223,H tel D Aubusson, Room and bathroom were a bit small though we know from other stays that others are much bigger so luck of the draw , Good breakfast very comfortable bed quiet excellent location 
152224,H tel D Aubusson, My only criticism would be that the bathroom space seemed slightly smaller than I had expected However the rooms were very spacious and clean , All the staff members provided us with an excellent service very helpful friendly and polite There was a little bit of a communication barrier with the concierge staff but they accepted complete responsibility and in return made amendments to suit our convenience 
152225,H tel D Aubusson, Please do not sell the Lobby with the fireplace too often to private functions The guests want to stay there too , Very helpfull staff Small but delicous breakfast Lovely bread selecction very good Orange Juice 
152226,H tel D Aubusson, Breakfast is a tad expensive , Unbelievably beautiful hotel Amazing lounge area with stunning fireplace Staff was up to par with hotels that cost thousands per night I found my new home in Paris I did not understand the negative reviews for this hotel I travel a lot especially to Paris It has everything that you could ask for 
152227,H tel D Aubusson, Nothing, The service by the staff was impeccable from the moment we arrived until we left always helpful and accommodating The property itself was beautiful located centrally to all the thing we wanted to do and well maintained The whole stay was really amazing Will stay here when I return 
152228,H tel D Aubusson,No Negative, They provide within each room a Samsung mobile phone with free roaming calls within Europe also with an excellent app that gives you the hot spots of Paris around you 
152229,H tel D Aubusson, We had two issues one of which was slightly resolved There was a definite heating issue with our room Our room deluxe would not heat above 60F 15 C It was a freezing week in Paris and it was difficult to come back to a cold room The staff supplied a portable heater and each day they said they sent someone to repair the heating and that it was repaired It was not The space heater was sufficient but given the price of the room this should have been resolved in a different manner I suspect there were no other rooms available as this was over New Year s Our only other thought on how our stay could have been improved is if the hotel offered a petit dejeuner of just coffee juice and baguette or croissant We are not big eaters in the morning and did not want to pay 25 euro per person for a buffet when we eat so little It was easy enough to walk to a different brasserie each morning but it would have been nice to have the option to stay in the hotel for breakfast , Our room was exceptionally quiet and very comfortable It was a great place to relax after walking all day in Paris A fabulous location this little boutique hotel is intimate and the perfect marriage of location quality and comfort The main rooms are beautiful from the jazz bar to the fireplace room which are decorated elegantly but is not overly ornate like some of the 5 star hotels This little hotel has charm and is very romantic The room had a very comfortable bed bedding an umbrella which came in handy the one day it poured a safe for storing passports and jewelry a cell phone for our use with free international phone calls maps etc and little details such as chocolates with evening turn down service and a flower left in the bathroom A half bottle of champagne was left for us on our anniversary which was very thoughtful The staff could not have been more friendly and put up with our rusty french and spoke english when we hit a wall 
152230,H tel D Aubusson,No Negative, We have stayed here several times in the past The rooms have all been upgraded concierge service is tops and the Laurent Jazz Bar is one of the best in Paris Everything is at your fingertips Convenient location for left and right bank Really a good value for your money 
152231,H tel D Aubusson, Breakfast at 25 00 a head is just crazy When you re paying 400 a night the least that should happen is breakfast be included , Fabulous hotel in a great location Very friendly staff 
152232,H tel D Aubusson, in the midst of a heavily touristic area hotel s public spaces not that great no in room entertainment, Very Friendly and helpful staff Nice Jazz sessions
152233,H tel D Aubusson,No Negative, Great location for The Louvre Notre Dame Palais Du Luxembourg and Musee D Orsay as all within a reasonably short walk The area has plenty of cafes bars and restaurants close by All staff were very friendly and the rooms and public areas were spotless Our room was in the original 17th century part of the hotel but sympathetically modernised It was nice and quiet at we both got a great night s sleep This is a great base for people who want to be out and about sightseeing and experiencing Parisian life rather than being hotel bound as the hotel majors on service rather than high spec pools gyms and other leisure facilities It does have live jazz which was going strong when we got back at 10pm It was a Saturday night and every table and bar stool were taken and you can t book in advance so get there early 
152234,H tel D Aubusson, Nil, Fantastic staff who were so understanding when we arrived early after flying all night and even though our room was not ready they provided an upgrade a few hours later
152235,H tel D Aubusson, Nothing Maybe some would bulk at the expensive breakfast but actually we never ate breakfast in the hotel opting to go to all those lovely very local patisseries instead , There were 3 couples all staying in their own choice of hotel I think everyone loved our hotel the most even though it might have been a little Cheaper than the others From the emails to me before we arrived to ask was there anything we wanted to do whilst in Paris with genuinely great responses The phone for calls rather than having to change our phone plans to all the little extras wine chocolate and Hermes products everywhere it was perfect 
152236,H tel D Aubusson, If the windows were open the street was too noisy , The bedroom was big and the shower amazing The staff extremely helpful and kind Walking distance from Louvre and Nortre Dame and tons of great eateries and local shopping 
152237,H tel D Aubusson,No Negative, We only had one night in Paris and this hotel was perfect great location and beautiful hotel Our bed was so comfortable The staff was very friendly and helpful and we wish we had more time in this magical city

152244,H tel D Aubusson, When we were there the courtyard was being repainted and I really wanted to eat our breakfast there But not a deal breaker at all , The staff were very friendly Upon check in they gave us a tour of all the facilities and into our room Upon reaching our room we were told they gave us a upgrade which we were very happy about There was a champagne waiting for us and the nightly chocolates which were yum The facilities though not as elaborate as a big hotel we were still very happy about because everything was just too pretty The beds were comfortable too and room was spacious considering you are in Paris where almost all hotel rooms are small Location is perfect too lots of cafes around so when we want to have breakfast elsewhere there are lots of options The hotel is very near Pont Neuf too and is just walking distance from Notre Dame Cathedral 
152245,H tel D Aubusson,No Negative, The hotel is close to everything Just one block from the river Beautiful room charming lobby and excellent staff The live music in the lounge was an unexpected bonus 
152246,H tel D Aubusson,No Negative, Helpful and friendly staffs services Comfortable bed Cozy room Nice location close to touristy places and eateries Chez Fernand restaurant that is just beside the hotel is superb

152249,H tel D Aubusson,No Negative, WE have been coming here for some years because of its wonderful location on the left bank the warm friendly staff We generally do not single out anyone however in this instance we have to say that the we were so pleased to see the familiar faces of the breakfast staff
152250,H tel D Aubusson, Their Superior room seems tobe their basic entry level double Ok but hardly spacious , Breakfast good but expensive Location is excellent 
152251,H tel D Aubusson, The weather Too cold and wet , All the staff the location and the general ambience The Jazz in cafe Laurent the wonderful Florian in the bar the concierge M Jean and his staff The friendliness of most of the other guests 
152252,H tel D Aubusson, bathroom very small stairs to bedroom only a problem for people who don t like stairs , the piano bar created a pleasant ambience at night location very close to the action of the left bank
152253,H tel D Aubusson, nothing to dislike, Beautiful hotel in a great location Lots of bars and restaurants close by Hotel staff very helpful and pleasant We stayed 2 nights and asked hotel to recommend restaurants Both were first class We couldn t fault the staffs excellent customer service Some lovely touches also Complementary half bottle of wine on arrival chocolates in the room and quality bathroom products The bedroom was beautifully decorated and the hotel is full of character I will definitely stay here again 
152254,H tel D Aubusson, It is somewhat expensive The price excludes breakfast , The hotel is very well located in terms of sightseeing shopping and restaurants The staff are very friendly and helpful 
152255,H tel D Aubusson, Nothing Location staff and room were just great , The staff were so friendly and helpful They knew it was our honeymoon so upgraded us before we even arrived Our room was really clean and comfy and the bathroom was great with a massive bath and fabulous Hermes soaps The concierge team organised a fabulous restaurant for our night out and nothing was any trouble for them 
152256,H tel D Aubusson, There are no negatives regarding this hotel , The staff were extremely helpful booking our excursions and restaurants The room was beautiful 406 Turn down service very welcome water bottles every day very comfortable slippers ladies size not generic big foot size 10 The bar area is so serene and pretty and an enjoyable place to stop and have a drink The banana cocktail was yummie 
152257,H tel D Aubusson, They forgot to turn my bed down so apparently i missed out on the chocolates , The quietness of the rooms the location the ambiance decor the Hermes toiletries
152258,H tel D Aubusson, no restaurant I mean food location and bar is there in the property except for breakfast and room service and this is missing for a fifth star , Everything
152259,H tel D Aubusson, Nothing, Loved everything about this hotel in a great location My husband and I stayed on the opposite side of the river and then transferred over to this hotel Next time we will only stay here Marina at the front desk was amazing as was Max at the hotel bar The service was first class The beautiful bar Cafe Laurent was a wonderful unexpected delight Very upscale bar adjacent to the Lobby wiith Jazz on the weekend We are foodies and there were many great restaurants around the corner and the hotel is within walking distance to the historical sites It also has a lovely courtyard for morning breakfast or evening cocktail off the Lobby bar area You should book this hotel as it will exceed your expectations We will be back 
152260,H tel D Aubusson, Nothing, The room was quiet and the products were wonderful Hermes soap Breakfast was delicious I liked the welcome We were shown all the areas in the hotel Had terrific wifi 
152261,H tel D Aubusson, We would have loved to have sat in the courtyard but there were always people out there smoking , The staff was outstanding particularly Jean at the front desk 
152262,H tel D Aubusson, I thought the breakfast was overpriced for what it was Better to have everyone order from the menu then it would be more freshly prepared , Really enjoyed the oversized room and excellent bathroom facilities 
152263,H tel D Aubusson, Nothing Ready to return , Lovely charming hotel Nightly treats champagne and fruit very much enjoyed Excellent concierge recommendations for dining Delicious coffee Staff always pleasant and helpful 
152264,H tel D Aubusson,No Negative, The cleaning staff was incredibly attentive they left kid sized slippers for my daughter and they left luxurious fruits and treats each night in our room The hotel is lovely and not overrun by tourists a real gem 
152265,H tel D Aubusson, Breakfast was not included in our booking and it was quite expensive It was 25 euros for each person which seemed like a lot As a result we only had breakfast there once It s so easy to find a more reasonable breakfast in the neighborhood but it would have been nice to have a reasonable option in the hotel as well Something quite strange happened while we were there which made us feel a little less happy with the stay but it s hard to say who exactly was to blame On the first night we went out to dinner and returned to the hotel where we sat in the bar for a little while When we left I brought my coat to my room from the bar the bartender said the next day he actually remembered I had it with me and the next morning it was gone I may have left it on a railing outside my room while I looked for our key card in my purse but we were in a part of the hotel that was shared with only one other guest room so unfortunately the only explanation could have been that a fellow guest or staff member took it It wasn t a very expensive coat but it meant I was walking around in the chilly weather without one for a day hoping someone would turn it in It never was turned in and unfortunately I had to buy another coat Like I said it could have been another guest which is obviously not the hotel s fault but I just find it so strange that a coat would disappear in such a nice place , The location of this hotel is superb It was my husband s first time in Paris I used to live there and I wanted to find somewhere central so we could walk to most of the places we wanted to visit Being in the Latin Quarter was a great spot for us and it s so close to tons of great restaurants Some of them are quite touristy but you can find a few good spots that are more filled with locals The hotel itself is in a beautiful old building and the bar has live jazz music every night at least every night we were there Our room was small but tastefully decorated and very comfortable The staff was very nice and helpful 
152266,H tel D Aubusson, Room lighting rather dim but artistic and separate reading light in bed was good not too much criticism , Chaos at check in one receptionist polite helpless in the face of work load some technical failures apparently I was forced to pay before entering the room that seems strange Tried to make up with a half bottle of champagne nice gestured Good evening live music entertainment Overall very good I was given a room upgrade PCM
152267,H tel D Aubusson, Nothing not to like, Beautiful hotel typically French feel Exactly what we wanted The staff where brilliant and the location was perfect The loft room is the best and gives you a special experience whoever thought up the idea for these rooms should be commended 
152268,H tel D Aubusson, Nothing Rare we say this but on this occasion it is difficult to find fault , Stayed here for 3 nights as part of a trip to the England v France rugby match This is a wonderful and special hotel It is perfectly located close to the Louvre Latin Quarter and transport links RER from CDG and Stade de France as well as the Metro It is also a lovely place to stay very good staff clean rooms and a real away from it all feel Wine in the room was a lovely touch 
152269,H tel D Aubusson, No breakfast included but with all the amazing local cafes to sample this may be an advantage , Fantastic building and convenient location we were able to walk everywhere easily but at night it was quiet and relaxing Staff were courteous and friendly really welcoming A fantastic place to stay 
152270,H tel D Aubusson, Nothing Everything was perfect , The hotel is comfortable and clean with lovely furnishings The staff was helpful friendly and attentive The location is perfect for sightseeing one can walk to museums the Metro and the RER 
152271,H tel D Aubusson, Nothing, The staff was very helpful and pleasant The breakfast was delicious and the location was convenient to all the left bank activities They let us store our luggage at the hotel while we walked around Pais on the day we checked out
152272,H tel D Aubusson, Small bedroom Could not fix the heat of warm water in the shower Quality of information at the front desk concerning activities in Paris was a little poor , Excellent location beautiful house very classy and very cosy at the same time quiet bedroom Very nice staff excellent breakfast Caf Laurent is a plus 
152273,H tel D Aubusson, We can be very critical when it comes to hotels we have no qualms with paying the price tag that comes with the luxury label provided we feel we ve been offered what we paid for and I can honestly say that our entire experience here was without flaw it s now our go to hotel in Paris It feels five star and in fact trumps some of the ones we ve experienced in Paris I would have enjoyed more room service options but this is merely a matter of personal preference , As soon as you enter its obvious the interior is gorgeous The sitting room is breathtaking and it s great to have the heated courtyard which would only be better with a fireplace We took a deluxe double room which was spacious clean and also very detailed Not a standard boring hotel room in the least The staff were all extremely friendly effiencent and accommodating We asked for quite a late checkout and we were so hateful that they graciously accommodated us Sybille was so great in accommodating restaurant reservations as well We loved one of the main bartenders who felt like an old friend after a few nights They welcomed us with a bottle of wine the first evening which was a wonderful surprise And turned down the room with great care every night The neighborhood is great for access to museums bars and some of the best non touristy restaurants 
152274,H tel D Aubusson, The tub drain wouldn t hold the water very well also we don t drink alcohol and requested a bottle of nice juice instead but were given the wine anyway Aside from those small things which do matter our experience was wonderful , We had a fabulous stay and we have recommended it to many friends Everything about it was wonderful and the restaurant recommendations were superb Thank you we will definitely be seeing you again 
152275,H tel D Aubusson,No Negative, Super lovely hotel with the BEST location Very sweet and professional staff fabulous breakfast Loved the free water bottles in the room and the decor was incredible charming Great place to stay if you are looking for a small boutique hotel with a homey feeling 
152276,H tel D Aubusson, They are still in the process of undergoing a renovation so here and there you could see a little sign of that but overall they are managing it very well and it did not intrude on our weekend at all , The staff was extremely helpful and went out of their way to make us comfortable 
152277,H tel D Aubusson, The breakfast offering is extremely expensive considering what you can get just outside the door The bathroom was cramped and the closet poorly designed with very little space , The location was excellent and the staff very helpful The rooms were clean comfortable stylish and surprisingly quiet 
152278,H tel D Aubusson,No Negative, Fantastic Hotel every little detail was well thought about makes the difference Great staff knowledgeable and helpful Location easy easy access to all main attractions but in the heart of a great cafe and restaurant area Would recommend this hotel over and over again Use the concierge service to help book pre visit and during your stay it will help you make the most of your time Interior of the hotel is truly beautiful pictures don t really do it justice 
152279,H tel D Aubusson, Why no gym There were some late night revelers in the patio area our first night so we never got to sleep before 2 30 p m , the staff is great and offered much assistance from getting us an airport cab to a haircut The downstairs lounge outdoor area and salon were gorgeous The room was quiet and clean with a nice bath 
152280,H tel D Aubusson,No Negative, Rooms are very comfortable Room cleaning service is excellent There is a nice fire place in the lobby and service is very good Rooms are well insulated and quiet 
152281,H tel D Aubusson, We were offered upgrade of the room the room was lovely but it was a bit weird that there was no bathtub in the room we had more spacious room more spacious bathroom without bathtub , Staff were lovely helpful location is perfect pleased with the surprise gift Loved the music played in the bar Felt so special having lovely wine accompanied with the live music Our stay in Paris could t be this good if we didn t stay this hotel We will definitely come back again 
152282,H tel D Aubusson,No Negative, Hotel D Aubusson is a very comfortable hotel in a wonderful location close to The Seine and the vibrant districts of St Germain and the Latin Quarter An added bonus is the atmospheric Cafe Laurent which hosts live jazz concerts

152290,H tel D Aubusson,No Negative, We had a great stay here The staff made you feel welcome from the moment we stepped in the door Our only comment was you could not make a cup of tea or coffee in the room and if you ordered one you were charged for it 
152291,H tel D Aubusson,No Negative, We enjoyed the bar entertainment The help at the front desk for tickets taxis restaurant referrals was excellent We felt very secure and welcomed in Paris 
152292,H tel D Aubusson, Nothing I was there with my 27 year old granddaughter and we enjoyed ourseleves very much , The location and atmosphere of the hotel Plus the very welcoming and helpful staff and nicely furnished bedrooms withfloral balconies 
152293,H tel D Aubusson, unfortunately there was a lot of construction at the time that took away from initial first impression There was also a garbage strike the day we arrived so you can imagine what the outside streets looked like , the ambience was spectacular loved that cafe Laurent was right in the lobby the staff was fantastic they helped provide car service to and from the airport Definitely a place I would not only stay again but highly recommend
152294,H tel D Aubusson, All staff were nice and helpful However It s a bit pity that there is a psychological distance In distance Of course this is exigeant to staff , Location comfortable facilities Staff at the reception was very helpful
152295,H tel D Aubusson,No Negative, Everything we could not fault the hotel the staff the service the position all perfect They all went the extra mile even when our Malaysian air flight was delayed by a day a quick email to the hotel elicited a quick reply and a chilled bottle of wine awaited our late arrival We over the whole hotel experience 
152296,H tel D Aubusson, Unfortunately there were road works right outside the hotel which made it dusty and noisy at times and access was difficult for taxis when arriving and leaving with luggage This was not the hotel s fault but impacted on our stay, Friendly and very helpful staff nothing was too much trouble 
152297,H tel D Aubusson, The taxi that was called for us refused to give us our change when we arrived at the airport His green cab is 3607 , When we arrived at the D Aubusson we were so impressed with all the wonderful help Every part of the hotel was tended to with loving care Its like each of the staff welcomed us to their home Housekeeping excellent Lounge area excellent Loved the young girls at the front desk They were very charming

152302,H tel D Aubusson, The only negative with the hotel room would be that I would have liked a mirror above the desk so that I could plug in my power adapter and hair dryer and blow dry my hair The hair dryer in the bathroom was terrible , The hotel s location was perfect There were plenty of bistro s in the area I loved that it was only a few minutes walk to the Seine River The staff was very accommodating I would highly recommend it
