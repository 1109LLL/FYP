329495,Cotton House Hotel Autograph Collection, The staff wasn t as organised and attentive as you would expect in a 5 star hotel At times it felt more like a staff training environment than a luxury hotel This used to be a lot better It was the attentive staff that gave the place its magic , The environment is really great and relaxing
329496,Cotton House Hotel Autograph Collection, The hotel had lost our booking com booking and our room was only ready 6 00pm We had to wait at the pool area where the beers were served warm , The Design
329497,Cotton House Hotel Autograph Collection, If you wish to charge like a first class hotel you can t manage like a second rate hotel This hotel isn t value for money Nicely decorated premises and well located but very poorly managed We checked out after 2 days and went next door to El Palace the old Ritz which was far superior in all respects and literally half the price The manager of the Cotton House needs to start managing the hotel We phoned the manager to share our concerns and never had our call retuned Says everything you need to know about the lack of interest in the guest experience Staff are very friendly but mostly untrained They need to spend less time talking to each other and pay more attention to their guests It all has a whiff of Faulty Towers about it Day 1 no housekeeping turndown service Day 2 no housekeeping at all It took 2 phone calls to finally get our room cleaned The large maid s trolley stayed in the narrow corridor near our room all day Coffee machine in the room was nice to have but Day 1 we only got 1 decaf capsule and 1 caf for 2 guests and no milk We spoke to the housekeeper Day 2 we only got 1 decaf capsule and no milk Breakfast choices are limited and more characteristic of cheaper 3 star European hotell You will need to ask 2 or 3 times for a coffee even though the barista only needs to press a button on an automatic coffee machine you will recognize from airport lounges Coffee capsules in a first class hotel restaurant Really Step off the elevator on the 2nd floor onto carpet that is filthy and stained The fitness centre is a fitness closet Small little equipment and no water On Day 2 it was locked Went to reception who said they would send a colleague who never arrived Finally managed to get a maid to open it after a long wait Rooms have the world s smallest complimentary water bottles Must have been a real effort to source them ,No Positive
329498,Cotton House Hotel Autograph Collection, The smell in our room was terribly Very bad plumbing The sofa table and rug were very badly marked and not in keeping with the rest of the decor, The architecture and common parts to the hotel are stunning 
329499,Cotton House Hotel Autograph Collection, The service around the bar could be a little bit faster , The service was impeccable and really friendly I loved the staff in the hotel always smiling and cordial The room was really spacious well presented clean and filled with amenities Bonus tip the bed was really comfortable and the wine in the room really delicious

329502,Cotton House Hotel Autograph Collection,No Negative, This hotel is amazing a class act and well run Fanastic staff with attention to detail The food is superb with a great bar and outside terrace that even in March is a great place to chill out blankets and firepits keep you warm as you can tell we will be returning 
329503,Cotton House Hotel Autograph Collection, I have been in many 5 stars hotel and i can tell this is not one of them the lobby and breakfast room is 5 stars but when it comes to my room it was less than average furniture so old and the carpet was so dirty I didn t want to step on it staff in the breakfast room were not very friendly i will definitely not stay there again , The breakfast is great bathroom really big and nice

329505,Cotton House Hotel Autograph Collection, Unfortunately we seem to have caught the height of trainee season I m assuming regular staff was on holiday and service was overall poor Further worst breakfast eggs benny I ve had in a long time totally undercooked and poor massage in a tiny noisy room This is all quite unacceptable especially given the price tag of the hotel , Wonderful building public spaces and decor Stylish clean rooms Good lunch
329506,Cotton House Hotel Autograph Collection, We booked a deluxe room and got put in a broom cupboard Had to fight to get upgraded out of it at 12 30pm when we arrived without being forced to pay for an upgrade Generally check in staff doing Late shift are pretty unpleasant Pool tiny Few facilities or service that make you feel that you re in a 5 star hotel, Beautifully designed bar and breakfast room on first floor Restaurant staff very helpful Cosy outdoor terrace 
329507,Cotton House Hotel Autograph Collection, Drainage in the shower was not adequate and it took a while for all the water to drain Also the water temperature setting went from warm water in the cold setting to very hot water in the hot setting , Very friendly staff extremely comfortable bed great location wonderful breakfast 
329508,Cotton House Hotel Autograph Collection, It s not like a five star hotel not so clean Every facilities and service seems like a three star hotel Not worth the money I really not recommend this hotel if you require a high standard five star hotel And waht a big joke happen when our check in date Especially The reception staff are really not polite bad manners first welcome sentence is Miss u have booked 2 rooms for the same day we should charge u 2 rooms price And insteaded that I had booked it But at last it s mistake the staff made it s not the same person just the name is almost look like the same But even ending didn t come to a serious sorry from tche staff awful hotel staff All the checking in duration is full of we will charge u 2 room rate we won t call the booking com coustermer service u call it by yourself to solve the problem But please cotton hous the fact that it is your fault you have did but u ask the guest to suffer this unprofessional service Awfully experience , nothing like 
329509,Cotton House Hotel Autograph Collection, Nothing We loved everything , The bed was so comfortable The room was very clean and modern We especially loved sitting on the balcony The staff was very friendly and spoke English We enjoyed our stay very much We will recommend this hotel to friends coming to visit Barcelona

329511,Cotton House Hotel Autograph Collection,No Negative, Absolutely oozing with style and character The hotel s location is central and Sagrada Famille is a short and scenic walk away Our room was smaller than we expected but perfectly formed My friend and I loved the terraces and utilised both of them during our stay Cotton House staff are warm and accommodating Our stay was to celebrate my birthday so we wanted something with the x factor and this hotel certainly delivers We especially want to thank Alonso Gabriel Sara Laura Mercure Younes and Alejandro who were exceptionally sweet to us and ensured our trip was extra special Gracias

329513,Cotton House Hotel Autograph Collection,No Negative, Great hotel great location stylistically restrained for such a hotel but retaining a luxury feel think colonial gentleman s club but updated Staff very helpful Great food Being a solo guest can often mean a hotel tries too hard to make you feel welcome but I was treated well without the service being overbearing Definitely shall return

329515,Cotton House Hotel Autograph Collection, The fitness center had limited options , The hotel is situated in a strategical place for you to go around everywhere in walking distance or would only require 2 3 stops on the metro for major tourist attractions The decor is amazing and the staff are always willing to help especially their concierge services where they can book you entrance tickets in advance for tourist destinations They also provided some insightful advice to which tourist places are recommended

329519,Cotton House Hotel Autograph Collection, People say watch your wallet in Barcelona it is easy to be pickpocketed I feel like I was cheated by this hotel They should ve posted a picture of the window side deluxe room The view from my room was terrible There was an air vent with a noisy so we couldn t open the window Besides the room was enclosed with the high wall right next to the building as you might imagine this hotel screwed up my first impression of Barcelona I wonder how this hotel got five stars I felt really stuffy and dry so I ask someone to change the room but they answered every deluxe room has same view so if I want to stay with a normal window view then I need to pay 100 euros more to get an updated room even I booked with a pretty high price it was almost 300euros I felt really sorry to my friend because chose this hotel it was just waste of money , The breakfast was good I should ve just visited this hotel restaurant
