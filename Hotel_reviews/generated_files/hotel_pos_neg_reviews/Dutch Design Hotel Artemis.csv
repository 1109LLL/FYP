350601,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, A city tax we didn t know about 27 euros for 5 nights Shop 15 minute walk away No nearby bars or restaurants seriously zero 40 minute trip into Amsterdam we expected this as we went out of town for a good price but I could imagine it getting tiresome with a family Be prepared for high bar prices if you d like a drink after a hard days sight seeing , Very friendly staff Efficient service in bar and restaurant Good price for last minute in first week of August Most other centre hotels were asking for at least 150 a night this hotel was just under 100 
350602,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, I noticed quite a few guests patronising the little cafe next door The reason s you need to investigate and resolve it them to enable guests to eat at the hotel , I liked everything about the hotel The beds are extra comfy the room was well cleaned and the cleaners were polite I am British and the staff were good enough to speak to me in English I really felt at home I am so grateful to Dutch Design Hotel 
350603,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The windows barely opened only a Very little The drains did not clear properly the neon lights from buildings next door flooded our room The bed and bathroom were clean but the rest was VERY dusty and needed a good spring clean , The location was excellent for our visit to family resident in Amsterdam The price was excellent for Amsterdam there were covered bike parking facilities It was reasonably quiet considering it was in Amsterdam The linen and bathroom were clean 
350604,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, When I paid for my reservation they could not locate the money for at least 2 weeks which caused me stress and inconvenience The rest of the aspects were great though ,No Positive
350605,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis,No Negative, The location itself is pretty good about 20 minutes away from the airport by public transport and 25 minutes away from Central by tram It s a really nice hotel looks quite modern has a welcoming environment by all the staff very clean and tidy rooms Would definitely recommend to anyone 
350606,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, There is no air conditioning This is not a 4 star hotel The floors have very filthy carpets While they advertise parking on site there is none It is public pay parking anywhere you can find it , To be honest the only thing was the friendly front desk staff 
350607,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis,No Negative, Beautiful hotel really comfy beds polite staff Housekeeping left clean towels even though we didn t really need them Tram and bus stop within walking distance Would stay here again 
350608,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis,No Negative, Great wifi and location Really helpful staff and great transport links into the centre Can buy metro tram train all in one pass at the reception as well as discounted attraction tickets Room cleaned every day and lovely spacious rooms 
350609,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The staff could have been a little more friendly and approachable and the breakfast available could have been a little less expensive However overall the hotel was very impressive and the location was perfect not too close or far away from the town centre ,No Positive
350610,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The location is quite far from the tram or bus stop it took 10 minutes walking so when it s raining it s really a big problem so you have to order taxi ,No Positive
350611,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Quite expensive overall with breakfast parking fees etc taken into account It s located in a business industry park which is less than ideal for 90 of tourists We will spend our money elsewhere next time , Breakfast was enjoyable
350612,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The hotel is a little bit out of the centre but it s just a short walk to the tram stop which gets you into the city , The hotel was clean trendy and modern the beds was very comfortable and the staff were extremely helpful and accommodating I didn t eat here but the restaurant looked lovely I would definitely stay there again 
350613,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, It s just a little bit far from nearby public transportation stations Average walking time is 8 minutes , It was a really beautiful and clean hotel with all the equipments you need 
350614,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Transport to airport could be better the only ideal option was an ber as public transport would have taken over an hour hotel shuttle would be greatly appreciated, Room great and beds so comfy Did ask for a double though but happy to put them together Metros were our preferred option but the hotel advertise the tram which is also good but slower and smaller
350615,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Our room was dusty staff forgot to give us towels one day when we asked the reception for a new deck they promised to do in 10 minutes however we only received our towels on the next day after we called again besides that its an ok hotel to stay in while in Ams , Beds were comfy rooms are quiet staff is nice and helping No balconies 
350616,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The evening staff at around 3 30am on Sunday evening were very unhelpful when we enquired about a lost phone that the hotel had information on acted like he didn t care However the staff on Monday morning sorted it out for us within 5 minutes and we got the phone back ,No Positive
350617,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Room was dusty and windows were covered in fingerprints smudges Soap in shower was empty wasn t refilled even when note left for housekeeping Breakfast not included , Bed was comfortable 
350618,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The cleanliness of the hotel was unacceptable From the first day the bath was not clean which we mentioned but nothing happened We stayed for 3 days in the room but never cleaned someone , It was a modern very large hotel next to a beautiful park Long way from the center but with the tram 2 you reach it in 20 minutes A noble staff gave us room for a very early morning without charge big plus 
350619,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, There were no normal teabags and no normal milk for tea There was only coffee and herbal tea and coffee creamer Although I m sure if we asked they would have provided this Was a bit weird that they charged for the same coffee satchels in the reception as what was in your room We had no sugar so I had to ask and this was just handed to me free of charge so did not quite understand why they charged The shower was not as powerful as what I would have like but the bathroom was very clean and towels were changed everyday if required I was a bit annoyed that when me and my friend decided to relax in the outdoor seating area at 11pm I was refused a coffee as they had shut down the machine yet they were serving other drinks and there were plenty of people outside still drinking The worst thing was the breakfast Although there were plenty of options in the buffet to choose from I thought the breakfast was hugely overpriced at around 20 each I ate out for cheaper than that and had a full lunch with drinks at the hotel and it was cheaper than that Was quite shocked at the price Music channels on the TV would have been good , The hotel itself was beautiful the staff were extremely nice and helpful The lunch prices were reasonable The outside seating area was beautifully set out and so peaceful The rooms were very clean and the design was clean fresh and modern Complimentary toiletries were nice 
350620,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis,No Negative, Hotel is positioned on outskirts of city but there is a 5 minutes walk to tram that take you to city center 20 minutes ride Staff is polite Room is neat and tidy You can print your boording card there 
350621,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The wifi was occasionally a little flakey , High quality hotel with excellent rooms and fantastic restaurant food Pretty easy to get to even by bus from the airport and not too far from the nearest tram stop to get into the city 
350622,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Just a minor thing there were some bits in my bed when I got into it Looked like small squishy gel like substance Not really related to the hotel but the walk way to the hotel from the tram stop was a little run down scary at night I felt a little uneasy , Hotel was modern and food was good Staff were excellent 
350623,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Slow WiFi Distant location from city center , Cosy room Free instant coffee tea sugar in the room Liquid soaps in a reusable container instead of tons of disposable ones 
350624,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, unfriendly staffs at breakfast hotel is located far from the city centre not so close to the airport either the hotel shuttle to city centre is limited to weekends only no compliments water the housekeeping service is not good they don t change the sheet and clean the room properly, spacious room good selection for breakfast
350625,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, No shuttle bus to the airport, Helpful and informative staff members easy access to trams and buses They also had their own bikes you could rent for the day 
350626,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Room was a bit dark and dingy No sign of Dutch Design apart from the odd token gesture Just seems like an average hotel No indication of trying to provide a great customer experience for the price , The terrace by the water
350627,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The dinner menu was expensive and very limited in choice Portion sizes are very small Had to pay an extra tax when we arrived Was not aware of this when booking Thought everything had been paid for , Comfortable beds and modern style 
350628,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, In the bathroom the washbasin had lots of deep cracks that were dirty so it was not even cleaned properly The washbasin should be replaced I also found a dried up piece of pepperoni on the floor in a corner of the room so clearly the room was not being cleaned well , I liked spaciousness of the room 
350629,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The daily cleaning was insufficient I e beds were cleaned and towels were changed but cover sheet wasn t changed And coffee and suger supply wasn t refilled Water wasn t strong enough at the shower , On the good side hotel was very clean and organized Front desk staff was very kind and helpful 
350630,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Shuttle service is a joke you are asked to book atleast an hour in advance and they charge per person for shuttle into the city It is more like a taxi service Quite some walk to public transport Not ideal for city visits unless you dont mind the walking, Clean and tidy room fairly new hotel looks to be in good condition 
350631,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, No shops resturants without a half hour walk we needed paracetamol and walked 30 mins there and 30 mins back Would be good to maybe have a small on site shop for essentials like this n toiletries Also older male behind the bar not very helpful polite and could certainly do with a refresher on his customer service , Large rooms very comfortable shuttle service to Centre very good for the money Friendly staff at front desk always happy to help Would deffinatley stay here again 
350632,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, No complaints , Although somewhat out of town transportation not a problem and staff very helpful in giving directions reserving cabs etc Good rooms attractive restaurant
350633,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, There were some staff that was not friendly Also no one informed me that when I handed in my washing on a Friday I would only get it back the Monday whcih was very frudtrating , The location It is an 8 minute walk from the tram The rooms was also nice and big 
350634,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Both me and my friends found the pillows very uncomfortable and lumpy We also didn t like the door to the toilet doesn t actually close and is quite transparent which would not be appropriate if on business with a business partner luckily we were good friends so it wasn t too much of problemz, The bus stop wasn t too far away good value for money shower really nice
350635,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Location too far from everywhere 1 About the front desk We came before the check in time and wanted to put our luggages We had a total of 7 luggages 3 big ones and 4 cabin luggages The receptionist did not help us at all Furthermore when we asked about transportation as it was King s day and some public transportations might not work they did not have sufficient information to tell us instead they told us just to ask the tram driver Lastly I was ordering a taxi for after check out I haven t even finished giving out all the details for the taxi as I said before we had a lot of big luggages as I needed a van one or anything big not a sedan the receptionist already picked up the phone and called the taxi When I added some information for the taxi she looked at me as I was interrupting her So disappointed with the hospitality And we got a sedan taxi 2 Housekeeping We were staying for 4 nights 5 days drank coffee after our first night they did not clean the mug until after the 3rd night and left the desks dusty We were impressed at first how the hotel takes sustainability seriously and about the note of daily excessive laundry caused by hotel towels and thus we hung our towels on the rails and hooks yet housekeeping still changed it every single day , Comfortable beds and nice bath
350636,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The staff were not very helpful and were quite rude Really put me off wanting to go back there , Very clean and attractive hotel It is a little way out from the centre however it s only a short walk to the tram which was very convenient and a great way to see a lot of Amsterdam 
350637,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis,No Negative, The hotel staff and the hotels location to the city were excellent Highly recommended The walk to the tram stop was easy once you knew where you were going 
350638,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, I literally didnt have shampoo stocked in my hotel for both nights i thought for certain that they would notice the empty bittle and refill it but it didnt come on the second day I also noticed that the room wasnt cleaned carefully just a staff prlblem , The area around the hotel was amazing and abundant with cute wild animals 
350639,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Far from public transportation and shops around 1 km to closest bus station and 2km to closes shop , Great place polite staff and bike rental in the hotel Extra comfortable beds Refrigerator and safe in the room 
350640,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Be warned it you re travelling by public transport there is a 10min walk from the nearest metro or tram stop to the hotel through an industrial zone This is well flagged up on the hotel website but it may present a challenge if you have a lot of luggage and the weather conditions are not ideal The directions to reach the hotel on foot are non trivial so pay careful attention to them The seating round the bar is a bit unusual not very cosy comfortable nor conducive to social mixing , The free WiFi is good e g I was able to watch Netflix Breakfast is not included and costs 20 but there is a fantastic selection of breakfast foods with many different types of freshly baked bread a highlight 
350641,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Bathroom basin was cracked significantly not sure if it has been noticed will need rectified Limited toiletry in the bathroom shampoo and shower gel altogether Took ever so long to get hot water in the taps showers TV really old and poor resolution remote control unable to make any adjustments Noisy heating air conditioning fans so we kept it switched off in the night or on low fan speed Needed to allow enough time to get out as public transport access 8 10 minutes and then to central Amsterdam was 25 30 mins , Quiet although close enough to the centre by public transport Comfy large bed good quality of sleep hotel provided us with an extra double duvet which was very helpful as it was quite cold outside Great breakfast Staff very helpful a bit of a language barrier with some but with enough other staff around they managed very well
350642,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, problem with hot water in shower on the second morning right as i was checking out i paid over 300 for this hotel booking the basic expectation is a clean room a warm bed and a hot shower It s a shame that the guest experience is ruined because of a failure to deliver the basic needs , close to airport nice sleek hotel
350643,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The staff was less than accommodating It was not convenient to get back into the city of Amsterdam The tram is at least 17 minutes which is not a easy ride and then you have to walk to the hotel Uber is easiest way to get in and out of the city and to the airport Skip the expensive inflexible hotel shuttles, it was a clean pleasant hotel
350644,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, No milk in the room for tea or coffee No water bottle in the fridge Breakfast not included in the price otherwise it is 15 Euros The style of the rooms is modern but dark and a bit gloomy The bathroom door wouldn t close properly and curtains don t reach the floor which leaves day light in the room in early morning No shops around as the hotel is located in a business park The tram is a 15mn walk and it takes 20mn to reach the town center In Holland no restaurants would give you FREE TAP WATER in a jug with your meal This is very disappointing Your tap water is drinkable so you could at least give it for free like they do in most other European countries Sorry but this is very petty , Quiet and comfortable bed Spacious Big lifts and fast Doorbell at the bedroom doors Wide corridors and doors Big rooms and good size bathrooms 
350645,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, I felt likd the room had just been given a quick once over and it wasn t that clean it was like staying in a borrowed bedroom dusty and with dribbles down the glass bathroom door There were only 2 people on reception and they took absolutely ages to get through the small queue , It was within easy walking distance from where I needed to be The views The art The price on the night I needed it however given the distance from the centre and it s setting that should be the price anyway The bed was comfortable 
350646,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, My only slight issue was the shower needs to be adjusted as had to take the shower head off the wall to use it but this is only a very small issue , I liked the hotel as it was nice and quiet I loved the huge bed and the heated bathroom floor There is plenty of storage and an iron ironing board and tea making facilities I had no problems with the wifi which is also free The hotel is on the outskirts of Amsterdam but can easily be reached on the tram 2 which stops at a lot of the main attractions so this made it easy to get around It takes about 20 minutes to get to the stop for the hotel and then a 5 minute walk through the housing estate The hotel is very clean and has some nice modern quirky pieces in it The staff are helpful and answer any queries you may have You can download a map off their webpage which tells you what trams buses or metro you need to catch You can also buy 24 48 72 and 96 hour GVB bus tickets from them which covers their transport 
350647,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis,No Negative, Hotel is in overall very good Nice position in Amsterdam It is a short way from hotel to tram station Tram is coming very often and it is quickly in the center Perfect choice 
350648,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The windows of the hotel can be wider and bigger The location of the hotel is a bit away from city centre I would prefer more vegetarian options , I liked everything regarding the hotel the staff the room room service and ambience The restaurant provides food till 10 pm and there is separate menu for hungry souls after 10 pm too The shuttle service enables us to reach city centre with cheapest price It is very convenient for families and with children The view through windows at night is soothing 
350649,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, There was dirty underwear from a previous guest so I m not sure how clean the room actually was also the reception takes a very long time It took me 15 minutes to get my bag from reception when we went to collect them We didn t have breakfast there as the price was shocking for what you were offered The bed was so uncomfortable that both myself and my husband have terribly sore backs , I liked that we were not bothered and we could get a tram back to city centre easy enough 
350650,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The only thing I didn t like was before arriving there was no mention of paying city tax When I arrived to check in I had already paid for my hotel so was surprised when they said we weee due so much money for city tax , The hotel was beautiful clean big and bright Staff were friendly The room was nice and spacious The restaurant was a nice size The bar was nice The out door decking was beautiful with a lovely pool around it making it a nice place to sit with a drink and relax 
350651,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The heater and the window insulation was inadequate to bring the temperature warm inside the room and it was uncomfortably cold in the room especially early in the morning It is far from the tourist central and the public transport station is far for Asian standard to walk and no one else is around while you walk from the public bus or tram station to the hotel for 30 to 45 minutes after 8 pm I dont recommend this place to anyou tourist , Clean room
350652,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis,No Negative, Getting there from airport 30 min by bus 69 direct getting to the city center 20 min by tram 2 direct overall quite a convenient location Clean spacious lots of art in the lobby 
350653,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis,No Negative, The location of this hotel is perfect for those who love to walk run in nature There is a beautiful park very close to the hotel The tram and bus stations are pretty close from there you can take the tram to the supermarket 2 stations 
350654,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Breakfast was great but quite expensive, The croissants really WERE extra flakey Also the staff retained and returned to me a full bottle of whisky that we had left there on checkout by mistake
350655,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Location is ok easy to reach with public transportantion but still it needed 45 mins to get home from city center , Beds were confy and room was pretty clean I loved that they has gluten free breakfast items available 
350656,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Hotel is a bit far out the city center but easily reachable by tram Limitted choices at the hotel restaurant and literally no other options for having dinner in the area , Good room spacious and well equipped Available baby cot upon request Nice staff they accomodated early checkin for me and my 7 months old 
350657,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Was farther from the city center than I expected The restaurant was expensive and breakfast is at a high extra cost , Very comfortable beds very friendly and accommodating staff 
350658,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis,No Negative, The beds were the comfiest I ve ever slept in The staff were very friendly Not too bad a location either Short ride to Amsterdam and the airport 
350659,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, I was hard to find the nearest tram or bus stop they were at least 8 minutes walk away The maps supplied lacked any reference points so it s easy to head in the wrong direction without using GPS Compass There are no shops near the hotel , Room was comfortable and came with ironing board and kettle Free Wifi was good 
350660,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Maintenance faults in room no heating in the room so reception provided electrical heater we were not able to prove that temperature in the room is not 29C as it says on their system no discount offered and staff speaks own language in front of me when I was reporting all problems to them in UK it is very rude manner Maybe for Netherlands it is quite acceptable not to respect their own guests and there is definitely no rule guest is always right , I liked design of room and facilities shame that heated floor in bathroom did not operate on first night as well only on next day maintenance have sorted that because we have reported Comfy beds with memory mattress fresh linen Bikes are too expensive double priced at hotel better to rent in city centre Fair time spent to get to town centre on tram very quiet location very convenient to have a good night sleep 
350661,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Wooden interior was a bit dark for my taste In a country such as netherlands where sunlight is not always present a room with ligther colour would be more suitable , Very nice room with nice beds and bedroom We were a bit worried that we got two single beds instead a double as we originally wished However the beds were quite big enough for us in the end
350662,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The location is a slight walk away from the nearest tram station so it felt a bit inconvenient at times , The room was a decent size very clean and comfortable 
350663,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis,No Negative, Nice room Quiet hotel so good to get some sleep at night The hotel is a 10 12 minute walk from the nearest metro and tram stops Nearest amenities are 15 min walk Not a problem for me as enjoyed a morning walk to the metro 
350664,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Staff was rude on arrival as she stated I need the payment card or i would not be able to stay Which lead me to have to pay again with a different card and for small period I had paid twice whilst waiting for a refund Even tho it had all been paid for since November Also on check out they tried to charge me for breakfasts that I hadn t had which ended a good stay badly , Location was good good travel links to all relevant sites and points of interest 
350665,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, In my opinion the staff were very rude on arrival We booked with a credit card which I previously had called and spoken to one of the booking com members of staff about as we could use it for booking but where not able to take away with us We where assured that it would be fine however we may need to leave a small deposit or a debit credit card with them so they had something they could charge us to if we were to leave without paying At check in the woman immediately asked for the credit card I explained the situation and she was very rude and told me booking com had nothing to do with the situation I should have rang and spoken to them directly After a slight disagreement she finally allowed us to use the room without a credit card but I left the reception feeling embarrassed and not valued at all , The room was very cleanly and the facilities such as the gym and welcome area were lovely 
350666,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, I have no complaints , This is a unique stylish hotel which also functions as a contemporary art showcase It is truly fantastic It was luxurious The room and facilities were great and the restaurant excellent Staff were helpful and friendly Parking was easy The stay was very good indeed One of the best hotels ever 
350667,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The air conditioner was broken and I had to sleep a cold room even if I request them to to change my room they couldn t do anything In addition the responsible people are not interested with any guest ,No Positive
350668,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The wireless signal was not so strong and also the distance from the center of the town , Nice personal very comfortable room quiet area modern design 
350669,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, It s not brilliant it s not bad either Some things are slightly strange for a four start hotel lights not working well too small bathtub But in general it s a very decent place , If you have a reason to be close to any of the office buildings around the hotel the next morning then this is the place to be 
350670,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Nothing not to like although location not ideal for anyone with mobility problems , Clean and well presented room helpful and friendly staff Quiet location 
350671,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The 145 bus no longer goes past the hotel , we always stay here as it offers great value for money very well appointed rooms comfortable good restaurant clean is a 15 minute bus ride from airport plenty of trams and buses into town 10 15 minute walk to bus tram stops 
350672,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The room was very dusty and the floors were dirty No vending machine for snacks which was annoying as no shop near , Lovely hotel great staff I ve stayed before and would again just the room needed to be abit cleaner 
350673,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis,No Negative, Large room for very little money Well designed rooms with large double bed Clean and neat Very helpful personnel Could check in early very welcome after 24 hours of traveling 
350674,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The room service menu could have more variety and the location of the hotel is a bit away from the city , The beds were very comfy and the room service was a definite plus I got an excellent deal for a three night stay in December 
350675,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Distance to the tram could have been better signposted and lit, Modern clean hotel catering for a business clientele Quiet and well decorated Staff were lovely and bilingual 
350676,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Location was a little bit out of the way however also felt that we didn t want to be too close to the town anyway, Staff were very friendly and accommodating

350679,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Not that convenient it takes 10 15 mins to bus tram station There is rare grocery around however when you leave hotel and turn right will see a small coffee called out of office that provide cafe and some light food ,No Positive
350680,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, It was a slight walk to the bus stop but really not that long We requested an early check in but when we got there the room wasn t ready This was a bit annoying but they did say that they were unable to guarantee an early check in , Beds were incredibly comfortable Staff were friendly and the hotel was nice and modern
350681,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The hotel is not like the four star hotels I have been to according to its cleanliness and comfort and the location is not convenient at all as you have to travel for at least 30 minutes which is a waste of time for travelers to get to the city center , Nothing
350682,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, I don t think the hotel should charge to use the car park when you already paid to stay at the hotel That s the only bad thing , Had the best three nights sleep ever the beds was that comfy 
350683,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Apparently they charge the guests of the hotel for parking for a few hours for 15 Euros Something we didn t know when we asked the receptionists where can we park the car It s an illogical price especially since you can find free parking if you re willing to walk 3 min , The staff at the reception were nice Overall it s a decent place 
350684,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The food on my plate was poor not reflecting the menu description what I ordered undercooked TV was not working after tweaking by staff it was solved next morning same problem , Staff showed great talent in solving the problems I had didn t ask for the problems Location at A10 congres building was nice Bed was a big one for me since I am 2 02 meter tall
350685,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The tram and bus is about 10 12 mins walk from the hotel But if you don t mind traveling to the city center for about 20 35mins this is perfect hotel for budget travelers , Nice and clean hotel Friendly staffs 
350686,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, A bit expensive for what you got Bathroom door doesn t shut properly , Free safe and fridge in room Staff friendly The art work around the hotel 
350687,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis,No Negative, Very helpful friendly staff Good food Just ten minutes from airport Pasta dinner the night before and after marathon was a pleasant and enjoyable surprise Use of a room to shower after marathon even though checked out was another big plus for this hotel as was use of locker room to store bags 
350688,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The shower smelled like a sewer most of the time When someone in another room flushed their toilet we saw water bubbling in the drain , The bed was comfortable A good location outside of the city center 
350689,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, not so close as expected to public transport breakfast not included and the price the would have charged was really expensive 20 25 each , Quite big room friendly staff
350690,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, It depends on what you want To be in the city centre or away from the busy centre For the accommodations at Design Dutch hotel it is worth a few minutes on the tram , Everything was great It is a 10 minute walk to the tram and another 20 minutes on the tram to get to the historical centre of the city This can be great for peace and quiet at night 
350691,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Location You have to walk around 8 minutes to catch the tram for city center and around 12 minutes to cach the bus for the airport, Rooms are very nice and spacious
350692,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, We couldn t check in for an hour and a half after the check in time 3 30 The room was tatty old and had big red marks all over one wall The television was very old and the channels didn t work For a 4 hotel it was very dissapointing , The location was excellent and the information given to get around was fantastic 
350693,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Location was a little out but only 15 mins from airport and excelent transport services, Beds were super comfy I almost wanted to take them home beautiful hotel Friendly staff 
350694,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The staff were rude I was told You have water in the tap when I asked for a jug of cold water Despite having a Do not disturb sign on the door we had house keeping come in not once but twice The 24 hour room service was non existent and I was told that for a list of drinks was not available to give me over the phone but that I would have to come down to reception to see the drinks for myself awful service, The bed was very comfortable and hotel very clean
350695,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Rubbish iron in room, Transport links the central including night bus only 10min walk away walk is all within residential and pleasant surrounds lovely during spring summer 
350696,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Very out of the way from any other facility s basically set in a industrial estate no restaurants or bars close by taxis or 10min walk to closest tram which is 25min trip into city centre, Beds were very good as were the rooms overall really nice hotel an decor helpful staff 
350697,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Fleas were disgusting No room service or room service menu was inconvenient The attempt at compensating me for flea ridden rooms throughout my stay was pathetic , The hotel was very underwhelming I can t think of anything of note that I liked really 
350698,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Had my room cleaned by the cleaners even when I had a do not disturb sign on the door and even stole a bag of cannabis I had on the side of my bed Not a happy man, Nice comfy beds 
350699,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, High priced limited restaurant with poor service and very expensive breakfast offered As there were no other eating options nearby this was a problem It would be good if the bathroom had a normal door that could be closed instead of a swing door , Air conditioning excellent comfortable bed reasonable space 
350700,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Couldn t really fault anything we were there for 2 days and had to ask for extra tea and coffee as think the cleaners forgot the second night but staff at reception gave us some straight away without waiting Really couldn t fault anything such a good hotel , Hotel was amazing and staff were really helpful and friendly Location was really good as well only around a 10 minute walk to the tram station and then an extra 20 minutes on the tram into the centre 10 if you go to Rijksmuseum and walk from there which is what we did we didn t have any food at the hotel but menu looked pretty good a bit pricey for us but nice if you want a treat Would definitely recommend this hotel 
350701,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, TV was very quiet even at full volume Staff weren t particularly helpful especially with regards to booking the shuttle bus We were told it had to be booked an hour in advance despite the paperwork saying it was better to book in advance to guarantee your seat We ended up just using the train instead as it was cheaper and far more frequent Prices at the hotel bar are absolutely insane even for Amsterdam , A short distance from the city centre using the number 2 tram or the hotels shuttle bus though the bus is a pain to book Great rooms with nice bathroom and huge comfortable beds kettle fridge and TV including some channels in English Free wifi 
350702,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Prices for breakfast and dinner was just to expensive and for that reason we did not eat in hotel the way we would have liken to x, Beautiful hotel eautiful very friendly staff and a shuttle on weekends that is never late and very cheap to be dropt to town and collected thank you for my lovely stay xxx
350703,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Easy to get into town but the closest tram or train was still a 10 minute walk , Lovely hotel staff were awesome Hired a scooter from the hotel Lovely big rooms 
350704,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, I think some people may think it far from the centre of Amsterdam However the trams are really frequent and the cost is fine if you buy a 5 day pass The hotel do have a transport service this is more expensive though , The outside area is fab 
350705,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The cleaning of the rooms was minimal A little bit far out from city centre , The room was lovely and the staff was very friendly and helpful It s about a 15 20 minute tram journey to city centre but it was in a quiet area that offered all the necessary transports needed The food there was lovely and all organic and fresh but was a little bit expensive but still delicious Loved the whole experience and would definitely stay again 
350706,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, We asked staff to clean the tiles in the bathroom as they were fm dirty when we got there Although they were apologetic nobody cleaned the tiles while we were there , The shuttle into the town centre helped the distance 
350707,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Pillows were extremely uncomfortable very stiff neck in the morning room could have been cleaner aswell, Size of bed and room was spot on and the food at the restaurant was superb 
350708,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, It was too far from everything We struggled so much to get anywhere using the tram that was 10 minutes away and it takes at least 30 minutes to get to the city centre , The rooms were comfortable and had everything we needed The staff were very helpful 
350709,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, It s too far out from the city center to be worth it for any sightseeing or dining There isn t a lot out there to eat at Though I highly recommend going to RADION for food , The design and comfort of the room and bathroom were excellent They also kept the place very clean 
350710,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, It s a little farther out than I thought but obviously caters to business rather than tourism The transport links are good but about 10 mins away and there isn t much around the hotel if you want to nip out , Really comfy and clean room we spent little time in it due to having a fairly full schedule but ticked all the boxes Special thanks to the lady who checked us in she was absolutely lovely I got a really good deal as it was obviously one of their quieter periods which was really nice as the hotel seemed very chilled compared to the more bustley centre Again we were very busy so it was a nice oasis to return to Staff were very helpful in getting us to the early return flight we had also 
350711,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, distance was further fm central station then first thought but still bearable , Very professional very customer friendly very helpful for tourist and offer help with directions etc 
350712,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, bed was very soft not comfort sleeping for me, everything what I expected was met the hotel is situated far from the center but I knew about it when I booked
350713,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Mattress and pillows were both too soft It was not far out of from the city on the tram but it was a little bit of a walk then from the tram stop and this walkway is quite badly lit I wouldn t have liked to have walked by myself but in saying that it didn t feel unsafe Check out queue was slow , Fantastic breakfast Room bathroom and bed were all a great size We requested to check in early and our request was granted no problem we were delighted after travelling all night 
350714,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis,No Negative, everything you need in 1 location food sleep drink Friendly staff Yes a little out of the narrow streets and canals of old Amsterdam but thats why I chose it Tram ride is easy and cheap better to have modern at a reasonable cost and relax 
350715,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The location is too far from the city centre and quite remote albeit good tram and bus links nearby, I loved the friendliness of the reception staff Chambermaid was amazing Really clean hotel I slept good everynight the bed was so comfortable 
350716,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, This is my second stay here 4y ago and although I m very happy overall once again this time both the sink and the shower cabin had sewage problems the water wouldn t go through fast enough which can lead to hygiene side effects ,No Positive
350717,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The wifi was poor We could only connect by our door expected better It is also located very far from centrum It is a good location if you are going to the airport the next morning but not for visiting Amsterdam , The hotel is really nice the beds comfy and the staff was very friendly 
350718,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Just the location even though though it can t be changed it was just a bit too far out going on a night out the cab alone was like 25 also hard to find from the airport the bus doesn t stop anywhere near and so it s pretty far to actually know where you re going, Beds were super comfy staff were super nice 24 hour reception place was extremely clean nice little terrace outside room service was fast
350719,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, For us the hotel was a bit out of the way ideally we would have liked a more central location But it was very easy to get into Central Amsterdam on public transport so we can t really complain We didn t eat at the restaurant at the hotel as it was a bit beyond our budget so can t comment on the food We didn t realise we would have to pay city tax on arrival on top of what we already paid so bear this in mind , The room was lovely and the bed chairs were very comfortable The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming While the hotel is further out from the centre of Amsterdam it did mean it stayed and peaceful I liked the fact there was a safe in the room meaning I didn t worry about our money or passports If you don t mind travelling into the city everyday it s a great place to stay 
350720,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, When I booked my stay I was told breakfast would be included and I payed more for it to be However when I tried to get breakfast I was told it wasn t included alough I know I paid for it It was very frustrating because we were expecting breakfast and couldn t get any food until we went into the city center which was a pretty far distance from the hotel Also the nearest tram was almost a ten minute walk and that made it difficult to travel with luggage, The quality
350721,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The room wasn t properly cleaned Dust and debris around the corners and under the bed No hotel information in the elevator Rooms were dark Shower was leaking Staff were robotic It was too far out Apparently there s a fitness room but it s not listed anywhere and the staff couldn t help Wifi was poor , The beds were comfortable with a mattress topper The rooms were made daily
350722,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, We were charged 3 50 for a tiny bottle of Fanta so wasn t too pleased with that, Staff were nice and friendly on arrival and throughout the trip rooms were lovely with really comfy beds
350723,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Location though our fault we didn t research area enough and hadn t considered that we d have to use public transport so often to get into central Amsterdam Tram bus and metro were all very local and went every 10 mins though , Beautifully presented very clean and modern amazingly comfy beds Good info given by staff including free maps and vending of tickets for public transport 
350724,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The chef is rude and we paid 45 for two burgers and a bottle of water we asked for the burgers to come medium rare and they came raw and mine was cold Sent it back and she said to us that one was half eaten and that she ll send one back but we had to pay for 2 burgers still everything else is good but just do not eat here ,No Positive
350725,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The door of the private bathroom was made of glass and not properly fitting the wooden frame resulting in lack of privacy you could hear inside and it was not a lockable door , Extremely clean room with fresh towels and linen everyday Staff always available for help and questions They have an extra pc with printer in case you need to print your flight tickets 
350726,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Slight walk to the tram stop providing access to the city centre but perfectly manageable and the staff provided maps with instructions on how to get there , Beautiful rooms with perfect facilities Very comfortable stay 
350727,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Arrived to find that they hadn t been notified that we had booked to stay from the 5th not the 6th luckily a room was available Food menu didn t change and if you didn t eat fish poultry it was difficult to find anything suitable Location remote so no chance of eating nearby Wouldn t have rated the hotel 4star ,No Positive
350728,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The hotel is in the middle of nowhere there is nothing you can do without travelling to the centre of the city 30 min tram or 40 taxi It is not a cheap hotel so you would expect the beds to be comfy Also the very superficially clean your room everyday never change the sheets Would not recommend , Not much really The sat tv Also there is an iron in the room 
350729,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Didn t quite realise the hotel was 30 minute tram ride into the centre but they were regular , Staff were brilliant and very helpful with ideas and navigation help 
350730,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Faultless in my opinion Only good things to say Will be back , The hotel is clean and modern The staff are extra helpful The food and drinks and service are excellent 
350731,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis,No Negative, Good location with tram to the city a short walk away The bed was incredibly comfortable The room was immaculately clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful 
350732,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Would be nice to have a hair conditioner provided , The bed was very comfortable clean room Very good public transport connections with city centre and airport 
350733,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Expected the bar to be open late but it wasn t Nothing in the immediate area except office blocks and flats not one shop, Very clean very trendy looking hotel
350734,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Minor negative things At our arrival there were some spots on the fabric on the bed Our room door had to be really slammed in order to close properly and we made sure each time to check it when we left the room One night when we came back to the hotel we found the door improperly closed by cleaning staff leaving our luggage at the disposal of anyone passing by our room Fortunately nothing happened but this might remind the cleaning staff to check each door after they have finished their tasks , Good size room nicely decorated and furnished with super comfy beds Helpful staff Waterside terrace Quiet neighbourhood and quite safe not to mention wild life friendly with ducks and rabbits we came back late from the center almost each day of our stay Good value for money Ice making machine in the corridor For those worried about the walk to the tram 15 min if you choose the main street 10 12 min if you go through the park the hotel provides a shuttle to the city center and back against a fee and you have to book it one hour in advance The tram connection was very good and available longer than the shuttle the shuttle was available until 21 30 if i remember correctly therefore we did not tried the shuttle 
350735,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Inconsistency in drink measurements against the cost Not worth it The location wasn t the best just in that it was within a kind of business area However distance from the central Amsterdam is ok approx 30mins on bus tram , The decor is quite pleasant I like that they sell the designs in the hotel Space in room and the fact that they accommodated my requests was appreciated Breakfast was good as it was mixed and catered to all really 
350736,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Although everything seemed to be perfect the bedding had blood spots on it The room was cleaned and the mini bar stocked up but the bedding never changed throughout the stay Upon arrival back home my partner complained of a rash on his back which was incredibly itchy and raised from the skin the doctor diagnosed it as bed bugs and prescribed some tablets cream , The hotel itself visually was outstanding the artwork was amazing and the room was lovely 
350737,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Breakfast was very expensive and I got sick of riding the tram half an hour into town Could have filled up coffee when having room cleaned, Beautifully decorated rooms Clean bathrooms with a bath Coffee and tea mini fridge great mirror
350738,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The tram station is 10 mins walk and it is quite far from the tourists places in the center , nice comfy modern clean place friendly helpful staffs nice tram station that connects to the tourists places Quiet neighborhood 
350739,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Glass door into en suite bathroom that didn t reach floor or ceiling offers zero privacy in our Twin room when using toilet or shower etc The room didn t quite live up to the promise of the rest of the hotel and could do with a refresh as the wallpaper paint and headboard were a bit grim , Cool artwork to look at in the reception area where you can grab a really comfortable seat and a coffee from the bar Very quiet location and trams only 15 minutes walk away 
350740,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Distance to downtown and the fact that inly tram2 could give us a ride , The hotel is nice and clean however accesing downtown is just too hard far 
350741,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The majority of the staff were super friendly and very helpful however on a couple of occasions a certain member of staff was extremely rude to myself and my partner, The hotel was beautiful and very clean The beds were super comfy and room service was great
350742,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The walk through the park at night from the tram stop was ok at daytime but quite daunting at night for my wife and my daughter Closer stop to hotel please x, Staff extremely helpful Rooms clean and beds comfy
350743,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Nothing I didn t like really it s smack in the middle between the airport and the city but it was easy to get to both by bus or tram Plus the location of the hotel allows me to experience the quieter suburban sourrounded by nature part of Amsterdam , Twin beds are big very comfortable Room service pizza at 2am was just what I needed to satiate my craving Design of the hotel inside and out is exquisite Loved the 3D mural in the lobby Very artsy 
350744,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, It was a bit out of the centre but still no trouble to get in , Very easy access to the tram stops Very clean rooms and comfortable bed with very helpful staff 
350745,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Bathroom door could not be locked and it was semi transparent In other words you could literally see the silhouette of any person taking a shower in the bathroom Not so fun for friends or family traveling together, Comfortable and clean room
350746,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Hotel is quite far from the centre which is not terribly convenient but the tram and bus connection is very smooth and frequent , Nice large beds heated bathroom floor safe fridge and very pleasant surroundings with water ducks and bunnies Staff was really helpful and kind 
350747,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Breakfast was extra and expensive It should be included at the price Parking was extra and expensive nearly daily price of rent a car Because of that we didn t rent a car, Cleanliness comfortable room
350748,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, its distance from the central train station the center of Amsterdam 10 minutes walk to the nearest public transport station and then 30 minutes ride to the center , a designed and modern hotel the staff are very nice and helpful 
350749,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Blanket was way too thick and it was hot sleeping under it although believe me I am a freezer Location is 30 min away from the city center by tram but hotel with such quality would otherwise cost much more in city center , Hotel is worth the cost Everything was clean and up to standards Room was big enough and contained everything you need while being away from home 
350750,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, It is a bit far away from center about 15 min by tram but there is good connection by public transport , Great clean hotel with friendly stuff Not expensive and very comfortable 
350751,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Staff didn t interact with guests at the hotel they don t welcome you or greet you at any time in the day Restaurant only serves at certain times of the day although you pay extra to eat at the restaurant , Rooms were very clean and tidy hotel is modern 
350752,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis,No Negative, Location is a little far out but we knew this when booking so it didn t bother us If you re not too fussed about being central it s actually really easy to get to and from the city centre with good transport links and an added bonus of being able to rent out bikes or a scooter a really good way of seeing the real Amsterdam not just the touristy parts and giving you the freedom get around easily we got a Vespa for the day and absolutely loved it The hotel itself is lovely well equipped with friendly and accommodating staff on call at the 24hr reception there s a restaurant too we never used it but have no doubt it would be amazing sitting out having a meal on the patio when the weathers nice We spent each day of our stay out on the grounds smoking and having a drink of our own bought at the supermarket about 15 mins away such a relaxing environment to wake up to and unwind in I could speak endlessly on how much we enjoyed our stay we got so much for what we paid a trip back here before the year s out is almost certain 
350753,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis,No Negative, Excellent choice of food at breakfast nice comfortable room staff very helpful Although the hotel is a 10 minute maximum walk to the nearest tram stop route 2 the service into the city centre is frequent and fast 
350754,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, It s about a half an hour tram ride into the centre of Amsterdam and a 10 minute walk to the tram stop , Very quiet location modern clean and comfy beds Couldn t fault the rooms 
350755,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, did not have recycle bins should have should allow pets the girl that checked us in was not very nice not clear what were the prices of the tea or if were for free, wi fi maps available at reception nice lake with ducks fridge
350756,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Wi fi signal not great If there was a gym swimming pool or more facilities it would have been even better , Nice spacious rooms Very clean Comfortable seating area outside and great spacious arty reception area 
350757,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Breakfast a little too expensive shuttle service should include at least 1 more stop and should be available a little longer , Location rooms friendly staff parking available shuttle service terrace
350758,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, There was a lack of lights in the room or very soft lights so only really good for daytime stay which we didn t do , The decor was lovely and liked the area the safe and bathroom facilities were a good value for money 
350759,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Transport was a bit problematic as its location is slightly far from public transport , Breakfast was just a marvel a good variety of choices I really enjoyed the comfortability of the bed the size and silence I also enjoyed the internet it was super 
350760,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, In May the heating was simply not working We complained but the staff didn t do anything about it In general the staff was not nice or friendly In one of the days they only put towels for one person when me and my friend were both sleeping there The bathroom was clean but the bedroom floor was a bit dirty , The hotel is modern and comfortable not far from the airport you can rent bicycles 
350761,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, We had to change room when we arrived We booked a superior double room 823 and arrived at the hotel at 10pm and went to the bar after we had our room key We got back to our room about 11 30pm and realised that the Queen size bed was in fact 2 single beds pushed together We called reception to ask to change rooms and the guy was really rude he said that s how they do Queen size beds and he would see if there s anything could do but in a very patronising tone We had ordered pizza to the room just before we complained and we went down to speak to him about the room and the pizza was already at reception he did not bring it to the room or offer to help us carry it at all but still charged the 3 50 room service charge and kept the 1 50 change He was very rude at reception again saying that it s very late and asking why we didn t notice it until now when we checked in at 10pm which I thought was completely irrelevant So we were told to go and wait in our room until he sorts it out So we carried our pizza up and had to sit in a room which wouldn t be ours we had ordered it to eat in bed and watch TV and the pizza was cold as we d been at reception for so long However when he did come back to the room they gave us a free upgrade to a business room which I have to say was a lovely room 821 The guy at reception was blonde and had just started the night shift on Thursday 19th May Cleaner came everyday which was good but did not replace the glasses and did not replace the miniature body lotion , The new room was lovely and the bar downstairs was nice Good hotel but it s quite far from central Amsterdam 
350762,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Even though part of the appeal was the area the only issue at all was the trips into town but that s the only grumble, Great location outside of the main city friendly and helpful employees beds and room interior in general were great 
350763,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, It was a little far out from the center however there was a short walk to the Tram Line 2 which takes you to most of the main places so this really wasn t too much of an issue, Very modern hotel with all the comforts you could ask for Rooms were slick and stylish and comfy little extras like a water cooler and a shoe shine machine on each floor were a thoughtful bonus Bikes are available to hire from reception at 16 Euros for half a day and as the hotel is so near to the Nieuwe Meer Oeverlanden and the Amsterdam Bos I d reccomend you make the most of this We did not eat at the hotel but the restaurant look good The staff were all very helpful and friendly 
350764,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Staff seemed to be rushing all the time even when dealing with customers When in the room interior seemed bit outdated We noticed dirty spots on the walls and floor Also tiles and glass door didn t seem to meet standard of cleanliness I expected Room was chilly even when temperature was set to highest so I kept bathroom door open all the time to get more warmth Furniture a day doors were scratched And the view was poor seeing construction sight And one of the windows didn t had curtain maybe on purpose but seemed that there should be one We were not able to use free WiFi only if we sat just by the door in our room Internet connection was really bad We addressed this issue twice but nothing changed they just told that a lot of people might be using it and that s way it s so bad Some tv programs didn t work when it was raining The hotel was a bit far from center but if you don t mind 10 min walk through the park back and forward to public transport and then 30min ride in it you will be fine , Bed was comfortable and we had a good night sleep Shower was comfortable and spacious Staff helped out by providing printing facilities for out boarding passes Bathroom had floor heating what was nice 
350765,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, the hotel is far from city center 25 minutes by public transports Public transports are bit far from the hotel 10 to 15 m walk , Comfortable and spacious room
350766,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, was quite a far distance from city centre meaning the cost of transport was quite expensive taxi 25 to centre, The bed was really comfy all room amenities were provided shampoo hair dryer iron 
350767,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Mini bar was empty first day there was no soap shampoo in the bathroom Signs of flooding were on the wall , Staff was nice and really helpful we were allowed to check in 2 hours earlier before the official check in time 
350768,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The TV didn t have very good sound over all we have to put it up to 50 and we still couldn t hear it properly other than that it was a lovely room would defiantly book again , The beds in the rooms are massive it was lovely to sleep in the Bath room was very big The ice machines on each floors were wonderful too After walking from the tram it was nice to have a cold drink The room got cleaned everyday with fresh towels and we got given extra pillows when we asked for them all of the staff where very friendly and helpful 
350769,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Poor WiFi in the room 441 couldn t stream a 5 min YouTube video Not close to city centre or airport or tram station or bus stop Expensive breakfast not a large spread ,No Positive
350770,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Breakfast is to expensive and we could not put it on the room bill , Some in the personell had the gift of personal service some did not The food in the restaurant was good 
350771,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The Cleanlines The whole room was dusty and everything needed dusting Literally Everything The shower bathroom was the worst it had soak scum stains up the glass there was toothpaste all over the walls Hairs clogged the shower It was all generally dirty unfortionatly as we actually liked the hotel and the staff But spending a couple of hours cleaning before you can take a shower wasn t good , Loved the beds the layout of the room and the shower was awesome I love the detox water at reception it was one amazing touch 
350772,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, We thought the price of breakfast was too expensive for our budget and ate elsewhere or got food from the supermarket , The hotel was easily reached from the Schiphol airport by bus and an 8 minute walk A similar walk and an interesting 20 minute ride on a number 2 tram took us to central Amsterdam past many of the popular tourist destinations Seeing rabbits and birdlife on the walk was a surprise in this developing urban environment The hotel staff were efficient friendly and helpful the room was spotless and comfortable the wifi was good 
350773,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The hotel s big disadvantage is the location The location might be could for business travelers because there are a lot of companies around it but is definitely not good for tourists The distance to the closest public transport for city center or for airport is 850 1000 m the supermarkets are even further and no other posibility to grab something to eat except the hotel restaurant Another problem was wi fi It worked good only in the bathroom and in the hallway and very poor the rest of the room including the desk , The hotel is very nice comfortable clean and with everything you might need for your staying fridge tv kettle even iron and ironing table The staff provided us all information and maps we needed 
350774,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The location is in the middle of an office area with nowhere else to go However not far from excellent tram service into town WiFi signal too weak to be of much use Instructions from airport did not work recommend taxi , Good hotel rooms Very clean and comfortable Bar and restaurant were good Staff friendly Will go again 
350775,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The door of the bathroom was of glass sliding not closing i did not like that It took too much to reach RAI amsterdam walk a lot then wait for metro hardly caught lectures I intended to attend also to the center of the city walk wait for tram the tram is very very slowly it was difficult Staff are just doing their jobs no advices and sometimes do not understand you , The room was nicely prepared and furnished adequate light iron machine and a table for ironing a kettle 
350776,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Despite there being a Do Not Disturb sign on the door and after paying for a late check out until 2pm the cleaner called and let herself in on 3 occasions between 9 30am and 1 30pm This happened with 2 other rooms that friends were staying in Found this to be very invasive and unprofessional , Room was clean and the free wifi was great 
350777,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, people who work on the reception was so rude and without any smile i didnt see any hospitality Also hotel is so far from the city centre which is almost 18 bus stop far away and there is no bus stop close to hotel, Was so clean everything 
350778,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Front desk staff a little standoffish Cleaner let herself into room on three seperate occasions on the morning we were leaving even though we paid extra for a late checkout plus had a do not disturb sign on the door same thing happened in two of our friends rooms as well Hotel itself was quite expensive without not a lot of food options , Room size style and overall cleanliness of the hotel 
350779,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Floor was really dusty Key card stopped working twice because they were close to our phones So I think we should have been told on arrival that they would do that Room service was quite expensive and limited Wi Fi signal was bad in our room The milk provided was powdered so couldn t have a nice cuppa on a night , Slept really comfortably 
350780,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The bath tub which has the shower makes it difficult for people with bad knees to get into the shower Also the tub is so narrow that tall people cannot stand in it we have to stand in an unstable position which is both dangerous and painful , The double bed Queen was nice and large and sturdy enough that even heavy and tall people like us could sleep comfortably in it Reception check in and check out friendly fast corrrect Breakfast nice omelettes good selection of cheeses good staff but some more fresh fruit small tomatoes and other vegetarian or vegan options would be nice Nice room Good parking Very nice bar good selection of drinks and snacks All staff is friendly and helpful 
350781,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, was a bit far out but that did have its perks when you wanted to escape the busy city centre and it is a 1 minute walk from a tram stop with trams that come every 15 20 minutes , hotel was lovely great facilities amazing food in the restaurant extremely friendly staff
350782,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The beds were too short and too soft Especially for tall heavy people we both are 1m90 and 100kg the beds make you sink into the mattress The bath tub which has the shower makes it difficult for people with bad knees to get into the shower Also the tub is so narrow that tall people cannot stand in it we have to stand in an unstable position which is both dangerous and painful , Reception check in and check out friendly fast corrrect Breakfast nice omelettes good selection of cheeses good staff but some more fresh fruit small tomatoes and other vegetarian or vegan options would be nice Nice room Good parking Very nice bar good selection of drinks and snacks All staff is friendly and helpful 
350783,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, WiFi is not supporting business travelers as the latency is high and the line capacity is too low , Breakfast was excellent and everything fresh Great bed just the right softness but still firm 
350784,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, The Bike Rental from the Hotel is too expensive, You can reach the Town Center by bus or tram in about 25 35 Minutes I recommend to take the tram because the tram is faster and you have a nice route through amsterdam Tram Bus Station is not far away from the Hotel maybe a 5 min walk The Hotel WiFi is working good 
350785,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Tha waitress from the 25th morning we ask same information about the breakfast and she wasn t very nice , It s a amazing hotel very clean and comfortable Excellent
350786,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, A wider choice on your dinner menu , Excellent assistance and support As I was accompanied with my 10 year old grandson who has a foot injury and was using crutches 
350787,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, I had to run for my train because they have asked me to go back to my room and bring an electricity adapter I borrowed Typically 4star hotels would just send somebody up but now I m starting to sound like a whining jerk and the experience was overall very good , Nice hotel with a very good value for money for Amsterdam taking into account we got them via late deal on bookin com 20 minutes via tram to city center but the tram route itself was very nice 
350788,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, We did miss little things on certain days like spoons for making tea The location is around 3 miles from the centre of Amsterdam which is difficult when you plan a fully tourist holiday to Amsterdam however the number 2 tram was regular often crowded the later on during the week it got The walk to the tram was about 7 minutes from the hotel with opportunity to cut through the residential area which seemed safe enough , The rooms were large and comfortable and very clean on arrival The empty mini bar so we could store our own milk and drinks was good 
350789,Dutch Design Hotel Artemis, Didn t really not like anything Just a little way from town centre but the tram got us there in no time and really cheap too , Really luxury amazing beds and really pleasant staff
