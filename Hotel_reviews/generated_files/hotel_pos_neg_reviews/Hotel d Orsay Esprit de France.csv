262003,Hotel d Orsay Esprit de France, I was a bit confused with the lighting arrangement There was a lamp next to the door that switch on and off at random We couldn t find how to turn it off except of one that switched off all lamps in the room It wasn t a big deal though and have we stayed longer I guess we could just had asked the front desk , The room was modern ample for Paris standards and well furnished The location is superb for anyone visiting Paris for its central attractions Louvre Champ Elysees Notre Dame all within easy walking distances 
262004,Hotel d Orsay Esprit de France, The club room was a little on the small size but had everything we required, Excellent location helpful and friendly staff free safe and air conditioning we would certainly return

262009,Hotel d Orsay Esprit de France,No Negative, Paris is expensive hence this as a 4 hotel also seems expensive but it is I think reasonable in context We had a very pleasant and enjoyable stay The hotel is thoughtfully and tastefully arranged with good attention to detail and the staff were very friendly 
262010,Hotel d Orsay Esprit de France,No Negative, Hotel D Orsay is in a very convenient location a quiet street just a half block from the Seine It s easy walking distance to the Louvre Place de la Concorde and the heart of St Germain as well as to several Metro stations The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming Each time we came back to the hotel it was like coming home Our room was also a good size bigger than what I had expected for Paris It was nicely and comfortably furnished in a homey way you will definitely not feel like you re in a chain hotel here Overall we had an excellent stay and would definitely come back next time we re in Paris 
262011,Hotel d Orsay Esprit de France, The shuttle to CDG is 60 so we took the train for 10 each The train is so easy and right across the street , We had an very quiet room with a small garden view The staff was very gracious and accommodated our lack of ability to speak French The location is central with easy access to all of Paris I only wish I could go back again next year 
262012,Hotel d Orsay Esprit de France, Breakfast wasn t amazing and the breakfast room was very hot with stuffy air The room was tiny even though it was supposed to be deluxe which isn t the smallest available with the toilet door right next to the bed Although we asked for a twin room what we got was a room with two single beds pushed together so we had to move the furniture ourselves to put some space in between the beds which made the room even smaller , The best location possible Easy access to main attractions transport shopping areas and of course restaurants 
262013,Hotel d Orsay Esprit de France, The area is very quiet with a lack of bars shops etc We loved it but may not be suitable for people who want the hustle and bustle of the city Also a smell of drains in the area which is very common everywhere in Paris Not the Hotels fault obviously but a bit off putting , The location was fantastic Walking distance to the Eiffel Tower Louvre and Notre Dame Just off the Seine its in the street behind the Musee D Orsay EXCELLENT bus and train links just around the corner too The hotel staff were amazing and couldn t do enough for you The accommodation was classic and immaculate and we were driven a free upgrade to a triple room which gave us even more space The photos online are very accurate Breakfast was served from 7 11 and the choice available was outstanding We have never been to Paris before and we re so glad to have chosen this hotel over all the others due to its location and class 
262014,Hotel d Orsay Esprit de France, Having to leave , Comfortable and spacious room nice bed linens and luxurious towels Helpful and attentive staff super location Lacked nothing for comfort

262017,Hotel d Orsay Esprit de France, There is plenty of storage soace for folded clothes but not much for clothes on hangers Also it took until the second day to find the mini safe which is in the bathroom on the right side of the clothes closet I probably should have asked oh well , The staff at hotel D Orsay were very welcoming kind considerate and helpful I choose a hotel by the size cleanliness and quality of the bathrooms and in this hotel they were superb Large bathtub with a nice shower two sinks full length mirror clean white ties and marble floor If you re European and expect a bidet my room did not have one but I think most Americans do not expect a bidet The Windows opened put into a beautiful square solarium type garden which was quite beautiful The heating system worked perfectly so you could be warm all through the night when you sleep I especially liked all the antique furniture and real paintings on the wall Great USB chargers in the bedside night lamps so you only need to bring the cord without the plug I was near the elevator but never actually heard so the room was peaceful and quiet Although it was nice to hear the birds in the morning Breakfast had very healthy choices and I love the fact that they had s diner delivery service from I be uneven a nearby restaurant The neighborhood is safe and well lighted and 2 minutes from musee D Orsay and othe interesting sites I would definitely say there again I arrived to the hotel by public transportation which cost 10 plus the visit of a subway ticket and then it was a short 5 mi use walk to the hotel When I left I you d the airport shutle taxi for 60 to CDG just see above ground how far away the airport was With no traffic it s 30 minute With intense traffic it takes 1 hour 10 minutes

262042,Hotel d Orsay Esprit de France, My wife and I had a standard room which was a little short on storage space while my children had a Superior Suite not sure how that happened which was excellent with everything needed Breakfast was a little expensive there is no restaurant at the hotel but this is no problem as we walked 200 yards down the road to one of the many excellent bakery cafes for breakfast , My family spent the week before Christmas 2016 at the hotel and it was one of the best we have had We got an excellent deal on the rooms making it very good value for money Location outstanding A 200 yards from Musee D Orsay and Metro A short walk from Louvre Notre Dame Hotel Des Invalides Eiffel Tower Latin Qaurter and Champs Elysees Hotel beds very comfortable rooms a little warm but even in mid winter we could open the window and the street is so quiet we could sleep well Staff excellent with in our case good English
