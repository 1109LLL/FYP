81925,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, Service was appalling throughout the stay Poor bar service ignored yet overstaffed breakfast service was chaotic and housekeeping asked us to leave an hour before checkout twice , Decent location and hotel in good condition
81926,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, The reception staff never there had to wait for so long and when someone is there they re quite rude no smile no eye contact Asked for an iron many time many occasions but never received one So I had to wear my creased clothes, We ve payed for the breakfast but we only had it once as it very poor quality there s barely anything to eat Very disappointed
81927,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, When booking the room several months in advance we have asked for a room on some of the top floors the view was the main reason to choose this hotel Nevertheless we have been given a room on the 8th floor out of 23 or so with a very poor view For sure we were disappointed in this respect , The location of the hotel very close to metro bus taxis very lively with lots of restaurants and bars and the Montparnasse tower 
81928,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, Most staff at Breakfast not friendly Food either run out or often cold though had plenty of selection just not enough for the amount of customers More often than not would run out of either plates cutlery or mugs cups for hot drinks Basically they are not able to cope with the high demand , Fantastic location to metro and train stations 
81929,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, Doesn t deserve a 4 star rating The staff were very unfriendly and not welcoming at all The restaurant floor was badly stained and breakfast service was appalling too impersonal like going into a canteen The front of house and hospitality was non existent The bedrooms were very dark and gloomy the shower head kept falling down so you couldn t have a shower One of the toilets didn t flush No complimentary water in rooms The restaurant was closed for dinner Wifi connection was weak, The bedroom sizes were good clean and the beds were comfy but high The speaker system in suite was great One of the rooms had an English socket Liked the ice machine near the lifts
81930,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, The room smell like cigarretes it was a family room and the room had no smoking sign on it yet it smelled very bad Asked the staff about it but didnt do much , The bed was extra fluffy and nice for family
81931,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, While the hotel was lovely for the most part we found the restaurant lacking in service and cleanliness Things seemed very disorganized while we were there with dirty dishes left on tables and messes left at the buffet It was difficult getting the attention of anyone if we needed something so we just did it ourselves Believe it or not we could not connect our adaptor in the bathroom so I could use my hot curling brush for my hair They only had something for men s razors which seemed very odd to me I ended up sitting on the floor near the bed doing my hair in front of a tiny mirror as all the outlets that took adaptors were on walls away from mirrors , The Pullman Montparnasse was a lovely hotel with nicely appointed rooms It s a bit of a ways from everything so taking the train is a must if you are planning to tour all over the city The gracious lady who checked us in was very friendly and helpful 
81932,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, Phone not working Reported it no response in 2 hours When room was cleaned tea coffee milk were not topped up Had to constantly go downstairs as phone was not working to ask for milk and coffee Took an hour for it to arrive ,No Positive
81933,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, there was an ice machine on floor but had to ask for containers to get it in also TV did not always work also phone did not work to call desk but we just let it go even though they offered to fix it tea coffee service in room not stocked first day, great breakfast buffet included
81934,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, No babies with me so I didn t need what I found in the refrigerator a half empty bottle of milk and some yogurt nothing else I would have been happy if i needed a coffee stick for the next day I found one on the floor Waited in vain for someone to check out the room after I called several times I had to pack and make another visit to reception to nicely ask for another room at 11 PM I got another room where was not possible to watch all the tv channels At the check out they offered me a bus ticket or a coffee seriously for free for making up the incident , I have no idea
81935,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, It is difficult to find something not to like The only thing that could be improved is the lobby , The beds were cloudlike and the view over Paris exquisite 
81936,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, For a hotel of your calibre it is sad to see paper cups in rooms instead of China cups probably a cost saver but not a good look and not pleasant for clients to drink out , Comfy beds fluffy croissants good breakfast selection excellent service from your staff and Concierge especially Greg who was most patient with us We have had a most enjoyable stay thank you 
81937,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, Staff service skill complaining with Working condition or It issue in front of costumer s Eventhough it could be true the costumer s should not heart that , Location
81938,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, Room was t really clean when i arrived I had leftover tea and coffe sachets with no setup for a new guest arriving Called the reception they asked me to come down to change the room This is might be ok in France to ask a guest to come down to change his room when you checked him in a dirty room Where i come from and when you have such unfortunate issue where hotel does a mistake at least a manager calls to aplogize and send a team member to change the room I am a big fan of Pullman as a brand and this is my 3rd stay at Pullman Montparnasse and maybe 50th stay in Pullman brand in general worldwide was a letdown this time, Location and large rooms compare to similar hotels in Paris Large screen to watch football Great coffe in lobby bar Great public areas and nice seating Good vibes in general with nice movments
81939,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, The room was not well cleaned the fridge of the minibar was not working neither coffee nor tea nor a bottle of water were provided unstable WiFi, Spacious room comfortable bed good bathroom helpful staff
81940,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, The number of hotel staff needs to be increased as there are so many rooms Or they should improve the efficiency of the staff On arrival we waited for more than 30 minutes standing in lines to check in On top of that there are many group tourists as well so the lobby is always crowded and noisy And the breakfast is not cheap but its quality is less than mediocre ,No Positive
81941,Pullman Paris Montparnasse,No Negative, not a lot of choices at breakfast buffet but the food quality is good Paris standard We enjoyed our breakfast there everyday very much the area is safe close to metro a lot of nice bistros nearby so you still have a lot of choices for dining out even if you come back late 
81942,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, I think I can write a big essay here Service does not match with its name brand I dont usually use hard words but service everywhere in the hotel was pathetic Reception told us that we get 2 bottles of water per person per day but the guy at room service would only give 2 bottles 1 plain and 1 sparkling It s kind of compulsory to take sparkling so you cannot get two normal water and he made a big fuss out of it either you take this or i am going breakfast was another struggle i ordered omelette which took 20 mins and then came a wrong one Then i requested to get hot water for tea as we had to wait a long time for the omelette then came the right omelette but 20 mins to bring hot water so omelette got cold and they were not even apologetic Staff behavior was such that at times it was close to being rude Room service was ultra slow they forget things to bring with breakfast and then would take long time to bring which spoils your mood for breakfast meal the cleaning people would call 10 times for room make up even when you tell them that we will let the reception know and even after informing they entered our room for cleaning while we were there I have a long list and can go on mainly related to service It is a big hotel and you as one customer do not mean much to them I guess As I said only because of Nima we managed to have good time at the hotel , The only good thing worth mentioning or praising at Pullman Paris was the gentleman at the information desk named Nima He is an amazing individual excellent in dealing with requests and has answers to almost everything He helped us in everything during our stay we would have struggled big time if he was not there A big thank you sir for making our stay really good otherwise we would be regretting for paying so much just to stay in one okay sized room The facility is modern style so the room and bed was good the bathroom however needs some attention as the shower was broken and door lock did not work View from the room was good Location is really good you can walk around and there are so many options for shopping food etc Family friendly place 
81943,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, Service in Cafe Atlantic for an evening meal was extremely poor twice had to ask for a menu and then i was kept waiting for 20 mins before I could order a meal , Receptionist very helpful and pleasant and got a great room overlooking Montparnasse Tower 
81944,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, We had issues with noise from the rooms either side of us We had an adjoining door on either side of the room with no insonirisation we could hear everything that was being said including a crying baby which woke us during the night and children playing all afternoon so no catch up with a snooze in the afternoon and we couldn t complain to the neighbours as babies cry and children play that s normal We wrote to the management about this they answered more or less satisfactorily The hotel was very full due to a handball competition We were there to relax it wasn t relaxing but we ve stayed in this hotel many times with no issues so all in all we won t change we ll definitely refuse a room with adjoining doors though next time , Big rooms great view this is why we ve stayed here many times super breakfast 
81945,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, The electricity on the desk was not working and although I complained and they said they will fix it this did not happen The room was dark because one of the lights was not working It was not fixed In general the maintenance looks poor and we received a so called clean Bath Towel that had blood stains This was very unpleasant and we are considering after 30 years to move to another hotel when coming to Paris , I have been coming to this hotel for about 30 years so we are used to the location and the hotel itself 
81946,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, More varieties for those who do no eat meat and poultry More egg dishes More varieties Black tea was not very good , Fruites Corwason Corn flakes 
81947,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, I understand that the staffs of the breakfast restaurant were very busy however many tables and buffet table weren t clean enough , Location is perfect 
81948,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, We booked Paris view room with high price but hotel didn t prepare Paris view room for us They say it was just a request and they do not have a responsibility to keep a Paris view room for us So there s no sense to book a Paris view room with high price ,No Positive
81949,Pullman Paris Montparnasse,No Negative, It is an amazing hotel very clean with tremendously comfort with a romantic view of the eifel tower with wonderful breakfast excellent staff very good location and quiet I would go back to this hotel s price with bases of amenities is very reasonable 
81950,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, Rooms were very warm Would have been nice to be able to open a window Bar was very expensive even considering the Paris prices, Great breakfast and location
81951,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, Small toilets and poor quality of cups tea and coffee making facility They charge for even a set of cutlery and small things Overall experience is good , Best about this is location and area 
81952,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, I was asked to pay extra 30 for early check in check in is at noon and I got to hotel at 11 It is rip off not customer service , Place of the hotel is great near to metro stations Stuff is friendly room clean 
81953,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, There was smoking on our floor despite being assured it was a non smoking room Received 6 am wake up call on a Sunday despite not ordering one Cleaners started banging on the door at 8 30 Came 4 times despite my telling them we were trying to sleep Paid 26 Euro for coffee and croissant as rest of breakfast was rather sparse and somewhat disgusting Bar was functional but not comfy Hotel designed for people with kids , Location good Price great Room functional and clean 
81954,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, Long wait for the elevator due to a conference of some sort that was taking place Other than that my family and I enjoyed our stay at the Pullman Paris Montparnasse , The bed was comfortable and the view was GREAT The breakfast croissants were AWESOME The staff was very friendly helpful and knowledgeable They were able to tell me where places were that I wanted to visit and even gave me directions to the nearest ATM machine

81956,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, Short stay in Paris , The location of this property is very nice Few steps to the central metro station and surrounding is full of restaurants and bars Free shuttle to and from SIAL Food show was remarkable as SIAL is one of the largest food shows held after every year in Paris It attracks thounsands of exhibitors buyers and traders from all across the world I was pleased to avail this shuttle service every day Kudose to their team for

81960,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, We booked a room through Booking com but they were unaware of any reservation we waited even check in about 1 hour were in the ordinary confusion it was the same at check out the receptionist wanted to charge us 30 EUR more than we had and We waited 30 min poor service WiFi was at a luxury hotel too weak Facebook Messenger does not work Breakfast very poor no vegetables , receptionist named Erasmo very kind and polite

81964,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, The room was not very clean with stains on the carpet and down the fridge door The TV did not work as a result of which we shared out first evening with a technician in the room for over one hour attempting repairs One of the drawers in the room would only close if manipulated Probably the main issue was that the room we were in had a connecting door to the room next to it and as a result we could hear the conversations of the people next door and their television which they left on one night until 3 00 am the next morning One of the reasons for selecting this hotel was that we had stayed their the previous year and found it very good This time we considered it to have deteriorated and represented poor value for what is quite an expensive hotel We will not be staying their again ,No Positive

82012,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, Very disappointed in the wi fi connection While receiving sending emails was no problem backing up to icloud took forever to the point that it was useless , Can t beat the location Airport bus directly across the street ditto train station Easy access to not only metro lines but also to several bus lines so you can see the city Did not have hotel s breakfast as it s too expensive and who wants to eat that much at breakfast Lots of cafes near by including in the station where we had cafe creme and croissants 
82013,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, When checking out there was extra 20 on the bill when i queried this i was told that the booking com price was an estimate i don t believe this to be true as i have booked with you many times before i would like your feedback on this, Nice rooms good location we would try pullmans in other cities
82014,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, Absolutely nothing , Excellent location modern hotel with ample amenities and decent sized rooms The staff were great and the breakfasts were plentiful loved the breakfast room with all the windows and nature outside One of the best moderately priced hotels we ve experienced in Paris 
82015,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, i thought the breakfast was ok but over priced I ve had much better food for less money in other Paris hotels 78 for three of us Trop cher Also not a great view from our room 815, For a big city centre hotel the staff at reception were outstanding Genuine welcome helpful and very pleasant 10 out of 10 Could not have done more to make us feel welcomed and relaxed The hotel is just opposite Montparnasse station which was very handy for our early train to St Jean de Luz Montparnasse area is surprisingly nice Cemetery is well worth a visit and close to Jardin du Luxembourg St Sulpice brilliant 
82016,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, The information staff were very rude and of little help To make a cup of tea there was no tea bags in the room and when asked I was given 2 tea bags plus 2 paper cups to drink out of For a high class Hotel they really need to lift their game I definitely would not recommend this accommodation to anyone I was surprised that Avalon Cruises used this accommodation as they always have first class accommodation, The locality
82017,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, Tea coffee provided in room could have had normal cups rather than take away ones But it wasn t a prob really All smokers were standing far too close to the entry doors one had to hold their breath to avoid inhaling smoke , Good location staff very helpful Great room great beds
82018,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, soundproofing is very poor the sound of TV from next room can be heard very vividly, location is excellent airport shuttle bus stop and metro station are very near from hotel 
82019,Pullman Paris Montparnasse,No Negative, We were booked into another hotel which my husband had booked as a surprise for my 50th birthday When we got there we were shocked at the lack of cleanliness so left straight away and booked this hotel in the hope it would be nicer It was lovely and the staff were great so my 50th birthday surprise was a success Thank you
82020,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, only that our room had no view of the Eiffel Tower and no pool, We loved the Pullman friendly staff great location that s safe and great restraints near Eiffel Tower and the bed was amazingly comfortable the only down fall was that the bathroom wasn t the newest but good and would of loved a pool as it was hot and no beach near but was a very pleasant stay close to train buses hop on hop off I would defiantly come back and recommend to anyone coming to Paris
82021,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, Flow problem with the sink in the bathroom and it deserves renovation too bad for this level of hotel at this prices range Otherwise the room is correct and clean , Warm welcome friendly staff excellent location amazing breakfast 
82022,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, Can be very expensive 7 Euro for a coffee on room service Toilet wall was dirty Only given cardboard take away type cups for coffee tea in room These were not replaced after the first day and had to ask for replenishments and you only get one each so had to reuse Windows were dirty exterior Hotel bar very expensive Free cable TV only had news channels all others were not English speaking Tried to charge us on check out for items from minibar that were not used Requested a high room but only got 10th floor , Staff very helpful but not overbearing Reasonably large room Good location 
82023,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, Vegetarian Breakfast Overall breakfast was brilliant However I am guessing that is quite normal unless the hotel explicitly specifies such , Everything was good
82024,Pullman Paris Montparnasse,No Negative, Easy access to airport bus Good location for Gare Montparnasse metro bus Found wi fi a bit slow but free Didn t have breakfast as its almost 30 pp went to near by cafes for 8 pp which is fine 
82025,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, Literally the only slightly annoying thing was that they had advertised a Sunday kids Brunch but we were told when we arrived that wasn t on during August due to staff holidays so we didn t get to try that might have been nice to know in advance especially as we had booked with kids a bit so we could enjoy a lazy sunday brunch them in the hotel , Wow what a stunning place the hotel was so beautifully designed and located in a great spot We didn t know Paris at all and we found the metro right outside the front door perfect only a handful of stops and we were at the eiffel tower We had an amazing lazy Sunday morning walking round the local art fair at Monparnesse its was a perfect over night we wished we could have stayed longer We will defiantly be going back
82026,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, The old bath room used to be cleaner But with the new bath room there are too much dirt around which I had never seen before at the old batch room I think the dark tiles are causing the cleaner to clean properly all the corner of the batch If Pullman does not start cleaning properly the bath room and remove all those dirt in the corner it won t be long before the whole new bath room is completely unacceptable and will turn this hotel rate to 2 or 3 stars My recommendation will be to have white tiles as before so that the cleaner could see clearly and clean properly Or if Pullman wants to keep the current dark tiles then instructions must be given to all cleaners to clean properly the bath room especially all corner where the bath and tiles meet furthermore Pullman must have clean bath curtain in the bath to prevent water watering all over the floor and the sink desk something we do not see with the old style bath room whoever design this new bath room made mistake but it can be managed if my advices are taken into consideration or else my wife and I will never sleep there again I have using this hotel since 2000 from the time of Meridian to Pullman but this is the first time I had to complain ,No Positive
82027,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, Wifi is expensive whereas this should be included as it is in all hotels we stayed so far, Very attentive staff For example the reception lady suggested getting a baby bed which we did not think of She was very welcoming and knew what we needed before we asked Finally rooms are soundproofed which is great for getting a good rest 
82028,Pullman Paris Montparnasse, Complicated Wifi you have to enter your email each time you want to go online very annoying house keeping staff they keep coming in even with the do not disturb sign on the door they knock very loudly and systematically open the door without respecting guest s privacy Sewer smell coming out from the air conditioner , The lobby helpful front office staff quality of the room service very cool waiters
