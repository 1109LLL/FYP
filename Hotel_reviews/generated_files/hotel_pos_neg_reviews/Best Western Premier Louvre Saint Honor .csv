50673,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , WEll I asked for a shuttle service from the airport to the hotel I confirmed twice with the hotel desk personnel weeks prior to my arrival I even had email proofs On the day I arrived at the airport I was appalled to find out there will be no shuttle service because they weren t sure which terminal to pick me up I came to Paris with my twins I was hoping there d be a cab waiting for us instead we all had to take the train to the hotel Then I asked if they have an iron facility They said they don t so I asked if I could get an iron so I could press my clothes They promised to get me one day after day until nothing happened and I had to knock on everyone else s door to ask for one There was also a time where none of our electric devices worked turned out our power circuit got turned off not sure how that happened It was a nightmare , It s a great location near the Musee Louvre and the Metro 
50674,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Breakfast was not to my liking Bacon needed to be crisper strange taste with sausage Possible that preparation in Europe is not the same as US Not something I didnt like but I thought the elevator was smallest I had ever been in , Location and people at front desk
50675,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , The room elevator hallways and stairs were extremely small narrow Regarding the elevator only one person with luggage 1 can fit Hopefully you re not claustrophobic , Bed was comfortable
50676,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Rooms very small and stuffy Breakfast facilities terrible Having stayed in other 4 star hotels do not feel it deserves a 4 star rating but it is OK just OK , Paul at desk very friendly Beds comfy bathrooms good location good 
50677,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , No view from our room , The room was spacious enough for our 3 large suitcases Breakfast was good Staff very friendly however we did book a taxi the day before leaving and there was some kind of mix up which made us late to checkin That was disappointing Otherwise all good
50678,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , The rooms were tiny but I think that is normal for this area of Paris Our shower was broken for the entire 7 days they offered to move us but they couldn t move our kids too so we would have been separated The elevator was broken for 2 days and we were on the 6 the floor luckily we already had our large suitcases up to our rooms They never replenished the shampoo coffee etc Said there were irons and robes in the room but there is not One iron for the entire motel that was always being used Most of the staff were not that helpful or knowledgeable about places to eat in the area Told us to go to McDonalds when we asked for ice cream , You could walk a lot of places very central location Lots of cafes nearby Paul the front desk man at night was friendly Fine please if you are staying for a very short time 1 2 days 
50679,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Noise of metro trains we were in the back part of the hotel on the third floor out of eight and could hear the trains passing beneath us It did not stop us sleeping as we were so tired but it could have been a problem We did not spend much time in the room Also piles of rubbish were outside before the bin men came and the 19 breakfast was not worth it but plenty of other places nearby , Location Could not be much better for the things we wanted to do 
50680,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , We booked adjacent deluxe rooms We were put into adjacent standard rooms It was only because I noticed the mistake that it was acknowledged However due to the hotel occupancy level and being late in the afternoon it wasn t possible to provide the rooms we had paid for and with only 2 days in Paris we lost over an hour of our first day trying to remedy the situation Compensation was offered but at the time of writing this the refund that was promised has not happened , Excellent location comfy beds quiet Jenna the general manager was very helpful in trying to fix the issues that arose however the problems we had shouldn t have happened in the first place
50681,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , There were little broken things around the room that looked like it needed some repair though it was clean and comfortable , The bed was great and the air conditioning was wonderful because the weather turned very hot during our stay 
50682,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Not rearly a dont like just a mention the shower screen was missing in room but didn t stop us having a shower, Central location near big bus stop which we used for sight seeing and lovely eateries right near hotel easy check in and lovely fresh breakfast 
50683,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , The view was not good We ask if we could be moved but was told that they could not help us , Staff was friendly location was very good and the room was good 
50684,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , The hotel could of done with better signage there s just a plaque on the side wall which is easy to walk pass, The room was very clean and comfortable and vey quiet could not hear any noise of a nighttime considering it s location
50685,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , We were two couples checking in at the same time One room was ready and as it turns out was significantly bigger 3 times including the huge bathroom than the room given to couple number two whose room was tiny a little bit bigger than the bed and came with drilling at about 7 00 am the next morning directly above So my feedback would be to give two couples checking in at the same time the same size accommodations , The hotel is in a great location with restaurants shopping and lots to see all nearby The breakfast is a little pricey but the coffee was good and selection is varied and abundant We arrived a little early and they were very accommodating with luggage an early checkin for one room and helpful with suggestions on where to park 
50686,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Quite a small room for the price expected more space Walk don t drive taxi around the city if you can walking likely to be quicker if you re doing a short trip Traffic is pretty heavy on main roads Driving in Paris is a bit hair raising compared with the UK Leave plenty of time to get to your airport or train station in case you get stuck in rush hour or a traffic jam Don t assume the zebra crossings are like UK either Pedestrians do not automatically have priority unless there s a green man Be careful , Clean and comfy hotel room Great location 5 mins walk to the Louvre Loads of restaurants and shops nearby City is gorgeous highly recommend the traditional French onion soup Love the little cobbled back streets where there s more lovely restaurants and shops Highly recommend to visit here lots to see 
50687,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , The toilet seat was broken and we found hairs on some of the decorative pillows I expected better for the price we paid , The bed was very comfy the room was modern and the tv was great The air conditioning was an extra perk 
50688,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , There is no gym no pool and no view from the room We could hear the subway trains from our 1st floor room Maid service was sometimes not complete until as late as 2p They were frugal with replacing toiletries such as the lotion ,No Positive
50689,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Very small hotel Superior room was very disappointing as room was extremely small in size One very small wardrobe for storage Coffee machine was not working Bar had very limited drinks Didn t even stock wine No atmosphere Only plus was location , Great location Clean 
50690,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Very small lift and reception so one must be patient Problem with air con this time , Location room size bed and shower all excellent Samuel on reception is superb 
50691,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor ,No Negative, The location was fantastic and one half to one block from numerous bus stops that took you anywhere you wanted to go and the city The six day museum pass was very economical and allowed special entrance bypassing Long lines Spend all day at the Museum Doursay and have lunch at the most elegant restaurant in Paris Almost all restaurants are outstanding
50692,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , nothing, Location is prime Staffs are very helpful I like the ambience and quietness It is spacious and the inside is exactly like what you see in their display pictures 
50693,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor ,No Negative, upgraded to a larger room the first room was quite small but OK for Paris The second was quite roomy and well appointed We had to extend our stay due to an injury and we were accommodated very graciously The location was fabulous 
50694,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Room was too cold reported to the reception that only 1 of the 2 heater vents was working within 10mins of arriving nothing done during our 3 nights stay to fix this Cleaner also leaving patio doors open unlocked on both days after they cleaned the room unacceptable and reception staff did nothing in response other than saying it was a mistake , Good location and couldn t hear any noise from the nearby streets 
50695,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , I was very disappointed with various things which I would have expected from a four star hotel The light in front of the mirror in the bathroom was out and had not been attended to There was no place to hang the shower head Only one of the beds had been made with a valise and decoration it looked very odd that the other twin bed had not Felt like we had to keep the curtains shut at all times because the window door went straight onto an internal staircase wouldn t expect this from a superior room We had to specifically ask for coffee in order to use the machine in the morning Finally the staff seemed a little glum and weren t the most welcoming , The location of the hotel was great very close to the Louvre and the bathroom was a good size
50696,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , If you are a light sleeper you can hear the hum of the metro The wifi stopped working helpful and quick fix from reception , Very helpful staff and good size room 
50697,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Wifi turned off at midnight the morning of check in bed was not as comfortable as I would like and the toilet was not for larger people as I had to throw a leg into the bath tub just to fit But other then that the staff are very helpful and polite And overall a great place to stay , Great location and cosey little room 
50698,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , I never write reviews but I was so mad that I sincerely hope I can save some poor souls from going thru this scam I also waited an entire week to boil off some steam First of all How did this so called hotel get a four star rating If i knew it was so easy to go thru star ratings I would have opened a hotel myself Rooms are completely outdated Dirty carpet flooring stains Broken curtain Broken bathroom heating Locker room showers Unhelpful staff Wi fi connection block In general the rooms are so outdated it feels and is in some points extremely dirty I walked around the carpet flooring on my heels I felt like an ostrich I basically slept dressed with my hoodie on Next morning I didn t shower My high school gym locker rooms looked like the Emirates Palace compare to this pension I asked immediately a room swap with no results This was my first night Next morning I checked out was supposed to stay six nights I obviously did not get any refund not even partial Again how in this world did this youth hostel get a 4 star rating I will file a complaint to Best Western and to the French Tourism office Also since I m not a buffoon and I travel a lot I took some pictures See attached and stay away from this place , The location is central and comfortable 
50699,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Booking com info says parking but NO this is the second time we have booked a hotel because the website said on site parking There was parking at a public garage near the hotel , The location was great for museum visits to the Louvre and the D Orsay Very touristy type area Easy walk to Notre Dame and other sights 
50700,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , The price for the breakfast differ from night to day staffs Evening staff said the price given was for 3 people and morning staff said price was per head , The room bed were very spacious The bathroom very clean 
50701,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , nothing, I booked the classical room for one week in January but when we came the staff kindly upgarded the room for free as the period of staying was really long It was a first good impression So the room was big enough for two people clean and with a good view to Saint Honore There is everything in it you need for a comfortable stay Towels are changed every day bath things are always at hand We opened the window but it wasnt noisy at all not quite still as it is the city center Everybody i think refers to the location of the hotel and it s right it s excellent you cant have better All sights are so close to you that we did not use any transport The breakfast was european all you need to have in the morning eggs sausages many kinds of cereals juices a lot of fruits yougurts and of course bakery fresh and warm The service was perfect you got coffee or tea immediately I should say the hotel costs its price adn i will surely choose it next time in Paris It goes with all needs of the tourist or businessman 
50702,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , The breakfast could have had more options or separation My partner doesn t eat pork and the eggs and bacon were on the same serving tray with evidence of people cross using the utensils, The room and staff were very friendly
50703,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Paris hotel prices are high so it s not really a complaint but the price is high The low euro exchange rate helped make it cheaper The metro runs under the hotel We were on the 4th floor and could feel the vibrations of the trains passing underground A minor annoyance which we soon got used too , Location staff cleanliness nice sized room and very good breakfast buffet Wifi truly free everywhere and of good speed 
50704,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , The bath didn t have a curtain or screen appeared to be broken The room was incredibly small but this is pretty normal for Paris and the stairs down to the room from the door were very odd It felt like a very standard experience and I would have expected it to be a little nicer than it was for the price Sadly from experience hotels in Paris seem to lack the actual 4 feel often , The location was fantastic and the bed was comfortable The staff were friendly
50705,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Slight rumble of metro can be heard but didn t disturb us, Excellent location very central Brilliant service staff very helpful Room upgraded and very comfortable
50706,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Not accurate information I needed a taxi to go to the airport and the concierge told me that not all the taxis in Paris has the facility to pay with credit card so he would find me a known taxi that does After 20 minutes of waiting for his taxi he told me that I needed cash I went out of the hotel and took a taxi in one minute and realize that all the taxis should have credit card ,No Positive
50707,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Stayed at the room 001 There was heavy smell of cat urine in the room Also the safe s battery was empty and staff was not able to find replacement batteries during our stay also explaining that technician cannot come in the weekend Staff also seemed to lack training and while they were not bad persons they were generally poor in communication , Stable wifi good location 
50708,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Staff at the desk seemed helpful but at the same time quite rude One of the receptionist was annoyed by us clarifying issues and repeating the question as well as complaining why we asked to call the red bus information desk if we were not fully decided on the tour We strongly recommend Best Western to train their staff on patience and courtesy with the customers As for the rooms would have been helpful to have robes slippers and tooth brushes in the rooms , Location rooms facilities all very good We were 2 families travelling with 2 infants and were upgraded to deluxe rooms 
50709,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , tiny lift, Friendly and helpful staff especially jean baptiste not sure if spelled correctly We love its location as it is only a stone s throw away from the Louvre In fact we were able to go to the hotel to freshen up and rest a bit and then resume our tour of the Louvre before it closes for the day Good coffee and breakfast spread 
50710,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Some amenities were not working properly AC had a wire disconnected that I was able to fix by re wiring it The magnifying mirror with LED light was not working properly The shower has a slightly malfunction , Location and staff 5 
50711,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , You hear metro coming through at night , Great location Initially we checked into one room we did not like and were switched out quickly The staff was very attentive to the situation 
50712,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Rooms overlooking the courtyard are dark and lacking views but can t be helped The hotel is well designed to maximise the limited space , Perfectly located for a short stay visiting all the tourist sites and with easy access to the RER B train line direct from Charles de Gaulle airport The staff were very friendly and helpful and the super comfy beds were very welcome after a long day sightseeing 
50713,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , I could not sleep on the mattress It was worn out and should have been replaced 10 years ago The room was tiny and the bed would not allow a 6 man to sleep on it without his feet hanging over The bathroom was tiny Never ever stay at this hotel ,No Positive
50714,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , The classic rooms are small but not cramped don t expect a lot of space but they are immaculately clean so no complaints , The location is amazing and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful 
50715,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Elevator at the new annex makes train sound Seriously gotta do something to solve the sound proof issue Staff overall unattentive and in constant shortage of hands , Location location location And pretty roomy given the location 
50716,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Room size is very small lobby also very small street location not convenient for a taxi to stop for a moment to unload luggage , Cleanliness of hotel nice approach of staff good WiFi 
50717,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , NOTHING , We arrived early in the day and as we had anticipated our room was not ready Mickael Ritschard Director check us in and upon our return in the afternoon all was in order Mickael and his whole staff could not have been more helpful to include an expresso maker sent to our room The price location and comfort of the hotel is among one of the best in Paris HIGHLY RECOMMEND We did not have breakfast there but the room was clean and neat and the food looked good 
50718,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , I thought for the money spent it would be a higher quality hotel I realize it is in a older historical building I did not realize that when I was make my reservation Room was quite small Bed was comfortable Bathroom needed work shower nozzle holder fell of wall and needed repair , The front desk staff were very customer service oriented I also liked the fact that the hotel had taxi service at less cost than what you found on the street The hotel location sells the hotel A block away from the Louve and close to many restaurants and historical sites 
50719,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , WiFi was expired at to 24 00 I cannot connect in the morning before check out , Excellent location Clean room Nice staff Good Taxi service to the airport 
50720,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor ,No Negative, Pleasant workers and perfect location They do their best to speak English if you don t know French Couldn t ask for a better location Worth the extra cost 
50721,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Coffee machines are trendy but I do prefer a kettle There were only 3 small milk pots and 2 coffee pods I asked for some more milk but none came Stole some from breakfast next day and kept it in minibar The reception staff were inattentive and much preferred to socialise with their friends than help guests The breakfast staff were fantastic though The WORST thing was we had to pay another 10 tax on top of our bill which he said was the hotel tax not the tax that we had already paid to Booking com I shall be taking this up when we get back to England as I want an explanation why we had to pay tax twice an extra 70 Will not be using Best Western again if this is their policy , The location was superb A very short walk to the Louvre and a pleasant stroll along the Seine to Musee D Orcy Lovely restaurants nearby Very comfy bed and spacious bathroom with great shower and bath Lovely breakfast selection and great coffee

50724,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , I asked a room upgrade before arriving and I was asked to pay in the checkout Some days later I realised the hotel also charged the upgradeamount in my credit card They never answer to my mails neither credited it , Localiza o 
50725,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Room is very small and a bit overpriced but this seems to be the reality in central Paris, Location is great very close to Louvre and metro station Staff was very friendly 
50726,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , The only downfall is that their breakfast is expensive for a day 19 Euros a day per person It s best to just enjoy the patisseries around the are on Rue Saint Honore it doesn t cost as much plus there are tons of cafes in the area too , The staff is so friendly and very accommodating I have no complaints 
50727,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , The place was too small It seems like everything was cramped up in this tiny place , The only good thing about this place was location Staff were ready to check me in quickly 
50728,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , The airconditioner leaked through the ceiling on the 2nd night No one could fix the problem Not even an attempt at helping out So the drips kept me up the whole night ,No Positive
50729,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , The lift was very cramped and would only hold three people at most without luggage , Loved our room on the 6th floor which overlooked the street Loved how quiet it was Loved the comfortable bed and the decor of the room
50730,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Air conditioning did not work 88 90 degrees in the city DO NOT get balcony rooms on low floors if you plan to sleep before midnight very loud interior room is fine Overall I don t think this hotel is a good value for the price No amenities and rooms much smaller than other comparably priced hotels Somehow the auto rating is giving the hotel a 4 2 which it is not , The location is right near the Louvre
50731,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , N A, Everything was exceptional From the moment of booking until our departure Hassen was so accommodating and helpful Thank you for a wonderful stay 
50732,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Very loud room windows right at the street side No parking even for 2 min to leave pack luggage The rest was very good , In general very good location clean And a good quality vs price rate I would recomend 
50733,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , The underground subway metro noise could be heard and became quite annoying , This property is in a great location and the room is wonderful It is close to lots of caf s bars and restaurants
50734,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Not much, The location of this hotel is ideal for tourists right in the heart of the Louvre Tuileries neighbourhood Lovely room lovely breakfast and really friendly helpful staff
50735,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , They were remodeling people walking by and working installing new carpet problems with A C solved by opening 1 window etc , Small hotel currently remodeling May 2016 with an excellent location in the middle of Paris and a great customer service Don t expect big in terms of facilities but a nice place to stay during your visit to Paris The cheapest I found in that location 
50736,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Noisy neighbours and not being told at booking or in advance their was work being under taken, We were not informed that there would be work be carried out In the room above us they we screaming shouting and fighting throughout the night reception staff didn t do enough to stop the noise we had to go up ourselves to get them to stop Key cards didn t work properly in the end they resorted to giving us a an actual key it was that bad
50737,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor ,No Negative, Very good location just a short walk to Les Halles for access to the Metro and RER Some building work going on and we were upgraded to a really nice room making the stay very pleasant

50740,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , The ONLY complaint is the small elevator Otherwise everything was great , The staff was very helpful in accommodating us We wanted 2 rooms next to each other and they made it happen instantly A great location walking distance to all your touristy needs and if not a metro station is minutes away Great stores and food around the corner 
50741,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor ,No Negative, We loved the staff very friendly We also liked the great price Even our local friends thought it was a good price for the location The 7 euro breakfast is perfect Isabelle and Rose in the Breakfast room are sweet as can be 
50742,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , We arrived at 10 00 Staff was totally incompetent was not be able to check the booking was starting on that day at 14 00 Instead sending us to the another best western to walk in the rain with all of our luggages the reason was they have rooms available I could have made rezervation by my own if I wanted to stay at the second one Which was on renovation Later on that day I still could see they are 3 more rooms available ,No Positive
50743,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , a few more bottles of water in the mini bar would be great really small elevator flat pillows, Very friendly and helpful staff comfortably room and bathroom excellent location 
50744,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , We got a good discounted price but the normal price would simply have been over priced So it was great for a January visit but would be unreasonable at its normal rate Not sure it merits a four star status at least not what one considers four star elsewhere but this is Paris , Fantastic location near key sights good public transportation links many shopping options and generally friendly reception staff 
50745,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , I had one of the worst traveling experiences this was suppose to be a 4 star hotel where i paid a sum of money only to be disrespected by a taxi driver contacted by the hotel When i reported the incident i was left with apathy no appologies or even getting back to me with a reaponse The hotel itself is definetely not a 4 stars one it is barely 2 stars I was at first accomodated in a lousy room 101 where cleanliness was a huge issue when i complained i was offered after the 2nd night to be moved into a better one which was probably the only good gesture the staff offered However still the hotel did not meet the 4 stars expectations at all, Location
50746,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Not much to fault at all except they did make up the rooms quite late 2pm one afternoon and we had just gotten back from a massive walk to have a nap so we refused the service Mini bar breakfast room service and the hotel bar are quite expensive but no need to use these when everything is outside your door , We really like the location of the hotel 5min walk to the Louvre and across the road from lovely bars and restaurants The staff were very friendly and aproachable and the hotel lovely and clean We had breakfast 1 day when we were given a discount of 14euro and it was very good We wouldnt have chosen it for the normal 19euro though Rooms were of a good size and nicely updated we also had a mini bar very handy They also offer room service but a bit expensive so we didnt try it We will return to this hotel 
50747,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor ,No Negative, The location was excellent as it was very close to the Louvre but also in walking distance of way too many other great landmarks to list I know because I was listing them and decided it was just easier to say that instead The staff was fantastic and spent about 15 minutes with us when we first got there showing us on the map all the great places to go 
50748,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor ,No Negative, The staff were very pleasant and especially helpful as I had managed to make a double booking due to a computer error on my part The twin room was lovely with decent toiletries The location was perfect for walking to the Louvre and the Champs Elysee Merci beacoup 
50749,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor ,No Negative, Small hotel with great location close to museums Excellent friendly and helpful staff Our deluxe suite on the sixth floor was fine for a mature couple staying six days No trouble sleeping although just to make sure we did use the sleep noise app on our Ipad If returning to Paris will definitely check this hotel first for availability and price 
50750,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , The only thing that I want to commend was the food of breakfast buffet it should be refilled once it was consumed , A big room with coffee machine was offerred that was amazing The breakfast was good 
50751,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor ,No Negative, Wonderful hotel in a superb location with convenient access to transportation culture e g museums and shops The staff was super friendly and prompt to help Great breakfast too 
50752,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Booking Com misrepresented what I was booking and have ignored my emails since this was a ruined birthday trip and despite being a loyal customer for years I do not intend to book through them again,No Positive
50753,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , The rooms are tiny Breakfast is limited , Great location and easy access to tube station A few minutes walk and you will have a wide selection of restaurants to choose Lebanese Indian and Italian just to name a few 
50754,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , The bathroom had a terrible smell probably due to mould in the pipes even though we raised it with the staff and they tried to fix it I think the problem was bigger than they expected Plus the mattress was uneven on one side badly worn , The location was ideal very central and the service reasonable 
50755,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Pass on breakfast 18 euros poor quality raw bacon not cooked scrambled eggs soggy fruit salad hot and humid room and some inhospitable kitchen staff two days running different people As well housekeeping staff knocked wanted us out of room in ten minutes to clean at nine am two days in row and was not hospitable at all about being told we needed half an hour , Front desk staff excellent Very helpful friendly even to the point of bringing in cash to help me change 200 euro note Very comfortable bed and very quiet with windows closed considering on busy street 
50756,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , The room elevator hallway size can be a bit of a shock to some foreign tourists , The staff were very accommodating and aided in everything from directions to restaurant suggestions to calling cabs 
50757,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor ,No Negative, I am writing to express my appreciation for outstanding service and professionalism by the staff at the Best Western Premier LOUVRE Saint Honore My wife and I spent five days at the hotel from October 14 18 2015 and were so pleased we returned for three days from October 25 27 2015 Based on my experience at the Louvre Saint Honore I would eagerly recommend this hotel to everyone on the basis of comfort cleanliness and excellent customer service We knew that this hotel was not a huge luxury hotel but everything from the breakfast service to the warmth and care from the staff who work at the front reservation desk was first class Everyone went the extra mile to provide a warm and welcoming environment after long and weary travel I appreciate the efforts of the daytime and evening staff and in particular Alice who stands out as an exemplary member of the Best Western international team 
50758,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , For a four star hotel the room that upgraded to was really small The room was stuffy and no air conditioning Elevator was rated four person with no space for luggage really only 3 if you squeeze No complementary water provided , It was in a good location near Louvre and we got free wifi 
50759,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , A bit noisy room we were staying on the 1st floor with windows facing quity busy road also cleanliness was questionnable The price was quite high for what we got , Especially the location very close to all monuments center etc 
50760,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Early morning construction tv remote didn t work cold shower front desk attendant could have been friendlier , Clean room good location balcony comfy bed spacious room for Paris 
50761,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor ,No Negative, While staying there my friend became very ill and needed a wheel chair and then hospitalized The staff especially Hasson and Thomas were so helpful But ALL of the staff were so compassionate and caring 
50762,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , The breakfast is very limit type of food , It s a small hotel at center area the reception cheers and helpful There have few restaurants next of the hotel and the distance to metro is very close 
50763,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Minor things such as No kettle to make coffee with ingredients supplied reported and never fixed Coffee mugs chipped No soap in bathroom Shower screen missing handle and there is no clock in the room These little things stop us from giving a perfect review , Location Location Location 35 room hotel gives a cosy and uncrowded feel in a big city Italian restaurant on the left and classic French brassiere on the right Everything is only a short walk away You will not find a better value hotel in the city 
50764,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , The madress was broken and should been changed out long time ago Information was given to front desk and hopefully case closed after we checked out , Location is as good as it gets 
50765,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , the only bad experience was that at the reception when I arrived the clerk said that she did not find that I had already paid when I insisted she found the receipt I have to say the hotel would do much better without her , I liked almost everything especially the upgrading the stay was excellent 
50766,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , Tiny rooms This is listed as a best western Premier location but not the premier experience I was expecting Room was tiny and I felt like it was not a good value for the cost based on other hotels in the area I ve stayed at before that had larger rooms faster wi fi more amenities and cheaper breakfast , Awesome beds knowledgable and helpful staff 
50767,Best Western Premier Louvre Saint Honor , The ac did not work at all making room quite stuffy, The manager at the front desk Mr Husein was amazing and the location quite perfect Parking was expensive at 30 Euros for the night
