298278,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The breakfast buffet was seriously underwhelming and served in a dark windowless basement didn t help Staying for 10 days without absolutely any changes seems unacceptable especially during summer with an abundance of fresh produce available Suggest the hotel and chef kitchen personnel to review menu offerings and replace with more appealing fresh and healthy choices such as small bircher m sli with berries gluten free breads cakes and pastries omlettes by order with herbs avocado sheep and goat cheeses With a little effort the breakfast could be much better , Hotel is in walking distance to DLR and bus lines a bit of a longer walk to Greenwich Park Room was small but contemporary and cozy Staff ok

298298,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The Breakfast Bacon was hard and very salted Sausages were all burnt and the Pan chocolate was so hard you couldn t bite in to it Because it all had been cooked way way too soon then left under heat lamp for too long before being taken though to the dinning area, Its was around the corner from the DLR train station which is a bonus if you want to travel to Cutty Sack Canary Wharf shopping centre then on to Oxford St

298337,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Over priced Food very bland Some staff very rude toiletries was the smallest I ve ever seen , Not a lot realy it was better two years ago when we was there and it seems like they have stuck themselves there
298338,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Breakfast was not included and iit was very expensive to buy once at the hotel The shower door wasn t wide enough and water came out all over the bathroom floor We did ask for a room with a good view as we were celebrating our anniversary but the room given to us had a small window so high up that we had to stand on a chair to look out and the view was of the car park , The staff were very helpful and the hotel was spotless The bar area was very nice 
298339,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The room we stayed in was quite small for a superior room and looked lovely but was not practical I bumped my head twice on the very awkwardly placed bedside tables The bathroom was small The bed was not too comfortable There was no draught beer at the bar which is not acceptable in a four star hotel This all said we did enjoy our stay and most likely would stay again for a short break I feel we got 4 star decor but 3 star fascilities, the location was perfect for visiting all attractions in the area The hotel was very well presented and the staff were very professional and attentive The view from the room window was amazing Breakfast was good 
298340,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Need to sort the television reception out Picture keeps intermittently freezing for seconds at a time making it impossible to enjoy watching anything , Location Staff 
298341,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Twin room size too small for two big blokes, Close to DLR staff friendly and helpful Twin room very small moved to family room at no extra charge Breakfast good quality just needs some gronila
298342,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, WiFi would not work phoned reception 4 times to report as needed to work from hotel in the morn and send Urgent emails Reception advised they would send somebody up phoned 3 more times as almost 2 hours had passed Receptionist ended up coming but could not help Complained on check out only to be told that a male who the hotel had asked to attend our room had said he had been and sorted No one other than the receptionist had been to the room and we had been unable to access WiFi which caused lots of difficulties given the work we needed to do and urgency of some communicstoons , The bar area is lovely and the evening meal was also lovely 
298343,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich,No Negative, Loved the fact the reception staff were so helpful and knowledgeable and area which bus to take etc They were a real pleasure and a credit to the hotel
298344,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Pillows could be a little softer for me I will visit with the family , It was pristine beautiful decor comfortable bed fabulous lounge and restaurant with moving fish mural and portholes to boot Room was lovely with historical facts of Greenwich etched on the glass bathroom wall 
298345,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Just one thing No lock on inside of bedroom door , Clean Everything I needed including iron ironing board Relaxed Good location Nice breakfast peaceful in the breakfast room and they have an automatic pancake maker Pleasant helpful staff This is an good part of London to stay as a visitor Greenwich is nice in the evening when the tourists leave Plenty of interesting things going on Good transport links by bus or train Greenwich Dulwich Bridge zone 2 Good shopping in Canary Wharf and much quieter than west end shopping 
298346,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Neither of us like air conditioning but these days there is little choice To have been able to lower the aircon a degree or two further than the system allowed would have helped However it didn t ruin our stay , A warm and helpful welcome on arrival with delightful staff where nothing was too much trouble It is spotlessly clean and for London amazingly quiet The fact that we could park our car in London was a big plus too 
298347,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, There was honestly nothing that I didn t like about this hotel , The hotel is beautiful overall and the rooms are very spacious The staff are friendly very considerate I will be most sure to book this hotel again 
298348,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Person who telephoned pre arrival and gave incorrect info about breakfast prices and was told it was only continental breakfast available Didn t like glass door on bathroom that was opaque and gave no privacy Would have liked to know that Deptford station was closer than Greenwich , Reception staff on arrival were very helpful and friendly The room was very pleasant and clean Good range available at breakfastbreakfast 
298349,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, This is no real criticism as such the only thing that my wife would have liked better was the lighting in the bathroom and maybe a magnifying mirror especially for applying her make up, The staff were very friendly and professional the rooms were lovely clean and comfortable The breakfast was excellent and good value the staff were constantly on hand topping up dishes so the food was always freshly cooked tables were cleared very quickly and unobtrusively 
298350,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Only problem was on the morning of check out the loo started not to flush properly , Arrived at reception and I forgot the card I made the booking on The lady was really helpful and sorted out all the details Really friendly and a great response to a problem totally my fault but the staff sorted out the problem straight away The room was lovely and very comfortable with lovely decor lovely view over Greenwich Breakfast was very good and great selection again very friendly and helpful staff I have stated here a couple of times now and most definitely stay again
298351,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The room was small but large by London standards The only negative was a cracked handbasin like that when we arrived We decided to live with it so as to avoid a more remote from reception room change , It was convenient for the Docklands Light Railway at Deptford Bridge station within a ten minute walk and thus able to link with other mass public transport The staff were very helpful with maps and advice It is a kept clean hotel 
298352,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, We were disappointed with the food in the restaurant and thought it was overpriced We preferred local restaurants which were cheaper and the choice of food was better , We liked the hotel very much We have stayed in other London hotels and this had a better friendlier atmosphere The room was very clean and comfortable 
298353,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, My daughters room was cold and a bit on the small side so she had to change rooms Bad draught through the window , Beautiful lounge and bar Quiet location but only a tube stop away from Greenwich and all its attractions and nice restaurants
298354,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich,No Negative, The bed very comfortable Even though the room was not very big it was very comfortable and well designed And also I appreciated an electrical point for the hairdryer close to a mirror which is very seldom the case in many hotels And of course a small desk to put down the lap top when working 
298355,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Wish I d realised I could control the air con from my TV instead I turned the power off at the entrance to the room meaning I couldn t charge my mobile phone overnight, A true first class royal welcome from staff in an impressive reception area The public areas of the hotel are of superb standard and the quality of the staff remained high throughout 
298356,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Gym had only four machines and one was not working Despite name hotel is not in Greenwich but Deptford and further from Canary Wharf than I anticipated , Staff were friendly and professional Comfortable bed and high tech lighting etc in room Great shower 
298357,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich,No Negative, One of the rare occasions that we managed to sleep in a London hotel without being disturbed by traffic noise or loud guests in the hotel corridors Also staff were professional but there was a nice chilled out vibe Facilities all excellent and cleaned to a high standard 
298358,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, We had a ground floor room were unable to open the windows for ventilation so had to rely on the air conditioning The frosted bathroom window did not have a blind there was a light shining through our room all night , The hotel was in a great location for our needs and was very modern architecturally pleasing 
298359,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, I would have liked to have a bit more gluten free options in the restaurant menu but we were able to bring in our food into our rooms so that wasn t such a big deal Still it would have been nice to eat at the hotel restaurant at least once , I loved the room and the staff The room was extremely comfortable and we had tea making facilities which suited my mother very well The staff were so friendly and helpful They did their best to help us out whenever we had any queries 
298360,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Need another coffee machine at breakfast as very busy at weekends and needed to queue , Lovely interior especially the bar Nice comfortable room with lovely shower 
298361,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Staff seemed new and not properly trained no one seemed to be in charge problems with maid service room not cleaned properly on entry then not at all next day no maintenance staff available Saturday night to fix a leaking toilet bar staff unable to serve basic drinks could not make a long vodka as it was not on the menu and she didn t know what it was,No Positive
298362,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, We weren t allocated the room we were promised I rang the day before arrival and was promised a room on the top floor we ended up on the second floor Hence we didn t get the view mini bar and coffee machine that we paid for when booking The door didn t fit properly and we were woken several times with the door rattling every time someone came into our corridor , The breakfast was good and the staff in the restaurant were very attentive
298363,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Very unhappy about being asked to pay 50 per night for the dog to stay no mention of this when booking advertised as dog friendly No car parking available either Dinner menu was also very uninspiring,No Positive
298364,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Nothing all good , Staff very helpful no problems with a late check in Not the biggest twin room I ve ever stayed in but there was a nice feel about the place and great value for money Looking forward to staying again 
298365,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, There was a bit of a wait to check in and there seemed to be staff standing around rather than checking guests in , We stayed in the Greenwich hotel for a festival the location was good and the hotel was decent value for money The room was clean and had all mod cons Nice bar and friendly polite staff 
298366,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Car parking was an issue But we worked around it , Lovely room and view 10 mins or so walk from the centre of Greenwich 3 mins walk from DLR We had a minor issue with the room that was dealt with fantastically well and we received a complimentary gift on our return from dinner Will be happy to stay again 
298367,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich,No Negative, Absolutely delighted such a lovely stylish building inside and out modern good sized rooms with comfortable beds spotlessly clean ensuite with a good shower Unlike a lot of hotels it was quiet both in the rooms and outside the building A good breakfast was served in a splendid dining area and the bar had a very relaxed and comfortable ambience plus drink prices quite reasonable To top it all the staff were amazing very helpful and obliging they went the extra mile to help I certainly will book this hotel again and Thank you to the staff for making our stay a pleasant one
298368,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Broken shower door Cold shower every morning unacceptable Letter of apology in room missing the Petits Four , The staff were very helpful tried to sort out the problems as best they could Letter of apology in room offering Petits Fours 
298369,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Nothing, The Greenwich history chronology on bathroom door was fascinating My husband liked the general feel of the building decor ambience and clear view of London from our bedroom window and balcony 
298370,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The location of the hotel wasn t for me I felt as it was too good for where it was But right next to train station which helped , Great Stay one of the best hotels I have been to The room its self was unbelievable Very clean hotel and great staff I was shocked that it was the price I payed for such a great place value for money Great hotel and would stay there again 
298371,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, I have never been charged a deposit in advance of staying in a hotel before and I have stayed in all sorts of places all over the world It was a bit of a shock to be over 100 poorer than I had expected as I walked through the door even though I got it back at the end I couldn t enjoy it during my stay I expect a small room as a single traveller so it wasn t too much of a shock There were too many little problems though like no teabags being left by room service and a long wait in the restaurant when I asked for some I eventually gave up went out and bought some And when there is a large puddle of reddy brown water that has leaked from somewhere onto the bathroom floor I would like to at least be asked by one of the 3 investigating staff members if I would like to be moved I would have said yes Some places allow you to relax and enjoy the luxury of your stay But this was an unforgettably and undeniably extremely overpriced experience , The breakfast was good and the staff were obviously keen to help There were gluten free options for both main course and dessert at dinner I also really liked the area and was able to explore a part of London I don t know very well with ease I love the DLR I eventually discovered a local Japanese restaurant which was excellent 
298372,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The only two problems was that there wasn t a bath tub and there were flies flying through the Air Conditioning vents and flying around the room My wife and I would love to book again on our anniversary but that s the only thing we re afraid of, It s really prestige love the red carpet at the entrance and the interior design The staff are friendly The rooms are spacious I booked a standard room and even that was huge Felt really serene and peaceful too 
298373,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Letting people know about the door signs Because we not aware that the signs were double sided our room was not cleaned replenished and on a second occasion when we had used the door sign correctly it was not cleaned again with a note saying we could have it done by housekeeping if we let them know when we requested this there was no one in house keeping and the receptionist had to bring tea and coffee etc We ended up remaking our own beds again Also was not happy with the 30 00 per day deposit in case of breakages which not aware of until we booked into the hotel , The hotel was extremely clean and the breakfast choices very good Hotel staff were very attentive only problem was the trouble we had with the room not being serviced 
298374,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich,No Negative, The hotel has recently stopped being part of the Mercure group but seems completely the same Still comfortable with decent sized rooms good views from the upper floors and better value for money than central London Very close to Deptford Bridge DLR station 
298375,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The only thing I didn t like was the 3am call asking if I had requested a toothbrush I hadn t but rest assured that if I had the staff at the Greenwich would get me one , Friendly helpfull staff clean comfy room and good food Only 2 minutes from the DLR and Tesco express and 10 minutes from lovely Greenwich shops and markets perfect for our trip 
298376,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Reception a little slow on arrival but once all booked in smooth sailing Would be good if had mini bar in room Also shocked at price of breakfast if not booked in advance was 50 per person Or 12 95 if booked in advance Don t know how anyone can justify 50 for breakfast , Room a little on the small side but well laid out and comfortable Nice queen size bed and nice plush carpets The bathroom was lovely Loved the history lesson provided on bathroom door and was nice and bright Nice touch with the steam free square on mirror Definitely would stay again
298377,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Prefer Nespresso coffee in the room but tea making facility was good , Very nice room very nice bed staff were excellent Good location for the river and our friends in nearby Greenwich 
298378,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Unfortunately I was in room 801 next to the lift Fab views of the nighttime city but noisy because of the lift and the swing doors leading into the corridor It sounded as though someone was moving furniture every time they were used They should have soft close doors there Parking is limited so remember to reserve a space before you get to the hotel I gave it a low comfort score purely because of the lift shaft and door noise otherwise my overall score would have been closer to 9 instead of 7 9 I will stay again , The staff were professional friendly and helpful Check in and out was quick and efficient Breakfast was good The room although on the small side was clean and comfortable 
298379,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, It is a bit spendy per night, Excellent staff Willing to help We were there as a wedding party for my wedding They helped with requests for amenities 
298380,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, I booked a queen anne double and the staff tried to give me a single room Also was charged for breakfast which was included in the room rate , The room was compact but excellent and had all you needed for a night s stay 
298381,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Not being able to add breakfast at a more inclusive rate I booked it on arrival and it was a little costly , The turn down service was nice Clean Comfortable and quiet Check in was smooth and the staff friendly Breakfast was nice 
298382,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Just little things like glass door to bathroom allowing light through when one of us needed to use the toilet in the night so the other is also disturbed Taps more stylish than functional , Very comfortable room of reasonable size for the two of us and good location for visiting my daughter in the Greenwich area Located in small pleasant square away from the main drag 
298383,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Rooms were a little small for American standard we stayed in a queen room and at night heard water running above behind our bed Bathroom was a tad small , Breakfast was really good hotel staff was very accommodating and property was updated Had USB plugs readily available in addition to power outlets 
298384,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, nothing, Quiet excellent food in the restaurant excellent service throughout good choice at breakfast lovely pillows clean beautiful decor relaxing atmosphere 
298385,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Decor not to my taste but probably is to most others Queen room rather small Some confusion amongst staff sometimes e g room not serviced after first night apparently not on schedule when key didn t work on third night just needed reformatting I was told initially that it had run out of power then that it might not work because I might have sat on it Nothing major just some personnel needing a bit more training experience , V clean well kept room Good varied breakfast Location convenient for Greenwich quite easy to get to town too Overall a good stay 
298386,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, A minor issue the room we had unfortunately had a fault with the air conditioning unit which would very occasionally make a horrible loud noise for a few seconds This was potentially a problem but as it didn t last long I told the staff about it at the end of my stay becasue I didn t want the hassle of moving all my stuff once we had settled in I m sure they would have moved us if I had asked it seemed that sort of place It was room 20 on the lower ground floor by the way, Very friendly and helpful staff throughout very clean and well presented with high quality fixtures fittings and furniture etc 
298387,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Nothing , Staff fabulous Hotel lovely Room spacious with nice view great bathroom and huge comfy bed Communication brilliant when I left my sunglasses and these were posted to my home address 
298388,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, N A, Fantastic stay in a very well designed hotel I loved the small but very practical layout of the room and that it looks over a lovely park and quiet street yet so near public transport My favorite hotel in London and I have been to lots of others in the better category and more central locations before 
298389,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The room we stayed in was a little small and required a small amount of gymnastic skill to move around The window was also quite small so natural light was not great However you get what you pay for and we were extremely satisfied , Located just a few minute walk from the DLR Deptford this hotel provides the perfect location for those wanting to stay just outside of busy central London The staff were very friendly and attentive breakfast was great and the hotel itself is very modern and well decorated The warm welcome cookie was a nice touch The room was very pleasant and the beds were certainly comfortable The bathroom was large and the shower was good Due to the location we were able to enjoy a very peaceful nights sleep and would certainly stay again The hotel has a secure car park that you can use for 17 a day which is a little pricey but fairly competitive for London 
298390,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich,No Negative, Quiet location and very comfortable rooms Walking distance to public transport or about a 20 minute walk to the Cutty Sark The staff were very courteous friendly and efficient Breakfast was a wide choice of food to suit all nationalities 
298391,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The price of drinks at the bar , The variety of breakfast was very good staff were very polite and helpful not too far from the nearest station also very clean rooms air conditioning and very comfortable beds
298392,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, reception staff, the staff at the reception were very poor unfriendly and seem that they do not know well their job did not expect this from a double tree by hilton hotel 
298393,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich,No Negative, The bed was extremely comfy staff super friendly HOT CHOCOLATE COOKIE ON ARRIVAL A decent check out time of 12 00 We will def look for this hotel when traveling to other cities 
298394,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The bathroom was long and skinny so the sink was too crowded with the bathroom door closed Had to leave the door open This was despite the fact that the room was quite large Room needed another chair with wheels and could use a bureau for clothes It was easier to keep clothes in the suitcase , The staff at check in and at the restaurant were very helpful and friendly 
298395,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, No mini fridge beware as many different room types on offer and it s not all that clear which is which Also we were in the basement so tiny window near the roof and next to function suite so music was heard late into the night, Room was very clean and tidy
298396,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, We arrived and departed from kings cross so Greenwich location was a bit far out somewhere closer on the tube line to kings cross would have made it simpler in hindsight The price was a factor in our choice and the hotel was as lovely and fair value for money, Good bed Good bar Comfortable Helpful staff
298397,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, DLR and public buses are the only choice for public transportation and it takes almost 30 minutes to the city center but it s not that much problem , Comfortable and cleen rooms beds and cheery staff At the edge of zone 2 and not a difficult transportation Almost 200 meters to Deptford Bridge stop of DLR and public buses Breakfast was good enough Welcome cookie was a very good gesture and delicious also 
298398,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The only slight problem was the cooked breakfast was quite slow to be replenished which meant I didn t get the full choice but what I did get was very good , The room was bright clean spacious and very comfortable and the lady on reception on our arrival was possibly one of the most helpful smiley and professional receptionists I have ever come across A great breakfast overall a very enjoyable stay 
298399,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Initially being allocated a room next to the gym would have been noisy After complaining another room was allocated , Lovely quiet hotel with helpful staff 
298400,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Location was a little further from Greenwich than I expected but luckily the DLR was close by , Staff were excellent Welcoming and helpful Really made breakfast a bright start to the day Very comfortable room with a super shower Got a great nights sleep It was a very hot weekend but the room was cool and had a super view of London 
298401,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The staff are rude They dropped phone on me and took money out of my account and then did not explain that payment has already been requested while I paid with another card They are unapologetic for misinforming you of their fraudulent way of misleading on their payments Please be careful while making payment or reservations because the staff are not very clear on what their terms of payments are I specifically ask about payment and was still giving wrong information , The location
298402,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich,No Negative, Doubletree by Hilton at Greenwich was a ex exceptionally clean and manicured property and very close to the DLR 200 m which was very important to us Breakfast was ideal and the room very comfortable 
298403,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Car park was fully booked so we had to park quite some distance from the hotel and use the DLR not ideal I m not sure how much parking the hotel has available but it seems you do have to book a space so our fault I guess , Reception staff were excellent Friendly and very helpful with organising taxis etc 
298404,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The only problem I had was with heavy footed guests in the room above me who sounded like a heard of buffalo every night at midnight and every morning at 8 am In my room I would have liked a plug socket just outside the shower room so I could do my hair in the mirror , I was greeted well and when I asked to just view the room before taking my luggage in the manager guessed that I was exhausted and did not want to deal with the heavy case straight away and brought it up to my room for me The staff were friendly and confident and I like that the tipping system in on the receipt so it gets added to the bill I was put in a new built room so it was fresh The food was amazing and I basically waited to eat in the evening at the hotel They have room service which is perfect for me The room lighting is controlled by remote I had a king room with complimentary drinks and a coffee machine and kettle and plenty of space to move around The plugs have usb portholes so you do not need an adapter There is a huge and comfortable bar at the hotel and had I not been so exhausted I would have spent plenty of time in there I stayed for two days and I came here because I was staying at the stay city apartments round the corner and could not stand another night at that place I wish I had moved here sooner This hotel is great and I would return 
298405,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, I don t like being forced to have a credit card charged with a deposit, Very convenient for access to Greenwich and the City I stayed in this location before it became a DoubleTree and the most noticeable factor this time was the dramatic improvement in the manners and demeanour of the staff who could not have been more helpful
298406,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, On 3rd day breakfast was abysmal I had to ask for almost everything The person on the breakfast area did not fill up at all In the end I was embarrassed because I had to ask for so much and the female attending had a bit of an attitude problem Bread was low all end bits she was argumentative melon only one type there just came to the stage that I couldn t ask anymore No butter apparently on 3rd day they didn t have individual packets one had to ask and it would have been cut handy if one had been informed in advance Orange juice only had dregs I asked for ham this had also run out So she brought beef then proceeded to use the FISH fork to put some on my plate needless to say I didn t have any she needs training and an attitude transplant , Breakfast was very good for first 2 days 
298407,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich,No Negative, Staff were very accommodating pleasant to talk to and overall excellent customer service Our room was lovely which made up for the car park outlook Everything was very clean we would definitely stay here again
298408,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, the room was very small and on the lower ground floor the basement the view was of a wall and some astro turf we asked for 2 singles we actually got what I would describe as a Scandinavian double as there was no room at all between the beds the kettle was tucked in a corner and difficult to use safely there were only 2 tea bags for 2people all day and no biscuits at all and non of the supposedly delicious cookies the hotel advertises the desk dressing table was unusable as there was no room for someone to sit and another to pass behind the young lady on check in was quite blunt and not at all helpful until my daughter berated her , the location only a ten minute walk to the curry Sark and the river boats 
298409,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, We weren t keen on the foggy glass door to the bathroom found it a little intrusive with not a 100 privacy , The staff were really friendly and very helpful we had a snack before the concert and have to say the cheesey chips were the best we ve had totally recommend staying at this hotel Breakfast was plentiful and had good choices The staff were very attentive and cheerful 
298410,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, No notice taken on booking requests Asked for non smoking high room and parking Offered originally no parking low room overlooking car park with linen bag store overflowing Price offered to guests on arrival seemed far better than your site, Breakfast
298411,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Breakfast was a disaster Cookers not working no butter two days Ina row Staff not interested in complaint Lift broken Rooms not cleaned Dirty glasses that sat for four days, Lication
298412,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, 30 mins delay in checking in room not ready UPGRADE ROOM VERY SMALL NO DRAWERS FOR STORAGE TINY HANGING AREA AND BED RIGHT OPPOSITE INCOMING DOOR RESTAURANT RAN OUT OF HOT BREAKFAST ITEMS SO 20 MINUTE WAIT , COMFORTABLE BED NESPRESSO COFFEE IN ROOM UPGRADE OF ROOM DUE TO DELAY
298413,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The shower could have been better designed as it tended to drench the bathroom floor but that is a minor niggle , Very spacious comfortable twin bedded room well decorated attractively furnished an extremely pleasant surprise Great staff who really tried very hard to keep everyone happy and succeeded An extremely well run hotel 
298414,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Room was a bit small ideal for 1 or 2 nights But this is London and it wasn t cramped in the slightest given the price it was about right Main negative was the sliding glass door to the shower room which offered little in the way of privacy so only suitable for intimate couples , Exceptional staff lovely fresh cookie provided while checking in Plenty of staff on hand as well Much better than some hotels where 1 person gets left of reception to do everything Room was small and functional but all done to high standard Wifi worked well Car park at the back was a bargain for London at 17 overnight and a smooth drive in only being about 20 mins from the M25 Very close to the DLR so good for concerts at O2 and Stratford Cracking breakfast with plenty of options good quality produce and extras such a muffins Smooth check out Will definitely return again next time we have the chance 
298415,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Breakfast organisation was a shambles Buffet style breakfast ran out of hot food and had to wait ten minutes for replenishment which then went immediately because of the queue that had built up Senior staff asked to resolve showed no interest in doing so, Accommodation was fine
298416,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, No cooked breakfast available We weren t late but all that was left was a few beans and hash brown Not clear why as we were initially told chef was cooking some more as they hadn t expected some many breakfasts needed Then told that there was no gas and then told there had been an incident We were given complimentary drinks in the bar that evening and our breakfasts were deducted from the bill All a bit strange but could have been better communication , Staff were lovely Bar is beautifully designed 
298417,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Cant think of anything, On arrival staff were very professional courteous and helpful and this continued throughout our short stay We will certainly return as it was very close to where we wanted to be which was the Royal College at Greenwich 
298418,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The breakfast was overly priced , This is a great hotel Very accommodating staff they relocated us to a room with a bath upon request comfortable beds and nice quiet surroundings We ll go back 
298419,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Size of the bed, When I booked the hotel I choose to have the queen bed I was surprised because it s just the size of a double bed It s not really a problem though Apart from that everything is superb Staff are very friendly and enthusiastic Great place to stay I will recommend to my family and friends 
298420,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The location is not the best It is convenient for visiting the sights in Greenwich however But the impressive building suffers from being in a fairly run down area It is just slightly on the wrong side of the tracks, The staff were very helpful Except the bar staff who tried to serve double measures as standard when the bar list clearly showed singles available However they reacted well when this was pointed out Also the views from our corner room on the 7th floor were wonderful Nice wide bed too And great shower 
298421,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Only fault was the bar music we could hear in our room until at least 12 30 when I pulled out the earplugs otherwise couldn t fault it , Lovely hotel
298422,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Small room windows were draughty and allowed a lot of noise in throughout the night The shower room having a sliding door is rubbish For the money Montcalm are much better, The staff were superb
298423,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, N A, Very friendly greeting upon arrival Room was stunning very luxurious Food and drinks in the bar was extremely nice The chips were amazing and would definitely recommend trying a few cocktails Comfortable nights sleep We would definitely return and stay here again 
298424,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The aircondition not work at our week and it was the hotes days in london At tusday the hotel gave as mini air condition who made noise and we not sleep well Sad they not moove as to another room or give as something to sutesfight us, It was a nice and clean hotel
298425,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich,No Negative, Great hotel with a fantastic location the room was very clean and a great little layout but above all the staff were excellent and always ready to help plus free cookies always helps 
298426,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, I wish I had a bathtub instead of a shower as I had stayed for a few days Also I wish there was spa facilities , The room was nice and cosy the bed and pillows was all very comfortable and the staff was very accommodating Cleanliness was upto standard and the decor was very modern 
298427,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The room was supposed to be a queen this was not the case The shower room looked fabulous but in reality when you put the shower on it flooded the whole bathroom , The hotel was convenient to the tube It was clean and friendly Loved the cookies on arrival this was a nice touch The room reflected the area of London that we were in Lots of interesting facts and pictures
298428,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Room 20 next to gym Every morning 6o clock the sound of the treadmill horrible wake up call, We liked everything except how we were treated when the air conditioner broke It broke the day before we were leaving When we returned that evening it was still broke We were told this before we returned to our room and offered to move us to another room As we were checking out the next day at 12 it didn t seem practical and we availed of a portable air conditioner However the next morning around 11 15 just as we were packing up showering Tec we received a call from reception to say maintenance was on the way We asked for 15mins to finish of packing and were told NO Not best pleased 
298429,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich,No Negative, The breakfast was delicious with lots of choice and variety The pancake machine was the highlight of my stay Lovely filter coffee and access to a diy coffee machine for cappuccino and lattes Cooked breakfast was help yourself but refreshed often and kept nice and hot 
298430,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The staff were very rude throughout whole stay Did not get a warm cookie upon check in Staff were shocked when I asked for extra towels even though the cleaner left a message saying that if we need any towels the reception counter would be happy to help but they were not Reception give rude and unpleasant looks whenever we entered or left the reception hall and made us feel unwelcome Tried to overcharged by 50 pounds and then tried to overcharge by 100 pounds that was never stated while booking Had to make sure I didn t get over charged Restaurant was overpriced as was room service There is not much in location around it , Close to underground 
298431,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Sink was clogged no view from window ceiling height , Excellent bed window can be opened for fresh air no streetnoise so excellent sleep for London standards Walking distance from Deptford Bridge station Very kind reception upon arrival efficient check in

298437,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, I thought car parking was included in the price but was extra and quite expensive for I night The breakfast too I thought was quite expensive 38 for two No mini bar in room, Good breakfast selection
298438,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Squeaky beds in our twin room Kettle and cups were in the bottom of the wardrobe 3 day stay resulted in 51 extra for parking not mentioned on Booking com , The room was quiet up on the 6th floor Safe provided in room for no charge Friendly staff 
298439,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Room a little small but still a good stay , We had a lovely stay check in was quick and was able to park for free Staff friendly and helpful Room was very clean and comfortable bed

298443,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Nothing, I could not fault the hotel Facilities rooms location and staff all brilliant Top class value for money Would highly recommend to everyone 
298444,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The hotel was a little bit further than I expected it to be but even though it took me only 10 minutes to get to Canary Wharf where you can find a bit more facilities to enjoy , I really liked interior and the view from my window Breakfast was great I really liked hotel staff everyone was very helpful The access to the railway was very easy only 3 5 minutes walking Very comfortable bed I enjoyed my weekend stay a lot 
298445,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The reception staff did not notify us of the breakfast offer until after we had already arranged to eat so it was too late to take advantage of it It had to be prebooked , Lovely dining room and bar area better laid out than most 
298446,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, We had 2 keycards but i had to get down twice 2 different days because it didnt work , Breakfast was great Standard twin rooms were bigger than usual twin rooms elsewhere And there was a lot of staff all day and they were always friendly and smiling 
298447,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Perfect for our concert to O2 but travelling in and out of central London quite long , Excellent stay lovely helpful staff and the cookie is always welcome 
298448,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Temperature of room was hard to keep constant kept having to switch between hot and cold air Room was small for a king but that wasn t much of a bother really Breakfast only served till 11am which was quite a shame , Really tasty room service food the little jars of sauces were a nice touch Room was of a high standard and very clean While the bathroom door was glass it didn t really pose a problem as it was around the corner of the bed 
298449,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Typical for London the standard room is very small bathroom shower are tiny Room needs better lighting near mirror for putting on make up or make up mirror , Exceptionally helpful staff beautifully appointed rooms fantastic linens bedding tea coffee hot pot in room cookies 
298450,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, My room was 1 floor below the entry level They should not put rooms at 1 It is unacceptable The room was too small and not well organised do not expect a Hilton quality ,No Positive
298451,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Nothing maybe the taxi service you use since once they did not show up for 35 minutes without a reason just forgot I used GETT which was dependable and great, The staff was extraordinary Always accommodating I would say the only thing was it was far from the city however the trains were close and over all it was a great successful trip I would totally stay again I would love to enroll in a points program
298452,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, I asked twice for a surprise for my partner to be put in the room prior to our arrival once via email and over the call I was told by the chef he would display a small selection of cakes with a good luck message for my partner for the Marathon He said this would be sorted out for me and when we arrived into the room there was nothing there I was very disappointed considering I had requested this twice and revived nothing , Good range at breakfast and ideal for the Marathon location
298453,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Time it took to check in Nescaf coffee in room used to coffee bags one persons attitude compared to outstanding by others e g Fridge found for insulin that s all would recommend, Breakfast and offer of coffee to take away most staff biscuit on arrival

298455,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Couldn t watch TV from bed Strange single bed with lots of cushions that wasn t very comfortable was only place to sit and watch TV , Good location from London city and visiting greenwich
298456,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Was given the keys for a room that was already taken so embarrassingly walked into someone s room with a couple in bed besides that pretty good overall , Bed was comfy Food was good 
298457,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, never in my life have i dealt with such a rude manger this hotel charged my boyfriend for my room again He basically told me i was stupid and hadn t paid even after showing him my paypal account and bank statement luckily the girl at booking com was brilliant and sorted everything out for me this man left me feeling embarrassed and so upset he ruined my whole experience Although the receptionist Laura wad absolutely brilliant the manager made me even angrier by talking to her like utter rubbish How this guy is deputy manager i don t know All other staff were brilliant but due to the experience i d never go back , beautiful food and breakfast

298459,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, very rude staff not a clue how to book us in big confusion with car parking not even offered breakfast at check in which caused a problem when we walked in to the room on sunday morning staff said you not booked in one good thing the luggage guy very helpful and we got the impression he knew what was going on more than the 6 check in staff all standing behind the desk, location
298460,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Some issues with room cleaning but resolved , Location great room view from the room staff very pleasent but some issues around timliness of room cleaning Great food lovely atmosphere Wonderful area close on to many attractions 
298461,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, My basement room was rather dark and there was an intermittent squeaking noise possibly from next room s air con Air con generally was rather noisy The location s a bit out of the way though close to DLR station and walkable to Greenwich centre , Reception area has real wow factor from the former official use of the building Staff very helpful and service personal
298462,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Taking an extra 50 00 deposit off my credit card that will hopefully be refunded asap I had pre paid the room so you had my card details so I don t understand the need for this and it s the first time it s happened to us at a hotel , The beds are so comfy but the hotel facilities are basic Would have loved a bath Also the bar really needs somewhere to sit outside as it was stifling 
298463,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, They said it was a super king but was just two singles put together and you could fill the bit where they was put together, It was clean and tidy room was a little small but ok
298464,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Nothing, Cookies on arrival friendlieness helpfulness of staff Manager dealt with a minor situation out of there control extremely well very accomadating Modern comfortable
298465,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Breakfast in restaurant does not start until 6 30am which meant I did not have one as needed to be at work at 7 00 For the week and to accommodate business travelers I really think they should open at 6 00 and later at the week end If not visiting working nearby it is a good 40 mins away from center of London The hotel was very nice but area not Room is lovely but small , The welcoming cookie on arrival was divine lukewarm piece of heaven Location is ideal if visiting Cutty Sark and or Greenwhich observatory Less than 5 mins walk from Deptford Bridge DLR Also good for working in city Canary Wharf Breakfast included but did not get chance to sample it 
298466,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The 50 required in case of any extras was a bit annoying As it takes days to go back in my account , Staff were so friendly and helpful couldn t ask for better 
298467,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Only 2 teabags in the room Should have asked for more though as I m sure staff would have sorted this for us , Comfy bed Nice friendly staff Particularly lady behind bar who made a special cocktail for my daughter

298470,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Thought for the money the room could have been a bit bigger But it was still a lovely room , The bed was very comfy lovely shower and the staff were great Oh and the cookie was amazing 
298471,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, My room had some scuff marks and was missing a fridge and cupbord doors unlike the room my family were in I liked their room better But I cant complain the rest of the hotel was great Everything else was impeccable , The location and neighbourhood was great Lovely staff Very helpful Presentable and clean Breakfast was varied and nice The hotel is clean and the staff are helpful Id definitely book again 
298472,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Hotel was truly great but don t book if you are going through the BlackWall tunnel for the ExCel Exhibition centre etc Nightmare journey the following morning , Fantastic staff made to feel very welcome Room was very good Great bar area very comfortable and food was very good 
298473,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, I didn t like The bathroom sliding door it made us feel conscious of going to the toilet as it lacked the privacy needed , The style of the hotel and the quality for the value Ideal for a short romantic break away from the busy parts of London The food was really good quality And the cookie on arrival was a nice touch something different 
298474,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Unhelpful reception staff very noisy charged extortionate amount for a slice of toast Never stay again , Gentleman at the Door Entrance met us with a lovely smile 
298475,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, the selection of cold meats and cheeses was very poor The only thing that disappointed us , everything was excellent except for the breakfast We would definitely return to this hotel
298476,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, A little closer to the Greenwich Park would have been better but that is guided by my fathers ability to get around , Staff were excellent very helpful to my father who finds it hard to get around now Hotel was beautifully appointed stunning views of the city from some rooms 
298477,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich,No Negative, Absolutely beautiful hotel with incredible staff We arrived at 7pm and were met by 2 lovely receptionists who booked us quickly into our room along with 2 very yummy chocolate chip cookies believe me take them when they offer we asked for more the following day We were going to the O2 to watch Bruno Mars and were running behind schedule so I was panicking when we arrived however the receptionists couldn t have put me more at ease they checked us in quickly and escorted us to our room The room itself was perfect a lovely size for the two of us I went with my boyfriend and was spotless It had everything you would need for an overnight stay we even were provided with toothbrushes at our request after forgetting ours and it was no bother at all to the staff They were constantly smiling and very friendly For the price I paid for the room I would 100 recommend it to anyone looking for a beautiful hotel to stay in Uber s are available within 4 minutes of ordering and I honestly cannot fault the hotel Only thing I would say is I wish I ordered room service as the food looked incredible It was a 25 minute uber to Westminster which I think was 14 which was was ideal We spent the whole day being tourists and had a fabulous trip away mainly done to our stay at DoubleTree 
298478,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Nothing to dislike No swimming pool but otherwise perfect , Liked thedroom and comfy bed and close to Greenwich Easy to get to and near where I wanted to be Breakfast was fine and staff all friendly Couldn t work shower but sorted it in the end Used to live in the area so good to go back and visit places I knew and friends also 
298479,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The parking situation was awful They had limited parking and had none available on the day I was staying I asked to cancel my booking and be refunded due to this and I was refused Instead I was told I could park on a nearby housing estate between the hours of 5pm 9am Hence it left me having to vacate the hotel to move my car at 9am in the morning with no where to move it to It was awful and staff were very unhelpful ,No Positive
298480,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich,No Negative, for the first night although i asked for interconnected or rooms close to each other we had one to the third fllor and the other to minor floor the next morning we were mooved to third floor but the first experience of our staying was disapointing 
298481,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich,No Negative, Really nice comfortable hotel Room on 7th floor was small and quirky Would have been tight for a couple but perfect for single occupancy Decor really nice Warm choc chip cookie on arrive was great 
298482,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, They were decorating corridors when we arrived which reception didn t mention so a little surprised to get out of lift to be met by workmen outside our room and the fresh smell of paint Would have been nice to be informed , Lovely hotel and friendly helpful staff Comfortable clean quiet room with nice views We were able to leave baggage to walk around area once we had checked out Enjoyed our stay 
298483,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, However we had contacted the hotel the day before we checked in to enquire whether we arrive earlier and park the car so that we could look around Greenwich before checking in This was agreed and we had even agreed an ETA Unfortunately when we did arrive the car park was full and we were unable to park Instead we were told to park on the meters at 20p for every five minutes up to a maximum of two hours In the end we managed to drive around and find some unrestricted parking which we then used until we returned in the early evening to check in , The overall ambience of the hotel was delightful from the reception to the reception rooms and the individual rooms The staff were also very polite and courteous 
298484,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, It was a downstairs room next to the kitchen dinning area It was noisy There was a pillar in the middle of the room which is odd specially for Hilton Some works were carried out and hence corridors were not exactly what I d expect for Food was not great either The environment was bit grumpy and may not be most interesting for young professionals Another disadvantage was location Far from central London , Not much 
298485,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, My corridor was being painted during the day which was a little inconvenient but not a massive drama Given the price of the room and not really being central Greenwich I thought the parking was expensive at 17pd I got charged for two days even though I d only parked for one this was corrected Again given the price of the room I d expect better tea and coffee and a little more choice on the in room tea front Gym isn t very well equipped so if you need a hotel with a gym go somewhere else , The dinner I had there was nice The view was good and the bed comfy 
298486,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The breakfast was ridiculously over priced we were charged 2 50 each for the tiny bottles of water which we found in our room The hotel took a 100 holding charge but didn t explain that they were going to do this When I asked about it the man at reception rudely told me that all guests were told this therefore implying that we were lying We also weren t offered a breakdown of the charges on our room when we checked out In other hotels I have stayed in i have automatically been given an itemized bill to check and sign at the end of my stay Some of the service was also slow I think a lot of this was down to staff being new but the guy at reception was rude , it was very clean probably because it is new Most of the staff were very friendly 
298487,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich,No Negative, I have stayed at this property before it changed ownership and the availability of room types and value for money was better under the previous management However it was a comfortable room and my stay was fine 
298488,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The bathroom facilities are lovely but the bizarre opaque sliding door with a gap where they overlap feels less than private and I would not have felt comfortable with this if i was in a new relationship on a romantic weekend zero mystery , Decor is beautiful especially the bar area An easy walk to a great range if restaurants Quite location Comfy bed Staff friendly and helpful Booked a carparking space ahead of stay Absolutely necessary if travelling by car as the carpark is tiny
298489,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, asked for a Malibu and coke at the bar got told can only do Malibu as a shot another waitress asked what would I like so I said again a Malibu and coke he happily made it for me the other waitress asked them how would you price that Also asked for a strawberry daiquiri and got told they didn t have any left and was making the last ones, The room was a nice size just for a night staying bedwas comfy and we got a card each for a free cookie to collect whenever we wanted When we collected our cookies late at night we got asked how many and they offered us more than one each so we had 2 each
298490,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The climate control in the bedroom takes a while, Food was very good Staff very friendly and helpful Great facilities Would definitely recommend This won t be my last visit
298491,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Ordered food via room service and it came a little cold this was soon resolved and the hotel did not charge us and were completely apologetic for this , Hotel lounge Bar was decked out art decor with lovely comfortable chairs great staff couldn t do enough for you will definitely stay again 
298492,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The breakfast was a little delayed as there were a few of us in the restaurant But nothing to complain about the food was beautiful and worth the wait , Very nice hotel A little smaller than expected but plenty of room Staff were very accommodating and friendly And the warm cookie is an amazing touch after a long day of travelling 
298493,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The staff are rude went too london for my 20th birthday I dont understand why nobody is listening i would also like too make a complaint about the night shift reception manager last night He clearly needs too go on a customer service course Saying sorry isnt going too make up for travelling all the way from Cardiff too london by coach too then get 3 trains too your pathetic hotel then be double charged spoken too ruddily hissing noise in room which kept us up That was day 1 Day 2 just topped our time in london off Dont expect too go out sight seeing and have someone rumble through our stuff Didnt have a maintenance team sunday night yet they were in my room yesterday Didnt get informed by the hotel i had too ask if i someone bar the house keeping had been in there My partner noticed as soon as we got back in the room that the birthday cards he had put up had been moved and that the dreadful noise coming from the USB support had stopped Someone has had a great look around and had the fingers clearly in our stuff I will be taking this further too the police if i have too I did not at all enjoy my stay one bit I ADVISE NOBODY TOO GO THERE offered us a free drink then a free hotel stay back at that same hotel , Room was lovely 
298494,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, I would have liked a bath but the shower was lovely , Everything Beautifully decorated building Lovely room Quiet area Excellent room service amazing food Loved the shower room doors glass with interesting facts about the area Loved the huge photo above the bed of Greenwich Love this hotel and will be back 
298495,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Was given a different room to the one booked Was doubted about free breakfast but when saw the booking reference accepted Changed to a better room the next day Photos online don t reflect the state of the rooms Be careful with this hotel Definitely not 4 star but 3 yes , Some staff polite Restaurant and bar good 
298496,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, We had booked a queen bed room but were offered a room with two single beds pushed together and with two single duvets , Location surroundings and decor 
298497,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Wifi in the bar intermittent and restaurant menu was meh , Quiet great location excellent staff hyper clean I could go on and tick all the boxes Recommended One niggle Wifi in the bar was iffy however the G T s weren t Good music choice too
298498,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Requested a quite room with nice view and was given a room that overlooked the aircondition units and generators so was very noisy and NOT a nice view ,No Positive
298499,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Car parking limited and couldn t get into hotel car park for whole of our visit We asked what alternatives were available and where directed verbally to a street five minutes away Hotel could do with a map showing alternative locations Small point we were very happy with our stay , Great location whilst visiting the O2 for the weekend a short walk to Greenwich and all its attractions Room on top floor was spotlessly clean with great views and large comfy bed River clipper boat to O2 best way to get there and Emirates cable car a must Staff really friendly and would definitely stay again
298500,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Only one of our rooms were registered and we had to wait quite a while whilst it was sorted out we felt anxious and stressed after a long journey At breakfast we were told we were not booked in for breakfast and the waiter had to leave us to go and check which was highly embarrassing He made a joke of it but we were still embarrassed as we didn t know what was going on Thank goodness we had the emails on my phone and had taken the paperwork , The hotel was really lovely and the reception staff very nice 
298501,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, I booked this hotel in particular for its gym facilities so I was frustrated when I got there and found out they were refurbishing it Even if they gave me a voucher to use Novotel s gym I didn t use it because of the inconvenience , I got there at 2 am and they gave an outstanding warm chocolate chips cookie 
298502,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Duty manager attitude Size of room Room Cleanliness, Room too small Duty manager was rude Kept us waiting for 2 hours before checking us in Wet used towel by previous occupier left in the shower
298503,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, I paid 150 a night for a room that didn t even have enough floor space to allow for a gap either side of the bed , The hotel is fairly new the overall finish and look is lovely Staff are great Warm cookie on arrival which was a nice touch 
298504,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Some of the persons from the reception were not quit kind It took half an hour to make an invoice and then they said I m wornking for you you should have asked from the beginning when you made the reservation Really And I paid for that Disappointing,No Positive
298505,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The room was a little dusty room was 702 probably put the duvet after the dust cleaning and also the walls sre too thin heard a man cough all night but apart from that it was a grear stay , Staff wete great room service aswell as reception staff on th 28th in the evening and 1st of march in the morning 
298506,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, We found it difficult initially to manage the room temperature owing to two sets of controls for air conditioning and no opening windows , Very pleasant friendly helpful staff Within easy access of historic parts of Greenwich Good food in hotel restaurant and plenty of nearby alternatives too 
298507,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich,No Negative, Lovely Hotel in a quiet secluded area in greenwich with beautiful views especially if you are on the 8th floor Comfortable room with complimentary hot chocolate service Friendly helpful staff 
298508,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The bathroom was lovely but when you showered there was no door so the bathroom turned into a pool , Great service Staff were extremely accommodating and welcoming 
298509,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich,No Negative, The room was awesome right up top with an almost 180 degree view over London The bar looked amazing and we didn t expect it to be as nice as it was Breakfast was delicious too Location wise if you re visiting the O2 you can t go anywhere else DLR was very close and good links to the tube 
298510,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Nothing to complain about , Great location facilities Staff were extremely helpful Single room on Honours floor was fantastic comfiest Hotel bed ever 
298511,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Lack of parking facilities 15 for 24hours is a bit expensive especially when you re staying for at least more than 1 night The heating in our room wasn t working however we were provided with a portable heater , The hotel staff were very friendly and welcoming and the hotel itself looked very nice clean and tidy very well decorated 
298512,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The hotel is just a little off the beaten track but it s close to the DLR and so this is not a big problem, The staff is friendly and welcoming public spaces are comfortable and attractively furnished rooms nicely decorated and well equipped And the food is good too London hotels are very hit and miss but this one is great 
298513,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, There was some building work going on at the hotel which was a bit noisy but couldn t be helped As with all London hotels the rooms are small but functional , Location was great Only a few minutes from DLR Breakfast had a good selection of hot cold food in a nice setting Reception orgained a taxi to the O2 for us for a good price 
298514,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Nothing A lovely 2 night break , Staff of which plentiful were the most attentive pleasant friendly and smart that we have encountered in a long time The bar lounge area is particularly plush and comfortable with a good selection at the bar and an excellent barman in Alberto A good choice of food there also Tip the nearest rail station is Deptford Bridge on the DLR approx 300 yards 
298515,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The room could have been cleaned a lot better this time usually the cleaning was first class perhaps this was because the hotel has just changed hands, The staff they are so polite and very helpful nothing was too much for them The bar and restaurant are excellent
298516,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, We had a problem with the tap in the bathroom as the water came out at speed and soaked us both in different nt occasions The staff said they would see to the pressure Also the notices for the door only fitted on the inside which meant you couldn t let the staff know about doing the room , We have stayed here many times and have ways been satisfied 
298517,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, They lost one of my two bookings as a result of changing computer systems 24 hours before arrival What should have been a simple check in procedure became a mammoth wait at the check in desk It meant one of my brothers had to wait a long time before he could get access to his room They were apologetic and assured me that they would resolve all issues before check out I also specifically went to the hotel to give them the bank debit card that I wanted both rooms to be charged to as they wrote to me to say the credit card I had given on booking needed a third party authorisation as I was not staying at the hotel They then pre authorised my debit card and gave me a receipt and confirmed all charges would be put on this debit card However the next morning my brother was asked to pay for the rooms on his card He told them I had provided my debit card Somehow they lost my card s pre authorisation so finally they decided to charge the rooms to the credit card I had given as a guarantee on the initial booking form but which they previously stated they could not accept Hopefully they will get a grip on their systems ,No Positive
298518,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Nothing really stood out but I think the tv in my room could and should be upgraded , The warm welcome and the attention to detail I e having a room upgraded with cake and drinks The power shower and the amazing bed 
298519,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Was in room 204 and had an adjoining door to the room next door full of noisy women late at night I must have stayed in this hotel 10 times now at least so would prefer a higher room overlooking city side with NO adjoining doors,No Positive
298520,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Our room keys were not ready or working on arrival but I think this had something to do with the hotels transition to Doubletree Hilton , Lovely decor and breakfast 
298521,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, the in room temp controls were a bit hard to get right and wouldn t stay on the set temp , We stayed here prior to attending a concert at the O2 and it was highly convenient The hotel was very comfortable and homely with a well equipped room We enjoyed our stay soo much that this will now become our go to for any concerts in the area we ve already booked again for our next one in March

298524,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Parking is too expensive and the bar is very pricey Also unless you re travelling with someone you re very comfortable with the bathroom will be a problem It s not an en suite per se it s more part of a room with a sliding door over it Said door has a large gap that you can see right through Wasn t a problem for us but may be awkward for a twosome who are friends or relatives , The hotel was excellent staff very friendly although that seemed a little forced at times like they were reading from a script Everything else was pretty good One of the more aesthetically pleasing hotels I ve stayed in I loved the historical facts about Greenwich on the sliding door to the bathroom

298532,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The rooms that are pictured must be more expensive than the standard ones as ours was exceptionally small and very very warm We slept with the window open despite it being December The complimentary shower products weren t the best either just a generic hair conditioner shower all in one product , Breakfast was lovely Staff were very friendly and even left a birthday cake on our bed for my boyfriends 30th When the room was too hot they came up and showed us how to open the windows Very helpful staff 
298533,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, We struggled to find the place with Satnav I suggest you phone and get landmarks from a staff member The lack of air circulation you cant even open the windows a crack And the unpleasant smell in the 4th floor hallway that was weird 17 a day for parking , The staff were friendly polite and eager to please the buffet breakfast was very tasty and plentiful with lots to choose from the room was nice and clean we stayed 1 night in a standard double and the bed was big good value for money in London Nice that you could ensure secure parking by booking in advance

298714,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Bath had no handrails No magnifying mirror in bathroom Poor lighting in bedroom A lot of staff did not speak very good English On our 1st day after returning to the hotel at 4 30pm our room had not been cleaned and they did not now why Complained to management about our issues Would not recommend the hotel ,No Positive
298715,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Do not try resting during the day here as the housekeeping staff love nothing more than slamming doors It s absolutely insane Seriously they have a job to do that s understood but the hour they took cleaning rooms near mine the amount of times doors were slamming was ridiculous It was like an angry teenager was in the place slamming doors so hard it shook my door as well This went on for the entire two days Shame really as it is lovely here , Lovely clean room very kind and knowledgeable staff Very close to the dlr yet down a quiet residential road just off the main road Very very nice The room and the hotel is immaculate new and obviously well looked after Not even a speck of dust 
298716,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, We arrived at 12 to leave our bags there so we could go and explore a bit knowing that check in was at 2 so we arrived back at the hotel at 2 20 and our room still wasn t ready which was slightly annoying as we had to wait even longer , The decor is lovely the bar area is very cosy Lovely location to have the afternoon tea 
298717,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Staff were a little unhelpful regarding the booking com information and clarification of what I had reserved on website etc ie parking, Design was great and maintenance of property excellant
298718,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Staff friendly and took in my bags but could not check me in at 11am despite my request at time of booking with booking com Lack of carpet or tiles on floor on the way to my room no bath lack of milk lack of shop to buy toothpaste or tooth brush Plus slow internet connection and inabilty to access national rail meant I had to check out several hours in advance Plus I could not understand a couple of staff members, My dog Henry was made welcome and was provided with a comfy bed blanket and large dog bowl Many thanks 
298719,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, More directions on the website of which tube station to get off and which way to walk , The room was really smart and well set up the breakfast was great so much to choose from the bar was really well decorated the staff were helpful and friendly Great stay all round thanks for making us so welcome Excellent location for o2 gigs

298722,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Not an issue for us as it was just me and my husband but the bathroom was a sliding semi see through door which I imagine wouldn t be very comfortable for some guests I doesn t leave much for privacy , This hotel is in a great location while not right in the centre it was a 2min walk from the DLR I had a couple of requests before our stay which were all met The room was spacious clean and comfy We would 100 stay here again The value for money was excellent 
298723,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Shower seemed to fllod the whole area Maybe it was me Tap on basin turned to right when it was just meant to turn on room 15, Good location to Greenwich Cutty Sark Friendly helpful staff
298724,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Nothing, Another excellent stay at this exceptional Hotel staff are great nothing is too much for them Room very comfortable and quiet Ideal base for seeing London Bar is a great place to relax after a busy day Restaurant meals were very good I prefer fresh milk with my tea and I called room service on several occasions for fresh milk and more tea bags which was delivered within minutes great service 
298725,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Asked for a pizza with no tomatoes and it turned up with them on And asked for chocolate brownies and they didn t have any This was our 2nd stay here and we will return next year again but not sure if the same hotel , The beds were comfy
298726,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Our room 15 was immediately adjacent to the front entrance and we were disturbed by guests entering the building late The en suite wet room was very wet indeed By the time we had both showered the floor including the bath mat was swimming with water Also the lavatory lower seat squeaked loudly when lifted a problem shared with the adjacent room so presumably the occupants of that room were disturbed by us as we were by them , The outstanding plus feature was the pleasantness and efficiency of the staff at Reception and in the bar and Restaurant The food and service were all first class 
298727,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich,No Negative, Helpful friendly staff who dealt with my request for a room with a bath with thoughtfulness and efficiency Beautiful bathroom Very clean Complimentary bottles of water in room Nice restaurant reasonably priced good quality food Excellent breakfast buffet

298731,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Not easy to park noise from the Air Con units outside The room temperature was fixed to high, The location was good the staff were friendly The bar area looked inviting but didn t have time to try it out
298732,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, If you can be bothered to make the short trip from central London it s really worth it , In a fairly quiet location near Deptford DLR station A great alternative to central London big rooms with a pleasant view great breakfast and often very good value
298733,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich,No Negative, The room were lovely clean and comfy a relaxing place Enough room for me and my daughter Breakfast in the morning was delicious and such a good choice 
298734,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Nothing really , The building is very interesting a combination of styles Many of the old design features have been retained My fourth floor double room was quiet with windows that open and very cleverly designed felt much more spacious than it could have done with the same area Great shower But the best part utterly lovely staff Old fashioned politeness and modern style there too It feels like what it is an individual hotel within a network which keeps its standards high but keeps it from feeling one of a chain 
298735,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, For the price Nothing , The location was perfect for our few days in Greenwich Very lucky to get this lovely hotel at a very good price on booking com staff were excellent Breakfast very good Relaxing bar area 
298736,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Ordered breakfast in my room it was a little later than ordered and not as hot as it could have been No butter for the toast and no milk for the tea I m sure they would have been brought if I d have asked but had to leave early so no time , easy access to DLR very comfortable beds and great shower Fabulous views from the 8th floor worth upgrading to premium room for the little extras Staff can not do enough and are all very friendly 
298737,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, I ve stayed before however this room was tiny you literally couldn t swing a cat It was also on the LG floor which was a total faff as due to a wedding we couldn t use the lift so not only were we inconvenienced on getting to the room we then had noise No mini bar so had to order room service for 2 small soft drinks and we were charged 8 I will not be returning A shame as this was a return visit as my first was better but perhaps I was upgraded previously , The bed is comfortable and the bathroom is small but to a high spec 
298738,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, phoned receptionist and tried to ask her about a price list for the minibar but she could not understand what we were saying and did not bother to follow up and try and reply to our question She said she could not hear us on the phone but could have came up to the room to find out Breakfast was quite disappointing sadly , The room was very comfortable and had a great view It was a good location for the comedy club 
298739,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The room was very loud could hear everything and everyone Personal preference the mattress and pillows were too soft not firm enough , Decor was beautiful Extremely clean Good quality bed linen 
298740,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, In the bar there was food on the floor and tables were a bit dirty and a group of men were extremely loud and clearly drunk Ruined our last night there There was coffee pods for the machine but no hot chocolate pods to be fair there was Areo hot chocolate packs , Loved the cocktails and how polite the staff were to us Very exciting on the Monday night when police officers arrested a random man by the front desk Was on the top floor 806 and only learned by accident that there is a button to open the window 
298741,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Room was hot couldn t get the air conditioning to go cooler than 25 degrees But the window opened once I was shown how not obvious and the room got to a good temperature , Lovely food in the bar and restaurant Free wifi was useful 
298742,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Communication between staff could be better A couple of requests made in advance didn t happen although did get actioned promptly at point and time of delivery , Great value for quality accommodation in London
298743,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The noise of the air con fans Stay here 3 times before and parked my car with no problem and No cost This time I was charge 17 a day which I didn t find out till I got the bill when I was leaving,No Positive
298744,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, More details on the closest tube station make it easy to find and accurate , The welcome message on the TV of the room and how you can control the lights heating from the TV 
298745,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, From what I expected the room and bed were a little on the small size however they did the job perfectly didnt spend a whole lot of time in the hotel room itself though I would definitely stay there again , Beautiul lobby and stairwell Staff were second to none very accommodating and very helpful Anything they could do they did It was a pleasure to deal with them Due to engineering work n the tram lines we weren t sure on how to get to Pancras train station so asked for some advice they booked us very reasonable transport from the hotel no hesitation Then rearranged the time as I had given the wrong time for departure Again this was no issue at all The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable Could see the Greenwich observatory from our window which was a nice little bonus Also the bathroom was lovely 
298746,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The new memmber of Staff need to practice them English and learn the basics of customer handling which is first listening and understanding customer Visited hotel before and trained member of restaurant and bar staff on open up As advicer the Prestige of the Hotel now is well below 4 I remember when the hotel opened up bartenders trained to serve drinks and they were well spoken You can see picture of training bartender on website and also on pc , Well located and placed in a particular position 
298747,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Room could have been warmer Even on highest heating a little chilly , I stay here whenever I have the need to This stay was due to building works happening at home within 2 mile of the hotel The staff have been accommodating to my needs and my changing timelines 
298748,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Room at 1 are not very much recommendable Shower didn t work properly because the shower head was covered with lome and the beam didn t focus Was very difficult to have a shower Staff was notified but nothing happened No plummer no other room ,No Positive

298754,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, No shoe shine machine , Good breakfast polite staff large rooms newly equipped The hotel is close to the DLR 5 min walk max In the first room I was checked in there was a water leak and a water was dropping from the ceiling However this can happen everywhere and I was quickly given another room and a drink voucher so over this was sort of a plus 
298755,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, room just wouldent get to the tempture we needed and was stuck at 21 degrees also was noise coming from fans outside, The overall hotel was fantastic looked stylish room was lovley and clean
298756,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Usual Tower Block with paper thin room walls guests next door were watching TV at 03 00 and you can hear every word And how can the maids yell out housekeeping while knocking thunderously on the opposite door at 08 45 while they are stood right in front of a Do Not Disturb sign That tells you far more about what ACCOR think of their customers than any marketing puff , Modern well appointed 4 docklands hotel and restaurant excellent value for money at 85 B B
298757,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, We didn t like the see through bathroom door very bizarre It was a small twin room and the bathroom was right opposite the beds we had to hide around the corner when one of us was in the loo or shower Also it was a sliding door which didn t really shut properly so absolutely no privacy or soundproofing The bathroom is the reason why I won t be staying in a Mercure again which is a shame as apart from that it s a fab hotel , The staff were very friendly and welcoming We were on the 6th floor and had a fabulous view across London 
298758,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich,No Negative, Everything hotel staff very friendly nothing to much trouble it was my husbands birthday while we were there and they brought a piece of cake with happy birthday on the plate rooms were excellent so we re the meals no complaints at all

298765,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Nothing, Staff extremely helpful my room was on the 9th floor so had an excellent view over London Comfortable bed shower easy to use and hot As a lone female traveller can often feel intimidated having a drink in a bar or dinning alone but I felt very comfortable and the staff could not have been more friendly and kind I thoroughly enjoyed my 2 night stay would definitely recommend this Hotel 
298766,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Shower head immovable and positioned to shoot straight out of cubicle Also the glass door to bathroom a bit unusual , Lovely hotel with welcoming front of house staff 
298767,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Nothing but only used it as a base for a works Christmas party so can t comment on the broader facilities , Small but modern and clean room with all the facilities you need Really close to the DLR station 
298768,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The room was not properly cleaned or dusted in the period I was there Stuff were just skirting through They just did the beds and changed towels but did not properly clean rooms It was dusty Lack of parking facilities is an issue The room is really cramped , The breakfast staff was very friendly and made you feel welcome 
298769,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Confusion over the booking booking com had me staying on 2nd December a no show so you can imagine my sheer panic when I turned up at 10 30 at night to find they didn t have me booked in this was not their error I however have been charged twice so not happy,No Positive
298770,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Bar prices were generally too high Charging over 2 for a lemon dash is totally over the top Breakfast was a service disaster on both mornings continually running out of food Coffee machine a joke, Quality of the rooms although a little small good modern rooms and welcoming bar area 
298771,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Little chaotic at breakfast but if you heed the notices they do tell you when are busy times to avoid if you want a quiet breakfast or have it in your room , Everything It is a stunning building with super friendly and helpful staff Our room was amazing with a fantastic view and lots of extras thrown in Food was good and reasonably priced including room service Highly recommended 
298772,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, I love cooked breakfast the only time I eat one is in hotels This one had no flavour I am used to quality bacon and tasty eggs but this breakfast had neither Bread was good and a good selection of other choices Unfortunately they also continuously ran out of mugs and eggs etc They topped up things that didn t require it but left people waiting for other items , Reasonable room high up with a good view of London and good DLR connections
298773,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Breakfast in the morning was a good selection but the staff were not quick enough filling up and there was a lot of waiting around for more Also waiting for breakfast bowls on both mornings of our visit , Room was excellent Very roomy very comfortable bed and pillows Lovely decoration and comfort D cor comfort throughout the hotel was excellent 
298774,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Further than expected from 02 Took 1 hour to walk back from 02 to hotel Fresh milk for tea is so much nicer than UHT milk Would have liked a better lock on door, Comfy bed Polite helpful staff
298775,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Nachos ordered in return to hotel were literally a packet of nachos eith scattered cheese Not particularly appertizing or tasty , Clean modern comfortable centric
298776,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The only complaint was the fire exit door was right outside our room and the door closure wasn t soft enough therefore we were disturbed each time someone came through the doors as they banged shut We did report this on checking out at reception , The location was great for us close enough to the travel links to travel into central London and Woolwich where our son is living hence the reason for the visit 
298777,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Design of bathroom terrible ask staff Door handle screws loose Safe temperamental wine offer available but no red wine madness Check roasted veg I doubt they are Would not return Breakfast cereal dispensers should be emptied before filling with a different cereal , Very pleasant staff which smoothed the manny niggles 
298778,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, We weren t really greeted when we arrived which was late and so we were weary and a friendly greeting wouldn t have gone a miss We had trouble with our access cards to our room The bathroom door was frosted glass which was not appropriate for a twin room And made the stay a little uncomfortable and awkward to say the least The view from the window was awful and we could hear the loud A C outside our window when we opened it which was annoying , The hotel itself was lovely It was a little tricky finding the main entrance The breakfast staff were very friendly The room was small but sufficient 
298779,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Had my appointment changed and asked for the day to be moved back 270 00 for 1 room One week before arriving They were going to put the cancelled room up at full value So this meant I lost all my money and they wanted me to pay 270 00 plus they would get the booking for my cancelled night Getting paid 3 times When I call customer service were so arrogant This is what makes Britain Great Poor service Poor customer relations Still waiting for my money back under the long distance selling laws Please share , Nothing 
298780,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Attitude of customer service with the hotel and booking com who just want your money, Had my appointment changed and asked for the day to be moved back 270 00 for 1 room One week before arriving They were going to put the cancelled room up at full value So this meant I lost all my money and they wanted me to pay 270 00 plus they would get the booking for my cancelled night Getting paid 3 times When I call customer service were so arrogant This is what makes Britain Great Poor service Poor customer relations Still waiting for my money back under the long distance selling laws Please share
298781,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The only downfall was the noise from the hallway as our room was on the ground floor near the doors to the car park I did make a comment to reception in the morning and they were very apologetic , The room was spacious and comfortable very clean perfect The staff were very respectful friendly and very helpful Breakfast had a varied selection some as a buffet and some cooked to order 
298782,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Only thing I didn t like was the size of our room on our second visit bit small , I loved everything about the hotel most especially where it s based in the heart of Greenwich

298785,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The air conditioning unit was outside our room The noise was unbearable and the room was very hot and the windows don t open I think the lady who booked us in knew about the noise I did mention in the morning and was told that it is sometimes very loud , The house is modern and clean Nice bedrooms and good on suite 
298786,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Our bedroom was located on lower ground floor and we found we could hear the plumbing noises of people using showers and running water and being light sleepers we didn t particularly sleep well Also when checking out we felt there should have been a member of staff dedicated to dealing with that and another member of staff answering telephone as we had to wait quite a while for them to finish on telephone before attending to us , Lounge area and dining facilities were very comfortable Staff friendly and courteous 
298787,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The room wasn t ideal it had a tiny window and felt small and claustrophobic It was located near a door which when left would close noisily sounding like someone was knocking a at our door at 7 30am , The staff were very friendly and very helpful 
298788,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Requested room near lift and they assumed I was disable and had walk in shower but room was on GF by reception too noisey Staff quickly changed for me which I was grateful however as I entered the room it had unpleasant smell as the bathroom toilet had no ventilation Bedroom also was blocked off with brickwall which was depressing Disappointed as last stay I was extremely pleased Hope they don t only treat first time guests well Gym was basement and as you enter the floor it smells of heavy dampness Gym treadmill inclined but couldn t come back down TV worked immitenently but no sound , The cleanliness the staff attitude is fantastic Parking availability on site 
298789,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, I was given a very poor room as I was on my own and an oap I complained was then given an excellent room Window in first room was so high I required to stand on a chair to see out it was cell Breakfast expensive and very average, Bar dining very good
298790,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Location is not very convenient to center of Greenwich Front desk concierge was helpful but didn t provide all information necessary eg bought river bus tickets from hotel but was not informed that we still needed to wait in line receive actual tickets from river bus terminal Also was disappointed with inflexibility to meet our needs for free transportation to U2 concert , Hotel is lovely very modern and clean Amenities are nice in room coffee tea beverages breakfast room service and lounge Housekeeping staff responsive with requests

298798,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, When my ground mother had emergency situation to need to hire or borrow wheelchair one staff gave me a number of Red Cross but nothing more than that I heard the case of the great support from my friend who had same situation in London In that case hotel staff tried to find how to deal with this problem and prepare a wheelchair for her injured mother So that I was disappointed with my situation as a four stars hotel , The rooms were really clean and comfortable to stay The location is also not bad to go city centre of Greenwich and to go sightseeing around there 
298799,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Location is far from ideal if catching public transport in and out of central London approx 1 hour each way via DLR and Tube , Impressive hotel with fantastic rooms and great facilities

298809,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, The bathroom is a bit compact for the design and scale of the hotel but it s a small gripe in what was otherwise a great stay , Super comfortable bed Much quieter location than the hotels in the centre of Greenwich which are all on a road and or next to the train line Great views from the 8th floor room 
298810,Doubletree By Hilton London Greenwich, Did not like being downstairs had asked for an upstairs room someone knocked on our window during the night which was disturbing We paid 5 for breakfast the first day and 7 50 the second day Same breakfast Why , Lovely large room very clean and liked the decor and furniture Comfy sofa
