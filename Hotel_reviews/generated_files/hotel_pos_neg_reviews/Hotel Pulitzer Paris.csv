116793,Hotel Pulitzer Paris,No Negative, Location Ambience Service are superb We were greeted by friendly and helpful personnel minimal fuss around the reservation and a cute tidy and comfortable room Then there is the lobby designed like a Library with a fireplace in the back like a gentleman s club in front And one of the best features It is in the middle of Paris walking distance from the Louvre If you arrive at the train station you can ride the Metro for about 3 Euros per person it s 2 or 3 stations 
116794,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, The wifi was rather slow and picky , This hotel has a great location within 20 min walking distance to Gare du Nord and Gare Est or 5 minutes by metro and within walking distance to Louvre Many good restaurants and bars in close vicinity Very helpful and friendly staff The rooms have a simple yet tasteful decor very spacious bathroom with rain water shower Mini bar Given the location it s really good value for the money Please be aware that breakfast is not included in most rooms and is 18 extra 
116795,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, it was a great value for money nothing more can be said except the rooms as small as you would expect in any Parisian hotel, It had the perfect character and charm for a four day stay 
116796,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Nothing special do not forget that almost all hotels in Paris are relatively small, Very nice room 503 although in front of the hotel facing the road it was very quite something very important to me design very modern staff friendly breakfast better than expected
116797,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, There was no name on the premises and I had to ask passers bye if they could tell me where no 23 was I had actually asked two gentlemen who were exiting the property , Everything Suite was excellent spacious and comfortable Bed was extremely comfortable and everything was absolutely spotless 
116798,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, The entrance is pretty dark, The staff the room with the excellent shower was all great In regard to other hotel I stayed inparis the room size was good The location was super l I will suggest to my friends to stay here 
116799,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, This was undergoing renovations which I was not told about This included concrete dust from the build everywhere in the air black dirty dust sheets up lights out in the hallway next to my room ,No Positive
116800,Hotel Pulitzer Paris,No Negative, Great location near metro near patisseries restaurants Lovely bedroom very comfy bed new upgraded bathroom very helpful and friendly staff 
116801,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Dark black no fun , It has been renovation so it was not pleasant I couldn t have eal all day and arrived afre a long journey but room service closed by 11 30pm only a banana The bed was good but room was dark 
116802,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, It s not a complain but check in time is 3 pm which in my opinion very late , Beautiful hotel with great service Rooms are spacious and comfortable The location of the hotel is fantastic Breakfast is great 
116803,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, The check in which too long asking for the same info even if I stay in this hotel regularly the noisy and outdated heating system , The location the showroom
116804,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Some minor DIY being done on the building next door Nothing the hotel can do about that but woke us up earlier than we d have liked , Fantastic hotel all round Location was easy to find and really handy for Paris metro Cadet and Grand Boulevards stops are very close Hotel was stylish and spotlessly clean and the breakfast was a great start to the days we were there Very glad we chose to stay at Hotel Pulitzer 
116805,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, small room but in line with Paris standard a modern shower will let earning very good feedback, excellent breakfast included in the room rate nice design style position friendly staff
116806,Hotel Pulitzer Paris,No Negative, Great location Staff was very nice good and varied breakfast Nice lobby and free welcome glass of wine at the bar Wi fi worked well 2 minutes from a metro stasion a lot of places to eat and drink Club room was very comfortable Will stay again 
116807,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, The rooms and stairs are a bit narrow but that is everywhere in central Paris , It s a really great place to stay in Paris Very close to convinient metro station The personal is helpful and the food for breakfast is just awesome 
116808,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, General service and the co operation of the manager as I had notified them prior of change of check in time Yet at the end of my stay I was still charged the extra night that I was not at the hotel , I liked the decor 
116809,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Beds stuck together when I asked not to have that Overpriced tea , I had asked specifically for twin beds for two people non couple And still we ended up in a tiny room with twin beds stuck together as a double bed which I did not want That was frustrating Cup of tea with a tea bag worth about 40 cents was five euros crazy Otherwise loved it 
116810,Hotel Pulitzer Paris,No Negative, Breakfast is excellent many types of fruits savory and sweet choices for main course enjoyed the hot chocolate The ambient temperature within the hotel is comfortable Location is perfect near to Metro station and walking distance to many tourist attractions
116811,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, On the first day the lift was being repaired so we had to use the stairs They re dark and twisty I wouldn t want to use them as a fire exit , Good location near Metro Monoprix and Chartier s restaurant Friendly and helpful staff bathroom clean with novelty basin Excellent buffet breakfast Marriage Freres teabags good value for money 
116812,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Room size, Smallest rooms i have ever seen but everything else is is good Not the typical aria for tourists but cosy if you like to walk around and experience more then chalms ellyse etc The staff was good and cosy lobby 
116813,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, the toiliet in my room smells wired and the breakfast was not perfect, the staffs were very nice and helpful good location very easy to get access to shopping area and attractions cosy lobby 
116814,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, The lobby and staircases were too dark , The hotel is located in a great neighbor and in a walking distance from many shops restaurants and cafes Room and bathroom were clean and spacious Staff were very friendly and helpful Breakfast is excellent 
116815,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Guest room not carpeted drinking water no replenish , 3rd time stay in this hotel overall still happy with this hotel friendly services and clean room 
116816,Hotel Pulitzer Paris,No Negative, Great location closer to Seine River closer to Louvre Notre Dame Royal Palace Sacre Coeur Easy acces to main metro and train station Very clean and quiet place great for relax and sleep after a visiting day in Paris Friendly staff and very good services 
116817,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, The staff was friendly but most of the staff was young and unexperienced The breakfast did not meet my expectations for a 4 star hotel as the croissants and cakes weren t fresh , Nice interior decoration clean and comfortable rooms Service minded staff 
116818,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, The rooms are on the small side but so are most in Paris , Very friendly staff great breakfast quiet rooms a great place to stay and excellent value for money in Paris
116819,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Unfortunately the bathroom s flush wouldn t work the first night They couldn t fix it but we were able to use the toilet down in the lounge area The next day they immediately fixed the flush so it wasn t a problem for the rest of the weekend Also the pillows are a tad lumpy but the bed is fantastically comfortable , Hotel is a quiet refuge from the hustle and bustle of the neighborhood Hotel amenities also inspire serious interior design goals especially their public lounge library areas Staff were courteous through all hours of the day and night Our rooms were always clean and smelled pleasantly of citrus Breakfast was included and energized us before we tackled the city 
116820,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, We had our stuff everywhere in the room the rooms were smaller than we had expected I also don t know why there is no logo or name of the hotel outside If you can t find the hotel like us notice it from the black sun blinds , The staff was really friendly we felt welcomed When you enter the hotel there is this refreshing smell I loved it And not to mention the detox water they serve you in the lobby 
116821,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Rooms are depressingly small and worn out Elevator going to rooms ending in x11 and x12 has such a small space that a small family of three with their suite cases do not fit in Stairs and corridors are terribly narrow and not air conditioned , Lobby is beautiful Rooms are air conditioned and quite Food in the hotel is very good 
116822,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, The complementary glass of wine The lounge area is lovely and relaxing and we definitely would have loved to enjoy a glass or two in the hotel surroundings except the bar is relatively unmanned And the choice of beverage is questionable , The breakfast was a treat The rooms were very clean and comfortable Such a quiet location and in close proximity to a number of good restaurants 
116823,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Hotel main entrance is not eye catching If you are walking and finding the hotel it is easy to miss it The hotel lobby ambiance is designed and decorated with dull color feels like lack of brightness Service personnel are friendly smiley face but not very fluent in English Guest rooms facing the main street maybe disturb by noise from the street rear guest rooms are relatively quiet, Locate in the 9th neighborhood of Paris 15 30 minutes walking distance from the Opera or the Louvre surrounded by few supermarkets coffee shops Chinese restaurants French restaurants and bars feels safe staying outside of the area nearby hotel Rooms are clean very comfortable toiletries and bathrobes are provided there is a mini fridge tea coffee making facilities and air conditioning in the room the only drawback is no carpeted 
116824,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Breakfast was not of 4 star standard very small and dark corridors Rooms were not spacious Charged EUR 20 extra for my kid who was only 3 1 2 year old , Location was very good Rooms were clean and staff was friendly 
116825,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Would appreciate freshly squeezed orange juice , Excellent location great value for money Fully worthy of the 4 stars Breakfast included in the price was standard but fully statisfying 
116826,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, We were told ther was an elevator to all floors when i contacted the hotel prior to booking Untrue There is none to the breakfast area When booking com contacted them to seek a refund of our breakfast charge they lied again saying we had not asked for an elevator This is quite upsetting as i am not able to use steps due to a disability , Room and barhroom very clean
116827,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, The room supposedly came with a city view but I had a view into other rooms My room was directly by the fire escape The bed was less comfy than I would expect of a 4 star hotel Quite hard mattress The Standard room was very small and I was missing a bedside table , The breakfast was really good the staff were very pleasant and helpful Nice to have a bath although small and air conditioning Location was great 
116828,Hotel Pulitzer Paris,No Negative, Clean rooms genial staff Breakfast provides The hotel is accessible to all sites Near Metro And walk fifteen minutes to half an hour at well known locations
116829,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Sub par breakfast , Great ambience and concept I enjoyed the wine hour and the rooms were comfortablr and clean The bathrooms were very clean and also larger than average in France The AC worked very well and adjusted quickly as well The breakfast was a little sub par for the price but that was the only down side Decent location would recommend 
116830,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, I got my normal room just from the second time First it was smelling room under the roof And my early morning taxi costs 40 per 5km It was a private driver and so on But I don t asked about this I wanted just a usual taxi but have no time to wait anymore and solved this , Good location Design of the rooms Quite good breakfast 
116831,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Beds slid around the floor very easily Rooms were a little small but that s not unusual for such a good downtown location , Great helpful service Excellent breakfast Location convenient to many restaurants Nice walk in shower 
116832,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Hotel needs renovation doors in interior toilet in the room were really uncomfortable No view at all Quite noisy street , Staff is absolutely helpful and nice Each approach was fulfiled immediately and with human participation We stayed in club room on special offer and room was really big on Paris scale 
116833,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, No on site restaurant but that did make me go out and explore and I found the best French Bistro not 50 yards away , The euro s were on so difficult to gauge the value for money the staff were excellent though and the free glass of Chablis slipped down very well I would definitely recommend this place 
116834,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, I received a key to a room that was already occupied thehall ways are too dark the KitKat in the mini bar was half eaten my room key stopped working as it was held against my phone the complimentary cookies soaked the napkins they were on with grease , breakfast
116835,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, On Sunday we were told the bar didn t open which seems silly when it is such a lovely bar space They really don t make enough of this area It s a missed commercial opportunity , The style of the hotel was stunning the public space on the ground floor was lovely 
116836,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Got downgraded as they overbooked the superior category we originally paid for Reduced fee significantly though as compensation , Great breakfast stylish hotel 
116837,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, The bathroom had a dampish smell due to small leak at base of toilet, Breakfast choice super Enjoyed welcome glass of wine Majority of staff very pleasant Good shower
116838,Hotel Pulitzer Paris,No Negative, It was our 2d visit here We liked everything The stuff is very helpfull and friendly The room we had was very nice designed and comfortable Bed is very comfortable Breakfast is excellent they also have BIO products Tea and kettle in the room Mini bar The lobby is so beuatiful The hotel and bathroom is perfectly clean Not as in the most Parisian hotels Perfect location walking distance to everywhere you want to see in the central Paris 5 min to the Metro aprox 30 min walking to the train station A lot of restaturants around shopping gallery in 2 min Highly reccomended Will come back definitely 
116839,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, The lift to the 2nd building is claustrophobic evidently a former lift for goods not for people passengers , Good design breakfast staff equipments 
116840,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Nothing But if I really had to point out one thing it might be the perfume in the foyer of the hotel it s really Parisien but maybe too strong for some people But this is just a minor minor thing , The breakfast is great the bed was great the location is superb the staff is very nice and they all speak English the metro is close it s just one of the best hotels we have ever been to There are a lot of great restaurants nearby Make sure you checkout Nick s Pizza 1st pizza place in the city across the street and the restaurant Chartier down the street it s a superb experience We had room 511 at the top floor which is amazing 
116841,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, The lobby was dark Corridors inside hotel were dark and dingy Rooms were too small and flooring was bare cement bathroom was small and wc was leaking for 2 days before it was set right Over charged for breakfast 18 Euro per person when most hotels charged 10 Euro for an average fare with just fruit cereal toast some eggs Did not allow us to delink breakfast from room rent when we wanted to stop b fast They provide 2 small bottles of water on day 1 and then onwards charge 5 euro per 1 2 litre bottle Outrageous We bought a 2 litre bottle from Carrefour for 22 cents Furniture was made of iron and plain and noisy when moved Just wanted to have the breakfast and get out of the hotel and return only at night totally fagged out to worry about the room Indian hotels are far far far better in terms of rooms service and rates Paris hotels suck for the price they charge , Only plus point was the location of the hotel close to major sights and museums and close to restaurants 
116842,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Hopefully the hotel has more promotions The breakast was expensive, The room even small was comfortable The location is great The neighborhood is nice and safe 
116843,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, It would have been nice to enjoy a cocktail in the bar lounge area when returning from dinner but it closed at 10pm having said that there are plenty of great bars near by , From the moment we arrived the staff were extremely helpful and considerate Our room was fabulous the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was lovely The breakfast buffet was super and the style of the bar area and reception was super it was only a shame we did t get to enjoy that area Close by is the Bouillon Chartier Restaurant which a a fabulous dining experience not the best food in the world but incredible value for money in a fantastic setting 
116844,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, The rooms did not smell clean and their was wee on the floor in the bathroom We could not get an iron or ironing board when we requested it and the staff were not the friendliest , Breakfast was great the lobby was amazing and really comfortable to sit in 
116845,Hotel Pulitzer Paris,No Negative, I asked if I could leave my bags prior to check in they went above and beyond by check in us in at 10am instead of 2pm which meant we could get a little rest before a long day of sightseeing
116846,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, There is practically NO hotelbar the rooms are small and there is some sort of mechanism that doesnt allows you to keep the bathroom door open , breakfast was good organised and staff was very friendly and helpful
116847,Hotel Pulitzer Paris,No Negative, Very good value for money location is central rooms are relatively small but to be expected Clean and safe and courteous staff Very good breakfast was included in our room rate
116848,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, When you make the reservation with Booking com ensure you bring the printout of the booking and payment information The staff tried to tell me I did not pay for the room and showed the staff the credit card charge Check out took at least 10 minutes , The free breakfast was wonderful You will not be able to check in prior to 2pm They will hold you luggage in a secure room until you return 
116849,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Little gripe as we never had Milk in the room although we had tea making facilities , Contemporary Chic and quiet breakfast was very adequate a good choice Safe in the room the staff were very friendly and helpful good Wi Fi connection 
116850,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Rooms are very small Do not prefer standard room it is not as seen as in photos I suggest you to pay an extra for a deluxe room There were stain on bath towels Hallway to the rooms are very dark and a bit scary black painted walls and floor with dark red carpet , Free wifi Very understanding and helpful staff Rich breakfast Good location
116851,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, The lobby war really nice and we would like to get a glass of wine but the bar was not open in the evening , Good location friendly staff comfortable bed 
116852,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Felt a bit spooked going to my room on top floor due to dark interior and lights being off, Close to where i needed to be Solid room though bit small with nice bathroom Great breakfast 
116853,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, I found blood in my bed sheet I had to change my bed myself and was told the day after that the cleaning lady had cut her finger I was not offered a compensation,No Positive
116854,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, The rooms were quite small And there was no door on the shower so the water sprayed onto the bathroom floor everytime you took a shower , We loved the boutique style of this hotel The staff were very helpful friendly The location was good only a 20 minute walk from the city centre 
116855,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Maybe the shower could be better Otherwise a very nice room , The hotel atmosphere was very pleasant and quiet with decor that was cozy and inviting The complimentary glass of wine was a nice touch The staff was very professional and helpful The bed was very comfortable and I also enjoyed the chocolates on the pillows A very nice hotel 
116856,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Room quite small but average size in Paris where everything is small Bed is highly improvable Mattress is old and not very confy pillow too low for me Pressure in the shower is REALLY low , Excelent Location People at the front desk are friently and very useful Very good breakfast 
116857,Hotel Pulitzer Paris,No Negative, Me and my best friend stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and it was absolutely amazing Cozy and very clean Location was great metro station was very close Personal also VERY nice Breakfast was delicious 
116858,Hotel Pulitzer Paris,No Negative, Feel so comfortable and relax The room is not so big but enough for two people It s clean and quiet and easy to go anywhere The breakfast is nice too 
116859,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, The lift is indeed too small for a hotel of this category two people maximum and could do with a renovation , Location friendly and helpful staff Amazingly quiet room we slept with the window open with parquet floor Wonderful choice at breakfast Wi Fi worked very well and there was a good range of TV channels 
116860,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Refurbishment could have been of better quality in the rooms It is not up to the level of the lobby Breakfast room is too small , Excellent location with a spacious room Good choice of food for breakfast and there s a nice style to the hotel 
116861,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, The walls are all dark grey to black It s very hip I m sure but not my taste The hallways are dark at night and hard to see The elevator for the back rooms barely fits 2 people The breakfast room is in the basement no windows dark walls , The room was large for Paris The bathroom was outfitted beautifully and the bed was very comfortable We were at the back of the hotel so it was quiet no street noise The breakfast was pretty good plenty of choices 
116862,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, The hotel towels and robes definitely need to be changed as they were greying and not suitable for any hotel and definitely not for a 4 , Location was excellent Busy and upbeat during the day and very quiet at night The hotel lobby smelled divine and staff were very helpful at all times 
116863,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, We asked staff to book a taxi and the guy used his mobile rather than the hotel phone Taxi turned up 15 mins late and already had 17 euro on the meter as he said that s when we called and that was the rule He didn t know how to get to where we wanted to go and we ended up being dropped off and walk as the bill was increasing We felt ripped and the hotel staff had called his mate Don t get the hotel to order you a taxi , Quite an industrial feel to the rooms but not creepy or cold Not too far from the metro Breakfast was quite good although the room was a little tight and you have to wait a while for the coffee queue
116864,Hotel Pulitzer Paris,No Negative, The Hotel is quite pleasant In case it would be needed it has to be noted that there are comfortable spots in case of one to one meetings Position is good and personnel very helpful Recommended 
116865,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, The breakfast could be improved especially for guests from the uk Maybe add bacon , We were upgraded for free as it was my birthday The room was very comfortable and the reception area very cosy 
116866,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, The room was so small that I ve never seen such a small room the bed was not for 2 persons the floor was painted concrete the furniture something from old army depot or something like that I find it incredible that this hotel is rated 4 stars it isn t , M Jannis the staff member at reception during nights
116867,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, I had borrowed an umbrella from the hotel and left in the room when I checked out They claim that they can t find the umbrella and are charging me 20 Euros for it , I liked the location and thought the hotel was okay in terms of the central areas etc My room was a bit on the small side and hallways are a bit dusty 
116868,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, I was booking for a group all of whom had to pay for their own accommodation on departure I had a number of issues explaining this to Booking com and had to provide my credit card to cover all rooms There were too many people that I dealt with instead od one person dealing with my booking I had to explain the situation to a different person each time The bedrooms were very small and felt a bit like a prison cell black surround to the bed and grey walls The rooms were very noisy if another guest flushed the toilet or had a shower the pipes would make an awful noise , The communal areas of the hotel were nice
116869,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Rooms are small but that is the standard in Paris , Good location and well connected by metro subway in a walking distance to the major stores very silent hotel and room very clean very good double bed very friendly and helpful staff very nice breakfast buffet airco heating in the room 
116870,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, I have stayed here many times and it always brilliant the staff are great but i was disappointed with the room very small i stay here 10 12 times year so would recommend and i will always come back here just hope the room is better next time Best wishes Rob ,No Positive
116871,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, The room was very small everything is black and the furniture is made of metal We had the same breakfast for 6 days not much variety 3 types of cheese 3 types of salami vegetables only tomatoes I asked for mustard and they told me they don t have , Good location 
116872,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Towels in the bathroom didn t look fresh For 4 star hotel I expected flowers in the room on my first day or at least on my birthday Also the TV remote didn t work well , Breakfast was very good Reception very helpful and friendly Very nice ambiance and interior 
116873,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, The only down side was a leak in the shower room under the shower which should have been reported by the chamber maid , Staff very welcoming and helpful good location for access to the metro station Lots of places to eat wide choice of cuisines Good breakfasts 
116874,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Rooms were overpriced for the size especially the twin room no hot water at all on the checkout day as system broke down I am in the hotel business and we would have offered a guest another night 50 off rates for this inconvenience Bad PR No milk in fridge and twin beds very small, The decor in the main lobby and ground level and the breakfast also the staff at the desk Very good decor
116875,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Room resembled a prison cell concrete walls and floor Didn t feel warm at all Hotel doesn t seem to have it s own restaurant and room service was delivered by someone external delivered on plastic plates Still had to pay a regular price 14 starter 18 main , Lobby is nice and cosy 
116876,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, The safe did not work in the room and the shower pipe came out of the wall the staff were quick to upgrade us to a larger more comfortable room , Friendly and helpful staff the reception area 
116877,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, One thing I found in my room was that there wasn t a mirror in the actual room We had a full length one and a big one above the sink but both in the bathroom so when my friend was in there I couldn t use the mirror The room was fairly small but having looked on other reviews I think that s quite normal for Paris there wasn t a great deal of space to walk round the bed and the bath wouldn t be able to be used as a bath by an adult but if like us it was just a base to go exploring then it didn t cause us any problems , When the taxi pulled into our street it did look a tad dodgy but don t let that make you think anything is dodgy about the hotel There s a metro station only about a minute walk away hotel throughout was clean and well kept bedroom spotless staff more than helpful each time we asked them to suggest good restaurants great selection at breakfast and food constantly topped up loved the free glass of wine on the night we arrived 
116878,Hotel Pulitzer Paris,No Negative, Very friendly staff good advice given about restaurants transportation etc Very clean hotel over all room extremely quiet in the middle of Paris A home away from home definitely will come again and will highly recommend 
116879,Hotel Pulitzer Paris, Please be noticed the FREE WINE only once even though you living for a long period I have extended the room to 10 days but the HOTEL did not mention it still only ONE FREE WINE during your stay , Breakfast is good wifi is fast in general but we works in midnight the upload speed is a little bit slow please ignore it if you are not using network in the midnight
