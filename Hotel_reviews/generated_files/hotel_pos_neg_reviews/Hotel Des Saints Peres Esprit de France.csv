229221,Hotel Des Saints Peres Esprit de France,No Negative, Precious historical small hotel on left bank St Germaine de Pres close to cafes shops and neighborhood feel Staff is personable garden area is lovely 
229222,Hotel Des Saints Peres Esprit de France, Just leave it as it is please, This is a traditional small hotel in Paris in a fantastic position just off boulevard saint Germaine Intimate setting and caring staff 
229223,Hotel Des Saints Peres Esprit de France, NOWHERE on the Booking com information on this hotel is it noted that the Junior Suite is THREE flights up a steep staircase with no elevator The hotel claims to have air conditioning but it was on only on the ground floor The staff kept saying it was broken and would be fixed but than changed their statement to say it wasn t on yet But it was on just not in the rooms We had to keep the windows open for air no fans and could see directly into the bedrooms and baths across the way And those guests could see into our room It was a most unpleasant stay It was our fifth time and our last Breakfast service was incredibly slow only one waiter for a full house so we had to sit at tables with used cloths and limited dishes and wait a very long time for coffee The cooked food was inedible The croissants were good bread not , Our third room was adequate in size finally 
229224,Hotel Des Saints Peres Esprit de France, Nothing really, I liked the general atmosphere of the hotel at the heart of Saint Germain des Pres It is a kind of boutique hotel with green spaces inside situated of one of the narrow streets in the area Very close to main boulevard Plenty of shops and cafe restaurants nearby Very professional staff Rooms are not big but very comfortable with a modern bathroom Breakfast may seem expensive but food is very fresh and good 
229225,Hotel Des Saints Peres Esprit de France, N A, The staff is very pleasant and helpful they went out of their way to provide us with directions restaurant suggestions and general travel plans Would highly recommend the Hotel Des Saints Peres 
229226,Hotel Des Saints Peres Esprit de France, The room was small exceptionally hot I didn t feel it was great value for money although very nice The area while nice was quiet although only a 10 minute walk to some life As a young couple I would have preferred somewhere more vibrant , Lovely bathroom very clean and great staff
229227,Hotel Des Saints Peres Esprit de France, the rooms could have been a little bigger there was hardly any room to store our suitcase , The staff were charming and helpful and the rooms were beautifully appointed 
229228,Hotel Des Saints Peres Esprit de France, It was wonderful We did not get the breakfast because we wanted to remain flexible and thought the price was high I m glad we made that decision however it looked very nice and it would have been nice to interact with the staff and other guests a bit more if we had , Charming hotel lovely design great staff 
229229,Hotel Des Saints Peres Esprit de France, My work laptop couldn t connect to the wifi because it had a pop up blocker installed which meant that I could not access my emails None of the staff knew how to help me with this and they were unable to connect me with someone who could help It made working in hotel impossible which was quite problematic given that this was a business trip In addition our first room has a ventilation problem in the bathroom which caused smells from other bathrooms in the building to waft into our bedroom When we raised the issue the staff kindly upgraded us to another room where the bathroom was very nice and had no smell Finally the shower door was not properly sealed and water seeped out during a shower causing a pool of water to form on the tile floor and soaking the bath mat Aside from those three issues which were relatively minor the room and the hotel was very nice , The location was ideal It s close walking distance to everything in St Germain The street is quiet and the room doesn t get noise from outside The bedroom had sufficient closet space The staff were friendly and welcoming The bed was comfortable Overall a great choice of hotel for us despite a few minor drawbacks 
229230,Hotel Des Saints Peres Esprit de France, No complaints at all , The team at the hotel are all friendly The hotel itself is old and quirky Each room is different and has antique furniture in it Most are away from the road so are very quiet It s simply lovely
