434602,Gallery Hotel, nothing, the stuff was very polite and helpful the room was as expected and described the breakfast was very good even if it had limited options the property is close to many stations bus and metro and therefore easy to go around music and dancing events have been taking place while we where there 
434603,Gallery Hotel, The swimming pool was a little small ok for the children as long as no more than 6 or 7 people were in it at the same time Strangely the cleaners did not bother to remove used glasses and the bathroom wasn t always fully cleaned , The rooms were a generous size and well equipped there were toothbrushes and razors along with the hairdryer gowns slippers etc The bar on the top was fun with friendly staff serving good food and drinks Also the gym and sauna were a nice added bonus 
434604,Gallery Hotel, The pool was very shallow and no where near long enough and the fitness centre could do with having heavier weights The tea in the room was replaced enough either but apart from that the hotel was fantastic Will definitely recommend , The staff were amazing and very caring The airport had lost our luggage and the receptionists offered to take care of everything to help find the suitcase When the suitcase turned up they were just as happy as we were The beds were very comfy the View was exceptional The bathroom was very clean and modernised 
434605,Gallery Hotel, For a weeks stay I was given a tiny room not enough space to unpack all clothes Worse still window opening onto inner yard view onto other rooms covered by a glass roof No fresh air I left after one night went to another hotel This was my 5th stay at this hotel booked well in advance I don t feel like going back again,No Positive
434606,Gallery Hotel, The staff around the pool and the pool restaurant did nothing to manage some very obnoxious children and teenagers in the pool We literally couldn t even sit in our son chairs and get some sun because these children super so poorly behaved and were splashing water and other guests The staff clearly should ve manage this and did not The pool area is also very short on lounge chairs and there are too many tables for food and beverage that are just not being used This whole experience really makes the pool area of no value , Desk staff were very helpful 
434607,Gallery Hotel, Small room without air and window to the wall If you open the window it s still impossible to breath because it s closed inside Awful night I couldn t sleep and it s spoiled everything This is what you get for 188 euro , Nothing
434608,Gallery Hotel, Absence of pegs in the bathroom No mirror in the entrance hall could have been attached to the door of the wardrobe which did not allow to store a dress too short for this , Very helpful and attentive staff
434609,Gallery Hotel, There was nothing that disappointed us , The staff at the reception desk and in the bar and the restaurant were very courteous helpful and friendly The buffet breakfast was expansive in choices and was delicious It was an unexpected bonus to enjoy the same coffee at breakfast as we have at our own home Nespresso capsule varieties 
434610,Gallery Hotel, Watch the prices in the bar mostly good but expensive cocktails , Excellent friendly staff in a very safe area of Barcelona stayed 3 times before will stay again 30 Euro taxi fare from airport Underground on the corner very easy to get about 
434611,Gallery Hotel, All entertainment channels on the TV are in Spanish It would be nice if possible to have an entertainment channel or two in english if at all possible This is not a big deal though just a nice to have , Excellent location within walking distance of a variety of shops restaurants and tourist attractions Rooms were comfortable and air conditioned The roof top bar had an excellent choice of beverages and bar meals The staff were friendly courteous and extremely helpful and spoke a variety of languages 
434612,Gallery Hotel,No Negative, Great location to access public transportation as well as a hop on hop off bus tour Good food at the hotel as well as local establishments Great little boutiques across the street with locally or at least in Europe made items The roof top bar was great and SUPER friendly staff 
434613,Gallery Hotel,No Negative, The Gallery Hotel was everything we expected The Hotel was clean and modern The staff was very helpful in making recommendations for dinner and booking tickets for local events Great restaurants and attractions were within walking distance lots of taxis in the area and the metro stop is on the corner of the block lots of options I would highly recommend this hotel for couples families traveling with teenage children or for business travelers it had everything we needed Would love to stay here again next time we are in Barcelona
434614,Gallery Hotel, One quirky thing only one heavy room key did not use the typical cards Overall an excellent hotel , Beautiful Hotel in a great part of Barcelona Eixemple with good restaurants close to the metro friendly and helpful staff contemporary design Wonderful experience in all regards 
434615,Gallery Hotel, The rooftop pool was a little underwhelming , Extremely helpful and eager staff Near to the Guadi Casas and walking distance 20 mins to Sagrada Familia Surrounded by excellent restaurants 
434616,Gallery Hotel, I booked a one person room and it was tiny they are transparent about the size of the room so no surprise there I guess it is how it was supposed to be but for more than 200 EUR the night ,No Positive
434617,Gallery Hotel,No Negative, It s a cute single room with color boxes on the wall The desk is a smart way to arrange the space of this little room The bed is double bed which is comfy n big enough for a good sleep 
434618,Gallery Hotel,No Negative, The room was gorgeous which had a living room and a bedroom The bed was super big and the mattress had proper softness The bathroom provided full range of utensils The computer and the printer were at the lounge The top fitness room offered the gym facilities and bathrooms It organised the morning exercise session for early birds 
434619,Gallery Hotel, My stay was a bit on the short side to try the pool for instance but that was just my schedule not a fault with the hotel , Located within walking distance of the old town and the seafront Helpful friendly staff Room was spacious comfortable and well furnished Very good breakfast Taxis readily available at short notice too Would happily stay there again 
434620,Gallery Hotel, Nothing we had a great stay , Fantastic hotel super friendly staff who made us feel very welcome they even gave our daughter a little present when we checked in which she loved Clean and modern facilities beds were comfortable tea coffee available and mini bar We could easily fit a baby cot into a standard double room so the rooms were very spacious Amazing terrace with a small pool and great space to just relax have a drink and soak up some sunshine 
434621,Gallery Hotel,No Negative, Excellent service very kind personnel The hotel is well located in a nice area of town Breakfast was good and not too pricey The room was in the back because I had asked for a quiet room and it was totally noiseless Clean room nice bed There was complimentary water and a water heater for a quick coffee which I appreciated Price quality was good
434622,Gallery Hotel, Reception slightly crowded Rooftop opening hours could be longer on Sunday it closed at 8 PM, Nice designed room very clean very comfortable bed and pillow menu Super helpful and smiling staff great location Didn t try their food nice toiletries Underground parking Rooftop nice atmosphere
434623,Gallery Hotel, Breakfast was too expensive so we had it in the gallery next door, Upgraded to a lovely comfortable suite Staff very friendly and most helpful Hotel in a perfect location for central Barcelona Unfortunately had such a busy schedule we couldn t enjoy the rooftop pool Would definitely stay here when we come back
434624,Gallery Hotel, Didn t like that we could only stay the 2 nights would have liked to stay longer Enjoyed the Gallery Hotel beautiful Barcelona , Excellent coffee Hermes Begonia Juanna looked after us so well All of the food was fresh just a great place to stay 
434625,Gallery Hotel, Two beds side by side Fell down the middle a couple of times One day room not serviced until we asked Then we learned to put sign on door for servicing , Staff exceptionally helpful A couple of bars Breakfast very good Good location Easy walking distance to most attractions Would stay there again 
434626,Gallery Hotel,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful Room was great and bed and pillows were very comfortable We also enjoyed the food we had in the restaurant The location was great and we found it was in walking distance to everything if you do enjoy walking 
434627,Gallery Hotel, They give you only one set of keys and you have to leave it at the reception It is not a big deal but I would prefer to avoid that , The stuff is very friendly location is good and it is very clean 
434628,Gallery Hotel, If I had to pinpoint one very minor fault it would be that when the rooms were cleaned they didn t replace the complementary teas coffees but the positives certainly out weighed this minor fault, The staff were exceptional from the reception through to the bar staff all made our stay a special one Location was fantastic ideal for restaurants bars the sites and shopping 
434629,Gallery Hotel, The roof top terrace was closed we did not realise this until we got to the hotel , Staff were extremely helpful room was excellent complementary toiletries were really good 
434630,Gallery Hotel, The outdoor roof top poool was under renovation while we were there in March 2017 , The hotel was well situated at the cusp of downtown and local neighborhood restaurants and shops The breakfast was excellent The hotel was a great value for what they delivered The staff was very helpful and made outstanding restaurant recommendations close to the hotel I would stay there again 
434631,Gallery Hotel, This visit was in March and the roof top bar wasn t open , Extremely helpful friendly staff Great location in an up market area of Barcelona Very handy for the metro the Diagonal station is only a few yards away Small but very cosy rooms 
434632,Gallery Hotel, Nothing Everything was great , Great staff best location in Barcelona Tons of great restaurants around If you like to walk it is on good walking distance from most of the interesting points But it is also in front of the Diagonal metro station in case you prefer 
434633,Gallery Hotel,No Negative, The staff were exceptionally helpful and very friendly and cheerful all the time Nothing was too much trouble We particularly enjoyed the well presented little touches in our very comfortable Superior room from coffee and tea making facilities unusual in Spain lovely range of toiletries and useful information about Barcelona to chocolates on the pillows at night There was even a small savoury snack of local delicacies waiting in our room when we arrived We were also loaned a 4G dongle by the hotel so we had secure roaming data for the duration of our stay which was very handy indeed Location is excellent Its a lovely area and within walking distance to most attractions but the metro station is only about 50m away if that and easy to navigate so it is easy to get around the city Lots of places to eat and drink close by as well We did not eat in the hotel at all as we don t do breakfast and were out and about in the evenings We loved the hotel and Barcelona and will definitely be back 
434634,Gallery Hotel, the bed was tooooo soft for me but my husband liked it , the staff were really helpful and the hotel is great the room was comfortable and location is good 
434635,Gallery Hotel,No Negative, The rooms seem to have been recently renovated so it s very clean Although the rooms was small it was well designed with everything fitting nicely inside and making good use of space especially in the modern style bathroom Staff were kind and provided a nice little touch with artisan chocolate as a greeting gift 
434636,Gallery Hotel, The bathrooms could use more of an update they re cramped and not well ventilated Sometimes the housekeeping felt unfinished and rushed and it was hard to tell when they would come to clean Room service was quick but mediocre food , The room was spacious we had the deluxe It had the most comfortable bed I ve ever slept on The staff was welcoming and are great with early check ins It was so easy to find In the heart of the shopping district The location and overall atmosphere is great and casual 
434637,Gallery Hotel, nothing at all, great room lovely bed and shower good choice at breakfast really helpful staff nice location about 20 minutes from airport bus drop off
434638,Gallery Hotel, The foyer is a little tired and could do with a BH Spin bike and water in the gym , The room Suite was perfect for a young family with the closed bedroom and living room The staff and in particular Hermes at breakfast where all very helpful I had to take a call at breakfast for work Hermes kept me fuelled with coffee and pastries without request He also went out of his way to entertain my 2yo son Clearly the location is excellent 
434639,Gallery Hotel, Lack of magnetic key cards locks , Probably the perfect location to get around Barcelona whether by taxi metro or walking Also the hotel location puts you directly between a buzzing atmosphere of places to shop eat and drink The hotel itself is very welcoming and accommodating Only thing that surprised me about the hotel really was the use of the standard key versus electronic magnetic key cards 
434640,Gallery Hotel, We had a bag stolen from the small restaurant at breakfast on our first morning It was captured on CCTV and the perpetrators entered through the main door of the hotel past reception and past the restaurant staff Despite our foolishness in our view the security needs to be improved All the staff were kind empathic and helpful but it would have been good if they had contacted the police directly as we lost a whole day of a very short break reporting the theft making statements etc We had half board and felt the 2 choices of main course was too limiting A milk jug for our breakfast tea would have been a nice addition but that s just plain pernickety , A substantial breakfast with good choices Comfortable beds clean rooms good service The restaurant staff were all amazing pleasant kind helpful The food was generally very good with a good choice of wines Would definitely stay again and recommend 
434641,Gallery Hotel, The temp in the shower fluctuated a bit but just encouraged a quicker shower , EVERYTHING was amazing We were offered an upgraded room upon checkin for a very reasonable 34 euro a night including all minibar contents and the room was worth every cent The room a junior suite I believe was perfect We weren t in the room for 2 minutes before receiving a phone call asking if a the room was alright and b if they could come make up the spare bed for our son Someone arrived right away and got it all sorted for us The staff was very kind and friendly remembering our names and room number any time we spoke to them One even popped by during breakfast to give my son a bottle of jelly beans Breakfast was a typical continental breakfast and included everything you could want Beds and pillows were comfy Room was beautifully appointed Location is also great and central to everything we wanted to be near In all a wonderful hotel and we look forward to our next stay Thank you 
434642,Gallery Hotel, The bed was extremely hard which to me was uncomfortable The couches were worn and soft which was also uncomfortable , We were upgraded to a suite upon our arrival which was nice The bathroom was upgraded nicely and having the extra toilet was a plus 
434643,Gallery Hotel, Waiter on the 6th floor was not nice Lack of information in the room about the city and local area Lack of staff in the restaurant and reception waited too long to be served , Bed was extremely comfortable some staff were really lovely but no consistency Location was good not too far from main attractions and easy to access them by foot car or public transport 
434644,Gallery Hotel, N A, The hotel is in a perfect location Within minutes from the station to the airport and walking distance to all major attractions Plenty of shops close by for the shoppers and lots of cafes restaurants and bars The staff friendly and helpful Hotel very clean Bed extremely comfy Rooftop perfect place to catch the late afternoon sun and enjoy a few drinks 
434645,Gallery Hotel,No Negative, The room was gorgeous and comfortable The staff were so incredibly helpful and generous with their time We had great restaurant recommendations from them This is also a perfect location to stroll from and enjoy all Barcelona has to offer 
434646,Gallery Hotel, Check in was very disappointing Since we were coming from a cruise ship we knew we would arrive earlier than the stated check in time I called booking com about a month before our arrival date about an early check in since it did not print out on my reservation form when I reserved the room on line Booking com called the hotel and they said they could not guarantee an early check in but they would do their best Then I phoned the hotel the day before our arrival to confirm I was told that they could not guarantee but would do their best When we arrived we were greeted by Sara who was very pleasant She checked us in and let us know our room was not ready yet and checked in our luggage About a half hour after we arrived a large group going to meet a cruise ship checked out of the hotel Several other groups arrived at the hotel a bit later and were checked in and shown to their rooms We asked if there was an idea when our room would be available We were told maybe another hour After another hour we asked again and were told it would be another 2 hours At this point we had been waiting 4 hours and many other people had come in after us and were checked in After another 45 minutes I noticed one of the hotel staff take our luggage in to the elevator I asked Sara if our room was now ready since I saw our luggage being taken into the elevator Without checking anything she said your room will not be ready for another hour I asked where our luggage was going then She then looked in the computer got us confused with some other couple and then said oh your room is now ready 5 hours we sat in the lobby If they would have been honest with us up front and told us there was no early check in if you are not with a group we would have booked a tour We would have even been happy to pay if there was an extra charge for early check in but were given the impression they would do their best THIS IS NOT YOUR BEST , Very attractive hotel in a great area of the city Most of the hotel staff very helpful Room very clean comfortable and quiet Breakfasts were good with variety and served in a very nice area where you could eat inside or out which was really nice as the weather was so lovely We were only a few blocks from some of Gaudi s famous works and also near a large shopping area with many high end stores The hotel is also very close to an excellent bakery Boldu that serves really delicious donuts Great area to explore this truly beautiful city We felt very safe here too 
434647,Gallery Hotel, The only problem was with room service they work quite limited time and don t have even sandwiches , Friendly hotel friendly stuff Big room and tasty food in the restaurant 
434648,Gallery Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly staff lovely breakfasts fantastic location and gorgeous view from our balcony overlooking the water Great rooftop loungers and pool 
434649,Gallery Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was very beautiful it was my first time and Barcelona Spain with my two doors we were on vacation and the hotel made our vacation even more remarkable and the location was outstanding
434650,Gallery Hotel, Drinks in hotel rooftop bar really really expensive Arrived to room to find shaving kit was open and only packaging remained Still remained after second days clean Also tea and coffee not replenished daily Daily cleaning service not good attention to detail , Roof top swimming pool and bar was great to relax at the end of a hot August day sightseeing Good location Really good for any sightseeing tour and for the train connections also great shopping Staff helpful gave recommendations for local restaurants and printed off directions and maps for us 
434651,Gallery Hotel, Nothing wrong, Excellent location Best stores restaurants metro stations and atractions at walking distance Rooms recently remodeled Staff kind and well trained 
434652,Gallery Hotel,No Negative, staff were very nice they gave us an upgrade to a deluxe which was really comfy and spacious very comfortable bed nice room sound system right next to Diagonal Metro station
434653,Gallery Hotel, Rooftop pool was not big enough or deep enough depth only thigh high Fine for cooling off but nothing more , Friendly and helpful staff Good location in a upmarket area about a 10 15 minute walk or short metro ride to other areas Many good restaurants and tapas bars nearby Rooftop bar was lovely and although the menu is small we had an amazing steak dish on our first night Breakfast was good Room was very clean and mini bar was free nice bonus 
434654,Gallery Hotel, The gym was just a few treadmills and nothing worth calling a gym I couldn t workout since the weights were limited to a few barbells with a max weight of about 30 lbs It s located in a small room on the roof with limited mobility , Location was by far what I liked the most Everything was within walking diatance if not 10 euors in a taxi can take you for quite some diatance Clean hotel with friendly and very helpful staff Parking was available for an extra 22 euros per day 
434655,Gallery Hotel, Nothing We loved all of it , The bed was extra comfortable we upgraded to a premium room Well worth it room was lovely Staff very friendly breakfast was delicious and excellent value at 9 a day when you book it on check in 
434656,Gallery Hotel, Wifi signal could be better but this is hardly a complaint Maybe providing free parking would be nice and the breakfast although decent and convenient was expensive even with the discount we got It was on par with my friend s hotel breakfast in terms of price so I m sure other hotels all have similar prices , Helpful friendly staff Great location good size modern rooms and bathroom with a nice tub and shower surround Quiet inside the room even if you face the street 
434657,Gallery Hotel, The complimentary drink which we were given an invitation for was only beer , Very helpful staff Good hotel nice breakfast really good value Would go back
434658,Gallery Hotel, Nothing , The front of house staff were exceptional Friendly and extremely helpful and welcoming The porter was excellent He took the time to show us how to use the room facilities It is a fantastic hotel 
434659,Gallery Hotel, The sundeck could have had more sunchairs , A great hotel with a very friendly staff we felt like coming home everytime we returned The hotel is clean fresh cozy medium size and at a great location We also enjoyed the food tried breakfast lunch and dinner and the beautiful sundeck at the topfloor We can warmly recommend a stay at this hotel 
434660,Gallery Hotel, Mattress was very old and covered with so many lumpy sheets Awful Barman was always too busy to serve or provide a correct bill or take payment although rest of staff were good There was a muddy mark on floor which remained throughout my 3 day stay Very limited vegan options for breakfast , Hairdryer was powerful but dangerous as it has to plugged in by the sink in the bathroom Bathroom was very nice Rooftop bar was impressive 
434661,Gallery Hotel, The pool was unusable as it was not heated and closed by dinner time each night The environment for the pool was uncomfortable as there are paying customers right beside it eating meals watching you swim We chose the hotel for the location and the pool and we were so uncomfortable using the pool that we only spent about 3 minutes total in it No fun being in your wet bathing suit while people are annoyed with you because they are eating their dinner , the room was great the staff were awesome and the location is unbeatable for access to La Rambla 
434662,Gallery Hotel, Location is 15 min walking to center la rambla No clothes hanger in room 122 and its bathroom No tissue in the room Reinnovtion in the bathroom of the lobby without any signs They ask for a deposit when we requested a plug Noisy rooms 122 and 103 you can hear everthing in the corridor and the metro The room is very small The bed is not comfortable No blockout in the window and the sun light is inside the room The hotel is very old They said it is 25 years but i think 250 years old Room keys intead of cards Breakfast is poor , The staff very helpfull Location is close to metro station and tourist bus casa mia and casa batllo 
434663,Gallery Hotel, The breakfast is okay , After having a personal issue with the room it was the manager herself who did everything to comfort and please us with great success Very professional and very friendly Would come back anytime especially for the cosy roof top area
434664,Gallery Hotel, they should wash better the glasses in the breakfast room , everything staff very friendly localization breakfast except the glasses that were always quite dirty room the chocolates they leave in the bead every night is delicious 
434665,Gallery Hotel, swimming pool too small , excellent location very close to metro station and 10 mins walking from La Rambla Rooms very confortable and clean with all the needed furnitures Staff extremely professional and always available for any necessity 
434666,Gallery Hotel, We felt sorry not to have concerts on friday and saturday nights like we had last year Moreover prices increased and we preferred the staff of last year , Location car park rooftop bar 
434667,Gallery Hotel,No Negative, Staff was extremely helpful and eager to be of service The location was outstanding and the room was modern and spotless Would advise anyone to stay there 
434668,Gallery Hotel,No Negative, Great location on street which links La rambla and Passeig de Gracia Felt very safe the whole time we were there Friendly staff reasonably priced food and drink highly recommend 
434669,Gallery Hotel, The service provided by staff unhelpful with regards to very hard beds I would advise not booking a triple room with extra bed if an adult is sleeping in the extra bed , The room was nice clean and crisply decorated The location is good 
434670,Gallery Hotel, Perfume or room freshener in the lobby area was overpowering and I could not bear to be in that area of the hotel Neutral scents are best for public spaces For the price it was a nice hotel but I think at that price it should definitely include breakfast Our chargers would not fit into their outlets because they were recessed but the front desk had loaners , Room very clean and new Linens fresh and unscented Great view near elevators 
434671,Gallery Hotel, Extra tea bags in room would have been appreciated No other complaints, Excellent beds staff fabulous did not eat at hotel Near metro stops so very convenient Would happily stay there again
434672,Gallery Hotel, I travelled with my friend so we went half on cost of room it was very expensive and did even include breakfast I would not have been able to afford this if had been with my husband far too much Also there was no view from room, Great hotel very comfortable we were in a deluxe room and the roof top bar was brilliant also free mini bar
434673,Gallery Hotel, One morning the breakfast area was very busy Nobody acknowledged my presence despite waiting for 5 mins to be seated Also lack of towels on terrace One day preparations for a party were under way and the music volume was being tested This went on for half an hour and was very irritating, The welcome and the roof terrace
434674,Gallery Hotel, Bar staff is not the most active Definitely not there to make money But who cares with so many alternatives close by , Good location Service minded staff at front desk We had a family room that are actually two double rooms connected through shared entrance room Very practical Nice rooms with everything you expect of this level of hotel 
434675,Gallery Hotel, isolation seemed worse on the 3rd than on the 4th floor could sometimes hear the neigbors but was no major issue , already my second stay there and i would definitely come back again extremely helpful staff with great tips for restaurants very clean and spacious rooms nice rooftop terrace with few people
434676,Gallery Hotel, You couldn t check in to the room until 4pm however they did hold our luggage , Fantastic location We were able to walk to walk the big sights such as the Gaudi apartments and the Cathedral It was also close to the main shopping streets restaurants and about a 15min walk to La Rambla The staff were helpful and assisted us with making bookings 
434677,Gallery Hotel, only very small things that could be improved first room has been a little bit dirty but second one was cleaned very thoroughly gym with only endurance machines and light free weights just one key per room and no toilet brush still overall i would definitely book a room here again, amazing location close to shopping restaurants and sights really nice hotel with spacious rooms and an amazing roof top terrace and pool super friendly staff we asked to change for twin beds as the double bed was quite small and could change the day after without additional costs
434678,Gallery Hotel, A mirror above the desk dressing table when drying your hair would have been very helpful , Very comfortable bed Nice quiet room on 4th floor Bathroom very well equipped and clean 
434679,Gallery Hotel, We skipped the breakfast plan given it seemed a little expensive for the options they had Several excellent and less expensive options in the area , Larger than expected accommodations for Spain We had a family room which was actually two rooms joined by a small entry way Perfect for the kids to have their own space and adults to have theirs Exceptionally good staff Very clean hotel with comfortable beds GREAT location just off Rambla de Catalunya about a 10 15 min walk to Placa de Catalunya or 20 min walk to the Born Definitely not cheap but priced right for what the hotel delivers 
434680,Gallery Hotel, Wifi connections in the room, Everything was amazing in this hotel staff is very helpful housekeeping is great If i came back to barcelona this hotel would be my first choice Special thanks to Laura from the reception staff 
434681,Gallery Hotel, Nothing the stay was amazing thank you , The hotel is beautiful at a great location fantastic shops and restaurants around The rooms are spacious and very clean The staff are very helpful We held an event at their Robert Crilion rooms and the staff and Andrea were amazing throughout the 3 days Everything we asked was accommodated and alsways with a smile The breakfast was great good selection and asked if anything etra could be made so I couldn t fault it and in addition the staff were always polite and smiling and helping constantly The event went smoothly and I couldn t have asked for anything else in addition beyond my expectations 
434682,Gallery Hotel, We have room for 3 person a one bed wasnt regural bed bud was comfortable , Very well located Metro is only 200 meters far away and around are only nice restaurants shops Love stylish interior design of the hotel 
434683,Gallery Hotel, We requested an early check in prior to arrival When we arrived at 12 00 mid day we were told the room wasn t ready and we should return at 1 30 We duly returned at 2 00pm and told it would not be ready until 4 00pm We had been up from 4am and were tired and needed to refresh ourselves Very disappointed with that treatment I don t think the reception staff even contacted the housekeeping staff to see if it could be ready sooner , very comfortable The girl on the desk at check out was very pleasant and helpful Good location and the bar staff were excellent We stayed in a junior suite which we found luxurious 
434684,Gallery Hotel, Was a shame that the roof top terrace and pool wasn t open Wasn t aware of this when booking Was hot enough to have had a drink up on the terrace, Staff were excellent very friendly and gave excellent restaurant recommendations
434685,Gallery Hotel, Nothing at all, Central hotel only short walk to main sites Great value for money Friendly staff and good facilities Would highly recommend and will stay there again on our next visit 
434686,Gallery Hotel, paid 40 Euros to get to the airport at 5 am Hotel need to be resourceful and agree with taxi a fixed rate of Euro 20 or 25 at all times , Location was ideal and the staff were very informative 
434687,Gallery Hotel, old key dark lobby old elevators, Location was good staff was friendly whole set of bathroom utensils breakfast ok metro near a lot of cafes near supermarket Perfect location for shopping 
434688,Gallery Hotel, The only downside is the key We are in 2015 why don t they use cards instead of key with big wooden meld makes it hard to carry on so you just keep it with reception , The location is superb right next to everything The room was good in size modern and and bed was comfortable 
434689,Gallery Hotel,No Negative, Great quiet location and still within good walking distance of attractions metro across the road nice breakfast Modern comfortable spacious room which was quiet even though it was at the front of the buildibg
434690,Gallery Hotel, The only bad thing is the room key still they are using the old style where you need to keep the key in reception when you go out Other than this everything is good , Gallery Hotel is very nice hotel room is big staff are excellent location is excellent breakfast is very good 
434691,Gallery Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is in a perfect location for exploring Barcelona close to the bus metro and tour bus stops The hotel itself is clean with friendly staff and great facilities I would recommend a stay at this hotel and would stay here again should I visit Barcelona again
434692,Gallery Hotel, Nothing although the gym could be better equipped and bigger than the current facility but can t really complain great hotel and even better staff, The room was great location ideal for getting around with the metro and tourist bus within a minute or so from the hotel The staff were absolutely lovely overall great stay and would visit again in a heartbeat
434693,Gallery Hotel, don t stay in room 521 as we did there is a running machine above you can hear people running and it s really terrible , location friendly staffs 
434694,Gallery Hotel, Living room couch was too low Made it difficult to get up , Location was perfect for seeing the city One of the most comfortable beds and pillows we ve had traveling 
434695,Gallery Hotel, Nothing to be mentioned , nice hotel with a friendly stuff and a great location easy to access to metro station taxi area and Barcelona bus tour everything is complimentary in mini bar 
434696,Gallery Hotel, The WiFi service during our entire stay was execrable It s 2015 Everyone now checks in with a couple of Internet enabled devices There s no excuse for poor WiFi in an upscale hotel We complained but service never improved Guess it s the Casa Fuster next time , My wife and I have stayed at this hotel numerous times and have been quite satisfied 
434697,Gallery Hotel,No Negative, Location is perfect many restaurants and attractions around Staff if friendly and helpful The place is charming and it s what you need for a leisure trip 
434698,Gallery Hotel,No Negative, Hotel is in a nice central location although about a 20 25 min walk from la Rambla but taxis are cheap and plentiful Barcelona however is not just La Rambla there is so much more to see and this hotel location is a great starting point Hop on hop off pass the door The hotel itself is very comfotable and certainly worth a visit 
434699,Gallery Hotel,No Negative, The staff were great the rooms were lovely and the food from the restaurant including breakfast was fantastic It was very central and overall I had an excellent stay
