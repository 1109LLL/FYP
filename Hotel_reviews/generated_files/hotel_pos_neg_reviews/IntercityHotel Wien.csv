376916,IntercityHotel Wien, Nothing, Everything was great we loved it Location of the hotel our room the staff 10 10 We ll be booking this hotel in the future for sure 
376917,IntercityHotel Wien, The breakfast was very expensive and I opted out of it The rooms were on the small side , I liked the free mini bar I loved the location of the hotel near Mariahilfer street and metro stations 
376918,IntercityHotel Wien, At 17 Euros per person the breakfast was considered to be too expensive They had coffee in the room however which made it better The rooms were on the small side but adequate for one person In my booking somehow the mini bar was free which was an added benefit , The hotel is very well located near the Westbannof and near 2 subway stations It is on Mariahilfer street which has plenty of restaurants and cafes Shopping on that street is also excellent Breakfast at the hotel was expensive so I didn t use it and instead had breakfast in the street Excellent choice of hotel overall and I recommend it 
376919,IntercityHotel Wien, Slightly stuffy smell As we had a kitchenette we could have done with a tea towel for drying up and a new clean dishcloth , The free travel cards Location near to the underground Friendly staff Spacious business apartment 
376920,IntercityHotel Wien, There seemed to be a ration on with the toilet paper and I would have liked to have utilised the trams more but the underground was easier , Wide range of restaurants takeaways and there was a supermarket opposite Spoilt for choice The staff were friendly and helpful the room was comfy and clean Great location for public transport and you are given a free travel pass as part of the deal 
376921,IntercityHotel Wien,No Negative, Very clean comfortable No problems with staff very helpful Bathroom felt brand new Excellent value especially with the included transportation ticket Great location across street from West Bhf U3 stop Would definitely stay again 
376922,IntercityHotel Wien, sheet and blankets smell is very bad and they are not changed daily slow internet no order can be executed at night because one person in the whole hotel works , Location is great Free public transportation ticket Staff is helpful
376923,IntercityHotel Wien, Staff ignored you until they are ready to serve you Rather than acknowledge you are there and say something like I will be with you shortly you get totally ignored , Located close to public transport and room rate included a pass on public transport 
376924,IntercityHotel Wien, Similar to Ruby Marie across the road no kettle or tea coffee facilities but did have a fridge , Very good location for public transport as well as retail therapy 
376925,IntercityHotel Wien, 1 Although room was quiet noise from outside bothered to much Church bells 100 rings at 7 am daily generator or something like that in the courtyard If close the window then very loud noise from air condition in the room goes on 2 Poor beddings couldn t sleep at all 3 No bathroom amenities except liquid soap 4 Iron and board room doesn t have anything to keep the door open no air in the room due to absence of the window and air condition , 1 City transport ticket provided 2 Convenient location 
376926,IntercityHotel Wien, Didn t like how booking com didnt state how many people were supposed to be in the room making an extra charge for me for the 3 nights there I have complained about this, The staff was so helpful with everything no matter what question was asked they done everything possible to find out
376927,IntercityHotel Wien, The speed of reception service is too slow We had to wait more than 15minutes just for check out A pillow case was dirty and I requested to change However they refused to give us a new one , Close to Westbahnhof 
376928,IntercityHotel Wien,No Negative, I like the location it s accessible to public transportation and near establishments The hotel is nice clean and comfortable The staff are nice fluent in English and acts fasts The lady at the reception last Jun 25 around 2am was very nice to offer me crackers because I mentioned I m hungry Thank you 
376929,IntercityHotel Wien, One guy in the registration counter kind of arrogant an asian one , Accessibility to everything cleanliness of the room just so comfortable to stay in this hotel if i come back i ll check in again in this hotel we did not drink any caffeinated drink so i leave no answer to that question 
376930,IntercityHotel Wien, Receptionist guy was very rude unwelcoming and not helpful at all On 2 different occasions as well Hotel would be ok But the staff left a bad taste in our mouth Shame, Location
376931,IntercityHotel Wien, The internet connection was spotty, The room was nice and clean Hotel location is great with lots of restaurants in the vicinity which in itself is very walkable and just a nice neighbourhood Staff was friendly and very helpful 
376932,IntercityHotel Wien, The Wi Fi signal was poor unless you paid extra Not what you would expect of a hotel charging as much as they do , The free public transport ticket was very useful and made this hotel the best deal I could find at short notice 
376933,IntercityHotel Wien, we booked a room with one queen size bed but they gave us tow single bed and we had to checked out at early morning and checked in in the afternoon to change our room and the free WiFi was so bad it was remaind me to 20 years a go at the time that internet is come ,No Positive
376934,IntercityHotel Wien, Free WiFi is nearly useless it s extremely slow and unreliable Our checkin wasn t very smooth the front desk person was slow and seemed not experienced The designer shower which we had was badly designed resulting in water all over the bathroom The king size double bed turned out to be two beds Pretty much everything in the hotel feels overpriced , Location is excellent next to public transport and since hotel gives free transport tickets you can go anywhere you want Breakfast is really good top quality Rooms were clean and nice 
376935,IntercityHotel Wien, TV is very small lots of Austrian and German channels are missing Staff sometimes don t make a happy impression , Bathroom was nice and overall cleanliness was good It s quiet and in a side road of a shopping street the subway is just round the corner which was superb We loved the free transportation card which we used a lot 
376936,IntercityHotel Wien, The mattress and pillows were to soft for us The free wifi is slow and for a fast connection you need to pay extra 8 euro per day , The room had everything we needed but we expected more in size and luxury because of the photos on Booking com Location is great close to underground and tram and the staff were very helpful This hotel is more for business travelers not romantic get away 
376937,IntercityHotel Wien,No Negative, The location is perfect for the full Wien experience the metros trains and trams are easy to use and very near the hotel the shopping street is maybe 10 meters from the front door and the restaurants are also near and nice Hotel was clean and comfortable and had free internet The staff was happy to help when needed I enjoyed my visit there
376938,IntercityHotel Wien, The official rating is four stars but I would say it is more like a three star hotel Staff was a bit of a hit and miss Some of them were good and friendly but others were not particularly helpful I am not sure whether it was a cultural issue but we felt some of them were a bit sarcastic when dealing some of our requests The manager should train them better on how to deal with the clients Breakfast has a good choice and was frequently replenished but it is not appropriate for people with food allergies as everything gets mixed and there is little care in separating the different items Finally a general complaint about hotels in Vienna I am not sure why but they do not seem to have the concept of a family room We were two adults and two children and had to get a special apartment that costed more than having two individual rooms which would have been inconvenient Families with more than one child may need to look elsewhere , The hotel is located just next to the beginning of Mariahilfer Strasse the largest shopping area a metro station U3 Westbanhof exit inner Mariahilfer Stse and several tram lines which makes it excellent in terms of location The free transport ticket provided by the hotel does make a big difference as you can put it in your pocket and forget about it which means you can easily move anywhere in Vienna in a matter of minutes Going downtown takes no more than 10 minutes There is also supermarket right in front of the hotel and several restaurants nearby Rooms are good size and sound insulation is good Moving to and from the Airport is also quite easy either through the CAT train it doesn t arrive directly but there is a quick link through the U3 metro line 
376939,IntercityHotel Wien,No Negative, Receptions was rud guy check in was at 16 20 instead of 14 00 they did not even said that we are sorry for late check in Staff is really a minues point infront of this hotel was Ruby marie hotel same price and staf were incredible and polite 
376940,IntercityHotel Wien, I didn t like the free WIFI which was the slow connection I would think that staying for 4 nights would make it possible to have the faster WIFI for free , The hotel is very centrally located clean and the staff is very helpful 
376941,IntercityHotel Wien, The hotel should provide body lotion The bar fridge should contain a few complimentary drinks , The location is very convenient The free transport card is a very good incentive 
376942,IntercityHotel Wien, It seemed like a private room in a hostel not a hotel , The place is nothing special Basic rooms Basic lobby Basic hallways Really nothing to write home about 
376943,IntercityHotel Wien, I had a double bed yet a single cover The toilet had a fan that made a weird sound all 24 hours of the day , The hotel room was very clean I got a City pass forbidden free and this was amazing The hotel was near a very famous train station 
376944,IntercityHotel Wien,No Negative, The location is perfect close the subway on the shopping street there is even a supermarket across the street The room was nice the bathroom very comfortable we didn t have breakfast as there is a patisserie down the street serving great breakfast 
376945,IntercityHotel Wien, The staff at the desk could have at least asked how my stay was upon checking out but I think I interrupted the breakfast they were having in the back office The shower is a bit scary I was taking a shower and the water changes from normal to boiling hot in an instant without touching anything My skin was red like I had been in the sun all day and that from a shower , The cleanliness was perfect Good job housekeeping housekeeping staff was also very friendly with saying goodmorning and so on 
376946,IntercityHotel Wien, The staff shift at night was not professional and they made a mistake about my reservation that takes me lot of time to spend on the reception disk and in the end it was their mistake That was so bad and they did not act professional after they admit their mistake, The bed was like a cloud the best thing is the hotel provide free city transportation card for all Vienna this is really exceptional
376947,IntercityHotel Wien, Wifi only for 24 hr I have to go to the check in counter to get a new password and ID for next 24 hr It will be wonderful if we can login wifi once , The location is good The room was clean and comfortable 
376948,IntercityHotel Wien, The Wifi is dreadful They charge for better speeds We re travelling and need to plan our next visit and this really hampered that ability They charge 8 euro a day for a service which is a given at any other hotel, The Hotel is well connected with the trams and metro into the city The shopping street is very good and quite busy A Billa supermarket across the road if needed The room is comfortable and the cleaners super attentive The free transit pass per person is an excellent and very nice gesture If you arrive via the Hauptbahnhof you need to catch Tram 18 to Westbahnhof to reach the hotel 
376949,IntercityHotel Wien, We asked for a room with a double bed but we stayed on a room with two single beds , Very good location next to the U bahn station and a few minutes from the city centre Very clean room
376950,IntercityHotel Wien, Free WiFi is very slow The price for breakfast for really expensive The bed and pillows were very soft , Location is great directly on Mariahilfer strasse and the free transport tickets are very useful Very close to U3 and U6 I would say hotel is quite simple and clean 
376951,IntercityHotel Wien, The pillows are too soft and the hotel does not offer firmer ones We were however provided with 2 extra pillows when we requested them , The hotel provides guests with a complimentary metro card which covers the entire Vienna transportation network for the duration of the stay The hotel s location is very central It is directly on Mariahilfer strasse and the Westbahnhof Metro Station thus offering a wide variety of restaurants sight seeing and shopping experiences 
376952,IntercityHotel Wien, We asked a hotel concierge if we were able to park in a certain area and he assured us that we were We ended up getting a 36 parking ticket Not a huge deal and otherwise we loved our stay , Proximity to the subway and a great selection of restaurants The room was clean comfortable and spacious Would absolutely stay here again Great value for your money Staff was friendly and mostly helpful 
376953,IntercityHotel Wien, Staff was acting more like detectives and less like receptionists They were questioning if I used my own credit card I had to show them the card and even then they had a hard time believing I could actually own that card Not sure what the whole issue was about When they found out that i was alone even though I had booked for two people they removed the towels from the bathroom I found that hilarious Number 1 because the towels are miniature towels they don t offer bath towels Number 2 what does it matter since i paid for the room for two people They started questioning why I booked for two if i was alone I informed them that I always use the same setting on www booking com Besides taking the towels they never checked if there were any tissues or toilette paper so I had to call in the middle of teh night to ask them to bring them The receptionist answered please call back at 7 am when the staff is here Well since i had an early flight I had to insist Overall if I don t take the Austrian hospitality into account I had an average stay in an average hotel The interactions were comical ,No Positive
376954,IntercityHotel Wien,No Negative, Location is not bad and they offered the traffic tickets during the stay Just 3 min walking distances away of U3 subway Only spent two nights in wien did not have time exploring hotel surroundings But nice staff clean room good location fair rate what am I expect more for a hotel 
376955,IntercityHotel Wien, Bathroom didn t have enough ventilation so it always had a moist and smell , Hotels location is great just 2 minutes to U3 and U6 also because it is near to Westbahnhof there is a direct bus to the airport You can walk through mariahilfer stra e to to center in 15 minutes While making a comparison with other hotels fees I added the sum of the price of the transportation tickets we were going to spend to other hotels fees as InterCity Hotel gives them free and this made an impact on my decision for 2 people 4 days stay as calculating the value of the price Rooms were clean and neat overall the hotel seems new 
376956,IntercityHotel Wien, Breakfast was a poor value for the price Free WiFi was extremely bad I have paid 8 EUR for WIFI upgrade but this also was rather slow for skype conference 6 5 EUr was refunded , Clean hotel all equipment worked well situated very conveniently staff helpful Tickets for the public transport included in the price a very smart move 
376957,IntercityHotel Wien, I did not feel welcomed properly when I first checked in One of the staff was very rude and always preferred not to ask or enquire about anything Cleanliness is fair but not great Reception is very small, The location is superb You will be close to the best stores within a very short walking distance Bed is really comfortable Many Satellite channels that would please most nationalities
376958,IntercityHotel Wien, The free internet speed is very slow The room was small The room felt too warm and stuffy at the beginning we learnt to turn off the heater later Also I felt over paid but I guess that is because for the time I was there the new year , Location is great By the end of the shopping area from the city core to the train station Many local restaurants around the area Very easy to take airport shuttle to the airport from the train station The room includes the basic facilities you need and the restroom feels clean 
376959,IntercityHotel Wien, The room we were booked in 325 smelled very strongly of cigarette smoke We asked for another one and were given a new room without any problems but I wonder why a family our son is eight was booked into a smoking room in the first place , Nice hotel efficient staff very clean and great location

376962,IntercityHotel Wien, The buffet breakfast was overpriced The cafe around the corner was less than half the price with everything made fresh to order , The staff were very welcoming and helpful The room was very clean and comfortable Free transport around the city made getting around worry free 
376963,IntercityHotel Wien, Don t think the hotel is an actual 4 star hotel Bathroom had an odor Rooms were a little plain and didn t go with the theme of the hotel surrounding Lastly I don t feel it is worth the price I paid for , Location is ideal Public transportation very close to hotel Breakfast was very good

376969,IntercityHotel Wien, Breakfast not included in fee On first night they didn t have dbl bed we booked and instead gave twin with no explanation or apology They changed the room the next day but no compensation for our inconvenience , Great location with direct airport bus from westbahnhoff
376970,IntercityHotel Wien, WiFi is rubbish They charge 8 Euros per day for a faster WiFi So don t get fulled about free WiFi advert Breakfast is a rip off 17 Euros per person What a joke 4 20 Euros for a 500ml bottle of water Rooms too small No ironing facilities in the room 7th floor provides a utility room which shuts at 5pm , The hotel is next to the metro underground It provides free transport tickets however please be advised that in Vienna no one checks if you have a ticket or not So I don t know how much value this ticket have

376975,IntercityHotel Wien, WiFi was a bit sluggish , Location was great right on the Mariahilfer Str with an easy walk through the shopping street to the centre of town The reception staff were friendly the rooms were clean and the beds comfortable The extra bonus was the free public transport tickets which we found very handy indeed 
376976,IntercityHotel Wien, There was no bellboy who help us baggage although we asked for this A very expensive option for breakfast , Courteous staff Good location Nice view A few meters from Metro

376978,IntercityHotel Wien,No Negative, True value for money It is on the bus route from the airport and less than 5 minutes tube train to the city centre location could not be beaten Clean and comfortable rooms with a good breakfast I had made a mistake on my booking so contacted the hotel directly it was no problem and corrected within minutes

376983,IntercityHotel Wien, There was no heating operating in the whole hotel With thin walls and temperature of 8 c degrees at night September in Vienna the room was freezing This is unacceptable in a 4 star hotel Further the breakfast hall on the 2nd floor is crowded and seating is limited and the buffet definitely is not worth the high price , The staff was very nice The location on Mariahilferstrasse near a U Bahn station is convenient 
376984,IntercityHotel Wien, Temperature of the room was too high and very difficult to control Housekeeping left the cleaning cloths in the room , The location was great Close proximity to the train station made getting around easy

376988,IntercityHotel Wien, The price was a bit much for a single tourist traveller but it s not out of line with what they re providing considering the city they re in , The location is 20 30 minutes walk from the tourist center but it s right at a transportation hub that has a direct subway line to the major sites The hotel s location in a major shopping district made getting good breakfast and dinner from nearby restaurants easy The room itself was clean and functioned well 
376989,IntercityHotel Wien, It would be much better if the hotel could provide a kettle , The location of Intercity was great It took just about 5 min to get to the train station and the metro station so it s convenient to plan your journey if you choose here Also the surroundings around the hotel was clean and the room was cozy too
