122487,XO Hotel, I could not spleep at all because of wrong fire alarm three times in a night Well that could happen but the way how the staff in charge handled with it and treated the guests was simply unbelievable I thought I have enough experiences with incovinient situations at hotels But this hotel gave me a chance to enjoy a negative travel experience beyond my imagination , Nothihg special 
122488,XO Hotel, Really nothing , This hotel was really excellent We had a very clean room and the room was especially for a city like Paris spacious The bed was very comfortable and the shower was brand new and also spacious The staff was nice and helpful and the location was nearby two subway lines line 2 and 3 Many restaurants just around the corner and a supermarket within 5 minutes distance 
122489,XO Hotel, Both of the breakfast options were way too overpriced 19 euros is way too expensive for the full breakfast and 9 euros is too expensive for coffee and a croissant The mattress was a bit too firm too hard , Beautiful design and decor wonderful area and exceptionally clean Out of 10 hotels that I ve stayed at in Paris this was the best Lots of wonderful restaurants and cafes in the area and a phenomenal boulangerie patisserie is 50 metres from the hotel get your breakfast there

122491,XO Hotel, It was quite cold when we visited and I would like to have had a very hot shower to warm up The water temp is good enough normally but I couldn t get that blast of hot I wanted Only a small point loved the hotel , Lovely staff and location The hotel has been totally refurbished and everything is well furnished and beautiful Lots of good restaurants and shopping nearby with local markets not far still walking easy distance Actual street is very quiet so can leave window open and still get a good nights sleep
