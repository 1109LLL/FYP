482902,Crowne Plaza Milan City, I was very disappointed with one thing in particular I have requested a small extra as we were celebrating my partner s birthday It could have been anything i e a birthday card note chocolate bottle of wine anything would have made a big difference I have worked in tourism for several years and I have never come across a hotel that failed to provide even the smallest gesture Bed lamps not working Bed was squeaking Speaker in the bathroom not working I was charged twice on my stay One time from the Credit Card used to make the booking and another time when checking out as I opted to use another card to pay for my full stay It is not what one would expect in a competitive accommodation market like Milan Would not book again , Good views from the 8th floor Nice toiletries Great size for the bathroom
482903,Crowne Plaza Milan City, Room could have been a bit bigger and more brightly decorated , Staff were helpful and pleasant Right next to the Metro station Outside bar seating area was very nice 
482904,Crowne Plaza Milan City, Didn t like the area too much but we were just passing through and wanted accommodation near the central station and for this it was perfect , Staff were friendly it was very clean 
482905,Crowne Plaza Milan City, the reception staff are not friendly have not professionalism knowledge as hotel reception staff they couldn t provide us enough information during our staying in Milan thought I asked same things many times feel discrimination ,No Positive
482906,Crowne Plaza Milan City,No Negative, Location is excellent right next to metro station and Milan Central railway station is just one metro stop away 3 4 metro stops to other major city attractions Breakfast spread was very nice Staff at reception was very helpful and courteous I ll for sure stay there if I visit Milan again 
482907,Crowne Plaza Milan City,No Negative, We chose this property for our first night in Italy after a long overseas flight due to its close proximity to the Milan Central train station where we planned to take a train to Florence the next day Our room size was typical by European standards small but the king bed was very comfortable and the efficient modern room design provided more than enough space for our needs The bathroom was exceptionally clean modern and had a great shower We also appreciated the electric kettle and small minibar The breakfast offered an excellent buffet with a good selection of eggs fruit yoghurt ham cheese pastries and really good coffee We would stay here again 
482908,Crowne Plaza Milan City, The hotels restaurant for the evening meal, The front desk staff the location the layout of the room the extra touches left it was my birthday got a card gift 
482909,Crowne Plaza Milan City, Shower was useless plus extremely slippery bath shower First room key would not operate second was working but we were asked to re present our passports to front desk felt like we were scammed , Bar was friendly with excellent service
482910,Crowne Plaza Milan City,No Negative, Great location metro is a few feet away from the entrance to the hotel Rooms are very clean well decorated and the bed was very comfortable Would definitely stay here next time in Milan 
482911,Crowne Plaza Milan City,No Negative, The location is very good parking lot is at the backyard of the hotel building and it charges reasonable The room is small but is cozy and clean it s nice that slippers are provided and if you need tooth paste and tooth brush it is also provided There is metro entrace just in front of the hotel very convenient to access to the city center The frontdesk service is good 
482912,Crowne Plaza Milan City, Overall Crowne Plaza Milan City was a nice hotel and met my needs for a quick weekend getaway to Milan However there is a bar club nearby which has an outside patio which was quite loud on a Saturday night even with the windows closed you could still hear the noise Also the fitness center was very small and had limited options not a huge deal as the weather was nice outside but maybe not as suitable for a traveller looking to utilize the space a bit more , Great location literally steps from the subway system 
482913,Crowne Plaza Milan City, Nothing, Everything the room was very comfort and tidy comfortable bed just helped me to sleep deep after a long day the bathroom was clean and has bidet this is very emportent point for me to be available in any bathroom specialy in Europe as there is no water supply along with the WC usually the staff and the guest service very friendly and helpful the hotel is in one step distance from the metro station walking distance to the main train station close to most of the attractions in milan 
482914,Crowne Plaza Milan City,No Negative, A typical Crowne Plaza 4 star hotel located on the top of the station Sondrio on M3 subway which leads to Duomo and the shopping centers within 15 mins The service is really good and the crew are all friendly and supportive 
482915,Crowne Plaza Milan City, Overall a bit too dark Airco was not working sticky in the room 6 for a very small glas of vine is too much, Nice garden terrace very close to the next Metro station
482916,Crowne Plaza Milan City, The Air Conditioning of our room was not working After several complains they changed our room which had working AC They should not provide us that faulty room at the very first point as they already knew that the air conditioning of that room was crap They mentioned that they can see on their system that it is not working and the room temperature was 25 degree centigrade Or they should have changed the room after our first complain Other than that everything was fine , The sleep therapy was excellent Staff were friendly and welcoming Enough supply of toiletries Clean and tidy 
482917,Crowne Plaza Milan City, The room was overheated and could not be cooled down Aircon not yet activated was the front desk response Tried several times to order room service but no response to any of the numbers I tried There was shampoo and body wash and body lotion but no conditioner supplied , The breakfast array was excellent The hotel was close to Central Station The bathroom was excellent Check out was 12 00 
482918,Crowne Plaza Milan City, The Air conditioning did not work in the room and so it was like sleeping in an oven Location is quite terrible and rooms are not very nice or spacious for the money ,No Positive
482919,Crowne Plaza Milan City, Paid for a Superior King room and it looked exactly like the regular king room didn t notice any room size difference or upgrades Tub puddled when taking a shower and it was really difficult dangerous to climb in and out of tub to shower Wasn t able to sleep in because it was so noisy in the halls evey morning starting at 7 I think the room next door was being renovated or something , Comfortable bed easy access to subway sauna in fitness center 
482920,Crowne Plaza Milan City, Shower had a bit of a crazy spray so half the floor got soaked and the tv was all pay per view Only minor , Amazing Location directly beside the Sondrio Metro stop staff are very friendly and helpful we got complimentary umbrellas to keep dry on our visit and complimentary use of the spa wellness centre and also a selection of nibbles when you order something from the bar it is on a busy street but the windows are almost 100 sound proof We will definitely be back 
482921,Crowne Plaza Milan City, The area is strategically comfortable but there is not much around But you can take the metro and get everywhere If you know it it s no problem , Great breakfast for an Italian hotel Very nice bathroom friendly staff The area is nice to get quickly everywhere 
482922,Crowne Plaza Milan City, all were great, employees are a big help all my cards as well were blocked and they accepted to solve the problem once i am back in my country and pay them
482923,Crowne Plaza Milan City, There wasn t anything I disliked about this hotel, The hotel was an easy and safe walk from Centrale station and although it was a bit further out from some attractions the metro station that was literally outside the hotel doors made for easy travel The room was really comfortable and the bathroom was really big 
482924,Crowne Plaza Milan City, Nothing special, Very impressive hotel from entrance reception to room preparation like lemon water reception employees wording and behavior pillow spray comfortable bedding towels cleanness etc Also location was very good as it s one stop by Metro from Milan Central Station walking distance 
482925,Crowne Plaza Milan City, No groceries stores nearby the closest one is at the train station or good restaurants More hot option for breakfast could be an improvement eggs for example , The hotel is located near the Milano Centrale Station very handy if you come by train A metro station is located right by the entrance of the hotel Rooms are spacious although a bit dusty Breakfast is good with plenty of options 
482926,Crowne Plaza Milan City, Location is odd Near the train station is good but it s a very dead neighborhood with a fair walk to somewhere more interesting , Nice clean modern room 
482927,Crowne Plaza Milan City, Furniture a bit scruffy Coffee table even a small one would be nice Bit pricey , Most amenities needed were there Very polite and welcoming staff at reception Right above underground station 
482928,Crowne Plaza Milan City,No Negative, This hotel was located in a convenient location The rooms where of a reasonable size and clean I found the reception staff to be very helpful and friendly I would say that this hotel made for a pleasant stay in Milan and would certainly come back again to this hotel 
482929,Crowne Plaza Milan City, Room was small , Wonderful breakfast Sweet and salty cheese ham egg fresh fruits and good salad juice hot food too Good view from the small gym It s with sauna Position is great for accessing metro and bus to the Malpensa airport just one block away 
482930,Crowne Plaza Milan City, The location is in an un interesting location Other Crown plaza are much better The normal room is small and looks more so as its designed in very dark colors , The hotel is actually on the Sondrio metro So you go out the hotels door right to the Metro That is most comparable Breakfast very good 
482931,Crowne Plaza Milan City, first of all they didnt give me my room i got smaller room for unfair payment back breakfast not that good and noise over my room for 2 days and nobody stop it or took to them to stop it very poor stay, i like the location and thats it
482932,Crowne Plaza Milan City, Hotel was indeed very close to the central train station but the city centre The Duomo Galleria Vittoria etc is 2 station by metro Be aware that the central station is not so close to the city attractions , Breakfast menu was very rich and everything was delicious Room was not so large but was nicely decorated clean and comfortable Reception and restaurant stuff were very helpful even the housekeeping stuff who can t speak English was dedicated to please Welcome drinks were offered Everybody was friendly and as two women travelling alone we never felt insecure 
482933,Crowne Plaza Milan City, Furniture had some spots and should be cleaned AC did not work making a relatively cold room I should have informed reception but was there for just one night , Close to Milano Centrale comfortable friendly staff
482934,Crowne Plaza Milan City, Customer service especially in relation to a difficult situation was terrible Even called IHG Customer Care telephone support and they were equally unhelpful legalistic and enough to drive anyone away from the hotel and the group Wouldnt touch it with a barge pole again ,No Positive
482935,Crowne Plaza Milan City, Bed was extremely noisy Scrambled egg cold and half fluid still Spa no pool Sauna small but good turkish bath smelly Fitness looks big on picture due to mirrors on both sides , Allthough there is a metro station next by hotel is at walking distance to the station and to the next car rental too next to Hilton Nice staff Good apero at the bar 
482936,Crowne Plaza Milan City,No Negative, Probably the best breakfast in whole stay in Italy Lots of choices There were also hot meals like scrambled eggs or bacons even oriental food with rice Very friendly staff Very clean and comfortable bed Stylish interior Good Hair dryer Got a very nice little aroma set for a good night sleep Underground station is just under the hotel We stayed just for one night but we could have stayed much more 
482937,Crowne Plaza Milan City, Gym is very small and not well equipped, Ability to get access to our room by mid morning was a welcome boost after a 23 hour flight from Sydney Thank you so much Staff at check in desk were brilliant
482938,Crowne Plaza Milan City, The fitness center too small The room quite tiny The sauna and hammam not prepared to be used The noise of the neighbours upstairs , The breakfast The parking
482939,Crowne Plaza Milan City, One of the best hotel experiences Cannot find any problem , Shower amenities superlative Room service fast and food very good Front desk friendly and helpful Definitely will recommend to friends 
482940,Crowne Plaza Milan City, This property needs deep cleaning also need to upgrade the room colors frames also the bathroom tiles For some reason lobby looks old and messy , Staff is very helpful and on point 
482941,Crowne Plaza Milan City, I didn t not like but the room was a bit tired and dark Just a few little detail points needed tidied up , Metro station outside hotel Hotel garden terrace Friendly reception and bar staff 
482942,Crowne Plaza Milan City, One of the staff was rude during my check in at the end it was a clear mistake from the hotel when they deducted the amount twice My problem is not the deduction but the way he reacted However the rest of the staff were nice and friendly , Location
482943,Crowne Plaza Milan City, 1 Rudeness from one of the staff when I was doing the check in I was discussing a wrong transaction done by the hotel and he replied I don t have time for that Go contact booking com I did then booking com representative confirmed that they made a mistake and they solved the issue For me this employee is rude and don t know how to deal with a customer 2 Mostly they don t answer the room service or front desk calls , Location
482944,Crowne Plaza Milan City, Shower Setup, Very Clean Friendly and Professional Staff Rooms are fine could be a bit bigger Extremely comfortable bed Delicious Breakfast with good variety Location is great 10 min by metro to Centre the station is literally 2 meters far from entrance
482945,Crowne Plaza Milan City, Not that optimal location for a tourist the old town is pretty far away But if you re ok taking the subway then it will be fine , Clean quiet hotel Maybe aimed more for business 
482946,Crowne Plaza Milan City,No Negative, Brilliant buffet breakfast well worth the 14 Junior suite room was perfect and even had our own little rooftop terrace Location right next door to sondrio underground station literally 5 mins to duomo centre Hotel was 2 minutes walk from Milan centrale station again ideal transfers from malpensa airport Staff were excellent helpful and friendly I made them aware it was my girlfriends birthday before booking they included free breakfast for us both and put a box of chocolates with a message in our room to wish her a happy birthday I also think they gave us free additions from the mini bar on her birthday as they didn t charge us Couldn t fault anything about the hotel room clean modern spacious with everything you could need even free robes and slippers The sauna and steam room was lovely also and included within the stay Wifi was consistently good throughout Will definitely recommend both Milan as a city and this hotel to my friends thinking of going 
482947,Crowne Plaza Milan City, Shower in bath and no hand rail to steady myself Toilet roll holder in a really silly location which made it difficult to sit on loo , Good bed and hotel location Pleasant staff and excellent breakfast 
482948,Crowne Plaza Milan City,No Negative, This would have to be one of the best all round hotels I have ever stayed in Staff was always going above and beyond Location with Metro at your door step was excellent Breakfast inc in package was superb 
482949,Crowne Plaza Milan City, The towels were rather thin and hard Hotel inadequately identified at street level unless familiar with Crowne Plaza logo , The room was an adequate size clean and with a standard functionality Breakfast was good for a middle range hotel The pink slippers were a nice touch 
482950,Crowne Plaza Milan City, Air conditioning central heating Even after lowering the thermostat the room was still very warm , The breakfast gave plenty of choice and was delicious Staff were friendly particularly in the breakfast room The evening meals in the Bar were excellent and the staff very attentive 
482951,Crowne Plaza Milan City, Room was smaller than on photos More expensive to book on booking than on hotel website booking through booking com you will be discriminated people booking directly have a 20 discount on all hotel services Ambiance music in the hall starting very early but sound insulation of rooms is not sufficient so it woke us up Globally sound efficiency of rooms is very poor, Staff is very friendly Very easy to park nearby Metro station just outside the hotel
482952,Crowne Plaza Milan City,No Negative, Liked the location in that it is near the station and we use trains all the time Also having a metro right outside the door was great Rooms were very nicely appointed clean and well presented Breakfast had a wide selection of food A late check out of 12 noon made the booking very attractive and one of many reasons for us to return 
482953,Crowne Plaza Milan City, We enjoyed it all and have no negatives, It was so close to the train station all the Staff were very friendly and breakfast was great loved that they allowed us to get our room early It was a brilliant time Especially loved the little sleeping set of sprays and slippers 
482954,Crowne Plaza Milan City, perfume in the corridors, comfy room helpful staff right next to metro so easy to get in and out even though not central except for business district 
482955,Crowne Plaza Milan City, We booked 3 nights but stayed only one there was bad smell in the corider We got a room wich was Dirty hairs in the bathroom The floor was dirty We changed room but it didnt help so we checked out the next morning and moved to another hotel They charged us for 1 night more then it was on booking plus city tax, Nothing 
482956,Crowne Plaza Milan City, The room was tiny The shower was very cramped We were given a corner room at the end of a hallway and there was barely enough room to walk around the bed My boyfriend s feet were literally hanging over the bed it was that small We had asked for a quiet room and the room was supposed to be sound proof however we could hear everything outside every person in the hallway the elevators cleaners vaccumming It was too noisy We felt like the price per night was too high and wasn t worth it Overall not a bad hotel but probably will not stay again , The breakfast was great and the staff were very nice We had requested early check in and late check out due to our flights and they were very accommodating The location is fantastic right next to the metro and a 6 8 minute walk to the bus station 
482957,Crowne Plaza Milan City, A few words of explanation on how to activate the room with the card key in the slot near the door would have saved me from searching the light switches in the dark ,No Positive

482960,Crowne Plaza Milan City, This is the first Crowne Plaza I ve stayed at that has no swimming pool and a very small gym The breakfast had very limited choices for a four star establishment and the surrounding area was a bit dead but the subway station is only two steps away , The best thing about this hotel is the reception staff they were very nice and polite eapecially Stage and te brunette lady As they answered all my questions very promptly 
482961,Crowne Plaza Milan City,No Negative, Our room was clean and comfortable The hotel is located in an area that doesn t have a great feel not up market however we did not have any problems with safety or security The underground is located beneath the hotel with access just outside the front doors so it is easy to get into Duomo Square 
482962,Crowne Plaza Milan City, There was nothing I didn t like Everything was great , We stayed at the Crowne Plaza Milan City for 2 nights We are a family of four so I got two interconnecting rooms The rooms were modern and the beds were very comfortable I love the way the rooms were decorated The bathroom was very clean Staff were friendly I also love the location It was on top of the Sondrio subway station yellow line It only took 5 minutes to get to the Duomo which was the 5th stop It was also close to Milano Centrale When we checked in at 5 30 pm one of our rooms weren t ready yet The front desk offered another room for us to stay in while waiting but I declined Our rate didn t include free breakfast so he gave it to us to compensate for the wait for the other room We really loved our stay here
