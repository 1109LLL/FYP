360461,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Dismal room with no windows No staff on the bar Reception staff unhelpful Hotel not welcoming Poor value for money Never rate as a 4x hotel stayed in much better 3 , Location
360462,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Getting the rooms ready earlier since most are coming in after a long overnight flight, Location I have stayed at the property 3 times now Came with 2 groups prior to the last stay 
360463,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Rooms are not clean and some parts are very old Guess we got one of the older rooms Reception just average and it looked like they had no interest to welcome there guests ,No Positive
360464,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, As above, Was told that we were being given quiet area at back of hotel There was building work going on from early hours of the morning and into the evening which I know was not hotels fault but annoying still Also one night we decided to dine in the restaurant waited for 15 minutes and couldn t see anyone serving then went down to ask if restaurant was open went back to restaurant again still nobody came so left the hotel and eat somewhere else
360465,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla,No Negative, Great location but pricey Great breakfast Could get noisy at night since it s right on La Rambla But if you want access to all the action that s the place to be 
360466,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, The room was dark it had no natural light and the window looked out onto a big fire escape which dominated the window there were always pidgeons on it cooing away and also two bedroom windows looked into the room adjacent, The location was amazing
360467,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, When i checked out i left my stuff in the room for them to keep it in storage They took my suitcase without other stuff there was another shopping bag that had items when i called the hotel they were not helpful asking me to call again 5 times and nothing happened So my stuff was stolen, Location and facility
360468,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla,No Negative, The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and professional Many were able to communicate in English which was helpful when we needed advice I loved the rooftop balcony where you can sit and watch the excitement on La Rambla below
360469,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla,No Negative, Great location and lovely hotel We took 29 staff members there on a surprise trip and all the staff from back end booking to check out were extremely helpful and accommodating With such a large group we all had different classes of room and even the smallest ones were well kept very clean and extremely comfortable Sitting on the roof terrace in the sunshine was a definite highlight to waiting for the rest of the staff to arrive 
360470,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Euro style beds two doubles pushed together but you get used to it so it s not a big deal at all and very common in Europe , The suite room 319 with the small balcony overlooking La Rambla was great Large room and you could always see everything happening below The rooftop terrace was also wonderful My wife and I purchased food from La Boqueria and had ourselves a wonderful tapas dinner overlooking the city one evening a must 
360471,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Staff was rude Website said their was a Jacuzzi and sauna but said nothing about the fact that you must pay extra too use those I ve never heard of a hotel that charges to use amenities There were several problems with my room including a sewage drainage issue after using the bathtub and a door came off the hinges But the worst part was not those things but that when I went to ask for a discount on the room due to those things the staff started arguing with me and being rude about the fact that I asked for a discount , Really nice hotel and close to great sight seeing and activities
360472,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, The rooms were small the staff on the interior asked for 2 extra towels at night because they always put only 2 and just did not want to bring us We asked to change to the rooms for more at a large additional cost and they told us that there was no room in the hotel and from our room in the hotel we saw full rooms,No Positive
360473,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Nothing, This is an excellent hotel we were lucky to get booked in at the last minute we had had a disappointing experience with the previous booking at another location Our experience at this hotel thoroughly made up for the problems we had experienced Although this hotel cost a little more than we are used to paying It was a revelation to see what could be done The size of the rooms the decor and the facilities were absolutely superb The staff were polite pleasant and helpful A really great experience 
360474,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, One of the dirtiest hotels I ve ever visited There was a blood stain on the comforter and hotel staff acted if this thing was normal , Location is really nice on the Ramblas 
360475,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Having to step in and out of such a high bath to have a shower Very uncomfortable with this concept , Great location on La Rambla and close to everything Easy to walk around 
360476,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Bed was on the hard side No milk in bedroom to go with our tea powdered or uht Small points really , The hotel is on Rambla Street which is the centre of everything Very close to the Gothic section of Barcelona Short walk to Harbour Short walk to restaurants Short walk to sightseeing bus trips Couldn t go wrong 
360477,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, The air conditioning was not turned on room got a bit hot and stuffy so had to open window wide which was not as good , Nice large quiet room with a wall opposite the cost of quiet but did have a mural on it Kettle tea and coffee plus bottled water provided 
360478,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, The lighting in the room and there was only the mirror in the bathroom I would have liked one in the bedroom avoid queuing , Location was perfect staff very friendly particularly Amelia
360479,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Nothing, Lovely hotel on the Las Ramblas Beautiful room which we were upgraded to the piano suite Amazing to do this for us and the staff made us feel very welcome Location is brilliant for take a stroll in central Barca
360480,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, At times could be noisy from the street at night , Breakfast was lovely Huge selection presented well Location very handy staff very friendly 
360481,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, The rude staff at check in Our room wasn t cleaned the same way each day We didn t get our coffee or water which is complimentary until the THIRD day , The location is perfect but would rather stay somewhere else 
360482,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, The place is a bit dated The checkin experience was met with a bit of arrogance but I write that off to communication barriers I queried the fact that that breakfast was included I did so politely and felt that I was proven wrong with a waiter that made a bigger deal of the fact that it wasn t than was necessary I checked my paperwork again and told the waiter it was fine and my misunderstanding of the booking he then brings me the phone to the table where I was once again reminded by reception that I was wrong Completely unnecessary and quite condescending from the staff Just didn t like the attitude , It was an OK hotel in a very good location If you want to stay somewhere in the middle of the action then this is the place to be At the beginning of La Rambla Just a short walk from the bus stops The hotel is not horrible I personally think the room we stayed in could do with a bit of updating compared to the price we paid In this case it seems that you pay for location 
360483,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, The room window was facing the hotel dining entrance which was full with noise that wrnt all to way in to my room Every little noise of the guest in the hotel was getting right into my room Very hard to get quiet wake ups in the mornings great stuff , Location was great 
360484,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Strange smell in the bathroom It s a bit cold during night but there s no heating in the room The air conditioner only has cold function , Location Staffs are very friendly 
360485,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Bathrooms old and grubby in need of replacement View from window was of a brick wall immediately in front Have stayed at several other 4 stars in central Barcelona which were better , Staff were all helpful and friendly
360486,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Cleanliness was poor bathroom had mould all along the shower seals and the door was warped showing evidence of a precious flood The escutcheon on the handle was missing too Would expect much higher standards in a four star hotel , Location was perfect
360487,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, The staff did not have a good level of English Rooms were very smelly Not good facilities, I did not like this hotel It was not what it was described in the booking Rooms were not clean The rooms were so smelly smell of toilet it seemed they did not have a proper ventilation
360488,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, In our room 101 we could hear the rumble of the underground subway The front window would not seal shut properly so street noise was louder than it should ve been But we were so exhausted after sightseeing it didn t effect our ability to sleep Bring ear plugs and eye shades and you ll be fine The room could ve used a fresh coat of paint And we would ve liked to have had lotion offered as a part of the bathroom amenities , The room size was good The bed was comfortable In the lobby they offered complementary fruit infused water The location was excellent It was very easy to get to and from the airport using the Aerobus Concert venues were nearby There was a Starbucks and a huge Carrefour grocery store across the street Everything we wanted and needed was right there 
360489,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, The 4 star rating ive stayed in 2 stars much better than this hotel Constant smell of damp walls in the room have water marks the shower needs a jet wash clean and overall make over They have low lighting to try and hide how dirty the hotel is o, Reception staff and porters are 5 star rating they cannot do enough for you Location is fab 
360490,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Room furniture was not even bare minimum and toilets were bad in drainage Very noisy corridors Will never come again as it was a bad decision I could have easily selected a better property in the same area in the amount I paid , Only good thing was the location being in La Ramblas 
360491,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, The bed could use an upgrade , Location is right in the middle of everything The staff is very helpful and pleasant The breakfast well worth the price 
360492,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, A bit noisy but no problem if you re only staying for 2 nights , The staff were so friendly and helpful They couldn t do enough Hotel spotlessly clean and beds were very comfy 
360493,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, The electricity is an issue, Petty quiet except you hear other doors close in the halls Electricity went out occasionally and new staff didn t know where a mailbox was and we found it on the curb 5 feet away Good room and location just watch your pockets and put your passport in the safe 
360494,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, The additional breakfast is very overpriced so I never did it Very loud at night since you re right on the main street and the rooms are not sound proofed You have to keep the windows open because you can t control the air conditioner so it gets warm , Beds very comfortable location is perfect right in the middle of rambla well connected to everything 
360495,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Staff are so rude and unprofessional I asked for a tea spoon in my room the first answer I got is we will charge you for it sir When I first entered I have been given a room that was already occupied thanks God the occupants where out Bed is not confortable I booked a King size bed I end up having two single beds joined, You can not find a better location 
360496,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, As far as we were concerned there wasn t anything not to like , The Hotel restaurant was perfect Wonderful food great choice and perfect service and fantastic value for money Would definitely recommend to anyone 
360497,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, If I had to choose one thing it would be to make the dining room a little cosier different lighting seating but the food was lovely , Fantastic location close to everything the city had to offer Very comfortable room with great bathroom facilities 
360498,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Accused of having not paid even when showed the booking confirmation and bank statement Foul smell in the room NO AIR CONDITIONING even though it clearly says that THEY DO HAVE IT the room was 26 degrees CELCIUS im from Scotland so as you can probably guess it was unbareable to sleep at night and I was reduced to sleeping on the floor as it was the coldest part of the room and they refused to change us rooms On top of that there was no windows to open only a door with a glass pane behind it The hotel is in a square and the economy rooms are on the inside so if you open the door every room can see straight in your room and the bed is right next to the door so very little privacy Anyone walking through the halls can also see in as they are open aswell At night they switch multicoloured lights on and there s no blackout curtain so your room turns into some sort of a rave at about 10 o clock as if it wasn t already hard enough to sleep , Location was ok
360499,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Cold stark outdated reception and bar area for a 4 star hotel Need a private comfortable lounge area for guests with good warm meet greet like the breakfast staff The breakfast staff were friendly but quiet low key They were organised helpful Tea coffee area in dining room needs more space or new location , I was lucky had lvly quiet room comfortable bed Good location 
360500,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, I left my ring on side locker on the sat night with the rest of my jewelery We went out early Sunday to visit the new camp On return that evening room was cleaned and my ring was no where to be seen I did say it to the man behind desk when leaving mon Because I wanted to go through all my luggage first just in case before excusing any body , Staff at reception where over helpful With my stay even helped me find a room away from lift because I have a sleeping problem the staff where every nice with helping with bags and to make sure that we where looked after 100 
360501,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, The hotel is very basic no coffee of tea facilities in your room Very noisey as the rooms doors are not sound proof So you hear everyone coming and going The breakfast was awful , This hostel is placed in a great location but unfortunately it s about all it has going for it 
360502,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Overlooking La Rambla The windows are not double glazed and do not close properly and the noise at night is terrible hard to sleep The sink in our bathroom was cracked I also didn t like the steps down from the bathroom to the living room I fell down them at night and hurt myself breaking my toe , The room was fabulous and spacious Beautiful stylish with a lovely bathroom couches a piano With views of La Rambla which is also a negative 
360503,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, No facilities in room to make own drink when we got coffee tea in room service the housekeeper did not take dirty cups away when they cleaned room, Helpful staff
360504,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, It is a very old property The bath room fittings are unique , Location is the only thing that I liked about this hotel Mr Javier at the Reception was a good guy 
360505,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla,No Negative, Helpful staff Practical and comfortable room Particular praise for good bathroom lighting correctly positioned mirrors and a full length mirror Perfect location for doing that Barcelona thing swinging down La Rambla and strolling the twisty streets little sunny plazas and people watching at a shady cafe 
360506,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, The bathroom produce pungent odor most probably from a bad sewerage system which also sometimes seeps around the room Mini bar is all charge even for mineral water I ask for queen bed but was given two single bed put together , The location is excellent Very close to the luxury shopping district near aerobus metro stations and quite a number of halal restaurants around A walking distance to tariq ibn ziyad masjid 
360507,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Poor quality of the room for the price paid booked a suite with a Rambla view the wash hand basin had a large crack in it the wardrobe door didn t close correctly the TV in the bedroom didn t work properly and although there was tea and coffee making facilities in the room teabags coffee sachets there was no milk went to the supermarket across the road for it The breakfast although it looked appetising did not taste the same Doesn t rate 4 stars to me I have stayed in better 3 star hotels in Barcelona, Location
360508,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Rooms a little small and one of our group had a glass walled bathroom , Lovely staff really friendly The perfect location for a whistle stop tour as we could get everywhere we wanted in minutes Rooms were spotless Nice bar Would stay here again 
360509,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, It would have been nice to have a kettle in the room to make a cup of instant coffee or tea , Hotel was very comfortable and the location was perfect for us Staff was helpful and friendly food in the onsite restaurant was very good although it was a bit expensive relative to other meals we had in Barcelona 
360510,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Buffet breakfast no good for 4 star category hotel at all Staff needs to be courteous for sure at buffet breakfast they were trying to avoid eye contact and ignoring so we may not ask for something it was very obvious to us Check Inn problems but it was still manageable , Location excellent Rooms size big and nice decor balcony with excellent rambla view
360511,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, There was a very nasty smell in our room but we were moved to another room immediately after we complained However the smell returned as strong in the new room within 24 hours of moving No amount of air freshener we bought got rid of the smell We booked a superior rooms but this smell spoilt everything for us , Very central 
360512,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Pity you have to pay for using health suite facilities and there is no swimming pool, The hotel is in a fantastic position La Rambla is a great street to wander up and down It is close to the hop on hop off bus and also where you catch the Aerobus to and from the airport very reasonable prices There are many lovely restaurants within walking distance You can also walk down to Port Vell which is lovely 
360513,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla,No Negative, They were able to arrange flamenco show even with short notice The location was great You can walk around the plaza and just chose you from chinese japanese tapas american cafe turkish 
360514,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Very noise the street side where our room was assigned And the bed was very uncomfortable a double bed made of two twins and it gave us the feeling that they would get split while sleep we request a change and there were not availability However the last night they moved us to a very good room and quieter side and we sleep very well , The location to walk around however noisy 
360515,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, the room was a little dark we asked the stuff whats the best way to get there and they weren t very helpful so we needed to look on the web , The Breakfast was great The location is the best on the la ramblas near the catalunia squere and many other attractions you have the aerobus station 5 min walk so you can get there very cheap from airport and 2 metro stations near by the room is a little dark but it s ok because you can open the window and have light from the la ramblas in 
360516,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, No coffee making facilities in room poor light in bathroom no early check in Plug sockets poorly designed for travel adaptors would barely fit , Location was excellent room was a decent size mini bar small but reasonable priced

360540,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Hotel smelled strange AC doesn t work the way thermostat shows which is confusing You have to put the door card in door slowly before it ll unlock Shower door and hinge was moldy , Location was great if you want to stay on Las rambles Bed was comfortable They allowed us to check in early which was great Windows have shutters which keeps out noise 
360541,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, We ate breakfast at Moka a restaurnat next door to the hotel because we felt the charge at the hotel was too expensive We could get a full breakfast that included juice and coffee for 9 Euro there I would recommend providing coffee making facilities and an iron in the room , The location and staff were very helpful and friendly

360543,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, I had booked a double room with air conditioning The first night we were put up in a real small room with an old air conditioner which was not working efficiently When i complained i was told that that was the room i had chosen I told the person that maybe i had chosen the small double room but i was told it was an ac room I was uncomfortable because of the heat Though they sent a person promptly to repair it was not functioning and I had to spend a night there because there were no rooms available But the next day after i insisted that they shift me i told them i would write a review on trip advisor they shifted me to the same category of room but it was so different than the old room they put us up in the first night It was well furnished had ventilation was a little more roomy whereas the earlier room had one small window It made me wonder why we were put up in such a room Are they supposed to reserve the best rooms for foreigners Did they expect indians to take things lying down and accept any kind of room provided to them are we paying any less for the room Though the location is excellent the comfort is far more important and you have to give equal treatment to everyone Due to this discomfort i preponed my trip by a day , nothing exceptional except the staff in the restaurant who were really courteous warm as also at the reception who were helpful in guiding us in the city 
360544,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Internet is very very very bad you need to reconnection every time and entering the username and password every time Noise from outside the street Very old furniture If you want to smoke you have to go outside the hotel, Actually nothing Just the carrier bags and the location Near metro restaurants shopping centers

360546,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, The crew was not the most nice people, The hotel located in the central of the city This is the only good thing in that hotel For the price they charging you can find something better
360547,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, The location is fine for those wishing to indulge in the chaos that is the Ramblas Next time we will look for a more quiet district , The hotel was very good and the hotel staff were helpful and friendly Our room was clean and spacious
360548,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla,No Negative, Prime location in the heart of the famous la RAMBLA The rooms size is good WiFi signal was not very good didn t try the breakfast since the room rate was already expensive

360550,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Never buy thru booking website by an offer like 40 percent discount 102 euro per night They said small room for 2 people But in reality bed was for one person Totally disappointment It does not deserve this money ,No Positive
360551,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, We booked three rooms same type price However on check in we noticed one was VERY different to the other two Way below standard and utterly unacceptable for the price we paid Had we not seen the other rooms we would have been unhappy but accepted it I dont think that type of room is acceptable to give to someone In saying that the staff were VERY accommodating and nice about it they acknowledged the issue and upgraded us to an amazing suite on our second and final night they couldnt change us on the first night as they were fully booked and gave all three rooms breakfast on the house for the second night Very good customer service and made a bad situation better, On Las Ramblas lots of shops restaurants markets around the area walking distance Main station a few minute walk away with the hop on hop off starting point located there as well Staff very friendly accommodating Breakfast was good good service and a relatively good selection Reception staff especially the manager David were very helpful and went the extra mile to assist us with queries about the area and issues that we had Just a note NO shops are opened on a Sunday so don t leave any shopping for Sunday 
360552,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, My son and I were quite satisfied all in all We used the room only to sleep and the beds are quite comfy , Location and the 2 female staff were so helpful and pleasant Sorry I didn t get their names especially the lady who speaks excellent English 
360553,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Although in the center it was quite noisy late night and early morning The breakfast was not to our liking The hotel lobby smelled like fish , the hotel was located in the center of everything 
360554,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Very hot room Aircondition is so bad and not working good Left is very bad Room toilets is so bad and towel are very old The blackout cirtines does not hide sunshinelight perfectly Room size is so small No coffee or facilites in the room Very high room rate around 192Euro per night I could not stay all my reservation so i changed the hotel next day to Hotel Royal Ramblas infront of Hotel Serhs Rivoly Rambla with a less rate cost me 150Euro night I dont recommend Hotel Serhs Rivoly Hotel in Barcelona , Location
360555,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Can t find one , I can t find one thing that I dislike about this hotel The location is perfect we can see the street of La Rambla right from our window The room is decorated beautifully and very clean It is only 5 mins or less walk from Pl Catalunya which is also where you can get your Aerobus to ride to the airport 
360556,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, I wouldn t rate this as a 4 star hotel More like UK 3 star A little pricey It s an old building obviously but the room and communal areas were very clean , The hotel is situated on La Rambla within a 5 minute walk to Placa Catalunya where the airport shuttle bus stops and the tour buses run from Fabulous location Easy walk to all of the sights we wanted to visit Staff all friendly and helpful even at 1am when our door key wouldn t let us in the room 
360557,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, room comfort we asked for a stand to accommodate for our suitcases but this seemed to become an issue room beautifully decorated but not practical some more hooks would have helped, location room size deco breakfast
360558,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, There was a blackout late at night staff could have handled the situation better It was too dark to locate my room after climbing several flights of stairs no assistance was offered no torch or matches were available I had to leave the hotel find a shop which sold a cigarette lighter to be able to locate my room the blackout was not the hotel s fault but assistance to guests could have been better handled , Great location
360559,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla,No Negative, Mosty I liked was they gave me a room that I had asked when I made a reservation comment It was on the silent part of the hotel Thanks for that And the best part is the location of the hotel You can walk to every side and also metro is really close 
360560,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Our first room was an inside facing room with NO light coming in from the frosted over window The light in the suite itself was inadequate and it was like a dungeon AWFUL and depressing Requested a move to a new room and this made a huge improvement to the situation , After spending one night in a dark and dungeon like room we requested another room This second room had a balcony facing a quiet street lots of light coming into the suite and we really enjoyed having the balcony 
360561,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, I liked everything and would return Will highly recommend , It was a great stay we enjoyed being close to Ramblas Plaza principal Clean and comfortable accomodations 
360562,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, For the price it was a taxi fare away from the main attractions which made it a bit expensive, We had an upgrade to a great room with lots of space and light
360563,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Front desk receptionist was rude She did not give priority to people checking out especially those who needs to be at the airport earlier that day Instead was busy checking in 14 people even though rooms weren t available , Great location 
360564,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Facilities not as described expected terrace bar there was a terrace but no facilities poor gym facilities need to be booked in advance Staff were very impersonal, Central location
360565,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, There was a problem at checking out booking com made a mistake but it took good 40 mins to sort it all out as the staff kept saying that booking com never makes mistakes and kept insisting the problem is on our side,No Positive
360566,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, I didn t like the stairs you had to go up in order to get to some of the rooms on any of the floors Also I took a cab from the airport to the hotel and the cab driver said it would be approximately 30 which it was during rush hour traffic then when I went to leave early am with NO traffic it was suddenly 40 The bellhop at the hotel I believe was in cahoots with the cab driver ,No Positive
360567,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla,No Negative, Location is fantastic The staff is very friendly Even though the room was straight above the Ramblas we slept soundly thanks to the soundproof sliding doors 
360568,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Power went out twice for hours internet slow and intermittent no tea or kettle in room Separate doonas and sheets for a couple, Great room over looking la rambla Comfy beds Shower pressure Excellent location Friendly staff

360570,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Nothing at all , We had a super friendly welcome from Annette who also upgraded us to a lovely suite on the top floor with an amazing balcony Could not have asked for a better stay 
360571,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, They could have a person on the terrace at the top of the building who serves drinks nibbles as you watch the sun go down It would be popular We went up there but no one else was using it, Very comfortable bed Great location Very helpful reception staff especially in the afternoon Lovely deck on top of building
360572,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Bathrooms need a really good clean the black tiles didn t help but it all felt a little grubby , Good location good size room and liked the small balcony Staff were friendly and helpful 
360573,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, The room was a little on the small side but we didn t spend much time in the room so not that big of a deal , The staff was very nice and accommodating and the hotel was very clean and in a great location 
360574,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Room was so small Admittedly stayed in the small double but definitely not that comfortable for 2 people also a completely glass bathroom so could see in at everything , Superb location right on the rambla 
360575,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Breakfast didn t start until 7 which made it rushed when we were departing for the airport , Great location room was large not sure if it was upgraded but it was very spacious 
360576,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Room sometimes noisy e g banging doors and dull internal decor , The location was excellent Some of the staff particularly Carlos at the front desk were very helpful 
360577,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, 1 The hotel is old It needs to renew specially the WC 2 The walls are very thin and the window isn t isolated well So I couldn t sleep after 9am because of annoying voices comes from the corridor and the La Rambla street 3 The rooms are very narrow and small We couldn t even opened two bags together 4 The room isn t deserve the cost 5 The Lifts are narrow and need maintenance , Great location Good stuff
360578,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, When I placed the reservation I made sure to state that the booking was ON CONDITION that we were allocated a room with a proper double bed and NOT two single beds pushed together On arrival we had two single beds pushed together They were even made up with bedding for two single beds THIS WAS NOT WHAT WE HAD ORDERED PAID FOR We asked to be reallocated a room as requested and receptionist was VERY unhelpful saying they were unable to do so I asked for the bed beds to be made up with linen for a double bed so that we could use it as a double to be told that there were no housekeeping staff available I insisted that linen was brought to our room and I had to make it up myself Also the advertised roof terrace was not open when we tried to visit it , Location on the Rambla was excellent 
360579,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, The only thing I didn t like was that we didn t stay longer than we did , Hotel was absolutely stunning Staff were extremely helpful and the rooms were absolutely spotless Location was excellent 
360580,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Staff was extremely unhelpful and unfriendly While our room was renovated they put us on the first floor overlooking construction It was noisy from 7am and when we asked to change they said they had no availability even though online it said they had options We ended up changing hotels , Great location Good price we booked at a discount 
360581,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Can think of anything, Smoking off of the balcony Large bathroom Sitting area with desk Nice large room Just outside the hotel is the Ramblas the sight seeing bus stop is close by The staff was excellent
360582,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, The lift is sooo small, I and my husband and my daughter stayed at the hotel from 30 March to 6 April 2016 when we arrived at night we have shocked when we see our room because it was very small and not suitable for us as a family with many luggage but the next day we talked to Mr Carlos Nogueira who is very cooperative smart and friendly he has changed our room to another one that was more comfortable and overlooking the street the location of the hotel is more than perfect you are in the middle of Ramblas street the most famous street in Barcelona and all the staff of the hotel are kind and friendly The only disadvantages is the Internet connection it was bad and disconnected a lot and the lift is very small 
360583,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Air conditioning was set only to provide heat and that too at night only If it gets warm I was told to open the Window As it was the first week in April we found that the room did get warm from the afternoon onwards Breakfast was not worth the 15 Euro So after the first morning we went ro a nearby place which served a good breakfast at half the cost Eventhough I booked more than two weeks in advance my Comfort Room at the back had a window which opened on to a wall They told me that the hotel was full and also that the front Rooms would be noisy from the Street Although both the Rooms were generally clean there was dust in corners and at edges of the room Bathroom door would not close properly as the door had sprung Restaurant did not have an attractive Menu , Location was right at Las Ramblas which was excellent Many places to eat close by Very close to Placa Catalunya Reception Staff were friendly and courteous After two nights in a Room at the back with little light on request they transferred us to a Room facing Las Ramblas for the remaining two nights This was good and there was not much noise from the street up on our fourth floor front Room 
360584,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, old hotel Not clean We book one double bad and recive two singles I complain and the unswerer was that this is a city hotel and there is huge demands for singles bads , Location
360585,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, I did not like that my windows were in front the wall I could not even se was it raining or not I did not take breakfast as I noticed that there were not fresh provisions but in packages , I liked nice spatial room with very nice bathroom
360586,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, not worth 5 stars air con didn t work 30 degrees inside the room the only solution found by the conciergerie is to open both the door and window to have some air extremely noisy you can hear door slamming all day long and early in the morning Extremely unpolite reception worker no greetings not helpful the only positive fact about the hotel is its location a few steps from the boqueria,No Positive
360587,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, The standard room we were in Room 608 was right next to the main atrium and it rained the night we stayed there so it was the noisiest room and we didnt sleep that night at all Also we didnt realise there was an electrically operated blind next to the bed so we slept with the curtain open all night and it was bright in our room overnight Finally and this is Booking com s fault the room rate said breakfast was included but actually it wasnt so we turned up for breakfast which looked lovely and we couldnt have it unless we paid extra , Bed was comfortable in the upgraded room Clean modern and a great shower
360588,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, The wi fi could ve been more consistent The rumbling of the metro below the hotel obviously couldn t help that perhaps a room higher up would ve reduced the rumbling , Location was just brilliant Bed was one of the most comfortable we ve slept in in a hotel The room 23 was massive but perfect temperature excellent view over Las Ramblas The closing partition doors to the seating area by the windows reduced notice levels 
360589,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Small details A metallic shampoo holder in the shower had rust on it It was unfortunate as everything else in the room was tip top Door to toilet was see through glass not the best choice of material , Room was very nice and tidy Great location La Rambla is naturally a busy street but the noice level was more than acceptable Friendly and efficient staff 24h check in is a big plus 
360590,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, We would have loved tea and coffee making facilities in our room which is standard in all English hotels and we were a little dissapointed we had to pay to use the sauna jacuzzi as this is also free with all hotel stays in the uk, The staff and the room were fantastic we were very happy and they even upgraded us to the superior room Fantastic service
360591,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Tired bathroom unpleasant drain smell However was offered a change of room sink drainage was mended and an ambipur added to counteract the smell Restaurant food was good but the dining room was not very atmospheric , Great location Very helpful pleasant staff 
360592,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, It was a bit noisy since it s right next to the boulevard and the smell of the painting made my mom have a headache , The bed was confortable and overall facility was nice and perfect location
360593,Hotel Serhs Rivoli Rambla, Old hotel with the attendant consequences some strange smell somewhere and I would not recommend to take rooms with the windows on the auxiliary court, Nice location polite and helpful staff good price offering through Booking com good in general if you are walking a lot during a day and are not a fan of luxury
