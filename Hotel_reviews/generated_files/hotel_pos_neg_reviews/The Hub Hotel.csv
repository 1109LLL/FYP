486332,The Hub Hotel, Had to change rooms 5 times The first time the door wasnt locking another room the shower head was one shower away from knocking the user out one room the lights werent working another the blinds were faulty and another time we were downsized This may be personal but dogs are allowed at breakfast which can be uncomfortable for hygiene reasons but pets are allowed at the hotel so maybe it is to be expected Quite expensive to get from Malpensa to The Hub via taxi over 90 euros however there is the option of coach for 8 euros to milano centrale and a taxi from there to the hub at around 30 euros but of course it takes awhile longer Only found a couple restaurants nearby 20 minute walk I would say but I wouldnt recommend it just get the shuttle to Morino and get the train to restaurants I believe it is only ranked 4 star because of the gym swimming pool and spa facilities but it didnt feel worthy of a 4 star rating , The breakfast had a choice of bread cakes croissants cereal bacon sausages egg ham cheese juices coffee hot chocolate tea fruit although the watermelon looked like it had been there for the duration of the stay as in staff didnt change it but thats assumption from its appearance The free shuttle service takes 6 minutes to get to the train station where you can then explore Milan Without the shuttle I would ve labelled the location lower as there is not much around as getting anywhere from the hotel is quite expensive so grateful for the free shuttle The front desk staff were helpful although one was a little frustrated by the time we needed to change rooms from the third time onwards I thought it was quite cheap for 4 star but you get what you pay for 
486333,The Hub Hotel, Breakfast was disgusting and not much variety Worst breakfast I ve ever had at a hotel Awful location no shops nearby Nearest shop is a 10 minute drive away which is ridiculous Shuttle is per hour which is inconvenient, Great friendly staff and hotel facilities Clean room Free shuttle
486334,The Hub Hotel, The location was in an Industrial area which we didn t realise when booking We had to walk 1km from the train station no taxi s to be found anywhere The walk was terrifying burnt out cars everywhere filthy streets and generally not a good place to be with bags and no idea where we were We found out that the hotel had a driver when we got there No places to buy general supplies in the near vicinity This was a conference motel great for that purpose not for tired tourists , The staff at the hotel were wonderful they really went out of their way to make our stay as good as they could 
486335,The Hub Hotel, The name The Hub is quite ironic as there is nothing central about the hotel While it looks to be easily accessible by train and metro it is actually surrounded by highways and the only way in is by car or taxi around 20 from a close station While staff were helpful it didn t meet our expectations of four stars and it s tired state shocked us for a property under ten years old Our air conditioming started leaking into our room which they then shut off leaving us tossing and turning and in the heat having an awful night sleep The finish of surfaces walls was fairly poor and the elevator to the pool and gym was broken down Maybe we had bad luck I would highly recommend looking elsewhere for holiday makers as this place in my mind is best suited to business travellers working at the business park close by and with company credit cards to charge their taxis to , The breakfast was excellent
486336,The Hub Hotel, From the hotel provided the taxi for the driver who came with me try showd the magic because he told me he dosent know how to go to pero metro politana he went round round try to charge me more I suggest to keep only four cars attache to the hotel ss hotel taxies otherwise that is not good for the reputation for the hotel Thanks, Not bad but little noisee
486337,The Hub Hotel, The parking should have been included in the price of the room and the way to the parking was nor friendly, The hotel was great the breakfast was also great 
486338,The Hub Hotel,No Negative, The staff was really nice and went out if the way many times to help us out and make us feel comfortable The hotel is nice but the great staff is their biggest asset 
486339,The Hub Hotel, Impossible to get fresh air double windows don t allow opening even for a good airing of the room Bed was on the hard side too hard Room could use some TLC lacking attention to details desk was lacking a descent finish bed side reading light could use some Viagra didn t stay in the upright position shower walls gave a unclean impression , In general property is ok room could have been better
486340,The Hub Hotel, I had no hot water in my room for the 2 nights I stayed I reported this to the reception after my first night and they said they would look into it Got back that evening and still nothing was done and they told me the whole hotel doesn t have hot water today but they are calling maintenance and it was now 22 00pm Not happy It was cold outside and rainy weather and I was looking forward to a coming back to my hotel room for a hot shower , Went to the spa and really enjoyed the service Wonderful lady and did a good job 
486341,The Hub Hotel, Breakfast was poor and was noisey in hotel No air conditioning in room was too hot, Staff were very friendly and helpful with helping us find our way round
486342,The Hub Hotel, Very dirty hotel staff at the reception are really incompetent, Chef of the restaurant is great in fact chef and the restaurant are the only good things in the hotel
486343,The Hub Hotel, Parking access was difficult location view from window road one way system near hotel difficulties with bathroom plugs, Breakfast complimentary Easter eggs panoramic gym and pool shuttle service
486344,The Hub Hotel, The heating in the room could be better too cold for me personally The most annoying part was the fact that the hotel is hard to reach the closest metro station can only be reached by car the hotel provides a free of charge shuttle service but it only runs on an hourly basis from 7 23 , The breakfast was excelent It had almost all that we wanted from bacon to nutella The staff was super friendly and the hotel was clean 
486345,The Hub Hotel, But far from the station and didn t have bath tub in the bathroom, Staffs are very nice Sara the receptionist is very helpful Overall the hotel service is amazing Loved the hotel and the room 
486346,The Hub Hotel,No Negative, The location of the hotel is great for everyone who is traveling with car Otherwise you cannot walk anywhere as it is located between highways The room was surprisingly quiet and personal is very friendly 
486347,The Hub Hotel,No Negative, The staff were incredible Efficient So so friendly Lana and Lowendy helped us a ton The free schuttle from the hotel is a life saver so convenient and on time every hour I will definitely return to this hotel Absolutely impressive 
486348,The Hub Hotel, Room was a bit warm and the air was very dry during the night , Lovely spa excellent massage and breakfast was tasty nice that it went on until 10 30 and check out was at 12 00 good for sunday morning laziness Navetta service to the metro station was also very useful 
486349,The Hub Hotel, make sure to take your shampoo the hotel doesn t provide nor the shampoo or the conditioner You have to buy bottle of water for your room There is 2 single use pack of instant coffee They won t replace it for the next day until you insist ,No Positive
486350,The Hub Hotel, Location is useless to reach nearest metro or train station you have to depend on hotel small van that too you have to book in advance , Hotel is just ok like any other hotel but don t deserve 4star
486351,The Hub Hotel, Every day same breakfast No consideration for vegetarian Near by no restaurant or bar Nearest metro or railway station not at walkable distance No milk powder in room ,No Positive
486352,The Hub Hotel, Swimming Pool too cold Coffee cups in room too tall for the stir stick spoon would be better , Nice room shower good breakfast choice spa area 15 Euro extra but enjoyed it 
486353,The Hub Hotel, It s mostly a business hotel for people who are attending the fair in milano It s in the outskirts of milan near the motorway junction there is no convenient public transport ,No Positive
486354,The Hub Hotel, The hotel has a set of policies that all are set to look after the hotel and not the customer The variation between the website and the hotel offer was astonishing The reception staff were like security telling you of the roules rather to assist I HAD 17 TOTAL NIGHTS BOOKED over 3 rooms Very disappointed ,No Positive
486355,The Hub Hotel, Rooms are basically well equipped but coffee machine and heating was not working on the day of arrival Heating was fixed coffee machine unfortunately not Deluxe Room is not very special in comparison to other hotels rooms All in all the price for such a room is far too much and not recommendable also the centro of Milano is too far away to make spontaneous trips Maybe a good business hotel but not fro private reasons , Rooms are basically well equipped but coffee machine and heating was not working on the day of arrival Heating was fixed coffee machine unfortunately not But reception offered me a coffee for free on the day of my departure 
486356,The Hub Hotel, The bar and contemporary ambience, Extremely over priced basic accommodation Food and restaurant quite good The Spa was small with mixed sex changing from not acceptable No betterthan a UK or US 3 star at best 
486357,The Hub Hotel, Could do with a couple more in room facilities like complimentary bottled water tooth paste dressing gowns shampoo and conditioner , The atmosphere of reception is open and nice Rooms are generally nice and clean 
486358,The Hub Hotel, Broken key only one tea bag in a double room missing water boiler broken shower plate showering with feets in the pool the toilet had no window and no working fan or air system at all as it s high you can t open windows btw however the air conditiong system barely works if it does at all WORST OF ALL THE STAFF while encountering all those problems just in the very moment i was being crushed by the absence of fresh air in the room i was being lectured about the efficency of it AFTER HAVING ASKED THE MAN TO LEAVE THE ROOM It s unbelievable then being sadly replied over and over to our simple assertions about the things that objectively went wrong we left earlier so that we could escape thier rethoric ,No Positive
486359,The Hub Hotel, a bit impersonal in its design as it is typical for a huge hotel far from centre, staff was friendly and funny great value for a four star good breakfast pool overlooking the city big bed 
486360,The Hub Hotel, Spa additional charge even sauna Not mentioned on booking site last minute surprise Terrible bed not any comfort at all Strange design and weak room facilities, Restaurant is fine Good breakfast Friendly staff
486361,The Hub Hotel, Dinner was very poorly cooked you don t expect to get bad pasta in Italy , front desk staff are always very friendly and very efficient great location for the showground
486362,The Hub Hotel, Everything was nice but the temperature in the room was very low for my perception but we fixed it by turning it OFF In rest we were satisfied , The breakfast was nice Also very convinient was the shuttle so you dont have to walk to the closest train station The rooms are nice and comfortable and Sara from the reception was very kind and able to solve any problem 
486363,The Hub Hotel, Is abit away from Milan central but never a issue as it cheap to travel on Italian railways Pool was cold but again not a big issue once your were in it s was fine , Fresh breakfast lots of choice friendly staff Luckily enough to book our stay with the anniversary of hotel birthday Invited to the celebration Free buffet and drink Great night Room very clean a few dents and scratches due to the age nothing major Swimming pool with great view over the San Siro Shuttle bus excellent service never had to wait any length of time in pick or drop off 
486364,The Hub Hotel,No Negative, In general the hotel is clean quiet and well situated for my purpose as the event was nearby I had appreciated the shuttle The Hub hotel team is helpful and smiling I recommend this hotelI and I will back again 
486365,The Hub Hotel, The room temperature can not be set in the room but the reception has to be called for that The only duvet was extremely thin and the room was 18 degrees C The pressure in the shower was insufficient to take a comfortable shower Supper at restaurant was awful the inside of the involtino con verdure was frozen and the cotoletta very oily ,No Positive
486366,The Hub Hotel, As expected the hotel was in a very modern style What we didn t expect was that our superior room would have only one rather uncomfortable pseudo desk chair and it was really not a room to relax in The city view was uninteresting to say the least The furniture in the lounge was also very modern and rather hard and uncomfortable , It was walking distance to the Milan Expo about 25 minutes The shuttle bus service was useful for Certosa train station enabling one to spend the day in Milan We much prefer smaller hotels but we needed a convenient location to this area and the Hub fit the bill The staff were all very friendly and helpful throughout our stay The dinner in the restaurant was very good Now that the Expo is over it is probably good for a couple days if you have business in the area or want a hotel near the motorway 
486367,The Hub Hotel, A little cold at night and no blankets just two sheets I finished work at 11pm very tired and hungry and would have liked a bit more choice food wise e g a small range of sandwiches, Great room very clean comfy bed great shower good position for Expo and Milano Fiera regular shuttle service to and from hotel
486368,The Hub Hotel, The bath I our room was small and had a large shower partition Difficult to get out of bath shower I fact it is very dangerous, Vicinity to Expo and shuttle service to Expo and train station 
486369,The Hub Hotel, The only downside is that if you arrive by train to RHO Fiera station the taxi has a complicated drive to reach the hotel , Its a clean modern hotel We stayed here to visit the Expo It is a 10 minute easy walk the hotel have a courtesy car at 5 euros per person if you do not want to walk 
486370,The Hub Hotel, No shampoo or body lotion in the toilet so you have to carry your own if you usually depend on the hotel for that a bit overpriced , Staff is really friendly close to the Expo location with shuttle service for a fee Can also walk to the Expo Good for a couple of nights stay 
486371,The Hub Hotel, The pool area was not pleasant the hotel is located at a rather deserted area far from the city centre not convenient for public transport, Very close to the EXPO polite staff no problems with our dog good parking facilities
