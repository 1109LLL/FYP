346406,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, The menu was clearly displayed in the lift available 24 7 so we had decided what to have only to be told that there was only a lesser menu with very little choice because U2 we re on at the stadium and it will be busy not a good enough excuse if you have so many rooms you should be able to cater as advertised , Comfortable rooms and bathrooms
346407,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, Room was supposed to be ready for 15 00 We had a plane delay meaning we didn t arrive until 17 00 We checked in and found the room they had given us hadn t even been made up so returned to reception to get another one We had to wait another 20 minutes for a room to be made up so that was frustrating especially as the gates at the Arena to see our concert opened at 17 00 Staff were efficient in sorting it out though, Location for Amsterdam Arena was excellent
346408,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, The free wifi was not reliable I was only really able to log on and use it for about 3 hours of my stay The breakfast is WAY better than Holiday Inn express and the staff is always friendly and helpful ,No Positive
346409,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, I love everything , I really love the place it was quiet and far from the noise of the city The breakfast has so many choices The transport are very close like 5 minutes walk from the train metro and bus 
346410,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, The breakfast price is too much and the room fridge was empty , The hotel is very comod because it can be reached easly from the airport and you can reach easly the city center 
346411,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, A 5 min walk is required from the nearest metro train station , The staff and the standard of Holiday Inn It was nothing special and all met expectations 
346412,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, Room service was limited on Sunday putting the existing staff under extreme pressure , From the date we started dealing with the staff we felt very comfortable No question was too complicated to answer and was answered immediately received The dining facilities were adequate but we mostly used the coffe shop for a quick breakfast 
346413,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers,No Negative, The bed was comfortable Room was spacious and the bathroom was fantastic The staff were all very nice and helpful and the breakfast was great we enjoyed every second of our time there 
346414,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, Nothing , Everything perfect place to stay great staff great food great location amazing breakfast great transport links Great places to eat nearby love it def coming back 
346415,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, after a long day travelling couldnt book in till 3 yet person directly after me was allowed to book in also no coffee making facilities in room, location was great as was cleanliness 
346416,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers,No Negative, Chose this hotel as near to Ziggo Dome where I came from the UK for one day and night purely to attend a pop concert Was easy to get to hotel from airport via Metro and easy to walk to and back from at night Very safe and convenient Had trouble finding the hotel initially but on asking anyone could help with directions Staff were very helpful and friendly 
346417,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, There were some minor signs of wear and tear in the room and a little bit of dust , i arrived at midnight at it was no problem all staff were friendly and helpful breakfast is worth it and the additional starbucks meant I could have my coffee exactly how I like it in the morning I had a break in between meetings and could come back to the hotel to work in their open space area brilliant 
346418,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, Inadequate wifi in the room, The staff were so brilliant at the hotel particularly the manager Christel Every question and room adjustment we asked for was met with friendly smiley people who were always happy to help We got extra duvets tea and coffee in the room there was always fresh lemon water at reception just overall welcoming and comfortable Location was great less than 20 minutes from Centraal station by metro last metro back is about midnight and it costs 7EUR for a day pass to go all around the city by tram bus and metro Lots of food options near the hotel as well as their own lovely cafe restaurant which has great internet access and places to sit and plug in your phone or laptop Wifi in the room was pretty poor only complaint from me but could always connect in other parts of the hotel I would definitely recommend if you want comfort away from the craziness of the centre of Amsterdam but want easy and quick access to the centre 
346419,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers,No Negative, I was worried about the location as the hotel is not in Amsterdam city centre however travelling by train is very easy to and from the hotel The 3 day pass was excellent and meant that we could use the trams in the city centre too The hotel was extremely comfortable with very friendly and helpful staff even when we arrived at nine o clock on our first night the restaurant prepared a lovely meal for us 
346420,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, The air and he never worked in our room and even after we call maintenance twice to come and fix it Upon check out they only offered us free coffee and fifth if they would fix the air for the next guest That did not help us at all We were uncomfortable our entire stay, The staff was very friendly and it was it easy access to the train
346421,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers,No Negative, The room was very nice and the breakfast was perfect A little far from the city but it s only a 15 20 minute metro ride from the central station which is perfectly fine 
346422,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, Absolutely no provision for vegans The people in the cheaper part of the hotel got free breakfast but we didn t The room was incredibly dusty No conditioner provided with the shampoo, One of the desk staff and the man in the bar were lovely
346423,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, Pay attention to reach the good hotel Because we went first in the holiday inn amsterda and not in the Arena Tower Make sure to go in the right holiday inn , The breakfast is just amaaazing the staff is really good and kind The room is super clean and beautiful Close to the metro Really good hotel I recomend 
346424,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, I had to wake up in morning to repark my car in to shopping centre car park Is cheep 5 per day but it s open from 7 till 10, Bath tub with bubbles my favourite and caffe machine Plus everything else was excellent
346425,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, Way more bath towels liquid soaps shampoos slippers shower caps feel good stuff Selection of coffees and teas were a bit basic A fully stocked fridge with drinks snacks beer wine also was sorely missing , Cleanliness of room modern furniture Tv was decent and available WiFi 
346426,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, When my friend and I got to the hotel staff seemed extra rushed and were not very welcoming Upon entering our room my roommate and I noticed that the room had not been or had been minimally cleaned There was bloody snot left on the curtains and there were chunks of black stuff in the shower The shower had the smell of vomit lingering I called hotel reception to complain from my cell phone and was told I d get a response After waiting 45 minutes in the room we noticed that the phone in the room wasn t even functional When I went to reception it seemed like they were bothered and stressed at the fact that I had even requested a new room rather than being apologetic about it Not sure if it s a difference in customer service by country but it didn t feel very welcoming Total bummer from a hotel chain that is usually pretty solid in the US , Breakfast was pretty good The beds were comfortable and room temperature was good They have a semi starbucks located on the first floor which was pretty nice It s about 25 30 minutes away from the center of Amsterdam so if you plan on going into the city you ll need to plan properly 
346427,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, Unprofessional house keeper did not renew wash set in the room Ridiculous city tax ever living in such far away from downtown , Reception was friendly and breakfast was good 
346428,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, Breakfast staff are professional but not welcoming Seems like forced to do the service professionally Run out of Shampoos Soap Dont expect they provide you with the phone call or automatically in next make up Finally you should get it from reception in person , Near Bijlmer Arena station Standard Service Natural orange juice in breakfast menu
346429,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers,No Negative, The view and location was really pleasant to relax It was located in a quiet and enormous area with nice design It was close to metro station and did not take a long time to reach the city center 
346430,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, The receptionist at night ruined my stay completely The hotel states they provide 24 7 room service and when I tried to order I was told the food has run out and there s no where to get food from until the morning He was verbally abusive and racist towards me He didn t have a name badge on and refused to give me his name We were then told we would have complimentary breakfast the following day to apologise for the way we were treated but that never happened Someone walked into our room while we were sleeping then walked out the morning we were checking out The hotel claims to be close to the airport but it s 20 mins away by taxi which was very expensive The food is beyond bland and disgusting I ordered a Caesar salad and when it came it had loads of fish in it which it didn t state on the menu We ordered a margarita pizza and when it came there was eggs rocket and slices of tomato all over it The towels were left on the floor as advised when you want fresh ones and we had to call up and wait over an hour for clean towels Generally a horrible experience and would never stay at a holiday inn again purely based on how badly we were treated , The only thing that s good about this hotel is the location which is perfect if you have an event at the ziggo dome but if you don t your far from the airport and city centre 
346431,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, Just the view but it wouldn t be a reason for us not to book again, Staff at the hotel were excellent it was a busy and full I m the hotel at the weekend but the staff were still as friendly and accommodating
346432,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, Although we had required in our booking a double bed initially two single separated beds were given to us The receptionist was not accepting that this is a mistake of the hotel since double bed is a preference and not a requirement I did not like that I had to argue a lot before we finally get what we wanted , Personel was kind and helpful on providing information about the city and attractions 
346433,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, On arrival my cousin and I took a taxi to the the hotel The driver was very friendly but I thought the taxi seats did not look clean and I asked how much it would cost we were told it would be on the clock As we were traveling I looked for the clock and there was none to be seen On arrival he asked for fifty seven euros which for a twenty minute ride I thought that was a bit extortionate To us that was not a good start , Staff were extremely friendly and nothing was too much trouble Very helpful with information as to where places were and regards local transport A lovely stay 
346434,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, The pillows were very hard and too big Woke up with a stiff neck , The location was great for the event we attended at the ziggo dome and a train station was a 2 minute walk with a direct train to central station Hotel was clean spacious and staff were friendly Great value for money would recommend 
346435,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, Menu choice for evening meal very limited few options round about so returned to hotel for evening meal However food was better than it sounded on the menu , Great Breakfast Comfortable bed Nice clean modern room Friendly helpful staff

346439,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers,No Negative, Room and en suit were spotlessly clean and spacious Bar was lovely and open till 1am excellent for a quick nightcap Good value for money and a short walk to the Metro Train to central was a quick ride and we never had to wait long for one to arrive in either direction 12 Euro s each for unlimited 48 hour travel was very reasonable Would happily stay again and definitely recommend 
346440,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, The service wasn t very good Some of the front desk staff was helpful some of them weren t The room service was awful I sent two different orders back on two different occasions Way too expensive for the quality and quantity of food However the breakfast was nice , Good location shopping Imax theater restaurants and train station within a 5 minute walk 
346441,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, Nothing really I suppose to be petty the water pressure was rubbish Not enough tea sugar and milk but more was requested Even in an executive room the mini bar wasn t complimentary I didn t know this until check out , Comfy bed lovely room Bathroom was lovely and big with a massive shower and bath Excellent room service options Good location for the train Would stay here again 
346442,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, For a 7 days family holiday it was difficult not unpake our luggage The closet was wide enough only for one person for two days We asked to change the room for a better one but we were asked to pay for it In the booking information it was no information about this issue Being far from the center we could not came back in the afternoon for a break and so enjoy more the vacation ,No Positive
346443,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, food was too expensive 6 50 for a sandwich is a bit much very tasty though Bathroom was nice and clean however the water temperature kept changing in a wave like pattern one minute it was too hot then it was too cold , Friendly staff I read reviews saying the rooms are small they are but it s only a problem if you decide you want to come to Amsterdam to spend the whole time in your hotel room Otherwise the rooms are just the perfect size and are comfy and warm plus you can always to down to the mini gym or chill I was a bit worried about the location as I thought it was going to be kway out from centraal but it was only a 5 minute walk to the station and only 20 mins on the metro The local area was also very spacious since it s right next to the football stadium so I guess it can get quite busy when there s a match on 
346444,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, It s really hard to get back to the hotel if you want to stay in Amsterdam untill a little later Tram only goes there untill 00h30 After that you ll take 1h30 to get to the hotel if you get the night bus,No Positive
346445,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, So bad the room was dusty when we came in Also blonde hairs in the shower , Modern and good location with good staff Restaurant and lounge is inviting Has Starbucks cafe in hotel
346446,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, Breakfast and parking are on the pricy side but that doesn t seem uncommon in Amsterdam , The staff is mostly very friendly the rooms very comfortable and clean It s a 5 min walk to the metro station right at the Ajax Stadium From here you can get to the city centre in 15 min and you can also take the train directly from there for example to Rotterdam There are several shops an restaurants close by In the lobby there is a small Starbucks operated by the Hotel staff around the clock 
346447,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers,No Negative, Thanks to personal who allowed us to check in much earlier than it is required Also we asked for an extra bed and it was no problem to solve this problem for additional payment The breakfast is perfect Bellissimo 
346448,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, Breakfast price was way high 22 euro per person You have to have some cheaper options for example for 22 euro you can have a feast in city centre , The room it self 
346449,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, Bathroom glass door was poorly designed opening on to bedroom which meant near misses and disturbed sleep as light was put on in bathroom , Close to Train and metro to get about Good restaurants nearby at the arena 
346450,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, There was absolutely nothing to dislike about Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers They made my first trip to Amsterdam feel like my friends and home , 1 Holiday Inn is located in the very center of the three largest EDM venues I have ever attended 2 They provided a quiet and clean room after AMF making it feel like heaven 3 5 star Staff 4 Breakfast was awesome 5 Holiday Inn was so good to me that there was no question in my mind that they will own my business in 2017 for AMF

346454,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, The breakfast selection is amazing however the cost is outrageous 21 50 per person for breakfast is crazy If we had more time we would not have eaten there due to price , The rooms were very clean and the location excellent It is close enough to the airport and the center of Amsterdam We only had a a short time in Amsterdam and the location allowed some time to sleep and see the city I would recommend taking the train The hotel is super close to the train station Just ask around at the airport about what train to take The hotel staff is very helpful in telling you which train to take to get the city center Would stay here again for sure 
346455,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, We couldn t log on to the Wi Fi in the evening but could in the morning it was great then I admire the Netherlands concern for climate change wish there was more concern here in the US It was funny though in our room lights didn t work phone didn t work It didn t matter for we were exhausted In the morning we found out about inserting the card in the slot ,No Positive
346456,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, One night at the bar restaurant one of the young members of the hotel staff was by herself and seemed overwhelmed with the number of people and was unable to even take an order for me I told her I wanted to order she responded she was busy I waited for 10 minutes and finally gave up , Most of the personnel is extremely friendly helpful and attentive 
346457,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, Didn t have breakfast included and the hotel wants to charge 21 50 PER PERSON , Bright airy room and good access to the metro to get into city centre 
346458,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, Rude Staff knocking on my door all morning in a noisy manner and the person was rude in talking and was like ill charge you so and so for being late in checkout Charge what you want but dont disturb the customer , New location is OK
346459,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, Nothing in particular , The hotel is new and very clean the staff was very helpful and kind It is not close to the city center but the metro station is just 5 10 minutes far away and it connects directly to the most important attractions Also the connection to Schiphol airport is very good as the bus station is very close and bus no 300 connects directly to there Breakfast is very good and has a lot of choices 
346460,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, The room was dirty And housekeeping was negligent and careless Our bathroom was really dirty We didn t get shampoo bodygel toothpaste Our soap and our toilette paper was used not original And there was some patch like blood on the floor The fridge was bad there was water at the bottom , Staff was really nice corteous helpful perfect They gave us a perfect serve Breakfast was perfect

346464,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, No comment , The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful when going into the city and also booking a taxi Excellent location for the ziggo dome and the Amsterdam arena football stadium Around 15mins to the centre on the train but it was an excellent service 11thJune 12th June

346466,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, A small point but the floors in the showers were slippery , The staff were excellent They were the most helpful and polite that I have met We had a major problem because we lost our passports and the reception staff made every effort to help us I would recommend that all Holiday Inn staff spend a part of their training in this hotel to understand what service is all about The food in the restaurant was also very good 
346467,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, Nothing , Great staff very welcoming Nice bar area serving good food The home made bbq sauce is lovely Very good location for the Ziggo Dome and easy access to Metro for short trip into central Amsterdam Great value for money 
346468,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, Size of the towels in the room poor Tea and coffee facilities in the room and awful uncomfortable Pillows , Location breakfast check in service We stayed here to see Mariah Carey at Ziggo Dome and the location was PERFECT 
346469,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, The bed and the pillows were not as comfortable , Located near Bijlmer Arena station so access convenient Good layout for breakfast buffet Courteous staff Upgraded to a new suite with a 180 deg view 
346470,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, The windows were not to be open and no fresh air available I hate hotels with sealed windows I feel like a prisoner Even for safety reasons when there is a very high building there are always options to apply a stop and have the windows at least a little bit opened The other thing I considered very strange is the very limited cheese varieties for breakfast in a country where cheese is a national emblem In addition the cheese seemed old and dried out , Very nice location very friendly staff very clean The food in the restaurant was really good Vary tasty very fresh Excellent idea to have the all day dining option 
346471,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, Included breakfast in the price of the hotel Thats all, How friendly the staff was and the fact that you upgraded me for free for my anniversary what was very much appreciated It was amazing and the breakfast was amazing I cant fault anything about this hotel had a amazing time

346494,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, 20 euros per day for parking your car that s a lot of money even for Amsterdam The hotel knows it because they asked us at least 3 times if we knew how much they charged , We stayed in this hotel for the first time 5 nights There were almost no guests during the first days of our stay which meant that the very good breakfast buffet was not completely on display but you only needed to ask Very friendly personnel clean room best bed I ever slept in ample and easily accessible parking space We also ate in the restaurant no complaints there hand cut fries but a little bit too expensive 5 minute walk to metro and from there direct tram to city center Shops cinema restaurants within walking distance 
346495,Holiday Inn Amsterdam Arena Towers, The location is far away from the city centre and main tourist attractions However it is close to the tram station Breakfast is expensive no good malls around, Closeness to the tram station Wifi was good the room was wide starbucks 24 7 within the hotel tea coffee facilities within the room
