74223,Park Plaza London Riverbank, more comfortable orthopedic mattress is our personal preference for better sleep, tasty breakfasts beautiful window view and kind helpful staff there created amazing atmosphere of our pleasant mornings our special thanks are to the Manager Vasiliy as well as to Vasile and Alina who mainly contributed to our positive mood and amazing pleasant staying in the hotel 
74224,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The tv picture quality was very poor and the shower water pressure wasn t very strong in my room , Very comfortable room and a great size for 2 or like me a single person who likes extra space executive suite I got a part river view on the 16th floor which I wasn t expecting However definitely request a high floor number if you re not directly facing the river as the very tall Corniche Building to the west will block out a lot of light Very friendly and helpful staff 
74225,Park Plaza London Riverbank, They did not do any of my request I for even though I rang up 3 days before to guarantee it was done If your looking for a romatic break this is not the place ,No Positive
74226,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Bar prices could be cheaper , Very clean room Bed was exceptionally comfortable Fantastic view of the Thames and Westminster Staff very friendly and helpful Food was excellent 
74227,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The view from the room was poor looking across to other rooms No outside view at all Very wet rainy on first day concierge had no umbrellas to pass out , The breakfast was very good and set you up for the day Found the beds to be very comfortable All round very pleasant stay 
74228,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Very dusty under beds didn t going looking underneath you could see under as had raised base on bed crumbs on floor friends from previous guests Tea could have been hotter at breakfast but we got a fresh pot once we had asked the waiter the first one came from the end of a large pot of tea Also tables in restaurant very low felt crouched over when eating and I am not very tall , staff very friendly and helpful nice clean linen and towels 
74229,Park Plaza London Riverbank, If you are the type of tourist that walks a lot to save transportation money this hotel is not for you I did not have any other food choice beside the hotel restaurant and the room service I personally feel that the location is not as good as advertised Yes it is next to the River Thames but there is really nowhere to eat shop nearby I would not mind walking 20 minutes to the city center to get some food but we have to remember the saying It s always raining in England Twenty minutes of walk under the rain can get very uncomfortable But to be fair there was a big construction surrounding the building so some restaurants shops might be closed during my stay , I was given a room in their new floor and it was amazing The room feels very cozy and modern with comfortable bed They have a Smart TV with some pay to play new movies installed which is a big plus for me as a movie enthusiast that barely have enough time to go to a cinema The breakfast was delicious and totally worth the price Their dinner service at the Chino Latino Restaurant within the hotel has a limited food choice and very limited wine options but the food is great Room service food was very tasty too The hotel is located next to the River Thames with some taxis available on the hotel entrance It s about 20 minutes walk from the city center 
74230,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room could have been cleaner particularly the floor and bedside cabinets The queue for breakfast was something I would not have expected from an Hotel of this standard , Comfortable bed good sized room
74231,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The location of the hotel is approximately 10 mins walk from Vauxhall tube station So unless you take a taxi everywhere be prepared to walk If you get a room on the side of the railway lines it will be a noisy experience with disturbed sleep The trains run frequently past midnight and resume quite early in the morning , Park Plaza is quite a modern hotel on the Albert Embankment We booked a Superior double room which was generous in size and had a comfy bed We didn t spend a lot of time in the room but it was clean Facilities included WiFi satellite TV a keyboard that controlled the light mood AC and a safe which was useful The breakfast was superb with plenty of choice with the option to request items that were not on the buffet The staff were very friendly welcoming and happy to help We got a complimentary drink for our party of 8 which we redeemed in the hotel bar The front of house staff were great couldn t do enough for us Thank you to Don and Raheem to mention a couple 
74232,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Missing curtains couldn t tell what the weather was as although had a window couldn t see the sky, Loved the mood lighting temperature control and very clean comfy room
74233,Park Plaza London Riverbank, There were fire alarms during two separate nights Both turned out to be false alarms phew but the hotel evacuation during the first night was rather chaotic and did not really give me confidence that a real situation would be handled very well However the upside is that the fire station is literally 50m away , Very reasonably priced by London standards Good location nice room friendly staff 
74234,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Even though it s near the attractions it s a lot of walking around which I didn t mind but it did tired us out quickly , I loved how it was near attractions like the London Eye Big Ben Sea Life centre etc which was ideal for siteseeing as I ve never been to that part of London 
74235,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Could have been a book giving information e g check out times and meal times Also no food available in bar or restaurant after 10 30 Hard luck if you have been to the Theatre , Best view in London Brilliant bar and food 
74236,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The rate is not inclusive of breakfast At check in they do mentioned that if you order for breakfast the cost is 13 pounds if you walk into the restaurant you pay 24 pounds felt cheated ,No Positive
74237,Park Plaza London Riverbank, no robes in deluxe double room a bit shabby scratches on floor from sofa bed marks on the sofa looked like chocolate no curtains up on rails just lining ones the porter knocked on our room twice with bags that were not ours and we had room service knock at 7 15 am with breakfast we did not order even tho we had the DND sign lit up we had a problem in the bar with ordering but this was resolved by the manager oh and we did order room service when we got back from our night out i went to leave a tip on the charge only to be sniped at and told NO NO not on there the hotel just gets it there were some cleaning issues but as we had to wait for our room i take it they were pushed so we put up with a few hairs in the bath we used the shower and called for tea bags as we only had green tea i feel some of your staff let you down with there attitude in an otherwise beautiful hotel , Location was amazing Gay friendly lovely looking hotel amazing views room service menu is varied and not to harmful on the pocket easy walking to westminster and south bank
74238,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Had to phone for toilets rolls and for someone to replenish the coffee sugar milk tea hot chocklet sachets in the room and when the staff did this they were obviously upset so they just threw all the sachets down on the table and I had to re pack all the goods into the holder myself , The Hotel Staff Reception Consierge 1st Floor Bar staff and 12 floor bar staff excellent 
74239,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We used both of the Breakfast Tea teabags in our room on the first morning and they were not replenished despite our asking , Great location for my visit to London just across the Thames from the Houses of Parliament The beds were super comfortable The rooms were a decent size for central London The room and the hotel generally was beautifully clean The staff were helpful and pleasant 
74240,Park Plaza London Riverbank, See above , The room allocated overlooked building works I felt the room was dusty and smelt of dust The shower was stiff to turn on I had stayed previously in Plaza Riverbank at that time I was allocated a very nice room overlooking the river 
74241,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Our room was at the side of the hotel and we could hear the trains at the back Have stayed at this hotel twice before and never had any noise so disappointed this time , Comfortable beds good choice of breakfast Even made us a packed breakfast one morning as we had to leave at 4 45 am 
74242,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Room 1550 window was very small you can not see any thing from it bad smell of the room and the hotel staff were not able to change the room for 15 nights while the other room 1553 was good , The air conditioner and light control
74243,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We travelled from Australia and spent a total of 13 days at this Hotel 6 in the beginning and seven at the end of the holiday We had trouble with house keeping in the first six days room not attended too after being out all day and so no tea to make a cuppa before bed When we went to book out after the first six days I asked the member of staff we dealt with would it be possible to have a river view for the seven days on our return but she curtly replied not on your deal The last seven days three of which had no house keeping at all until my husband spoke to a very nice gentleman on the desk would we stay here again No Would we recommend this hotel No When along way from home one needs to be a guest in a hotel that appreciates their patrons ,No Positive
74244,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, The little things such as having chocolates delivered to your room each night and concierges were extremely helpful and knowledgeable From check in to check out the service was second to none 
74245,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Since the room was facing the inner yard there was a lot of noice from the Airconditioning compressors on the roof assumption It is very noisy If you open the window to let some fresh air in Otherwise one has to rely only on the room AC and I am not certain if it is designed to supply fresh air or if it is only circulating the room air , EXcellent location for visiting the London Eye Thames Cruises London Aquarium etc Just a 10 minutes walk The hotel is new with all modern light and AC controls Staff is informed helpful fast and efficient Check out is extra fast The bathrooms are modern and kept very clean bed is comfortable 
74246,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The breakfast was someting you would have in 2 or 3 star hotels and it wasn t what you would expect from a 4 star hotel , The view from our room was amazing and also live music at the restaurant was perfect and singers specially the young gentleman had beautiful voice 
74247,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Slow WIFI, Great view over the Thames whilst enjoying dinner the steak was fantastic Only 1 issue i had was the WIFI was pretty slow other than that a very comfortable stay 
74248,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Quite a bit of the equipment in the room was either faulty window closing or broken door to the store in the lounge , Free upgrade to Junior Suite Bathroom facilities were excellent
74249,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Noise My room location near the tracks and planes taking off made for interrupted sleeping , Loved the breakfast and dinner It was varied and comfortable The Dining Area is beautiful as well 
74250,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Breakfast experience could be better with more attentive staff We had to ask for more tea and coffee on both mornings and they were slow to respond to any request despite there being several staff walking round Other than that staff were excellent, Stylish room with all the facilities you would expect from this standard of hotel Enjoyed the many options of temperature lighting etc and the to was a great size for that room 
74251,Park Plaza London Riverbank, For this kind of hotel and prive you have more expectations and facilities Not very personal location is very nice , The beds and shower Great facilities in the room 
74252,Park Plaza London Riverbank, See above, The first room we were given had a balcony with a lot of bird poop on the floor of it They immediately moved us when we complained Food in restaurant was very expensive for what you got Do not order a bottle of water if on a budget 8 Can is way too much and we feel the bottle was resealed Had aftertaste Staff was very good all around some exceptional 
74253,Park Plaza London Riverbank, General cleanliness of rooms not very good and there was a horrific smell in the bathroom not much room in shower and pressure poor Wouldn t stay here again , God Location
74254,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Breakfast was too expensive Some furniture was stained and the floor was scratched but nothing horrible , Loved the river view have to request The bedroom and sitting room were separate The staff was helpful and friendly Room service was reasonable Very modern feel but comfortable 
74255,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Our electric curtains were broken, Comfy beds lovely shower digital controls for the room were a nice touch The nearest tube Vauxhall was only a 10 min walk away 
74256,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The roomckeaber the staff friendlier check in clearer and more friendly tge bar more welcoming They charged service charge when you walked up to the bar to order a drink Breakfast a mess with a 20 minute queu So disappointed , The hotel was dirty The staff really didn t care even though I told three different staff including a manager i didn t want to resort to giving negative feedback as I understand the impact that this feedback can have on a business But tge genuinely did not care 
74257,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, The view from my suite on the 9th floor was superb Electronic control panel for air con lighting and curtains sadly this wasn t working Cosy bar with live music Fantastic hotel and can t wait to stay again 
74258,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Chino Latino breakfast is not worth it , Large room high tech controllers for light a c and curtains and modern decor Chino Latino view is amazing 
74259,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Very nice breakfast Good sized clean rooms They also let us change in the gym area after we had checked out and after a long hot day before going out to a concert 
74260,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, I had booked an executive room but was placed in a premium room I had a 9 day stay and at day 3 I asked if I was in an executive room I was not in an executive room They comped me breakfast for the remainder of my stay I was pleased They knew I was not getting the amenities of an executive room and would fix it Twenty four hours later I was still not getting the extra amenities Talked to guest services again They offered to move me to another room they provided the amenities I had been missing and they sent me wine and chocolates as a means to make things right I liked that they wanted me to be a satisfied guest 
74261,Park Plaza London Riverbank, family rooms or adjoining rooms, The dining was excellent food tasty and creative menu met tastes of entire family of four including two teenagers Dining room very friendly and accomadating staff we loved the dining 
74262,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The hotel was beautiful but several satisfactory variables downplayed our experience The location was fairly akward to get to in regards to public transportation the view of the room we we allocated was terrible Myself and partner were placed in a room where we faced the next building in development construction I specifically booked this hotel becasue it was by the Riverbank and hoped to enjoy the view I look forward to booking other stays at Park Plaza locations and strongly believe this is a one time situation , The bed was comfortable
74263,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Price as we received an email advertising hotel for 65 less per night than what we paid Unfortunately for the hotel we received it while we were staying there, Located on the Thames so lovely walk to and from hotel
74264,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We lost power the morning we were leaving so it was hard to get readp, Out of the hustle and bustle but a quick walk to underground or Westminster bridge and waterloo
74265,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Length of time it took to get checked in as the queue was long not all receptionists behind the check in desk were utilised to ensure a smoother faster check in I asked the breakfast staff for poached eggs but never got them individual serving us seemed to have disappeared after my request , Decor and cleanliness of the room Breakfast was also delicious although the service left a lot to be desired I also appreciated the availability of ice and ice buckets Bed was lovely cosy and and ensured a good night sleep
74266,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Almost 50 for breakfast seemed very expensive indeed And there wasn t any chamomile peppermint tea which is all I drink in the mornings Might be worth warning people that the trade off for the excellent view is that the traffic can keep you awake at night , The room was spotlessly clean and very comfortable and the view was outstanding 
74267,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Appalling service on arrival First allocated room that was already occupied Then allocated second room but the key didnt work Then given a room on 13th floor but no instructions how to find it Allegedly upgraded but rooms only difference was a nespresso and some slippers, Excellent evening meal in Chino Latino
74268,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Staff not as helpful as other hotels in London we have stayed with and felt it was slightly over priced but none the less a lovely hotel, Nice spacious rooms and bathroom with good in service rooms
74269,Park Plaza London Riverbank, not the best of view from our room faced other hotel rooms which wasn t great but it didn t detract from our stay , Great location for us as we were attending a concert at Twickenham Stadium Stress free tube journey from Euston to Vauxhall and a short stroll along the embankment to the hotel Great views from the hotel of the Houses of Parliament Friendly check in staff who were very efficient and helpful Room was very comfortable with a great design and plenty of room We got room service when we got back so can recommend the late night Pizza 
74270,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Smell from bathroom automatic service charging needed to ask for tea bags only two for two people over two days View from room obstructed by scaffolding I STAY INOVER 30 HOTELS A YEAR AND THIS WAS THE WORST VALUE FOR MONEY I HAVE EVER STAYED IN, Size of room
74271,Park Plaza London Riverbank, No cons This hotel is one of the best ive stayed in Ill definitely be back , The hotel is modern and luxurious The location is excellent great view of big ben and parliment buildings and the train station is only minutes away The facilities were great including the concierges and the business centre The little extras in our room were amazing too Nespresso machine full range of tea coffees and hot chocolates a fruit basket bottled water chocolates elemis shower products and complimentary slippers 
74272,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Housekeeping is horrible No change of towels or re utilize used towels with hair lipstick marks shoe prints etc I don t use lipstick and I didn t polish my shoes with the towels , Staff are friendly and helpful 
74273,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Things mentioned in the brochure weren t available e g Dressing gown slippers We didn t have breakfast tea only decafinnated tea Took three nights to get it Same for a teaspoon but got the milk next day Didn t replace the espresso pods for the duration 3 nights Charged us 3 50 for the 500ml water which should have been free We had to show the confirmation slip to get a refund Sent us an email that we could upgrade to a river view room for 23 night Applied for it but on registration they mumbled something like we have to get it through Bookings com I wouldn t recommend this to anyone Room without breakfast extra 21 person for over 200 per night Basically whatever you request the answer is no I e Because we didn t have a teaspoon went to the executive lounge asking for a teaspoon Guess what The waitress abruptly asked me phone reception Never again will I book this place, Comfortable bed clean bathroom
74274,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The absence of customer service in terms of changing our booking All it would take is for human intervention to resolve the problem not that hard , Weird electrical system in the room
74275,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, High quality bedrooms great restaurant Chino Latino Some minor refurb in progress to ballroom but well managed and segregated from guests Good to see a program of investment and refurbishment ongoing 
74276,Park Plaza London Riverbank, There is a floors which is not yet renewed so make sure you stay at the new floors they always miss cleaning my room although i am having the cleaning sign and once i back in the evening i found my room dirty and have to call the housekeeping and wait at the lobby till they finish this happen more than 4 times in my first 10 day of stay 50 failure there cleaning is suck and lake for the hygiene they don t vacuum floors for one week bed sheet not changed for 4 days or once you push them to change as there 4 star policy every 2 days toilets they don t clean it or even wipe it they just change the towels most of the staff are trainee and not professional on treating guests, Chino Latino Restaurant and Bar has a nice view and a daily live band with view into the river manager named James he was so good and make up the errors happen from housekeeping team by offering me an executive floor lounge access
74277,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Service in the restaurant was mixed They seemed to have a lot of new people working there The system for breakfast seemed disorganised in particular the process for ordering eggs was not apparent on the first day and then they took a long time coming with the rest of the breakfast going cold before they arrived We thought this hotel was very overpriced in comparison to other hotels we have stayed at in London Some of the staff were friendly but mostly the team were not overly friendly , Location and rooms were nice
74278,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The fact that they charge you the entire amount at check in plus 200 euros blocked for any additional costs complete lack of trust especially vis a vis someone who has stayed there for business several times before and is a member of their loyalty club The check in desk was attended by trainees who did not know what type of card can be used to pay guarantee the payment and messed up the processing of the payments I spent a lot of my time on the phone with my credit card company and at the reception desk to sort things out and never received a proper apology for what was a mistake of the reception desk personnel and errors in their system I also found that cleaning services could be significantly improved I agree with other reviewers who consider that the hotel lacks personality the personnel is not genuinely nice and it seems that there are perpetual renovations works in the hotel and around it In my view not worth the price Although I have to return for work in the area where is the hotel I will find other accommodation , it is close to the IMO 
74279,Park Plaza London Riverbank, A bath although rainfall shower was lovely I hadn t brought my phone charger would have been good to have had one available , Air Con was fab really efficient and quiet especially as London was scorching that night Best nights sleep in a hotel ever All staff were lovely nothing was too much trouble for staff at breakfast 
74280,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Getting to the hotel using the underground is a bit difficult especially with luggage , Hotel was very comfortable and I wrote a short walk to the main attractions 
74281,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Everything was great , Our room was really spacious The bathroom was beautiful and it was great to have a large bath tub and walk in shower Walking outside the hotel entrance door to the Thames and the views were incredible especially during sunset 
74282,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The hotel wanted to charge 50pound deposit per night so this would have been 150 for our stay Just to warn others as this is alot of money The room wasnt hovered properly so was little bits of dirt under the bed when we arrived , The lights and air con were all electronic 
74283,Park Plaza London Riverbank, There wasn t anything that we disliked , Hotel was amazing Fantastic location Great helpful staff Good location to tube great boat for food directly across the road 
74284,Park Plaza London Riverbank, They closed off half the lobby closed elevators no bottled water as advertised water dispenser was always empty staff never acknowledged us even at night only good service was the guy managing the taxis and pickups, Room was nice but small
74285,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Housekeeping was only adequate If a glass was let somewhere in the room it was likely to still be there when cleaners left Floors not throughly vacuumed daily , Attractive location upscale facilities helpful friendlly staff public transportation
74286,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Tea coffee facilities in room were inadequate and weren t fully restocked throughout our stay, Location perfect for walking to the local sites plus close proximity to tube rail station
74287,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Money is still being held on my credit card 3 days after I checked out and paid in full for my accommodation This is wrong Park Plaza and needs to be attended to as a matter of urgency I will contact you shortly,No Positive
74288,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Unfortunately I would say that unless you are on a business trip with a lot of money to spend it might not be for you Very expensive for a basic package Our room had a smell of sewerage in it which at times was very over powering Our towels when we arrived had holes in them and were all tattered When we ordered room service even though items were listed as available for room service we were told that they weren t Then when it arrived we paid the full amount and more only for the staff member to call to them room again saying we under paid On one occasion we went to the bar which at 5pm we were told was closed and they asked us to go to the executive lounge and we can have a drink there When we ordered our drink there we were charged a room service fee as the drinks had to be brought from the bar which is ridiculous Then a member of staff told us we would have to leave as we were not paying for the use of the executive lounge which was embarrassing as other guests were looking at us Even though he would not have known whether we paid for the use of the lounge or not he just assumed plus we had been told to use the lounge as the bar was closed To top it all off we were constantly looked at by the hotel staff as if we did not have the right to be in the hotel Whenever we would walk past reception we were given judging looks by the staff which made me feel uncomfortable Unless you are a wealthy business person I would not recommend staying here Also when we booked the room we were told there would be 50 deposit required but when we arrived they wanted 150 which again is ridiculous , Location was great Only a small walk to Westminster Our floor was very quiet which was nice for when we were relaxing after a long day out 
74289,Park Plaza London Riverbank, My only issue was the fact that when payment for the room was taking it was taking twice apparently due to an error I had mentioned this several times to the staff to them saying that it will be sorted and refunded in the next 48 hours It is near a week since payment was taking out off my account and it is still to be refunded I spoke to my bank about this during my stay and they told me to ask the hotel to get in contact with them so this can be sorted right away however the hotel did not do this and said everything was sorted , The hotel was stunning and very well presented It had everything you needed The location of the hotel was fantastic All located within all the local attractions that London has to offer The stunning views of the river thames and close to all local transport 
74290,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Main table always had dirty grime marks on side which never really got cleaned properly Would ve preferred for fridge to be easily opened but accept it was stocked for business customers as opposed to tourists , Pleasant comfortable room Easy access to most London attractions Staff friendliness and quick response to minor annoyances Bed was comfortable 
74291,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The breakfast is poor for such a hotel limited selection of food and it is served in the bar hence you seat on tables suitable to drink a gin tonic but not to have a comfortable breakfast The hotel is very big what makes the stay very impersonal this is not negative itself but I d had taken a smaller hotel if I knew , Location very near to the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey foot distance 10 min walk from Vauxhall Tube station on Victoria line direct line to King s Cross St Pancras train station 
74292,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Room had a number of faults which were poor for a expensive hotel Noise of trains from 5 30am Double glazing system broken so could not keep noise out Power curtains broken No hairdrier Only enough tea bags for 1 cup each Valet parking 15 45 overnight charge No info given about expensive parking , Size of room was good 
74293,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The shower didn t work the bath tub didn t drain the night door staff were rude and aggressive and behaved more like nightclub bouncers Upon check out I was given the wrong bill Truly awful experience , Nothing
74294,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Noisy location currently close to building site Very slow check in resulted in being 2 hours late into our room after a long journey , Stunning view across the River Thames 
74295,Park Plaza London Riverbank, View from our room was a wall Limited number of eating places nearby but not far to walk to over the river , Comfortable bed and good sized bathroom Spacious room 
74296,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, location quiet and great for first time tourist to London within walking distance to Big Bus stop The Eye and other attractions Doorman very obliging offering umbrella in bad wet weather Check in and out very quick and easy 
74297,Park Plaza London Riverbank, First night my room was next to the bar restaurant area and was loud all the way up to 3am I moved rooms but was not offered compensation for a very poor night , Nice breakfast and staff very attentive at breakfast
74298,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Mini bar wasn t re stocked after first day for rest of stay for a 3 night stay Food ordered on room service was cold by it arrived , The welcome package a complimentary bottle of prosseco and chocolates was lovely as was the view 
74299,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Our second night that we stayed there was no bath mat or face washers provided like the previous night, We were treated amazing for our stay given champagne and fruit platter on arrival and the view was simply amazing
74300,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We booked an executive room which was not ready when we arrived had to wait for one hour They should make more of an effort for the executive rooms Last night we had already checked out and wanted to get something to eat at the bar we were told by the bar staff the kitchen is closed and there is no way to order anything Only room service Went to the concierge to get our bags and ask again about food were told we can order room service in our room which was a bit patronising as we had just mentioned we had already checked out He said there is no way to order any food Then i heard the receptionist tell a guest that she can go to the bar and they can order room service no problem and eat at the bar When i told her what the other staff had told me she was a bit embarrased and said they should have said yes For almost 300 euro a night I expected MUCH MORE ,No Positive
74301,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We are on holiday out all day exhausted from sight seeing back to hotel not been cleaned no tea or coffee to make a drink toiletries non existent because no one cleaned the room for three days until my husband went down to Foyer and asked nicely for it to be done Will not stay here again in total we had eleven days stay beginning of June and from the 23 rd 29 th,No Positive
74302,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Great location Rooms were very basic but had everything you need There is a lot of construction in the area so the rooms were very loud early in the morning We also found the concierge desk was a lot more expensive for show tickets then the theatres themselves 
74303,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Shame there wasn t enough tables for breakfast only the low ones We ve managed to have our breakfast ok but not so comfortable Also when I was making the booking I felt it was clear to me that two prices represent breakfast or without I ve chosen with and when I arrived at the hotel my details appear to show that I hadn t include breakfast Could booking com write to me to explain that please Thanks, Friendly staff excellent facilities Very accommodating to my requests for my friends birthday Upgraded the room and found refreshments upon arrival It made my friends birthday celebrations very special she loved the whole stay and so did I We also loved reading the inspirational quotes on the carpet such a good positive way to start your break 
74304,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Only wish we could have had more nights to enjoy this property and exciting city When I return to London there is no doubt where I will stay , The location was so convenient to important places in London but was away from the traffic and noise Showed up without having done any homework and immediately the concierge sorted us out with bus and cruise sightseeing and a London show day of I told them it was my granddaughters birthday and they sent champagne and fruit to our room Amazing breakfast buffet with a fabulous view 
74305,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Was really looking forward to staying in this Hotel after being recommended by a friend however there were a couple close by our room who decided to argue for most of the night The kept us awake most of the night I reported this to reception on my departure, Beautiful Hotel well position on the River Thames
74306,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room that was given to us was blocked by a tall building and nothing to see from the other side There was an option to take the riverside but the price was not reasonable , The location is the best and made our the only one day stay memorable Our trip was a transit from Oxford to the Airport 
74307,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The bird poo on our balcony, Staff were amazing nothing too much trouble Extremely hot day when we arrived and free chilled bottled water was handed to us without any trouble Marius our Concierge couldnt do enough for us Lovely helpful young man 
74308,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We felt the price of room only was excessive , This hotel is very modern in an excellent location It is very clean and overall the staff were efficient and very courteous The bar staff were also very pleasant and we would like to recommend a lovely young lady whose name is Aga who comforted my husband following a minor head injury 
74309,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Very good somewhat posh hotel in great central location Excellent service from checking in and out laundry service and room service Beautiful breakfast restaurant overlooking the river Good ambiance friendly staff 
74310,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Vauxhall is becoming a popular modern area after hundreds of years of being tacky and dangerous The rumor was the USA Embassy is moving to this neighborhood That accounts for all the riverside condo high rises by the hotel Hopefully this means there will be more restaurants and pubs in the hotel area Now one must walk 20 minutes downriver towards the London Eye for eating places The hotel is a ten minute walk to the tube station which is also a rail road station and can be confusing The hotel restaurant was fine for breakfast and room service but not a place we d care to eat a real meal Taxi rides to west end theatre were nerve racking because of traffic The tube was faster If any criticism can be levelled at the hotel it is just TOO modern No English charm whatsoever The gym was inadequate for such a high priced 4 star hotel , Yes the eggs were extra fluffy and the bed was fine We paid extra for a room with a view which made the stay extra wonderful The grandchildren however had an inside view with no view whatsoever Easy riverside walks to three bridges going into the city of Westminster The breakfasts though expensive were worth not having to go out and search The BEST part of the hotel was the concierge staff Bradley and Tony and the others helped us immensely for tours taxis and airport runs The staff at the desk were so calm and helpful and professional Being on the south side of the river after maybe 10 trips staying in the west end was a new experience The Rose pub just down the street had top rate pub food 
74311,Park Plaza London Riverbank, On arrival we had to wait quite a bit and due to some of our foreign friends not appreciating the art of queuing we kept getting cast aside There should have perhaps been more staff on reception as there were only two although there were 4 desks in total However this didn t impact my overall experience of the hotel as naturally sometimes there are just busier spurts and that can t be helped , The hotel room was much more than I expected with little gimmicks like the control pad next to the bed to open or close the electronic curtains which made the whole experience that bit more luxurious and extravagant The bed was lovely and comfortable and the bathroom was great The room was spotless and a fantastic size given the fact you re in London We stayed in the standard room but still had a view of the river London which was beautiful It was just a really great place to stay 
74312,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Sad face unwelcoming receptionist at night time who took ages to get us room We were told that if we are coming back late on Sunday night then we can park the car outside the hotel which we did as there was no one to facilitate car parking We got the ticket by warden in the morning As we complaint the car parking manager David was extremely rude and nausty The whole stay was put to a sour experience There is no coherence between hotel staff and car parking valet services and they kept on passing us to each other No apology given It has been terrible experience with unfriendly staff at all levels, Location was good Rest was terrible
74313,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Very little It is a great improvement on original particularly the restaurant and bar area which now makes great use of the view over the river , Upgraded rooms have plenty of space and very comfortable bed Modern stylish bathroom and electronic controls for lights curtains heating etc 
74314,Park Plaza London Riverbank, No newspaper offered in the morning although meal room service available The queue to check in Breakfast enjoyed the food once we got it but because we had not booked on a b b basis this did cause confusion with the staff This resulted in being questioned particularly on the first morning several times by staff , Concierge staff were excellent Polite knowledgeable and friendly Checking in and out process was fairly efficient but there often seemed to be a queue We used the restaurant for both breakfast and dinner The a la cartel menu at breakfast was value for money as we had only booked for a room We enjoyed the shared dessert platter at dinner 
74315,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Bathroom layout was a bit odd No door dividing the sleeping area from the wash basin vanity unit area and then a shared door for the shower and toilet The sliding door could be positioned over the shower or slid over the toilet stall An outer door should have been fitted for privacy , The a c in our room was excellent and silent Our stay was on the hottest weekend of the summer so far but the room was always cool Hotel well positioned 5 mins from Tube and bus station Easy walk along the South Bank passing the London Eye Tate Modern Royal Festival Hall Hayward Gallery Easy access to central London across the numerous bridges 
74316,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I ve stayed at this hotel several times over the last eight years but after this time I won t be going back The expansion of the hotel impacted on the quality in my opinion Several things really impacted for me We paid 45 for valet parking Car was left on double yellow lines and we nearly got a ticket Unnecessarily stressful with zero apology from The doorman who told us just to drive off even though it was their fault Breakfast very bog standard and not worth 13 per head Appalling check out system I m heavily pregnant and queued for ten mins at very busy reception then when next in line and about to be served at the desk was approached by staff member with iPad to help us check out Except she couldn t refund the unspent part of the deposit so we lost our place in the queue and couldn t check us out so inefficient I d been queuing for twenty mins in boiling hot reception by then and felt awful No acknowledgment of this Very disappointing ,No Positive
74317,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Breakfast seating you get the choice of sitting at a very lonely Bar high and in view of everyone or almost sitting on the floor with the very low chairs I saw lots of the older customer struggling to get in and out of the confutable very low chairs and tables, nice room good size comfy bed great room service with good menus very late good size bathroom with bath and sep shower with good fluffy towels breakfast has a nice layout
74318,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The shower was a little small but not uncomfortable A C wasn t the strongest but I feel that is normal for Europe , The breakfast was amazing hotel room was very nice and comfortable Location was perfect right across the bridge from Big Ben and parliament 
74319,Park Plaza London Riverbank, There isn t much on the doorstep in terms of bars and restaurants or a coffee shop The refurb has left a bit of a confused interior layout also , Great views over the Thames and the Houses of Parliament Had a recent refurb which is very stylish and modern 
74320,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The entrance to the lifts was a little dark apart from that was excellent would, Hotel fab location also beautiful very clean very on trend the staff was so helpfully pleasant and friendly the bell boy don couldn t do enough for you

74322,Park Plaza London Riverbank, breakfast hot buffet was poor not a good selection and nearly cold Not able to get a vegan breakfast of merit , view of the houses of parliament and the river
74323,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Completely unacceptable that on arrival 450 was blocked on my card then upon departure 475 was actually taken Do I now need to wait 10 working days to receythe initial 450 to be returned to my card Basically for a short time you are charged double You are not told about this on booking and in my opinion it s tantamount to THEFT Wrong wrong wrong , Location and service
74324,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Rooms and Hotel looked tired Needed a face lift walls need repainting carpet looks getting worn And very expensive not vlue for the money Nicer places for that amount , Majority of staff were friendly 
74325,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The bed was surprisingly hard Like one step up from sleeping on the floor The good news is that the hotel staff are instantly responsive They sent staff with a memory foam topper which they put on the bed for the rest of my stay and resolved the issue The room lighting and AC controls from a little panel by the door and the bed which is a nice idea but I found a little wonky for some reason the panel by my bed would light up randomly in the middle of the night and was quite bright Also the AC was broken when I arrived As with the bed they sent someone up to my room immediately when I reported it and he fixed it within 10 minutes , The views from the room were exactly as advertised you look out to the Themes and Big Ben Parliament Breathtaking The hotel restaurant is actually the best meal I had in London during my trip and the staff are exceptionally accommodating Excellent bartender too While there were some small problems with the room see the negatives the staff was AMAZINGLY responsive and resolved the issues almost instantly The concierge desk was also very helpful in booking some day tours 
74326,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Hairdryer only blew cold air bedside lamp didn t work and also mattress covers on bed plastic, Staff were very helpful and offered excellent customer service

74329,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I was lucky with the wheater but I would not have liked walking in the rain A little far from the underground or centre , Location Quite and well equiped room Good size for the bathroom 
74330,Park Plaza London Riverbank, No slipper in the room No shaver kit No still water All the above essential items are missing and have to call operator Ask for river view but was given a view looking at another room I need to change the booking but front desk unable to do it as it book via Booking com and front desk never offer to call on behalf for the customer So got to use the room phone to make local call to booking com London customer call center which is so difficult to call thru and cost me total 20 pounds to complete the booking changes Would have given an above 8 rating if not for the above , A short walk to London Underground Good location next to river Thames and short walk to Parliament House Big Ben and London eye Good Concierge Great View from river facing the hotel front Lots of handy information to all the tourist attractions Clean and comfortable rooms 
74331,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The hotel foyer was a bit grim and unwelcoming The public areas in the hotel appeared dark and uninviting The room was noisey from the railway traffic The restaurant was expensive 21 00 for breakfast , The room was comfortable good lifts pleasant staff 
74332,Park Plaza London Riverbank, On arrival the reception staff was not very inviting at all but was professional Room view was directly on looking others rooms so have to be careful when undressing with curtains opened Restaurant although lovely did have some lounging sofa and chairs which made comfortable eating a little difficult if seated in those furnishings , The rooms are fantastic Room service restaurantstaff and check out staff all amazingly helpful and professional Very nice hotel 
74333,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The view from our room was another property having construction done which did not allow us to keep the curtains open as people were working It was just very distracting , The property is very clean and the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable It is in walking distance of the either the train or buses 
74334,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room had no view the staff weren t friendly the fridge didn t work the safe didn t work at first the fire alarm went off at 7am in the morning and we had no indication from any of the staff members on what to do the breakfast was very limited and standard for all three days of our stay the bathroom was not well ventilated,No Positive

74336,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Most of the staff were unfriendly and because there was a lot if different staff for different things they kept sending u to different people in response to your questions and had very little English people working for them there was a fire alarm just as we were leaving and it was very unorganised as very poor communication from the staff a lot not sure what they were Ment to do then and all the time As someone who worked in hotels for years and stayed in lot over the years I wasn t impressed with the effect running and welcoming of this hotel won t be recommending it or returning, The room was roomy and very cleanthe housekeeping were very helpful for cars bedding and whatever you needed room services was excellent The location was livekyBeside the tames facing big Ben and the house of parliament but was quite far from everything else but good bus trains tube and bus services The door staff were helpful for taxes and directions 
74337,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Soundproofing on the ceiling Our neighbours upstairs kept us awake until 2 30am walking heavily back and forth , Lovely comfy huge bed Very friendly staff and really enjoyed the bar and sushi at night 
74338,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Tea and coffee facilities were a little stingy only one packet of biscuits between 2 replenished daily Croissants were hit and miss some days nice some days a little stale, Great location with helpful staff Beds very comfortable with a pillow menu to suit my needs with comfort controls for heating lighting and DND rooms nice and quiet 
74339,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Was upgraded to mini suite which made the room experience superb Transport to and from by Uber taxi or bus excellent Modern facility with wonderful views
74340,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Nothing that I can think of , The concierge and front door staff were second to none They helped us with directions tickets dinner reservations etc etc Room was huge clean fully computerized 
74341,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Very near and on the same side of the river as the Eye and Lambeth Palace history buffs Also caught the water taxi from the eye to Greenwich Good buses near by some good pubs and restaurants Vauxhall tube station is about 3 blocks All in all a good choice This is more a business class hotel Food and drink were a bit pricey so we relied on other locations nearby There was a very cool pub directly across the street a converted small 3 deck boat that was very popular and from which you have great views of the eye Westminster and traffic on the river and it was very reasonable 
74342,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Asked for early check in and a quite room as my wife needs rests during the day arrived and was told no rooms available before 2pm then given one at the back of the hotel right next to a very busy main rail route with constant train noise and room was very hot so had to keep the window open as air conditioner was very noisy so had nearly no sleep mentioned this when checking out and got no apology or recognition that there was something wrong Breakfast was over priced for what was on offer won t be staying there again We felt we were brushed off by the staff when checking in and when discussing the room at check out , Nothing
74343,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Only downfall was the bar staff weren t too keen to serve when we turned up at midnight , High standard and finish to the hotel appearance Always greeted by staff at the front of the hotel Lovely stay Light and air conditioning controlled by key pad 
74344,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Nothing, The bed was comfy the staff were pleasant and very friendly they made us feel welcome every time we went in and out The room facilities were excellent and the bathroom was spacious The hotel was very clean We ate at the bar in the restaurant and the food was very nice 
74345,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Unable to book in for 1hour after booking in time was told we were getting an upgrade Will never know if we did would rather have been offered complimentary drink in bar only access to 1 restaurant bar and not the bar shown on advertisement for hotel Once in room no TV remote , Bed was comfy room was spotless 
74346,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, It was conviently located I thought being on the south bank might be a problem Tube was a short walk so it was no problem getting to the west end for theatre and also quite close to Tate s and other prime sites 
74347,Park Plaza London Riverbank, More a business hotel than tourist With some exceptions staff were slick but cold No good restaurants nearby , Clean modern and great location Ready to give an ordinary rating until they allowed us to check in really early after a long flight Thank you thank you 
74348,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room was a disgrace I got told I ll have to pay an extra 50 charge incase I decide to us the mini bar fine that s perfect Until I got to the room to find out I didn t even have a minibar in there Then I looked at my bank statement and I got charged 100 Did I mishear something somewhere Then it gets worse The light in the wardrobe didn t work Let alone the huge dent that was in the bin And a nasty smell was in the shower room It smelt like a body was rotting in the drain My boyfriend and I went and complained on the first night and was told nothing could be done about the smell And that we will have the mini bar light working and a change of bin done the next day Which then I come back to the hotel to see nothing was done So my boyfriend complained AGAIN And we was given free breakfast and a change of rooms Bearing in mind this was our last night there was no point in changing rooms For a hotel in London I was disgraced by the low standard of my room I am very well out raged that we was even sold that room Clearly it was not inspected before I arrived I personally think staying in a Travellodge Hotel would have been better It was a waste of money and time I ll never be coming here again nor will I be telling my friends to come here , Only good thing about this hotel was the view we got from our room 
74349,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The Tv interference was terrible therefore couldn t use the tv also the air con was poor bathroom was small , The appearance of the room was lovely
74350,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We wanted to have a tea and coffee in the bar in the morning but we wasnt allowed in as we weren t ordering food Was a bit of a shame , Everything As it was our first time staying here they gave us a free room upgrade and it was amazing We will definitley be staying again because of this 
74351,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I ordered room service at approximately 10 pm The lady replied that it would take half an hour It never arrived When I contacted staff by telephone I was told that an order had never been placed I said not to bother anyway as we were very tired and it was about one and a half hours after the request Very disappointed by this the facility did not materialize communication error on your part but not mine I teach young people hospitality and customer service this was a good example for them of a bad experience , Comfortable clean room Excellent location Breakfast restaurant staff were pleasant and helpful 
74352,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The air conditioning was not working properly until our last night therefore the room was very warm, The hotel is situated within good walking distance from all amenities
74353,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Payment with Maestro Card not possible walls were quite thin one could hear conversations in the next room , Not far from the main attractions of London great interior 2 different pillows hard and soft so I could choose 
74354,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Never get a room with a view I hVe stayed here more then once requesting a room with a view everytime Maybe next time , Great location with a very contemporary space So comfortable and clean Look forward to my next stay 
74355,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room was let down by little things such as the shower head not fitting correctly the annoying lighting system or noisy air con Also my room looked out across to other peoples room and felt that you could be seen the whole time Other little things such as the gym equipment being out of batteries or hoovers left in corridors meant there was a general feeling of shoddiness Staff in the bar were a bit slow and for 24 the breakfast was terrible , The hotel rooms were wonderfully quiet The location next to the Thames was scenic but not particularly convenient for the tube 
74356,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Wallsbetween some rooms are so thin it as if you have the other person in your room with you Avoid rooms 106 and 108, Location staff rooms in terms of quality and cleanliness
74357,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I think it was expensive for the quality of the room Housekeeping was tardy Elevator so dark you could not see the numbers on the panel , The location was the best thing about the hotel 
74358,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Reception never ever adequately staffed On check out no warning that film crew would dominate the foyer making it difficult to navigate to reception Staff more concerned with film crew than assisting guests, Room Restaurant
74359,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Good choice at breakfast and I could choose to be served and not have to endure a buffet Lovely room good quality bathroom products Charming and helpful staff Highly recommended
74360,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Beds too soft Poor soundproofing railway , Clean Modern Chino Latino great food Breakfast good but very expensive for what it is Friendly staff
74361,Park Plaza London Riverbank, the only thing that let down the room was that we didn t have a view in the room we got given This didn t bother us though because the room was beautiful and we didn t spend much time in their because we were walking around sight seeing as it was gorgeous weather , we LOVED the whole hotel it was beautiful with really friendly staff the hotel was very easy to find by getting the tube then walking across the bridge and was lovely to walk along side the river to get to the hotel I will definitely be staying here again when me and my boyfriend come to London 
74362,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I sent some postcards to the US and gave to concierge upon departure 3 weeks later and still haven t received them Don t know what happened , The River view room was perfect Perfect view amenities space furnishings comfort 
74363,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Staff could of been friendier used to work in a hotel myself as team leader on reception and there was no enthusaium or enjoyment at work asked for something a little extra for my boyfriends birthfay Nothing much but because we were travelling up 3 hours away I didn t have time but this comment was ignored, Bed was good size hotel has potential to be great but the key things just aren t there probably wouldn t stay again 
74364,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Interconnecting sealed up door between rooms let in a lot of noise from neighbours Woken at 1am 6am 7am not great at all , Bed extremely comfortable better pillows than I have at home 
74365,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Breakfast poor Weird setup in room no door to bathroom it was open plan Weird Lifts were awful We were on 14th floor Had to wait nearly 15mins for lift to get down to breakfast , Location Lovely staff 
74366,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Room with a view we we re facing other hotel rooms but I guess you would pay extra for a better view, One of the best hotels we ve stayed in lovely room and exceptional lobby and check in desk Staff were all very professional and very helpful Highly recommend to anyone
74367,Park Plaza London Riverbank, On arrival a deposit is taken in advance in case you charge anything to your room then a refund is given when leaving We didn t charge anything to our room yet money was taken out of my account for 24 hours I do not think this is a very good practice , The location was great for central London The bedrooms were very comfy and the breakfast was superb The staff were helpful and friendly I would definitely stay here again 
74368,Park Plaza London Riverbank, There were turbid water spots on the shower cabin but I used bath instead So it is actually insignificant , The staff is very helpful and friendly it is highly appreciated Breakfast is very tasty and diverse The location is amazing it takes only 12 15 minutes to get to Big Ben on foot Bathroom is quite spacious Control panel with lightning and air conditioning is very user friendly 
74369,Park Plaza London Riverbank, No tea or coffee in our room frustrating at 7am Breakfast was poor terrible dry bacon a considerable wait for poached eggs for my father and a toaster that either over did or undercooked despite asking for adjustments from staff Limited fruit on offer Not value for money at all no excuse on a Sunday morning , Bed very comfortable and room was quiet good shower and nice towels toiletries Bar staff very nice and very accommodating of our expanding group of tables 
74370,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, All the staff were incredibly helpful and extremely polite Fantastic location we were able to walk to the London Eye and London Dungeons taking in the views of Westminster and Big Ben Short taxi ride from Victoria Station to get to the hotel not expensive either London Taxi s outside the hotel at all times which was great 
74371,Park Plaza London Riverbank, nothing, this is our second visit to the hotel very friendly hotel nothing was to much trouble when we had an issue with an iron and further pillows and towels required would love to know what the smell in the reception area was it was my partners birthday and also celebrating a business success and when i wrote to the hotel to mention it a chilled bottle of bubbly was awaiting us when we arived at the hotel 
74372,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I didn t have a kettle in the room to make cup of tea on first day I would have preferred a better view of the embankment , Comfy bed very clean
74373,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The charge for parking was extortionate and no mention of that in advance Felt it should have been stated up front Found a space through the just park app nearby instead, Very comfy beds and modern spacious room
74374,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Room was only set up for one person despite me having changed the booking beforehand Difficulties from the outset changing the booking then there appeared to be no communication throughout our stay of the change Curtains off the track in our room not rectified by housekeeping Had to request a second wine glass for the room and a second pillow twice Breakfast service poor Overall do not feel that the service was four star standard , Bed very comfortable Lobbies and corridors very impressive 
74375,Park Plaza London Riverbank, A mix up with the arrangements of breakfast on the first morning was the only negative of my stay , The staff were extremely professional and made me feel very welcome 
74376,Park Plaza London Riverbank, never trust park plaza staff with your credit or debit card i was having payments taken from my account 3 times days after i checked out i had to call my bank and tell them to block park plaza from taking any further payments fraud is something i don t wish to experience while enjoying a night away from home , i don t like anything anymore after having multiple payments taken from my card for a one night stay 
74377,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Breakfast wasn t bad but I think there is still some room for improvement particularly could be an increase in fresh fruit , Location was fantastic I have never stayed on the South Bank before and loved being so close to Westminister and the Thames Very easy access to the train with baggage but otherwise could do everything on foot from this location 
74378,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Did not choose breakfast as price quite expensive at 22 Air conditioning was a bit loud but temperature was sufficient, Staff very friendly and welcoming every aspect professionally ran from check in to check out Room was clean comfortable and spacious excellent tea coffee and shower facilities love the option of body or full shower 
74379,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Breakfast very disappointing for the money we had to pay Fruit juice not fresh exected more for the money we had to pay, Great size room which has everything we needed
74380,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Site is noisy Glitches in room air con didn t work Engineer had to attend to fix In room housekeeping oversights no tea coffee mugs Bathroom gels etc lacking None of these are essentials but they were annoying and I expected better,No Positive
74381,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I couldn t take out the bathroom sink plug meaning I couldn t use the basin My view was of a new construction which can t be helped, The concierge who assisted me greatly and was easy to talk to Breakfast was great and filled me up for the days adventures Such a short work from the main attractions and hop on hop off bus s My daughter loved the lights and how she could have a few different settings 
74382,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Right by the South West train line Made it hard to sleep Twin beds shouldn t be shoved right next to each other We are sisters travelling together and pur beds are always a double that has been made into two beds , The location near the Westminster Bridge was a bonus The beds were comfortable 
74383,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Beware of the 50 00 reserve per night incase of extras This maybe standard in some hotels but we were not made aware about it anywhere on our booking , Excellent location very clean A really modern hotel 
74384,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The lack of detail to minor things for example grubby sofa stains in bed no iron Some bathroom facilities were broken or hanging off , The location 
74385,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Although our room was quite spacious unfortunately we looked straight out onto another building so got very little natural light , Fantastic looking hotel felt very luxurious when we walked into the reception area 
74386,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Hotel room had not stock for tea and coffees I had a fault with my air conditioning I reported the fault The said an engineer was sent to rectify the fault They hadn t so i spent two night in a stifling room with NO air conditioning Not happy More because I was lied to , Cleanliness of hotel 
74387,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Check out was a disaster reception lady charged to the wrong credit card without permission When asked simply said oh we can refund it But that takes 48 hours She was in a rush didn t bothered to ask how was your stay or was everything alright etc not an experience that you would expect from a Plaza Hotel Groups , Excellent Breakfast staff at the breakfast area very polite and Professional Easy check in 
74388,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The staff and customer services wasn t great We called for room service twice and the phone rang out After contacting the restaurant they advised that they could not help and put us back through to room service where it just rang out again I then contacted concierge who said that they would call back after 5minutes 30 minutes later still no call We ended up having to leave the hotel to get some food Disappointing service as we wanted an evening in I would stay at Park Plaza again but not the London Riverbank one ,No Positive
74389,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The staff and the communication was very bad The rooms was not clean properly and still had rubbish from the last guest , The location and look of the hotel
74390,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, There was such an amazing vibe in the entire building that it felt like home plus the room service was spot on Big Ben was across the street Such great views especially at night Couldn t recommend this hotel more Definelty worth every penny Will be back 
74391,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Check in was from 2pm We were told there was not a room available when we arrived at 2pm so to give it 30 minutes We went back at gone 3pm and still were told our room wasnt ready Considering the price of the room i expect the room to be ready for 2pm This was very poor especially as we had a dinner booked in central london for 5 30pm and then had to rush to get ready to make sure we were on time Having then been given a Room it was not clean There was mouldy bread and old milk in one of the drawers i am assuming from the guests before Clearly the room had not been cleaned properly There was also no hair dryer There was building work below our room we were on the 3rd floor that we were not informed about upon arrival and the work started around 8am waking us up The fire alarm going off the previous night didnt help ensure a relaxing stay Overall we were very dissapointed with this hotel especially considering the price I have never felt the need to write a review before but due to how dissapointed we are with our stay at this hotel i felt the need to share our experience I would not go back to this hotel as there are far better places to stay for the same price , Good location and nice bar The staff were friendly especially the concierge
74392,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Air conditioning didn t really work in our room so it got a bit clammy in the evening even with the coldest settings enabled The walk to the nearest station Vauxhall is about 10 minutes Though be aware Vauxhall can get very busy at rush hour so also consider walking to Westminster Tube Station 15 20 min walk , Hotel decor was very nice and modern Rooms spacious Facilities good Cocktails in the bar are really good Location is great Can t beat the views of Westminster Big Ben Embankment 
74393,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The wait at check in took quite a while however the staff were apologetic about the length of time we were waiting to get our key The room itself was great however we were placed on the side of the hotel next to building works which was quite loud and disruptive in the morning And there is no parking with the hotel Having not been there before we called to ask where was best to park but the information wasn t very helpful in fact we didn t get any information at all apart from their own service In the end we opted to use their own valet service which was great but quite costly, We upgraded to a suite with a city view which was great The room was a superb size and our view was wonderful The hotel is well located just a short walk to Westminster Bridge the London Eye and Big Ben The room was very clean and comfortable
74394,Park Plaza London Riverbank, lack of directional lighting reading function was a very bright spot on ceiling which was not helpful for the reader and too bright for the one who wanted to sleep If you have a lot of chrome it has to be kept polished the bed legs were dull and had accumulated fluff and dust One free bottle of water for two people is a little mean , The staff were outstandingly helpful and friendly The ambience was un stuffy The food was exceptional Toiletries by Elemis good choice 
74395,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, The spacious rooms and views are excellent As was the bathroom and house keeping was always available to offer clean towels etc The hotel staff were accommodating and extremely helpful and friendly Reception staff are polite and keen to offer a great service The door staff always helpful and cheerful and very polite Thank you Plaza and all staff and management for always making my stay at Plaza each week most enjoyable I thank you all for your excellent customer service and kindness 
74396,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Building site next door and noise associated with that from 7am Knocking pipes and noisy aircon machanics throughout the night, Helpful night receptionist
74397,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The restaurant is pricey , The location of the hotel is fantastic Bus stop is right in front of the hotel and the underground tube Voxhall is about 10 minutes walk It is only 10 to 15 minutes walk to Lambeth and Wesminter bridges The staff is courteous and professional The room is very clean and spacious 
74398,Park Plaza London Riverbank, everything was nice without a kettle The kettle was already wet and black things were in the kettle It might be washed but i felt it was dirty , Nice night view i booked a river view room Then i was able to see the big ben in my room Staffs were kind 
74399,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Our room was booked as a superior double expecting nice views over the Thames but instead had a great view of an incredibly large ventilation duct Also we arrived back at our hotel on the Saturday evening and there was a party going on in the hotel but it actually felt as if the party was taking place in our room as it was so loud and there was no chance of sleeping until it was over at 1 00 am , We found the breakfast pretty lack lustre for a 4 hotel but the staff were most helpful and the setting was pleasant 
74400,Park Plaza London Riverbank, There was a function in the hotel which lasted until 2am As it was directly below us we could hear the music thump loudly We had to phone reception at 1 30 am for them to lower the sound as we couldn t sleep had to wake up at 7am So not a good night and we felt they should have told us in advance that a party was going on nearby , Clean hotel great bar with nice cocktails nice accommodation bed very comfy 
74401,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Had to ask for Slippers Bathrobes two later supplied but only one belt and water Breakfast was the downfall of this hotel very poor selection in both hot and cold selections Chairs in main seating area are low and more coffee table like tables make it uncomfortable to eat at we requested a proper table and chairs for our 2nd day breakfast Request a room higher than 3rd floor otherwise Trees obscure view of River and Big Ben Noisy Party River boat located across road but quietens down after 11pm , The hotel is very prestigious Rooms clean and very spacious although we did get a free upgrade to a Junior Suite Bathroom clean and toiletries supplied excellent Towels fluffy Beds little hard but I dont mind that pillows lovely and bouncy Room service excellent cheap and extremely high quality Location good just a short walk to London Eye and all attractions

74404,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I wasn t informed about the deposit on account outside of the accommodation fee This really affected my budgeted expenses , Extra comfortable beds Friendly staff Nice breakfast 
74405,Park Plaza London Riverbank, after i expand the sofa to change it to bed for kids the room get smaller and hard to walk around the view very poor which was facing the other hotel too much expensive taxi from and to airport around 200 pound tow ways , 10 to 12 minutes walking to the attractions london eye big ben there are many bus stops near the hotel
74406,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The check in process was ridiculous The person who checked us in at the third time queuing forgot to mention the extra 50 charge To be honest we usually stay at the Park Plaza Westminster but only stayed here because they had no double rooms available , 
74407,Park Plaza London Riverbank, No parking nearby Minibar in fridge computerised and no room to put in my own items like my juice or wine to chill No breakfast included and very expensive if you wanted one , Close to cruise boats and Westminster Nice room and we were upgraded spacious clean and light Great location and friendly staff
74408,Park Plaza London Riverbank, There s nothing i didn t like the hotel and staff are just perfect i just want to say that you have to be prepared for a 50 per night damage deposit which you get returned when you check out but is was i little surprise for us , Everything was perfect big room with the river view Big Ben and London Eye bathroom with the shower and bath Great for couples 
74409,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Cleanliness of bar in morning where breakfast was served Sausages and natural yoghurt sour on one morning , Very large comfortable room Very well sound proofed

74411,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Terrible perfume at the reception main hall Used china wasn t cleaned unless it was placed on the floor It would have been nice with some comfortable chairs Would have been nice to know that you should pay a deposite at arrival eventhou it was refundable later on,No Positive
74412,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The water from my room left ALL my bathroom stuff smelling really weird I had to throw away all of it not sure what it was , The hotel itself is really beautiful and modern It s in a FANTASTIC location and every staff member greeted me with kindness and professionalism The bar was my favorite but I also love getting there with the LED walls around the escalators I would definitely recommend this place for price location and service 
74413,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Although on the river its a good walk to public transport Nearest is Vauxhall Few amenities in the immediate area , Very comfortable and modern Mix of business and leisure 
74414,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The check in arrangements were poorly marked and I spent almost half an hour to obtain the key and access to the room the hotel reception check in was not what it appeared to be and there was a long wait at the other side of the lobby for another check in marked as a club There were other peoples belongings in one of the drawers and the hair dryer was missing immediately rectified by housekeeping I hasten to add It would have been useful to have a charging point at the side of the other bed I shared a twin room with my niece and we both needed to charge our phones The leisure facilities were poor , The location was excellent and the views from the breakfast area were lovely The bedroom and bathroom were clean and a good size I would certainly stay there again
74415,Park Plaza London Riverbank, More tea bags and biscuits , very friendly clean good location close to underground we did find the room very warm and the air conditioning wasn t any help but over all a lovely hotel would definitely go back our room was on the 8th floor nice and quiet

74419,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The cleaness of the room The bedsheets were not changed for the whole of our stay which is 5nights We spilled a drink on the white sheet and it was so obvious but it was there every single day Plus never had the complimentary water apart from day one and only one bottle , The location of the hotels 
74420,Park Plaza London Riverbank, No communication between staff They mixed up our rooms messed up our breakfast and made us promises they didn t keep Our stay was booked 4 months in advance and they still couldn t get it right Not happy , Chino Latino in the hotel was beautiful and the food was amazing

74422,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The fact they stole 50 from my bank account and are still continuing to take money out, The concierge service was brilliant Good rooms shame about the staff on reception 
74423,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The only downside was that our main course arrived before our starter and the cheese was missing on our burger This has been rectified right away and we had a complimentary Maki for the inconvenience We had our burger replaced but they were a bit cold It is a shame as the rest was just perfect The staffs were just very efficient though , This Hotel is just fabulous The staff the room the location and the facilities are just perfect We had just an unforgettable stay We stayed in the room 1657 and we ve got a partial view on the river it was just perfect We will definitely be back The bonus was as well the band playing during our diner Thanks for making our stay so enjoyable 
74424,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The airconditioning was not working properly and although the staff were good enough to open the window for us that resulted in noise from the trains at the rear of the building , The location of the hotel is excellent and the hotel facilities are very good

74430,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The heating did not work in the room although it was freezing cold that week The engineer who was sent to the room told us that for all floors below the 11th the heating was off The reception transferred us to the 15th floor where the heating was ok On the last day of our stay the room was not cleaned and towels remained on the floor even though the staff promised to clean it on the evening shift ,No Positive
74431,Park Plaza London Riverbank, dusty mirror in the bathroom locked minibar, Great breakfast fantastic staff especially at the breakfast hall for instance Billel who spoke German with us and Andrea adorable view
74432,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Haven t received back the deposit I had to pay for the room 50 pounds Wasn t aware I had to pay this when I booked on Booking com On departure The car we booked was waiting for us outside for 30 mins and had asked if we were there and even though we had been sitting there for an hour the staff said no so we could have left earlier , It was just nice and handy clean and comfortable and felt safe
74433,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Around 20th April A C full blast when entering the room Tried to switch it to heating mode to no avail We had since been told that the hotel had the heating turned off Temperature outside at night was 3C After complaining the staff gave us a ridiculous tiny bathroom heater to heat the whole room Needless to say this was useless This is the coldest I have ever felt in an hotel room By far , Nice room was upgraded for free Still cold though 
74434,Park Plaza London Riverbank, can t really think of anything, the bed was absolutely comfy best nights sleep for a long time and the shower was brill powerful beautifully clean the staff were lovely and very kind n helpful not a bad word about the staff it was well worth the visit I would definitely stay there again We didnt eat at the hotel so can t comment on that overall excellent stay

74436,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Bathroom could have been given closer attention with daily cleaning , Comfortable bed Very quiet room Excellent location Having both a shower and a bath separately 
74437,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We traveled in a large party with some arriving before others I had booked the rooms on a credit card and as far as I was aware the payment was secure I was very disappointed that the rooms would not be released until the last member of the party arrived with the credit card What was the point in booking and using my card to secure the rooms if guests were not allowed to access them after a long journey from Shropshire with one guest being in a wheelchair Very disappointing ,No Positive
74438,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Service was generally excellent but on Monday night in bar was poor This was a shame Bit far out for theatres taxis required , Picture window views from our room 947 were spectacular Entertainment in the bar area every evening was top notch 
74439,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Shower needs to be repaired as stream was weak and dials difficult to use First day shower was full of hair After that all was great , Breakfast restaurant was fabulous Easy walk to sites of interest Concierge desk very very helpful in helping to plan our day If I ever have an opportunity to visit London again we will certainly stay with

74441,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Bit disappointing compared to other Park Plazas Room was nothing special air con didn t work hairs in bath room was dusty Had to ask for additional pillows which were delivered promptly The kettle is in a drawer and you have to plug it in across the room so not very well thought out Very meagre supplies of tea and coffee We raised these issues when asked about our stay on check out and were told that housekeeping and maintenance would be informed but the receptionist didn t appear to make any notes so wonder if this will get passed on On check in the receptionist was a bit non plus appeared to be smirking the whole time and didn t seem to care ,No Positive
74442,Park Plaza London Riverbank, In my opinion breakfast is too expensive at 42 for 2 people A few more tea coffee sachets in the room too would have been better otherwise can t fault it excellent stay , Very clean tidy modern Staff were excellent

74444,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The sound of the in room ventilation air con was VERY LOUD and made it difficult to sleep I would have prefered to have been able to open the window for ventilation but it was wired shut which I m assuming is due to the construction site next door Also my towels were changed daily which I did not request and which did not fit with the policy notice in the bathroom This is not an environmental practice , The bed was extremely comfortable and the room had everything I needed including an iron ironing board kettle hairdryer and lots of sockets for my electrical items 
74445,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The first thing at check in was asking for a deposit for the whole sum for the two nights I intended to stay AND 100 GBP extra for the minibar 100 GBP for the minibar where else does a hotel ask for such a horrendous deposit sum for the minibar Then I went into my booked superior room and started to search for the superiority I couldn t find any One day later the clerk confirmed me that all ordinary rooms are called superior The view from my window couldn t be better it went to the scaffolding of the neighbouring building not further than cca 10 m away from my window The bathroom it s nice but the tub is mounted with the backrest under the sink shelf The breakfast ordinary not bad but very very expensive 24 GBP for a plain breakfast which you get wherever in Europe for 10 Moreover if you would like to order an omelette it s not included in the 24 GBP already paid you have to pay another 10 GBP The location there is no pub no restaurant no other venue for going out in the evening in a radius of 1 km around the hotel There is only a very very crowded pub in an old boat on the river bank and the very expensive restaurant of the hotel , If you want to visit Tate Britain it s a good choice to stay at this hotel because it s located in walking distance from the museum 
74446,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The building work outside meant you had to run a gauntlet of lorries crossing into the site The cocktails were not mixed very well The breakfast was outrageously expensive for a buffet , The staff were friendly and helpful The rooms were clean Didn t use any of the facilities so cannot comment 
74447,Park Plaza London Riverbank, There were 2 vacuum cleaners outside my room all night The light above the bath had a hole in the ceiling The wash hand basin was blocked and drained very slowly , Good quality hotel and great location Reception staff friendly and efficient 
74448,Park Plaza London Riverbank, There is a holding deposit of 50 per night that you will have to pay on arrival Watch out for this as I didn t know about it beforehand and it took a few days to get back into my account after we left , The location is fantastic a short walk to Westminster and many of the sights The room is clean reasonably sized and has a nice selection of shampoos and soaps Also has a very nice aroma in the atrium as you arrive 
74449,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Bar upstairs was a little stiff and uninviting but perfectly adequate, Very pleasant staff and the concierge in particular was extremely helpful Doormen were also a nice touch and extremely courteous and friendly
74450,Park Plaza London Riverbank, When checking in there was four people on the reception desk on their computers and we were not acknowledged for a good few minutes which I though was bad seeing as none of them were serving any customers The aircon did not work well in the room so it s was boiling all night , Cleanliness
74451,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We got a room with view to and very much noise from the Railway The breakfast at the hotel was very expensive, Nice room and bathroom with both shower and a bathtub Serviceminded staff at the concierge Good breakfast caf s nearby 
74452,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Service at breakfast above and beyond No crumpets are generally served but Vasyl after initially not knowing what they were arranged to get some and I had them the next morning 
74453,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The pillows in the room where terrible We only had one cup in the twin room and hardly any sugar so my 9 year old did a mission impossible on the landing to the housekeepers trolley and acquired some milk also The drinks at the bar where ridiculous 1 bottle of coke and a bottle of small lager which was very needed long day was 9 20 You have been warned Reception Staff male could have been happier in his job , The hotel is situated in a lovely position and there are plenty of staff on hand some are really helpful The breakfast was all buffet style and plenty of choice The walk to nearest tube and bus stops are with ease Very close to London Dungeon other attractions 
74454,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Nothing really, Lovely friendly Staff was made feel very welcome Food was very good and not badly priced Overall I would highly recommend the Park Plazza Hotel and will definitely return 
74455,Park Plaza London Riverbank, the cleaning could be a bit better we found dust on glasses and ice bucket probably not been used for a long time we also had only had just one packet of coffee each It does just show that the lady who did the room did it too quickly and didn t check properly and the TV was not working we had to call services to be repair the rest was fantastic , the bed was comfy the room was big enough the breakfast was nice the bathroom was excellent
74456,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Not much information regarding how breakfast was served Didn t know there was a breakfast menu till after we had the self service Euro breakfast , The executive rooms are fantastic Staff are excellent and helpful The executive lounge is a nice touch with fantastic views
74457,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The window could have been a little bigger to let more natural light in, We arrived and told we had a free upgrade to a double executive suite and it was gorgeous and so big and the bed was sooo comfy Also staff delivered our suitcases up to the room and also brought us free wine and chocolate 
74458,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We were woken early by loud drilling outside Although I know this can t be helped and it was 8am so not too early , The room was a good size and very comfortable The bathroom was great having a separate both and shower 
74459,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We didn t have the room we had asked for that was a disappointment I had asked for a river view but we got a view of another building instead , The Room was lovely and also the executive lounge was brilliant views from the lounge is amazing 
74460,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Room next door woke us up arguing at 3am Had to call security Hotel staff hardly even apologised No compensation didn t even pay for a drink at the bar or anything , View of the river was fantastic Room was comfortable with a good power shower 
74461,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Everything was fabulous The staff were all so friendly and helpful and couldn t do enough for us Our room was beautiful with an amazing bathroom We felt like royalty from the start of our stay to the finish 
74462,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Cleanliness was below standard Room looked like it hadn t been hoovered Stains on pillowcases Empty bottle of water left on side when I checked in Loose toilet seat Plug socket not working Shower door thick with limescale , Huge comfortable bed Amazing view Loved having a kettle in the room Hot shower Big bath Excellent complimentary toiletries Issues I had with the room were sorted quickly 
74463,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Same breakfast everyday Would ve liked something different everyday Wish there was a pool And the fitness centre wasn t great , The view is to die for Make sure you stay in river view room
74464,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Dirty room Waste bin not emptied and still had old teabags in it Kettle not cleaned and tea coffee choices not replaced Expensive for what was offered , Near where needed to go 
74465,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We felt a little out of place as we went to London on a trip but most guests there were dressed in suits the only view we had was of other bedrooms but this didn t affect our stay too much , The bed was really comfy the staff were all friendly the room was big We didn t have breakfast so cannot comment on that 
74466,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Number of elevators and or their programming could be better Toilet and shower shared single sliding door Above our budget , Excellent location comfortable room friendly staff Cheap supermarket nearby 
74467,Park Plaza London Riverbank, For some weird reason my double room came with two single beds pushed together and two single duvets a bit rubbish for a romantic break with my partner Staff concierge were much more interested in talking to each other than service Why doesn t the main door open , Great location really close to Westminster and underground station Amazing bar with stunning views 
74468,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Fairly basic amenities in the room Only 2 teabags and coffee satchets A toaster would have been helpful I m sure if we d asked they would have brought extra tea bags etc but for the price might have been nice to have them , Staff friendly Good size room Generally fairly clean Room service happy to provide crockery and cutlery if you have takeaway 
74469,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The FOOD Appalling cooked breakfast and room service food was not child friendly , Magnificent view from our upgraded room at extra cost naturally Made a huge difference to our enjoyment 
74470,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Having to pay for one item I used in the mini bar They tried to say I had used two when I hadn t I understand it s London prices but for think everything was expensive and the breakfast was extortionate I think having paid nearly 300 for two nights we may have got even one free bottle of water Also think the fact you have to pay upfront for your room expected this and then 50 a night depsoit is pretty bad as it didn t state this anywhere and I could have been relying on that 100 for my weekend away however luckily I wasn t On the Sunday we went to the Chico Latino bar and we were sat waiting 20 minutes from getting there to receiving our drink Feel like it s because we weren t a big party so they weren t concentrating on the two of us as much , Amazing room with really good facilities Excellent location it was a ten minute walk to the right to Big Ben Westminster bridge London eye and to the left was a ten minutes walk to the Vauxhall tube station Didn t spend much time in the room as we were on the go for the three days we spent there The staff we re really friendly and I could tell if we had any queries or needed any help they would have more than happy to help The concierge men were so friendly and went out their way to make conversation and to make you feel welcome The hotel was sparkling clean and smelt amazing I couldn t fault one thing with regards to the appearance of the hotel and the room Also the singer on the Saturday night at Chico Latino bar was really good and enjoyed listening to him 
74471,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Well it was the same breakfast everyday And it gets a little monotonous The fitness center was quite old Especially the equipments Would ve been better if it was at least clean , The view was to die for Especially if you take the river view room Since the weather was great just walking around the Thames was lovely 
74472,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Rooms got warm and we had some trouble with noise from other guests but was resolved, The location is perfect to explore London staff are amazing and attentive
74473,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room was not cleaned properly bathroom floor not cleaned room not vacuumed surfaces not cleaned or dusted and bedding not changed during our 6 night stay Two days we were left bath mats as hand towels , Staff were helpful and responded well when we had cash stolen from our room Nice breakfast though very expensive The cocktails looked amazing 
74474,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I reported two faults 1 blocked bathroom sink that took 10 minutes to drain and 2 edge of the curtains was hanging off so light able to come in during early morning The drain problem was very unpleasant and unhygienic with previous guests hairs etc washing out I won t go into any more detail Neither fault was fixed between 9 30am and 10pm while we were out I had to speak to reception again the following morning They initially offered a 6 discount then when I laughed they offered this plus a breakfast in the lounge In the end the resolution was okay but what a shame it had to come to that Other minor irritations two out of four lifts not working waiter quite snooty and didn t bother to mention that steak comes without potatoes or ANY sides spoil what should be a very good hotel , The location was fine as was the final response to the complaint that I had to make 
74475,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Nothing , The rooms were beautiful very clean and loads of space The location was excellent Only 5 min walk to Westminster Our room didn t have a great view but we didn t pay to upgrade to a room with a view so we weren t expecting one The staff were very helpful and very friendly couldn t do enough for you We were only there one night we wished we had stayed longer 
74476,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Room got very hot in the night Air con noisy , All of the staff were very friendly helpful Good shower room for stuff in the bathroom Asked for a quiet room it was very quiet apart from the inconsiderates who slammed their bedroom doors at midnight on Tuesday 
74477,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, The service was excellent and the rooms with the river views were absolutely amazing Everybody was very polite and the whole hotel was very tidy and modern The location of the hotel is great because it s just so close to everything and it was easy to get a cab from right outside the hotel entrance We would definitely book this hotel again Thank you for a memorable stay 
74478,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I wouldn t choose this hotel for any kind of special occasion again We came for our first wedding anniversary I asked if they do anything for such occasions I got told they had already upgraded our room when in fact that was something we had already paid for Why make it sound like it was a favour when in fact it wasn t Also told we will get a little something in the room as it is our first wedding anniversary and nothing was put in there Not something you ask for if it s not there by that point it had all lost its appeal anyway My husband is highly allergic to feather pillows and we phoned house keeping twice to sort it and they never came Once it got way past midnight we got tired of waiting so ended up not using the pillows Mattress was uncomfortable so both slept very badly not helped by the fact the pillows weren t changed so could not be used It s a shame as the hotel outside and the lobby looks impressive but the room just was mismatched lacked attention to detail and was a bit bare Bathroom was lovely though Good size and nicely decorated Thankfully the view was lovely and we still enjoyed our anniversary out in London , Wonderful views from the bedroom and the bathrooms were very nice 
74479,Park Plaza London Riverbank, View was awful looking straight onto other rooms at front of hotel, Excellent no quibble service from staff excellent cleaning of room nd electronic services via touch pads
74480,Park Plaza London Riverbank, breakfast offered at 21pp is too expensive very often we only want a coffee and croissant so opted not to have breakfast at hotel, very fresh fruit in bedroom on arrival was a nice touch liked the overall standard of d cor throughout hotel friendly staff especially in foyer and at front door 
74481,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, From the moment we walked in we were amazed The hotel was beautiful the staff were very polite and helpful We arrived early and was told we could check in early After exploring the city we went back to our room and found a bottle of champagne with a plate of fruit I previously mentioned it was our anniversary it was amazing to come back in to a lovely surprise The room was amazing With amazing views Would definitely come back 
74482,Park Plaza London Riverbank, There as only 1 thing the light above bed was bright such that one person could not go to sleep whilst other reads better to have individualised bedside lights But the hotel was fantastic,No Positive
74483,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The staff were rude unhelpful and disinterested were not interested in the issues we raised at all Our mini bar was empty and broke but already changed us for the full content prior to entering the room said they would fill it but grudge was still broke said we had to deal with it and would bring an ice bucket instead kettle broke pressed don t disturb whilst in shower but came in anyway twice We had late checkout but when we returned to the room we were locked out they had cleared us out and put all our stuff in lost property reception made us prove we were who we were to get it back which was difficult as they took all our things This place was a joke and at over 400 for 2 nights it s really not what you expect at all they are not interested because they take payments for everything up front and refund you if you do t use something , Disappointed from start to end the view was nice 
74484,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Reception desk is painfully slow in dealing with customers It took me a very long time to check in as there was a small queue and there were only a few staff working at the desk although the staff are very nice when they do deal with you I didn t manage to check out at all as I was stood waiting for ages and had a train to catch that I missed as a result before I gave up and walked away from an unmanned desk whilst lots of staff chatted in the office behind the desk This was at approx 7Am You should have more staff on the desk at all times If you took some of the staff that just stand round saying hello to everyone that passes them then the desk would move quicker no waiting time for somebody to say hello in the lobby but you wait ages at the desk bizarre , Location interior 
74485,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We were upgraded to a suite but it had no heating in the bedroom or bathroom it was cold The bathroom also had smelly drains not pleasant The sitting room area was under furnished and the suite overall needed a refurbishment with scuffs on the furniture and badly hung net curtains We did point this out in at check out but no interest from receptionist We have stayed at this hotel a few times and it has declined each visit we won t be back , Location
74486,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The staff at breakfast were friendly and helpful but service for freshly cooked items was a little slow and when it did arrive it was over done Our room did overlook the train line which was not a problem and we weren t expecting a view but it would of been nice to be aware that this was a possibility , The staff were happy and helpful The room was well appointed and lovely and clean The location was great really close to central london 
74487,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Many rooms overlook 8 train tracks and the noise of the trains can be heard Room service sandwiches were very poor comprising not very fresh cheap sliced bread no butter and average filling The Bar menu advertises afternoon tea but the staff had no idea what it was , The hotel was smart and clean The staff were polite The room and bathroom were a good size clean and well equipped 
74488,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The sound of the elevator was quite loud next to the room on a night but it definitely didn t spoil our stay , We arrived early and we were able to check in straight away and were given a complementary upgrade to an executive suite The room was amazing and the hotel was only a 10 minute walk to Westminster for us sight seekers The room also had a nespresso coffee machine with some pods which is great for a coffee lover like me

74492,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The minibar facility no one made us aware that there is an extra charge to keep the bar open had to call staff 3 times to resolve the issue , The bathroom was clean and spacious but the shower head in the bathtub was broken
74493,Park Plaza London Riverbank, air con noisy at night switched it off in bedroom so could sleep had to turn it right up to get warm in day very black dark and shiny decor great if you like modern would prefer more traditional myself view of houses of Parliament and Thames made for very special visit room service meal could have been warmer but it was delicious , location and view upgraded well worth extra
74494,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We do not care to have to have 50 lodged on our card at checking in As a company rule it is difficult for staff on reception when one complains , The hotel has had some refurbishment and is very comfortable and wecoming
74495,Park Plaza London Riverbank, the light needs to be switched on and off from a panel also for the bathroom it s a bit difficult to turn the light on when going to the bathroom Small issue however , Very modern up to date quiet rooms well appointed
74496,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Paying 24 per head for breakfast and then being expected to pay 7 extra for pancakes is unacceptable There is a lot of work going on next to the hotel and we were put in a room facing a building site Not a good start to my husbands birthday weekend to which the receptionist had told us they would do something special on the day of his birthday to which no avail , Very friendly staff and the serve yourself breakfast was always kept topped up nothing ever ran short Room was clean and very modern Bed was comfortable but pillows were not

74500,Park Plaza London Riverbank, See above 100 security depositI wasn t expecting and hadn t budgeted for Also I asked the girl on reception if she could possi ly put us in a room with a view of the river to enhance my son s experience She said she would but when we got to our room the view was of the other hotel rooms I didn t want to complain at this point as we had already done a lot of trabelling and I was exhausted , I loved the location The staff were very friendly I didn t like how I was told on arrival I had to pay another 100 pounds security and would get it back when leaving I had not been told about this when booking and had not budgeted for it As a result I had to hold back on my London experience with my 7 yr old son who s 1st time it was away from home That 100 pounds was no use to me on the day we were going home I ve never been asked for that security deposit before in a UK hotel 
74501,Park Plaza London Riverbank, This goes for most London hotels but don t pay 21 50 for the breakfast at Park Plaza Take a short walk to the Regency Cafe and enjoy proper London cafe food for a fraction of the price , Sizeable comfortable rooms with everything you could need Staff are excellent

74504,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room was next to the mainline train network into from Waterloo I had virtually zero sleep despite having ear plugs and a pillow over my head The basic necessity of a hotel is to provide a quiet sleeping environment something the hotel fails spectacularly at They need to invest in proper sound insulation given the expensive price they charge The worst night s sleep I have ever had in a hotel ,No Positive

74510,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The building site next door if your room is on that side smell of receen glue made the room smell plus the noise of the guards talking all night while we was sleeping and dogs Barking because they are left in van waking everyone up, It has great location plus very friendly stuff nice and clean very helpful
74511,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I thought the toaster should have been by the cooked breakfast and although the breakfasts was a great choice our four breakfast was cold, Great selection of breakfast

74518,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Position of hotel is isolated with lots of building work being carried out around had to taxi everywhere as it is a fair walk from station tube ,No Positive
74519,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The view from the room was such a let down we were placed at the back of the building so were directly opposite the side of another building simply wonder how much it would cost to get a view More staff on check out would be helpful as the queue was quite ridiculous on leaving , The hotel itself was incredible Polite staff very clean Modern bathroom lots of towels shower and bath for a choice Loved the device for temp and lights very easy to use 
74520,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The fact I had to leave The view I requested a view of the riverbank but I got someone else s room , The room was amazing Very modern and clean Loved the control panel for the room 
74521,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The lack of views I had asked for a bottle of champagne to be in our room on arrival as it was a celebration This never arrived I did mention it when we checked out, Receptionist was very friendly Upgraded our room however we did not have a view of the river This was a little disappointing
74522,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The window didn t close fully very annoying hearing outside noise while sleeping Breakfast price extremely unrealistic same price as a steak , Lovely hotel 7 ish to Victoria through gett taxi app Short walk to Big Ben etc
74523,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Dust all over the work surfaces Booking com did not make it clear at all the the hotel would charge 45 per night for parking and put on our booking that we could get it cheaper which the hotel refused Meaning we parked on the street behind which lead to our window getting smashed Myself and my partner are well dressed and presentable however young and we re stopped several times and asked to prove we were actually staying at the hotel as it was hotel policy even though other guests were not stoped The bathroom was beautiful but I felt unclean and smelt Would only stay here again for the view , The view was absolutely breathtaking but a large markup in price the view is what made the hotel redeemable However the windows were very dirty which ruined the view The bed was really comfortable however the was blocked by excess furniture 
74524,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I was told they were using my card in euro just for a pre authorisation and I would have the possibility to pay in pounds at my arrival this wasn t true and my card in euro was charged in GBP in advance At the arrival the room was not ready after and over the expected check in time Once checked in the glass of the shower was not clean and the bed didn t meet our expectations for an executive room Also two curtains were missing to the windows and the complimentary bottle of water they were added the following day , The view from our room was amazing All the staff was super friendly 
74525,Park Plaza London Riverbank, There s not a single thing we didn t like about our stay here, From the moment we arrived to the moment that we left everything was exceptional The staff couldn t do enough to help

74527,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The aircon wasn t working properly so we turned it off The bath was situaTed in such a way that there was a shelf at the end of it which ment you couldn t lie either way Food was very expensive , It was situated walking distance to big Ben and vauxhall train station and the underground which was very handy The hotel was very quiet even tho there was building work going on right beside the hotel 
74528,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I was wrongly informed by staff about breakfast charges and ended up being overcharged The staff in the restaurant was not very attentive and quite rude , The location is great for visiting London sights 
74529,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The bathroom extractor fan refused to go off so there was a constant hummm all night , The efficiency of check in check out The room size was good with both bath and shower The view from the window at breakfast is a bonus 
74530,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Nothing all were great, I had a river view room It was amazing view at the at the Thames the staff were so kind I have to name Mrs Sheista who helped me in checking in and out Also Mr Stuart and Ruben at the hotel entrance 
74531,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Our first room smelt like urine so we got moved to a different room The second room was lovely but right on the railway track so sleep definitely wasn t an option Overall we didn t have a great experience on our honeymoon, Star where nice
74532,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, The room view was amazing and the staff were very pleasant This was our first stay at a Park Plaza Hotel but we will definitely being using their services again in the future 
74533,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The view from the bedroom wasent what I requested and there were dirt marks on the doors to the bathroom and wardrobes , I liked where the hotel was based and the look of the reception on entering 
74534,Park Plaza London Riverbank, 1 Our confirmation said check in from 1400 Reception advised your room isn t ready yet After standing my ground we were upgraded to a junior suite and got access to our room 2 The room was depressing The lounge area was dull beyond all measure The only soft furnishing was a torn sofa There were screws on the wall where a picture might once have hung but no longer 3 In the bedroom the bedspread appeared to have been thrown on in haste it was lumpy and uneven 4 Returning from dinner 2320 a security guard waved his hand and demanded Room key My wife replied I m sorry and he repeated just Room key We appreciate some security checks might be appropriate but so too might be basic courtesy This is no way to treat guests , We use this hotel often for London stays we like the location and would normally rate the property better but this stay was disappointing The bar experience was good with great views across the river
74535,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Was aware of the train lines behind the hotel as this was the direction our room faced Noise was minimal though , Very friendly staff food was great and well priced for what we had Would certainly stay here again for or next trip to London 
74536,Park Plaza London Riverbank, all fixtures and fittings seem to be at a bit of a funny angle toilet had brown stains screws hanging out of the fixtures in the shower mirror in a place that you cant use it toilet roll was so far back you need to be a yoga expert to reach it , clean and tidy smells great when you walk in
74537,Park Plaza London Riverbank, It seems it needs to be very careful to make your booking as the hotel does not allow any flexibility in changing your plan The furthermore be careful with your money as it might be taken for some reason that you did not understand beforehand It seems it needs to be very careful to make your booking as the hotel does not allow any flexibility in changing your plan The furthermore be careful with your money as it might be taken for some reason you did not understand beforehand I booked a room via booking for a 3 nights stay As we found that we did not like the hotel very much when we arrived I tried to negotiate with the lady who helped me to do the check in to see if I can use the credit for the third night to upgrade a room and she said probably not working but I could pay an extra 50 pounds for upgrading a room As we were not satisfied with the room type we booked in advance we agreed to pay to upgrade and I paid a deposit of 150 pounds And we left after the second night staying so we only stayed for two nights The lady who helped me to check out asked me if we was not going to stay for the third night I confirmed this and returned the key and she told me the deposit would go back to my card So I expected to have 50 pounds refund I paid 150 for the deposit as we did not stay for the third night but I didn t see it come to my account So I called booking to ask about this and the booking team tried to ask the hotel and negotiate with them but the hotel said as my previous booking was three nights so they also charged the upgrade fee for the third night That s extremely ridiculous as I did not stay for the third night Firstly I didn t say I wanted to have a three night upgrade as I have clearly told the lady in the front desk who was helping me to check in that I would only stay two nights secondly no one told me that the upgrade was for three nights and non refundable ,No Positive
74538,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room decorations are very good But all the drawers seem empty Can t even find slippers , Room service is fairly good considering no quick bites restaurants near the hotel and the expensive restaurant on the first floor

74540,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Where to start The room looked as if it had not been redone in 15 years every peice of furniture massive marks looking very horrible doors for the cabinets almost falling off Massive gaps between the door frames and tiles old paint left on handrails a quick scrub got it off Toilet not cleaned think ammount of dirt building up inside on the sides where the cleaners are clearly only putting a brush straight down and not doing the sides Toenail clippings left in the bathroom from previous guest that then stayed there for there for 4 days that s 4 lots of house keeping who missed massive nails Dust everywhere run your finger along anything massive amounts of dust under the bed well that s dirt central The room paid extra to have a river they didn t lie I did get a river view over the main road through some trees we could see it 4 meters away from our room it also appeared to be a construction site which everyone failed to mention which wasn t a good view and the noise started first thing in the morning The sound proofing from the windows is very poor so being on a main road next to a construction site was not good The rooms are joining again something they failed to mention so awoken a few times by the family next to us who had a young baby that was clearly restless the days they stayed maybe because of the constant noise Now this isn t the mothers fault or the baby s but the hotel should have told us it s a joining room so there will be noise or put us in a different room The bed well I ve stayed in a lot of hotels and frankly it s the worse bed I ve slept in in London House keeping I m unsure what they do apart from steal we got fresh towels nothing else done Now be aware in London it is common practice to tip and leave tips for staff This should include housekeeping which I also do at end of stay ammount dependant on service , The doorman was the only nice friendly members of staff I found 
74541,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The smell of the bathroom was all over the room If you used air refreshers or perfume it would be nice , The staff are all awesome and so friendly The room was spacious and very clean The location of the hotel is perfect

74545,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Price is a little too high for me Air conditioning is a little noisy , Room was very clean comfortable and everything about the Hotel staff and facilities were excellent 
74546,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Awful view from back of hotel and really noisy I could have nearly touched the trains as they went past level with our bedroom window Very little sleep, Bathroom lovely hotel nice and clean close to Westminster They upgraded us without asking

74548,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Rather than a price deal with the breakfast on check in couldn t it just be advertised at a lower price on booking Poss food in the cocktail bar a little later would be good as we arrived late and could only get room service , Hotel feels modern and sophisticated Cool gadgets to control the systems in the room 
74549,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Stayed here a few times Always book an Executive river view room as the view is great And always go into the restaurant Chino Latino The food is amazing

74552,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Very few places to eat near by Our double room was 2 single beds pushed together a bit of a pain when your there with your partner we had a humming noise from outside which we could hear all night the rooms state soundproof which they are not , Excellent location and parking on street behind hotel is free on a weekend closest parking is at a near by hotel for 24 for 24 hours which we only had to use on the Monday worth every penny walking distance to everything but wear comfortable shoes lol
74553,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The unknown damage dopsit And the fact I still have not received it back also rooms are very nice could here the people in the room next door, Staff location clean

74556,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We wanted a twin room with a river view which the hotel doesnt have so we had to go for the double the view was more important The resturant didnt sell anything but pan asian would have been nice to have some italian american British dishes as an alternative difficult to feed children in there , Stuart on the front door waw very helpful when we needed our taxi to the airport ensured we got a taxi and was happy and friendly nothing was enough The room was outstanding stunning view
74557,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room was a little bit tired scuffs and marks on wall could do with a touch up, Two showers heads in lively shower and sushi in restaurant was excellent

74561,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The hotel was dated 3 of the lifts didn t work properly generally quite impersonal and the view was mostly onto a building site that when finished will be right into other hotel rooms There are other options for that price or less , Staff were very courteous
74562,Park Plaza London Riverbank, My room was slightly noisy because of lift going up and down nearby The bar prices maybe just a little high and eating breakfast in the bar area was strange The range of the buffet breakfast could have been better , Location Location Location The Hotel was good Easy to find and the rooms were good Plenty of staff to help 
74563,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, We booked an executive room with river view It was amazing loved the hotel Would definitely stay again we are planning another trip to London and will definitely pick this one 
74564,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We were in one of the new rooms accessed by the skyline lift Unfortunately there were many items that should have been sorted out at the snagging stage of construction before they were handed over There was ceiling panel damage which drew your eye in the bathroom straight away During the night the toilet flush seemed to jam so water was constantly coming out When the flush button was depressed to try to free the valve the whole mechanism fell inwards making the toilet unusable until it was dug back out Nothing was terrible really but for the high cost of the room we just expected a little more attention to detail and so should the hotel from its building contractors installation company , Great Location
74565,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The website undersells the hotel the pictures that are given do no justice for the property , Everything was perfect the location all of the staff were the most kind and genuine people and the room was amazing 
74566,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Instructions for the coffee machine seemed to be absent and I ve never used one before Less local facilities in immediate area , Polite staff Good shower Good facilities TV etc Iron and ironing board included very handy Good size room Nice food in restaurant and for breakfast Spacious reception and communal areas for meetings and relaxing 
74567,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The cooked breakfast was good but it could have been hotter most of the cooked items were nearly cold , The bed was comfy the room temperature was just right The toiletries were very nice 
74568,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The prices at the hotel bar Like seriously make the prices subject to what people order not 10 for a gin and lemonade please , The live music in the bar restaurant was lovely and unexpected The location is perfect in terms of proximity to the centre of London and the underground a five minute walk

74571,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Train tracks behind the hotel Restaurant staff not attentive Waited what seemed like forever to get a menu in the bar while the bartender and 4 others stood around chatting Food just so so , Beautiful Great location along the river 
74572,Park Plaza London Riverbank, It would have been nice if there was complimentary water Bottles of water from the mini bar was very expensive , The location of the hotel was excellent About an 8 minute walk to Vauxhall station and a nice walk to the Southbank and Houses of Parliament Staff were very helpful and friendly Wi Fi is complimentary 
74573,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Chips could have been warmer and maybe the staff in the breakfast room could have backed off a bit they were kind of looming over me waiting for me to finish , Location amazing room service quick and tasty though the chips were a bit cold and breakfast was lovely The pastries in particular were specatular Loved the automatic curtains and the bedside lighting box 
74574,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room was a little smaller than i had hoped although we managed okay The bed was a little uncomfortable as were the pillows Wanted to eat in the restaurant but didn t book ahead of time Not sure what advancement of booking was needed as we ordered take away every night The television was also very hard to control and lacking basic features like a television guide This meant that i had to go to every single channel individually in order to see what was on The location was also very far out of the way of anything worth visiting something to bare in mind Uber s everywhere were far cheaper than taxi s although they still cost a lot compared to busses which require a hefty walk to get too , The hotel staff were incredibly attentive and warming They made sure you were always greeted and your needs were met Room service came within reasonable timings The hotel was beautifully decorated inside and looked very posh 
74575,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, The atmosphere was wonderful And we were seen to really quickly at check in all amenities in the room were first class The staff were incredible and gave us an wonderful service The location setting is amazing being next to the River and not far away from the houses of Parliament i have thoroughly enjoyed my stay and look forward to staying at this hotel again or to one of the other park plazas in Central London

74577,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Hotel is next to building that is currently being developed so work started at 7am and goes on all day and on Sunday Road outside was closed all weekend as Crane was in place so taxis and cabs couldn t pull up so had to walk a fair bit Breakfast buffet was cold ,No Positive
74578,Park Plaza London Riverbank, They were let down by the speed or lack of of the back of house kitchen and bar The biggest gripe we had was the seating in the bar We couldn t get a table to eat on our first night so the staff gave us a table in the bar The table is more like a coffee table with easy chairs around not really the easiest position to eat a meal , The front of house staff the waiters waitresses in the restaurant bar were excellent They were attentive and helpful The breakfast buffet was very good beautifully cooked and plenty of it The Chino Latino restaurant was very nice Just a slightly a slightly limited menu 
74579,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room was very hot even though it was cold outside and panel indicated the AC was on the coldest setting Engineer came and said there was nothing to be done Food was below standard expected of a hotel like this Bfast was expensive and very basic nothing exciting Had room service twice hot food was cold cold salad was warm both times , The view was wonderful and location was very convenient for the work I needed to do that said there is nothing to do nearby and no outside restaurants or coffee shops nearby 
74580,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The staff were abrupt We were directed to hospital carpark being told 15 for 24 hrs it was 74 we checked via phone before booking very disappointing end , The room

74583,Park Plaza London Riverbank, we were only told about the 50 per night security deposit on the room when we arrived to check in , staff were super friendly and helpful the location was ideal because it was close to a tube station and practically across the river from big ben 
74584,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Nothing except the gym needs improvement and I wish it had better equipment , I loved everything about this hotel The rooms are very spacious the location is great the room service dinging is very yummy and fast and the staff at the front desk were very helpful specially Ms Butol at the reception This hotel has become my favorite in London
74585,Park Plaza London Riverbank, First nights sleep disturbed by noisey occupants of room directly over ours So better soundproofing, The bedroom was superb most comfy bed ever Got a free room upgrade as was wife s 50th birthday
74586,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The reception staff checking out was very rude and made us feel stupid when we didn t realize we had to pay an outstanding balance for our room which was not a problem it was her attitude that there was no need for We checked out on Saturday the 4th of February and the room number was 428 On our arrival the girl on reception was more than helpful,No Positive
74587,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The view from my room was looking at other rooms, The new renovation is great The water pressure is great Bright lit room with different settings at simple touch of finger
74588,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The one and only thing that was a little annoying was that we asked the of the night time stay if we could have late check out and breakfast to the room which she said was fine but obviously didn t get communicated to the morning stay as we have several staff enter the room while we were trying to sleep or in the shower , Went above and beyond for the entire stay Provides us with complimentary goodies as it was my birthday celebrations So impressed Will 100 stay here again in the future

74590,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Upgraded to executive room but room was small and tight for 2 persons Asked for a river view and got an inward looking room with views of other inward looking rooms Bathroom and room lighting fancy but not that practical Expensive bar twice the price of the pub less than 100m away ,No Positive
74591,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Sometimes the room was a bit too hot , The rooms are very fresh The he receptionists always called back to the room after a service had been made to make sure everything went accordingly Park plaza was one of the most extravagant hotels I ve been in The staff were so helpful and polite My friend and I were always greeted with a smile Most definitely a place I would recommend 
74592,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We were charged for breakfast for both days despite telling staff at check in that we only needed it on one day The staff refused to remove and refund us on check out We won t stay here again due to this What a shame they really spoiled an otherwise lovely weekend Breakfast was pretty poor too chaotic environment and oh my days toooo hot in the dining room Eggs tasteless had to ask for coffee tea numerous times ,No Positive
74593,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I paid good money the same as everyone else staying although it was made quite clear by looks from the staff and attitude that because I choose to wear tracksuits as this is how I m most comfortable I somehow didn t fit in and wasn t as welcome as other guests staying at the hotel Really they shouldn t judge a book by it s cover as I am a business owner and stay in hotels of that standard and better often and am not treated like that anywere else ,No Positive

74595,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Check in and check out was painfully bureaucratic and IT systems slow How hard can it be to check someone in and out of a hotel Room was cold and adjusting the aircon made no impact A loud droning sound could be heard every now and again which made sleeping difficult ,No Positive

74598,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The immediate area around the hotel is lacking in facilities but thats not really a negative as you are so close to the city centre , Efficient staff and great rooms for a great price Location was great for city centre access or access to south London 
74599,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We had to call up twice about the room being so hot however the night reception manager added on breakfast onto our booking free of charge for each day we stayed so she absolutely made up for the room being boiling , Location was absolutely perfect for a romantic stay in the city 
74600,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The fact that the hotel room door didn t shut properly and lock so anyone would be able to walk by and push our door open from the outside was concerning We did however lock the door internally but we felt that this issue should have been checked before we checked in , The view of the Thames was nice but it was slightly blocked by the trees outside our window Still very nice and the internal decor is what you would expect for your money The light system is very handy as we would control the lights and heating from our bed 
74601,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Maybe just when I first checked in and when I tried to pay admin bond fee the system said my card declined bit I knew I had available funds may have been a small system glitch A minor hiccup , Breakfast buffet was awesome staff very helpful and professional Room reasonable size and quiet which was really good Elevators nice and spacious and not waiting for long time for an elevator Staff friendly approachable helpful graceful and professional

74611,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Nothing I disliked about the hotel all I will warn you is just be careful of the minibar in your room could have cost myself 7 50 for a little shot of vodka Also if you want a room with a view make sure to tell them that because for a superior room I didn t have a superior view other hotel Windows but that s not exactly a deal breaker , Staff were very helpful and made you feel welcome Room was cleaned brilliantly everyday which had an electronic sign so say whether your room needed cleaning or not Mood settings and AC on the go Amazing facilities within the hotel itself Bar looked right across the riverbank which made it that extra bit of perfect whilst having a drink Without a doubt the best hotel I ve had the privilege of staying in and for where you want to go in London you re sat right in the middle of everything 
74612,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Room was very hot even with air con on the lowest setting and window wide open Breakfast we went to at 9 30 was also very dry, Location down by the Thames
74613,Park Plaza London Riverbank, For the quality of build equipment and facilities etc the comfort of the bed was a huge let down Would rate the mattress 4 10 , Everything was very well built the room temp lighting control system was awesome 
74614,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Facilities faults After two calls to reception and a visit from maintaince it was determined to be a system fault with my room I was upgraded to a better room at 10pm which had the exact same problem Called reception again Was told they would get back waited but by midnight not heard back so went to bed Disappointed as it was a single night stay , Location was excellent 
74615,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I needed a plainer menu option Didn t quite understand it , Bed very good bathroom shower good cocktail lounge v good particularly having option of non alcoholic cocktail My husband liked the food me not so much A bit too dark to read menu in dining room we are quite elderly Concierge booked us theatre tickets Taxis available

74617,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We had a brand new room which was all electronically controlled from one panel the lights wouldn t turn off at night so we had to have our room reset After the reset the lights curtains aircon or telephone wouldn t work We went to sleep as it was late but then the next morning couldn t turn lights on to get ready and we couldn t even open the curtains to get some light in because they were controlled by the same panel The phone wouldn t work either haha A cleaner was on our corridor and we asked for her to contact reception to send someone up or to restart it again and no one came or nothing happened We understand this was totally teething problems as it was a new room but it did cut our relaxing stay a little short as we couldn t even make a brew Reception after coaxing knocked a little from the room rate and have offered a reduced rate if we do stay again which we would The hotel is lovely and this hasn t put us off I will just maybe choose one of the more traditional rooms next time , Beds super comfy and the hotel was impressive Restaurant food was fab and the staff mega friendly 
74618,Park Plaza London Riverbank, A connecting door into the next room meant there was some noise travelling through Otherwise nothing , Comfortable bed bathroom that worked great view photo added early evening The hotel gave my husband a card chocolates and wine for his birthday which was lovely The staff are friendly and helpful This was my husband s second birthday spent there and good both times We will be back 
74619,Park Plaza London Riverbank, They don t clean properly didn t change the sheets they just sort the old ones They went in and claned the room when the privcy sign was there and they didn t actually clean just changed the towels and sorted the bed The Heater stopped twice during my stay had to spend a night with an external one For such a name i was expecting better services, The location is the only good thing there
74620,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room had not been cleaned very well and the food items in the mini bar had not been checked and were open and scattered everywhere The general cleanliness of the room could easily have been better, The hotel has nice public areas
74621,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I had booked the hotel for 2 nights but unfortunately I had to leave after 1 because of a family emergency When leaving the woman at the front desk said I d get a refund for the second night once I contact booking com After contacting booking com they told me that the hotel refused to refund my second day even though the woman at the desk told me I would get a refund I will not be staying at the hotel again ,No Positive
74622,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I did not like being charged 50 00 each before we had used any room service facilities I think there should of been a pre warning about this and only charged at the end of your stay, The decor of the hotel was fabulous Very good facilities in the room and very warm 
74623,Park Plaza London Riverbank, On arrival the hotel looked fantastic better than I expected but that s where it ended We arrived just after 2pm and we re told our room was not ready and to come back in an hour At around 3 15 we returned and the room was ready we finally found our room which had a tiny number as the light up number outside our room was not connected wires on show The bed had two lovely towel swans on but was made a total mess with only one pillow each all the surfaces has cup rings and smears from previous guests The carpet was wet in various places where I m guessing the cleaner has stood a bucket The bathroom was filthy a dirty cloth used to clean the toilet the shower had mould along the edges it had clearly been repainted recently and there was paint all over the shower head The toiletries next to the sink had clearly been used and there was toothpaste from a previous guest down the frosted glass doors the sofa in the room which was originally yellow now with disgusting brown stains had some red cushions on with what looked like mud on The view was directly into flats next to the hotel even though our room was not cheap As it was New Year s Eve I knew the hotel was fully booked and we wouldn t be moved The following day we went shopping and returned to the room which had been cleaned a dirty cloth had been used to wipe the tv which now was smeared and stank the bed had been remade in a fashion pillows just thrown on also the cups spoons for tea making we re both dirty for a second time and we also noticed there was an issue with the plug socket next to the bed Which worked when it fancied On the morning of our check out we were woken by workmen drilling outside the door hovering up dust Disappointed is an understatement, The staff that worked on the entrance and took your bags were fantastic

74632,Park Plaza London Riverbank, One member of the waiting staff seemed poorly trained however after a complaint everything improved immensely , Great room fantastic views and attentive service Good location 
74633,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The mattress was very uncomfortable so we didn t sleep very well Both woke up with stiff shoulders and necks There were no extra pillows in the wardrobe ,No Positive
74634,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Everything needs to be sharper especially the staff and the bar dinning area needs to be clean and on point at all times you also could put up a tv with news and things to do while visiting london you could also maybe put some drop down blinds wind by the smoking area and make it more inviting ,No Positive
74635,Park Plaza London Riverbank, It took 3 days and a request every day to open my minibar although I left a credit card at reception I found the Reception staff not very friendly and the bar staff slow to ask for orders I eventually kept going to the bar myself I m not sure I would recommend it other than for location ,No Positive

74651,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The breakfast was very busy and not many spare tables There was quite a jostle in getting the breakfast and making toast and tea etc , Beds were comfortable and free WiFi was good 
74652,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The breakfast was somewhat cold on both days and we must have hit a busy period because many of the items on the hot breakfast were not available or being replenished, Excellent staff very helpful and very upbeat
74653,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The TV was difficult to work maybe batteries needed changing in the remote More teabags milk needed and we only had one pack of biscuits between us , Lovely hotel in a great location
74654,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The extra service charges to the drinks bill and the fact they could not give you the right change so gave you less change than you were owed left a feeling of being done which was a shame when everything else was lovely Food was also expensive would recommend the near by river cafes much cheaper and lovely views of river and land marks , The staff were friendly and the hotel comfortable superb position Clean and welcoming

74661,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I thought that there was not enough lifts for the amount of people that stay in the hotel as every lift you wait for is normally full so u can t fit in so you could be waiting for 10 mins for one But all in all great hotel , Hotel was brilliant staff were very friendly Location was brilliant for tourist the room was amazing from the confutable bed to the amazing bathroom

74667,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Room was dark the furniture dated and worn My room faced out into the center of the hotel so view was non existent For a superior double room I was surprised at what I got Dred to see what a regular room looks like 
74668,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Lighting in bedroom not good if one person wants to read in bed Overhead bed lights not a good idea Had to request extra pillows as only one on the bed Eventually found information in desk drawer re personal choice of pillows Having been exploring all day it was unacceptable to come back to our room to find the bedroom window had been left open by the housekeeping staff since morning Maybe this would be welcome on a hot summer day but this is December I couldn t find any information in the room about hotel facilities and check out times We didn t make booking for breakfast but enquired at the restaurant on 1st floor about just coffee and croissant but they said it was a set price for breakfast and there was not pricing available to meet our request , Location allows easy access to south bank river side walk and choice of underground stations The beds are comfortable and the bathroom spacious with a great shower

74675,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Smelly toilet food poisoned my colleague attitude of staff in resteraunt state of bathroom just not nice and 107 on a Sunday means basic standards at least are required And beefburgers if served need to be cooked properly not cold and not poisonous , The system for lighting the room

74677,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Aircon seemed to come back on to heat the room when we went out we wanted a cooler room, Rooms were lovely Location was great for what we wanted Friendly staff Good gadgets to control lights tv etc if you like that kinda thing 
74678,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I had a room at the back of the hotel so no view and noisy trains but I guess that is the luck of the draw The room and furniture looked tired though I hear that a renovation is planned The background music in the restaurant at breakfast time is too loud and more suited to a nightclub or bar The area around the hotel is not particularly pleasant and offers little or nothing in the way of interest or entertainment except the Imperial War Museum , The staff were very good attentive and well trained I had a couple of technical issues with the room which were handled promptly and efficiently I had breakfast three times and room service once All were to a good standard I was upgraded to a suite which I appreciated

74680,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Didn t get the rooom that I had requested Receptionist was arrogant and did not want to know any of my concerns Sat at the bar having ordered a beer the barman tried adding 1 40 for service charge Absurd , Location was good easy access into city centre shopping areas if you know how to get there Easy acccess to Paddington Railway Station via bus Don t get a rear facing room as you will be woken very early by the trains 
74681,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Need to change the late checkout early checkin policy to ensure the rooms are ready when they say they are, Great location and price Loved the hotel itself Breakfast was good Great helpful staff in all situations Checking in could have been better room wasn t available but the lady on reception went out of her way to make sure we got a room straight away Issue at checkout with the bill but again the receptionist went out of their way to help 
74682,Park Plaza London Riverbank, All good for me Comfortable stay , My second time to stay in this amazing hotel Great location fantastic breakfast and amazing staff I want to thank everyone who made an effort to make my partner s birthday very memorable We do come every year and Special mention to Joaquin B 4498 for your amazing hospitality and your hard work and professionalism Overall a great hotel and definitely will come back again 
74683,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I had booked twin rooms but when we arrive they upgraded us to a suite which we thought was nice but it wasn t the room had a sofa bed and a double bed but the mattress on the sofa bed was as thin as paper and I was basically lying on the metal bars which was incredibly uncomfortable We packed our cases and they moved everything for us while we were out for the day to a twin room the next day and everything was fine then and the beds were comfy and the bathroom spotless , Lovely hotel and easy to find via the underground from Heathrow Airport 6 on the underground or 80 in a taxi The location was great and walking distance to everywhere Plenty of things to choose from at breakfast and the staff could not have been more helpful and very friendly 
74684,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Customer service was terrible Although we arrived at 4pm our room wasn t ready and so ensued an embarrassingly slow and inconvenient customer service process that meant we didn t get our room until 2 hours later As a couple I could have coped with this but with a 7 year old girl and a hungry 3 month old this was awful When trying to rectify the situation there was very little communication and a constant need to check with the manager for every logical suggestion we put forward ie put us in a room that is ready upgrade our room , The location of this hotel is good We were a short walk from popular tourist attractions 
74685,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Taking a security deposit for extras ie the minibar yet the minibar was locked The view well there wasn t one but I will remember that for next time , Great location the staff were very friendly and it was a very enjoyable stay

74687,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room was really dirty when I arrived crumbs hair and dust on the carpet desk and even in the drawers Cleaning ladies just don t care or are blind Had to complain 3 times about it Room was very worn out holes in the curtains stains on curtains and carpet etc etc Bathroom was OK Room service food very poor e g steak sandwich and greasy , The view from my room looking over the Thames and houses of parliament was stunning The Chino Latino restaurant is fantastic 
74688,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Service in bar was extremely slow although not busy and the prices for drinks extortionate, The room was lovely and shower hot Visited the bar for drinks

74692,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I was placed on the 10th floor with repair construction work going on on my floor I was not pleased as I was there celebrating a special day with guests The money I paid for this stay did not reflect the service we received I was disappointed by the way this lovely hotel presented itself , Helpful staff good location
74693,Park Plaza London Riverbank, They didn t bother cleaning the dust on surfaces carpet floors or used glasses before my arrival If you require a simple plaster to stop bleeding from a small cut it may take more than half an hour and 7 telephone calls for the staff to deliver it as in my case It wasn t a quiet room even though I explicitly asked with regular train construction electric transformer unit noises The usual London Hotel behaviour Asking for deposit for everything from the room to the umbrella Unsecured Wifi Small annoyances such as the elevator that makes you wait min 5 minutes each time high end room control gadgets that require daily reset which otherwise don t turn of the lights no sewing kit etc , The location is central 
74694,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The receptionist was unbelievably rude I booked a superior double room and i was given a basic one I emailed the hotel in advance that i would like a room with the view towards the thames i was given a room towards the backside of a building under construction , The hotel was nice the location was good overall a good stay
74695,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I was asked to pay on arrival and was charged an extra 50 as a deposit on any extras incurred The receptionist told me this would be refunded on checkout but in fact it still has not been refunded over 24 hours later despite no extras being incurred My room was near the lift shaft which meant that I was kept awake until 1am as I could hear the lift going up and down the shaft all night Also the heating in the room was controlled by the a c vent which blew out air sounding like a vacuum cleaner impossible to sleep with the racket so I had to switch off the heating and froze in bed, Nice bathroom free tea and coffee in the room friendly and helpful concierge
74696,Park Plaza London Riverbank, There was no view from our room apart from other residents rooms , Amazing location Staff went out of their way to help It s the kind of place where people will keep coming back to a real home from home

74699,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Too hot in room stuffy and difficult to sleep with bright lights on controls will make sense if you stay there , Good staff nice reception and decent room layouy
74700,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Was unhappy with the hidden charges on reception on arrival 50 a night to cover cost s on Mini bar Also though Breakfast was priced very highly for the small selection which you had , Brilliant Location being 5 Minuet walk away from Vauxhall Tube Station and just a 2 Minuet walk away from the London Eye 
74701,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room was fine but the toilet could have been cleaner , The staff were happy and friendly It was my birthday and l was provided with an upgrade and prosecco with chocolates 
74702,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, For the price we paid on a Friday night the room was fantastic Everything was clean updated and comfortable The hotel is within view of Big Ben and easy walking distance of the underground 
74703,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Shame there is a building site next door where work starts early but that is out of their control and I was informed when booking, Excellent Staff v knowledgeable of the area and local restaurants Very friendly and made me feel welcome straight away
74704,Park Plaza London Riverbank, the room they gave me was full of dirty whole of the fifth floor smells very dirty everything fantastic but room was very dirty and durst everywhere, nice and pose
74705,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Good quality of service The staff is really welcoming and ready to help you My room was clean The hotel location is not so far from Vauxhall train station around 8 minute walk It was a good experience I will not hesitate to come back again 
74706,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The system of the elevators work was awful you could see a near elevator but still had to wait for some 5 minutes for another one to come sometimes they were full And the location was not very comfortable though not far from the very center but not very close to the Subway station , The staff was very nice the food was really good and the room was quite comfortable 
74707,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Was very happy with this stay No complaints , We stayed here as we were going to a gig in Fire nightclub which was just around the corner The staff were so friendly here They all made sure to say hello to you with a smile Really makes a difference in your stay when there are lovely staff The rooms are nice and big especially in London It s very central A five minute walk from the underground very easy to get to Very good value for your money Big comfy beds Lovely big showers and a bath 
74708,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Check in was very slow Room facilities in our superior room were not particularly impressive The heating air conditioning system blew extremely hot air and could not be adjusted On complaining we were told this was how it worked at this time of year so why bother having in room controls The side of the bath was hanging off One thin pillow was provided per person We had a view of a large and indeed noisy air conditioning unit paintbrushes ladders and other equipment left out immediately outside our window , Good location for the areas we were planning to visit 
74709,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Didn t know about breakfast was expensive got confused with lifts bath was confusing and uncomfortable light switches annoying temperature was all over the place and no happy medium , Decor front desk were chatty and helpful
74710,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Urine on the toilet seat in our bedroom hadn t been cleaned Only one pillow each Rather uncomfy bed 50 for breakfast for two Staff tried to charge my card twice for the room meaning it declined and utterly embarrassed me standing in reception , Breakfast was pricey but good 
74711,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Extra charge per night in case we use extras was higher than we ve ever come across in a hotel before 50 per night Housekeeping didnt really do a full clean any of the 3 nights we were there even though we requested a full room clean , The bed was veey comfy Great shower and bath tub I asked the receptionist for a high up room to have a better view she bumped us up by 5 floors The conceirge was friendly The lightpad to adjust the light settings was a small touch thay went a long way 
74712,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Heating didn t work so room was freezing Had a view of a building site from window and constant banging hammering and drilling, Room was nice bed was great as was the location
74713,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We couldn t get the air con to warm the room Our room was so cold I had to go to bed in a scarf , The fantastically friendly Reception staff member
74714,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I needed to ask for the manager to solve my problem because I paid for a double room and I reserved in advance but they give me a room with two single bed put together and a view of the machines in a first floor The assistant on the reception said me that the hotel was full but come on I had a reservation for a double room that I did 2 months in advance If I didnt ask to speak with the manager my parents will stay in that horrible room James the manager put my parents in a real double room not so good as the room that I was on July but at least with a double bed It is not good for clients face this kind of experience I am not happy with this hotel ,No Positive
74715,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We booked a room for two adults and a child On our arrival We had to make an extra payment as the room could only host two persons This hidden cost is very disappointing, Hotel staff were very helpful extra
74716,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Checkin took too long very unnecessarry Breakfast was very bad quality and did not live up to the quality to the hhotel , Fantastic ambient feeling and super service from staff Restaurant was fantastic 
74717,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The toilet was badly stained could have done with a proper clean Not happy about being charged for the bar in the room we didn t use it too expensive but our money was reimbursed the next day,No Positive
74718,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Location isn t great for central London around a 40 minute walk from Charing Cross Took an age to check in even though there was no queue Couldn t watch the TV as the digital reception was so poor and the lights were flickering as though there wasn t a continuous electricity supply The automatic door sensors at the entrance didn t seem to work and whacked me in the shoulder as I walked through Then they charged over double for the room and it took two weeks to get my money back after being passed round numerous people saying they couldn t find it being asked to send bank account statements through numerous times Eventually it was blamed on a system error and no apology or offer of any form of compensation was provided Yeah I wonder just how often this happens Never again , Nothing 
74719,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The location is about 10 to 15 minute walk the nearby tube stations While we knew during the time of booking one of us developed walking difficulty during the trip and found the location less ideal , Comes with services and facilities that one would have expected in a standard city hotel Its location is within walking distance to the Westminster area where there are a number of interesting attractions It is beautify at night 
74720,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Great location It s just a short walk to Westminster Bridge and Lindon Eye or the same short walk to the tube Best facilities and standard I have found in London and would definitely retirn
74721,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Valet Parking too expensive, Almost perfect Unfortunately no Underground station is closed to the hotel but 10 minutes walk and you get to westminster bridge easily
74722,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We got moved to a different room at the last minute room 636 when we checked in earlier and when we picked up the key later was moved to 730 without explanation the air conditioning didn t work and what should have been a superior room looked out over the back We only had one pillow each too It was our first wedding anniversary I spoke to the duty manager about the air conditioning explaining we weren t satisfied her reply was ask if we wanted to check out it was 2130 at this point no apology nothing not great management skills witnessed ,No Positive
74723,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Unfortunately the breakfast buffet was cold and the executive lounge was locked , Delighted to have been given an upgrade to a room with a view free breakfast and use of the Executive Lounge 
74724,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I think I have been in a room for people in a wheel chair That is not a problem at all but it was a bit strange , Frinedly staff and a great located hotel in the heart of London Also the wi fi was very fast I use to travel very often and this is not often the case 
74725,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, The restaurant serving Asian style food was excellent and would recommend it A couple of snags I ordered coconut and date cheesecake which certainly looked good and was tasty but sadly tasted very much like strawberries and hazelnuts the staff were adamant it was what I ordered Mmmm The other Snag was the printing on the menu With red lighting predominant the red printing disappeared from sigh on the menu 
74726,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Nothing all was great , It was a very special occasion for us and all the staff helped make it very convenient A special THANK YOU to Batoul who was such an angel for me on our 20 th anniversary the view was amazing the breakfast all matched my wishlist 
74727,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Expensive and very poor quality in room dining Could have had better from McDonald s Really bad cheap frozen chips a burger that was extremely poor and nearly 25 is extortionate, Staff
74728,Park Plaza London Riverbank, No mirror near a socket for hot air brush use Bar area rather bland not cosy , Room spacious with lovely view Location handy for bus routes Good breakfast 
74729,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Aircondition in the room quite noisy not enough choice if you prefer a continental breakfast just 1 sort of cheese and 2 sorts of meat no delicious bread as usual in the UK , Very friendly and helpfull staff
74730,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We chose a kids movie which worked for 5 minutes only The room service food was not hot and the blt sandwich was with brown bread not white bread I had an ordeal to stay in the room I had been allowed to book on booking com The housekeepers were not happy at all , Fun packs for the girls and beds pushed together for extra comfort The business centre s Alina and Natascha were excellent and went out of their way to help me get my lost mobile phone back Left it in a black cab It was amazing They are so efficient Thank you 
74731,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Rear facing room impacted by noise from nearby railway line and I couldn t silence the noisy AC system which was a pain , Location was fabulous room was modern bright and clean
74732,Park Plaza London Riverbank, View into another hotel room Room wasn t homey at all Had to pay up front at check in not much of a neighbourhood somewhat isolated construction noises during the day , Bathroom clean separate shower and tube 15 min to tube 
74733,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The cooked breakfast could have been hotter porridge lumpy and lukewarm , The friendly welcome and the personal touches e g a handwritten congratulations card and surprise bottle of prosecco The modern room controls 
74734,Park Plaza London Riverbank, A little bit noisy due to train tracks behind the hotel but wasn t really too bothersome , Nice modern comfortable rooms The room had some really great features including outlets for Canadian US voltage 
74735,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Room service food very poor cold and not good quality Woken up at 2am in the morning by other guests having a party in their room The drain covers in the shower were off the toilet button was missing and the television didn t work Complained to guest relations in the morning who tried to fob me off as I didn t complain when I got the room service I explained it was late and we were fed up we pushed for more compensation and eventually got Have to say we had a terrible experience and there seemed no desire to make up for it , Location good and a good view of the river extensive room service menu Concierge very good
74736,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Friendliness of staff I took my goddaughter and they arranged a lovely basket of goodies for the room The room was spacious and the bathroom was lovely 
74737,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Only a small fraction of the rooms face in clearly desirable direction to have a good view Everybody will ask for such a room of course We were disappointed There are new buildings appearing in very close proximity to the hotel which is spoiling the advantage of the splendid location The main asset therefore is the executive lounge which would share the ambience among all the guests if all the guests had access This would be my advice to the hotel , This hotel is lush and the staff friendly and committed It is walking distance from the action in london and a pleasant walk at that Since its a riverside location you can relax at the end of day with no more crowds around you and you can look around and see an illuminated landscape at least a mile long in each direction which is always a welcome wind down from the hussle and bustle which is also the attraction in london 
74738,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Rooms were lovely and clean staff were very friendly and helpful good location Only 10 minutes walk from tube station and only 15 minutes to the London eye so no need for taxis 
74739,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Firstly the room I was given was at the back of the hotel which backs onto Waterloo s 5 6 train tracks so very noisy I did ask to move but the hotel was full I paid over 160 for one night so I wasn t impressed and even though I wear hearing aids you were very aware of them running every 3 4 mins they did stop running around midnight Also the room had a bizarre lighting system which when set on Mood flickered all the time very annoying you also couldn t figure how to switch the lights off in the lounge area it was a suite The bed was very poor for the money charged and the furniture cheap old tired and badly damaged in places huge rip in the front of the sofa of about 25cm long Won t be staying again , I booked the hotel based on its location to St George s Wharf and the fact it was a Carlton
74740,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I was caught up in the middle of maintenance Carpet removal in the hallway window cleaning water leak in the room and stained bedding The room had a moldy odor , The staff was pleasant The breakfast was great I liked the availability of a restaurant For a first time visit it was well located to places I was interested to see Easy access to the central district A welcoming lobby 
74741,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Payment by card wasn t working when I checked in I was tired and all I wanted was to go to bed so the whole back and forth with the cards was a little too much , I love the spacious rooms at Park Plaza They definitely don t give you the claustrophobic feeling that most of the hotel rooms in London do My office is right across the street so Park Plaza is perfect for my quick business trips 
74742,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Bed wasn t very comfortable breakfast buffet was cold despite staff member probing it with a thermometer , nice new and modern very clean and good location
74743,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Upon arriving at the hotel my immediate thought was wow this place looks nice Then I got to the front desk what they saw was a person with a shaved head missing tooth jeans and a hoodie Not a former ice hockey player who is now a director of a software company Upon seeing this it was insisted that I pay for my room up front in full but was described as a deposit The term desposit according to the dictionary is to give as security or in part payment Upon taking issue with this I asked for a manager to clarify why a deposit of the full balance was required when it is standard practice to pay on departure The manager couldnt answer the question without his long period of hesitation and put it down to my method of card payment Now where I come from Peterborough by way of Birmingham both UK a Visa card is a Visa card So after proteacted dicsussion I reluctantly paid the full ballance and then went up to my room I then ordered room service which took them a while to get what I was asking for which was simiply a burger and wasnt allowed to charge this to my room and again had to pay up front Again I have no issue with this typically but given the issue i had at the front desk a theme started to present itself When the burger came it wasnt the warmest of food even though it was freshly prepared Room staff then pretty much forced their way into the room and then spilt one of the drinks all over my floor I am surprised they didnt try and charge me for the replacemet All other evenings for food were ok except one where the food was stone cold however a hot replacement was provided Then the second day came and my room key had been deactivated Upon going to the front desk I confronted the manager again who advised me that he personally had put a letter of apology in my room with a new key that would work for the duration of my stay Great how do I get a key that has been put in a room that I cannot access , There wasnt much to like about this stay 
74744,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Very clean very modern space Absolutely love the control consoles for the room Nice location right along the river and easy 25 min walk to Big Ben and other sites of interest Courteous staff pleasant experience Nice restaurants nearby Easy access to the tube about 5 kilometers away 
74745,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Breakfast should be inclusive of everything and not pay separately for pancakes or omelets The canned fruit was not acceptable , Really nice restaurant and bar 
74746,Park Plaza London Riverbank, it would have been great if there had been more television channels and if they d been easier to find Our mini bar was empty and hadn t been cleaned , Comfy bed and room great food in the restaurant and room service All staff very helpful and friendly Great views from the restaurant Love the whole ambiance of the hotel 
74747,Park Plaza London Riverbank, My wife tried to check in ahead of me as I was still working she was unable to do so as she did not have my credit card We had booked a premium double and were upgraded to an executive room with city view Could not see the benefit see picture 11th floor carpet in corridor and room was tired and dirty Located beside busy railway junction Train noise from early morning Located beside construction site Construction noise from early morning We also had a couple of door key failures , Bed was comfy Bathroom was clean Staff were friendly 
74748,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Breakfast buffet was average with an extra 9 charge for an omelette Only one complimentary water and one biscuit in double room is poor , View is fantastic and location is great Staff very friendly 
74749,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The lifts were extremely slow , I liked the location on the Thames Vauxhall underground station is a reasonably close walk or it is only one bus stop ride if you have a lot of luggage The buses are every few minutes I enjoyed the fitness room Bed and pillows very comfy Room was reasonably spacious We had superior double rooms 
74750,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Workmen outside bedroom window all day Renovation work being done We were not told about this as we booked and it was not reflected in the price, Staff were pleasent and helpful
74751,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We were on 10th floor overlooking a very busy rail network so light sleepers would have possibly found this an issue we slept like logs however and in any case there are plenty of rooms that face over the river so we would choose one of those next time It s a quiet part of Southbank at Lambeth compared with only a bit further up the road towards the London Eye so all in all location was one of its very major benefits ,No Positive
74752,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The reception noise due to carpet change at my floor and i have asked for a wake up call but no one called me , Cleaning the room was fabulas thanks Every think else was great thanks
74753,Park Plaza London Riverbank, When I tried use the iron in the room it tripped out all the electrics A concierge came up it was midnight and said oh no not again He was very pleasant and fixed the problem I needed a different iron so housekeeping brought me one with no steam function I requested a different one and asked them to leave it outside the room At 5am I tried to iron my shirt again The iron I had been left was dirty and left a black stain on my shirt Then the electrics went out again and the same concierge returned and had to stand there whilst I tried to complete the ironing constantly resetting the electrics I reported my dissatisfaction when I checked out only to be told oh sorry about that here s your receipt Not what I was expecting from a hotel of this calibre , It was Ok for what I required The location was my main reason for choosing this hotel 
74754,Park Plaza London Riverbank, A ground floor coffee shop would be nice for meeting waiting Fresh milk in rooms would be nicer than longlife milk, The ice machines are an accessible additional convenience Staff all charming and helpful
74755,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Room wasn t ready when we arrived so we were punted on to the 10th floor The 10th floor is being decorated so our room stank of paint filler , Nice Bed
74756,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Very poor breakfast lukewarm Very slow checkout then when i got home i realised I had been overcharged quite problematic to sort out Not very close to main tube stations , Lovely room clean and comfortable Good quality TV Helpful staff 
74757,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Location Nothing close by Not even restaurants Desk locked us out of our room Problems getting desk to act Concierge told us wrong about the London Pass bus Ended on the wrong bus didn t see anything , Bell boys very helpful Got us taxis right away 
74758,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Only one fairly flat pillow each although a request for more was met with a smile and efficiency but I didn t think we should have to ask one pillow each is a little stingy Also a little stingy was the complimentary drinks tray only enough for one cup of your choice and no free water, The staff were all wonderful and the hotel very efficient and attractively decorated We didn t eat there so can t comment on the breakfast Great bath 
74759,Park Plaza London Riverbank, That I requested a riverbank view and did not get one and the lack of pillows on the bed , The hotel was very luxurious and smart Rooms were very nice and advanced looking Very hard to fault 
74760,Park Plaza London Riverbank, There was a small issue with Concierge bringing our luggage up to the room as reception had forgotten to notify them but the professionalism of the staff when I phoned them from the room was superb it really was no hassle at all to us and only a VERY light complaint well not really a complaint we all make mistakes Concierge phoned us then the Manager phoned us shortly after to see if we were happy which we were as they treated us well, Amazing view from our River facing Room Excellent service Friendly staff Good value for the scenery and facilities on offer Great food to room service at 12 30am Well stocked mini bar
74761,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I paid for a room with river view They said that they upgraded me to junior suite and we were on the 3rd floor As a result trees were blocking our view to big ben That was bad ,No Positive
74762,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Nothing We both thoroughly enjoyed our two periods of stay There was some building development at the time which was well managed communicated, The customer support and service was fantastic
74763,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I didn t like how much construction work was happening in the area and the main entrance to the hotel was closed which I wasn t aware of till we arrived Also I thought the cost of the hotel room was quite pricey compared to other hotels I have stayed at which have larger rooms at a much cheaper price When I arrived in the room after a long journey I was annoyed that there was no hot drink station only to find it in a drawer of the television stand 2 minutes before we checked out the next day a strange place to put the kettle I thought , I liked the location of the hotel as it was very close to the sightseeing attractions I wanted to see The restaurant in the hotel was beautiful with lovely staff Also the restaurant on the boat opposite the hotel was nice too and good value for money It was close to the vaxhaull tube station 
74764,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Breakfast was poor and dis organised Half the dining room was blocked off at 9 30 for no apparent reason Also the room was an executive room with two uncomfortable chairs It is a business hotel and should not be sold as a tourist hotel as it lacks the comfort associated with that I have stayed in a few hotels in London as a regular visitor and this hotel offers little in the way of comfort , the river view which you pay extra for however as you do all your sightseeing during the day you are not in a position to enjoy it 
74765,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Early in the morning we woke up by the noise right outside our room There were workers who held on to renovate the floor I think this is completely unacceptable and unprofessional of a 4 star hotel At least they could have closed the floor for the time of renovation The location of the hotel is not so great because of the railway you can hear trains that goes by And last thing was that I could not open my mini bar so I called concierge next day and it turned out that my deposit was not registered which was kind of a surprise to hear because I had paid it right after check in ,No Positive
74766,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Coffee was inconsistently brewed One day strong one day poured with grounds one day warm not hot Carpet in the room were not properly vacuumed and dusty furnitures when we first arrived Room service failed to get our order right Ended up delivering food one plate at a time and not covering it Second plate had a cover Shower temps hard to control , Breakfast was excellent more balanced choices of carbs and protein Staff were super helpful at the breakfast lounge are courteous and efficiently clearing used plates all smiles As we arrived from a tour with Trafalgar daisy s tour Ignacio from the front end was super helpful to check us in for Oct 4 6 stay making our 2 night stay even better Although we didn t get a river view when we asked this location is perfect 
74767,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Room Location requested a quiet room high location on check in the receptionist checked and said he would give me a quiet room away from noise When I got to my room it was on the 2nd floor dark no views apart from a wall and drilling started as soon as I entered my room Luckily I was only in my room a short time otherwise a fairly pleasant stay didn t see much else of the hotel as breakfast wasn t included in my rate , Elemis Products Friendly staff
74768,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Service at lunch very slow even though a lot of staff working and only 3 other small tables in Was awake from 6 30am with noise from trains , Room ready for early arrival 
74769,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, staff friendly and went extra mile with sending up a lovely bottle and some chocolates when they found out we were in London for my partners 40th birthday Also the view from our room made the stay special wonderful at night 
74770,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Good if you want to stay on a building site Work outside being constantly done from 7am in the morning Lifts on the 2nd floor were not installed and we re covered by plastic sheeting not very secure Noise from other rooms was a problem in bathroom you could hear other rooms toilets etc being flushed and drained, Good location for what we wanted to do 
74771,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Nothing , This hotel is a 4 star Carlson hotel with very convenient prices Rates are lower than other similar hotels of the same quality Location is very good right on the river London Eye Parliament and Big Ben are at a walking distance Waterloo station can be reached either walking or by bus 
74772,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Having stayed at your hotel for 1 night on Saturday 1st October Room 632 I wanted to express my concerns I asked for these comments to be passed over during my stay but wanted to confirm in writing as the lady in reception could only say sorry Having paid just under 150 for 1 night I was extremely disappointed in the quality and standard of the room provided On arrival I was required to pay 25 to cover anything used from the mini bar but then to my amazement the mini bar door would not open I was also very disappointed with the cleanliness of the bathroom especially the shower screen in the bathroom This made it extremely difficult to take a shower so had to stand in the bath As we were in a rush to get out as we had prior engagements there was no time to report this to get it sorted to reception and to be honest I didn t feel it was something I needed to do or my responsibility in such a high standard hotel which should have been at a high standard anyway on my arrival There was also a fault with the toilet On numerous occasions the cistern would not fill up so there was a constant hissing sound and unable to flush I also received a number of phone calls to the room early on Sunday morning which I did not request A broken night s sleep was not what I wanted I have stayed at your hotel on a number of occasions previously but have never encountered any of the above issues I am also very disappointed as this was a surprise treat for my daughter and felt this was not good value for money as is the most I have ever paid for a double room too ,No Positive
74773,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room could have been better appointed with some pictures on the wall and mats on the floor The carpet covering part of the floor was frayed and the carpet in the corridor outside the room was filthy , Excellent view of the Houses of Parliament from the upper floors if you pay the extra Helpful and friendly reception staff very good concierge team 
74774,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The man who checked us in was very rude and not friendly, Only the location would preferred another hotel this was not worth the money we paid and got told when booked it we get breakfast included and arrived to find out breakfast is 20 per person and the hotel room wasn t cleaned the best and when we arrived they hold another 75 on top of the money you paid until you leave to make sure you don t damage anything in room etc do not reccomend this hotel
74775,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Room too dark restaurant food too specific without good variety Cold and impersonal feel to hotel , Room was clean of a good quality with comfortable bed and excellent bathroom 
74776,Park Plaza London Riverbank, becareful with this hotel i have stayed there between 29th sep til 2 st october i was with my wife my 5 years old daughter was in Turkey so she had high fever then we need to return 1 day ago i have spoken with booking com they have spoken with hotel and they said it need to be 24 in advance then nothing to do my daugter is more important then money so at14 10 i went to loby on 1st of octeber to check out so they said you need to speek with booking com to cancel your stay i call them and they again call hotel and they said this time it is 14 15 so you are 15 minutes late so we charge you full still my daugter is much more important then this hotel payment another issue hotel price was 450 GBP and they authorise 520 GBP which is normal but when i check out they take my credit card and take 450 GBP it looks normal but still my 520 GBP authorisation is not released i talk with hotel and they said it is normal this means i pay 450 GBP and also they authorise 520 GBP i am stil waiting for cancelation , free internet
74777,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The cleanliness was a little disappointing to be honest I had a dirty towel in my room and the mirror in the bathroom had finger marks all over it and didn t look like it had been cleaned for a while , The bed was very comfortable The trip was for my birthday and I received a free bottle of Prosecco and truffles which was a nice touch 
74778,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Having travelled 4 hours to Hotel and arrived at 3 30 Found our room was not ready DISSAPOINTING Hotel Room staff need more supervision Dirty Tray cloth Left on tray from Thursday to Saturday also On our day of departure although checkout is 1200 Room cleaner knocking our door at 0825 and again at 0910 Not acceptable, The location was superb and the front of house staff were top class nothing to much trouble Friendly and well organised Parking although expensive was professional and well organised Would definitely recommend to other travellers
74779,Park Plaza London Riverbank, the AC in the first room was broken only had cold air and constantly on I have to call several times to change to another one had been told that they were fully booked at first Not really happy about this part rests are fine , the river view room is quite nice Fast WiFi in the room Hot shower is fantastic 
74780,Park Plaza London Riverbank, There was no kettle to make tea in the room We had a no window view just looked into another block of rooms Some of the staff didn t speak English well Seemed like there were new staff each day hard to connect with anyone personally , Location was very good for us as we enjoyed the walks along the river to the bridges and to the tube Very modern inside hotel new attractive functional bathroom Comfortable bed Most amenities All staff friendly concierge very helpful porters also Quiet room tenth floor was a long way from traffic and construction noises Buffet breakfasts had a good selection Hot breakfast very good 
74781,Park Plaza London Riverbank, It was not as quiet as I expected , I liked the furniture and the decorations Also the staff working at the hotel are so friendly Moreover the food is great
74782,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The rooms were not made up particularly well with dirty glasses and cups left and bed not made up that well was not dirty but definitely could have been better , The view from the room was fantastic Spacious good bathroom with seperate bath Gym was great too Very good value for money given location and view Staff helpful and v easy go get a taxi and about 2 k walk to all major attractions which was great
74783,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Waiters were too efficient They took my wife s food when she went to make some toast Plus they were fitting skirting boards outside the rooms which was noisy in the morning , Very pleasing stay overall 
74784,Park Plaza London Riverbank, breakfast was ordinary felt like I was at Sainsbury s caf Reception desk staff were a little arrogant and showed little knowledge when I queried an issue everything seemed to be a drama , great view from room
74785,Park Plaza London Riverbank, they could of gave me a free night i didnt wanna go home i was enjoying myself too much lol, as i was staying in this hotel on my own for the first time and any other hotel the staff were very helpful they couldnt do anymore really the food was pleasant i had a lovely meal in the restaurant the waitress was great very helpful with picking me sum great meals when i needed a cab because i didnt want the underground because of travelling alone the front desk got me a cab straight away the door was always opened up and my bags were carried for me i was blown away i was not used to that at all 
74786,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Was told on arrival that l had ben upgraded you might say what s wrong with that Room of one on there own was far to large felt quite lost It was cold and although l switched heating up this failed to warm up the rooms Room was also right next to rail line train passes window so extremely noisy at all times throughout evening and night Air lock in pipes so when someone located elsewhere used water in night there was a screech that frightened me to death Would have preferred option of upgrade rather than being told Original room booked based on website details would have more than suitable but didn t get to experience this Not an enjoyable experience , Staff were friendly and welcoming reception presents well 
74787,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Room was in need of some TLC units were showing signs of wear and tear It was the first time I have ever been asked to pay a security fee which although refunded promptly at the end of our stay left a rather unpleasant taste Not quite what I would expect from what claims to be a four star hotel , View from room was superb Fruit platter was a really nice touch and much appreciated Most staff were excellent 
74788,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Just a little thing and it s never happened before at this hotel so am assuming it s a one off didn t feel as though it had been properly turned over from the previous guest Whilst it was clean and the bed was made and it was re stocked it wasn t done brilliantly There was still a used towel hanging behind the door that hadn t been removed and the bathroom bin was missing it s plastic insert ie you couldn t use the bin as it was just the metal lid casing There was also some waste paper under the bed Nothing major but didn t quit fit what i m used to at this excellent hotel , Location facilities for business staff are super friendly and helpful nice Elemis products kettle and iron in the room 
74789,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Would have preferred a bigger shower very boxy but clean just a bit worn didn t use bath , The bed was comfortable the room was lovely very clean chair very comfortable would have been nice to have more of a front view of the Thames 
74790,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Was given a disabled room not necessary Window was locked shut Mirror in main room had large crack No corkscrew in room and staff at the desk could not help me Safe wasn t working but was fixed after almost a two hour wait, Great location and comfortable bed
74791,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Confusing lift system Confusing room numbering Pungent smell of varnish Particularly poor pillow Room unwelcoming and inward facing over a courtyard of paint materials and ladders Room remote access not easy to master in the dark Noisy wedding party guests nearby made it impossible to sleep before 0430hours Dirty trays of plates and cups abandoned in corridors unhygenic and a trip hazard , The breakfast was great although you were very cheeky asking for more money for some breakfast items after breakfast had been paid for in advance
74792,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Room was half carpet and wooden floor A bit cold on the feet when stepping onto the wood Bed very hard Cost of drink definitely London hotel prices Due to cost stopped drinking in hotel, Room great view Very clean
74793,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The soundproof room was very noisy besides hearing the people next door talking you could hear the trains passing by Dont take a room at the back, Staff was very friendly 
74794,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Dust on bedroom floor Fixed hairdryer wired into bathroom wall instead of proper hairdryer to use in bathroom is annoying and old fashioned Lighting in bedroom poor Too dark even when on full Not bright enough to do make up in Was ok for one night Pretty soulless No lounge bar to go and sit for a coffee mid afternoon Workman hammering in corridor outside afternoon early evening day we arrived and construction work outside started bang on 9am Not restful Ok for one night but wouldn t rush back ,No Positive
74795,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Bin in bathroom hadn t been emptied I asked for room to be cleaned and it still wasn t done by the time I returned around 4 pm, Warm welcome Attentive staff Great location 
74796,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The initial check in was a bit poor with us having to ask for another room But once we were settled in it was good , The room had the best view and it was reasonable for London 
74797,Park Plaza London Riverbank, delivery of services and the house keeping staff , a lovely spot with a terrific view of the Parliament buildings the desk and concierge were good the house keeping staff not so much to be more precise our requests for non feathered pillows and extra blankets were never met and it was even a battle to get 2 extra towels promises but not delivery stay again yes but with conditions 
74798,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Pillows were shockingly bad and there was no spare in the room also it s at least 25 min walk from water look station and not 10 15 mins like the website suggests, Room was nice staff were friendly
74799,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room could have been slightly cleaner and there weren t any extra pillows in the room Also the room has a system that controls lights temperature etc which seems really cool but the system with a blue light on either side of the bed kept flashing all night we had to put a magazine over it , The bar was fab great drinks and views 
74800,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Staff in the bar were a tad snobby, Locations was great for a nice walk along the Thames and viewing Big Ben etc Restrooms and room nicely outfitted and super clean 
74801,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Dirty glasses cleaner walked into room without knocking asked for a towel they never bought it to our room noise started at 8am as there s ongoing building works,No Positive
74802,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We asked several times for a room with a better view but the only view we got was the construction work going on on the building next door , The interns at the front desk were super friendly 
74803,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Location is good but is further from Westminster than it appears in pictures around 25 minute walk , The hotel room was spacious and bright with floor to ceiling windows Nice clean bathroom Didn t try the rest of the facilities Hotel staff very helpful 
74804,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Room was overlooking railway lines and didn t realise that the noise of trains would wake me up at 6a m would have asked for an alternative room had I known , Reception door staff were very helpful friendly Bed very comfortable
74805,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The staff was nice and professional Except room service refused to take tips by credit card only by cash So he wasn t nice No pool jacuzzi or sauna for a little relaxing time , The staff was very nice and gentle The room with an amazing view and very clean The food was good Room service was fast and good 
74806,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The bolt on the bathroom door is a strange design which meant we were locked out of our bathroom at 3 am which is a rather surreal experience Housekeeping came quickly to rectify the situation Room servive is very good The size of our riverview room was excellent The appointments in the room are mainly very good but the blinds could do with an up grade Housekeeping are aware of this need , The view from the room was superb We could see the houses of Parliament the two bridges over the Thames and the London eye It made our stay very enjoyable watching the sunset and the city waking up from our room This was so relaxing and enjoyable that we used room service for breakfast The location is very good 8 mins walk to the Victoria Line at Warterloo and the walk along Albert Embankment to various places is a pleasure Very good value Reception and consierge are very good 
74807,Park Plaza London Riverbank, There s nothing we really didn t like maybe the price of the food or the fact we weren t prewarned of a 50 deposit charge in case of damages , The spacious rooms the excellent facilities and its location next to some of Britain s greatest and iconic buildings 
74808,Park Plaza London Riverbank, location was a bit far away from attractions noise of construction but overall was good, the restaurant is outstanding staff very nice and helpful 
74809,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The water pipes sounded loud every time I was try to wash the hands etc Showers handles were malfunctioning Fitness room doesn t seem to have good conditioning if any at all , The location is good and centre of London is easily reachable The staff is really friendly and my first request to change the room was handled immediately and I have got a bigger room Wifi connection was easy and excellent 
74810,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Asian inspired theme was a little quirky but genuinely nice As we where tourists the hotel allowed us to store our bags in the morning before check in and we came back at two PM and they quickly brought them up to our room and stored them again after check out the next day before we left the city This was very convenient 
74811,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Olga trainee Waited more than 25 mins to check in No one told us what was going on Booking com said the price was 125 10 but then it went to 175 10 Incorrect room number was handed over First it said 123 Then it went to 326 Had us waiting for an additional 15 mins on top of the 25 mins that we had already waited No one apologised for the error made on their behalf No complimentary anything no remorse for their terrible customer service I asked to speak to the manager on duty she said there were none available and those who were available were merely trainees like herself All round terrible experience Do not go to this location ,No Positive
74812,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I didn t like the building work happening around the hotel I feel this should have been disclosed at time of booking , The staff at riverbank park plaza are excellent If there is a problem at a hotel I find it better to judge by how that problem was delt with opposed to the actual problem that occurred as sometimes things do not go to plan I found the staff excellent when I bought the problem to their attention I also especially liked the shop located a minutes walk away
74813,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Views of the local area were great Service and hotel standards exceeded what I was expecting The room was spacious quiet and had everything i needed Definitely on my list of hotels to return to 
74814,Park Plaza London Riverbank, There is only one restaurant which serves a very limited selection variety Room service was slow they couldn t seem to find my room A little dated, The room was very big and comfortable You get a choice of pillows Small but well equiped gym for a hotel The room service menu was better than the restaurant and food was delicious Staff ver helpful Close to westminster
74815,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Food was to expensive and not enough sugar and coffee in room plus hair dyer was rubbish and a 50 pound deposit which was not mentioned when booked, The river view of the hotel but costly
74816,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Currently surrounded by construction Noise of the trains from room , Great shower and bathroom comfy bed Good breakfast and friendly staff Good location for Imperial War Museum and river 
74817,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Room 1104 is very noisy The window doesn t close very well so you hear all the trains and the check in and check out is very slow Please speed it up , Everything Room was perfect 
74818,Park Plaza London Riverbank, My room was near the train rail so there was a lot of noise while trying to sleep or at the mornings , I liked the decoration of the floor and the room 
74819,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Nothing, Hotel was quite view in my room was towards River Thames and Big Ben Bed was king sized and comfy Underground was not far 6 minutes walk as if exercise walking Walking along the River Thames was absolutely delighted away from smoke and pollution Will come back again
74820,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The front desk staff was absolutely unfriendly i have never experienced such a bad and rude service they really do not value their customers if a problem arises you are the only one sorry about that and can count on your self to resolve it I had to walk up and down 3 times because my room key was not working they were for some weird reasons upset and looked at you as if you were really getting on their nerves for being their customers I would never go back there and experience such a poor guest service, the location of the hotel and the great view towards westminster the room was also very comfortable and quite modern best shower i have seen
74821,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, The room was very spacious and the view of Westminster is brilliant Especially with the huge floor to ceiling window The staff are very professional The hotel is very lovely and well maintained throughout 
74822,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The ran out of Apple pie lol , The highest level of service given by every member of staff From the moment of arriving by cab my bags were delivered to my room and we even received a phone call from reception to see if everything was in order for us 
74823,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Looking across to other rooms Unable to look out and gauge the weather or have a pleasant outlook , Staff friendliness and helpfulness All very well trained and efficient in customer care
74824,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The Air Conditioning wasn t of good standard Made the overall experience uncomfortable Especially when it is Summer and it s very warm , The Reception and Concierge staff were very friendly and welcoming The easiness of an electronic device providing options for when wishing to turn on and off the lights control the air conditioning temperature curtains open closed 
74825,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The bottom sheet was not long enough for the bed We had to move the sheet down to the bottom of the bed so we did not touch the mattress protector and it was short at the top The mechanism to flush the loo came off a few times and the electronic device to control lights would not let us decide which we wanted on , The bed was comfy We were upgraded to an executive room which was spacious Room service food was good and staff nice and friendly 
74826,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Cleanliness could definitely be improved Carpets stained and hairs found in shower Organisation was poor and passed from pillar to post as to where our table was booked for evening meal and breakfast , Location and view from room
74827,Park Plaza London Riverbank, This may be personal to me but I found the lighting in the room headache inducing The rooms have a sickly orange light which can t be switched off as it is integrated with the rest of the room lights I had to request maintenance to remove the light fitting I also found the mattress too soft Otherwise the location and staff were good ,No Positive
74828,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Beds are not great We requested a room change because the bed was bad To their credit the hotel assisted us without hesitation The second room bed was an improvement ,No Positive
74829,Park Plaza London Riverbank, That s a very difficult question honestly nothing , We stayed in this hotel 4 times in the past 4 months we found it very comfortable We love the location and rooms All members of the staff were so kind and helpful always making us feel very welcome We enjoyed some delicious dishes and the view from the NEW Chino Latino Bar
74830,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Not informed that the front of the hotel was undergoing building work Found nail clippings under the bed when looking for the remote control Curtain remote not working Bit of a walk to either tube station, Overall lovely hotel with great location 
74831,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Bed was too hard and uncomfortable I could not have slept more than two nights on it we were woken at 8 10 in the morning by a chamber maid and a porter for the tray the night before which was unfortunate as we were not in a hurry to get up, Enjoyed our experience very much great location and loved the barge opposite for drinks we had a very good cheese board to the room late at night staff on reception were excellent
74832,Park Plaza London Riverbank, In my opinion I was totally satisfied, Have stayed before excellent staff accommodation and value for money Very convenient location for meetings in London
74833,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Confusion over double charging on my credit card which was not resolved until I queried it the third time The poor staff response to a late night fire alarm and the poor signposting for fire stairs Miscommunication over the timings for breakfast The mould on the top of the shower screen I could see that the space is hard to clean as it is only mls from the roof but it was very obvious and something could be done to minimise it The noise of the AC and the water gurgling in the pipes near the bath all night In all it seems like the staff were trying hard but just didn t quite get the details right , Staff were generally helpful and friendly The location was great and the facilities were pretty good Food and drink in the bar were very good 
74834,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I booked my room through Booking com and was 100 certain breakfast was included but was told on arrival that it wasn t The view was also disappointing looking onto other hotel rooms , Really comfy bed Concierge at front door was excellent Really helpful chap 
74835,Park Plaza London Riverbank, My room was very dusty in the bathroom and sink had product in it The bed linen smelled of urine even though supposedly clean was too exhausted to complain and slept on top of the bed When next door flushed their toilet the odour completely crept in to the bathroom disgusting , Location
74836,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Not the most comfortable mattresses for me but not bad , Beautiful place great staff great location close to London Eye We walked everywhere Victoria theater or took trains out of Vauxhaul station to Gatwick airport and Salisbury station to Stonehenge 
74837,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Noisy till 3am no nespresso machine or slippers or newspaper depite these items being advertised as I m an executive room People trying to get into our room having been given the wrong room number Bed hard snd uncomfortable bathroom no clean Need i go on , View
74838,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room looked as if it needed freshened up as it appeared slightly rundown But work on the hotel and corridors did appear to be taking place , The view and access to attractions where excellent The restaurant was amazing as was able to cater to diet requirements with a variety of dishes Bar was lovely also offering fantastic views 
74839,Park Plaza London Riverbank, They could have told in advance that the restaurant is mostly Japanese I liked it very much and the staff there was very nice but others might like Japanese less , Staff good Japanese restaurant bathroom with bathtub AND shower 
74840,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The only thing I did not like was a very unpleasant smell in the bathroom which I think was due to the drains once I put on the air conditioning the smells disappeared , The friendly and helpful staff cleanliness of rooms location superb lovely hotel
74841,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Room hadn t been cleaned well found glass on the floor Staff were lovely moved my sister and I to a new room but disappointed in the fact that the glass was there, Comfortable bef

74843,Park Plaza London Riverbank, noise on the sunday morning woke me up at 8am not ideal after a few too many not sure if room was above kitchens or if it was building work, staff were excellent decent location nice walk along river to london bridge
74844,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Shower could have bern slightly cleaner but not detrimental, Warm welcome recieved and as it was a special occassion the complimentary drinks were gratefully recieved also
74845,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Charging 3 50 for a can of coke from the mini bar is a joke I can understand having to make a profit on things however charging 6 x the price of buying it from a shop is a disgrace , The hotel is in a great location on the banks of the river Staff are friendly and polite Rooms are clean and a good size with large bed and complete with aircon 
74846,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Being placed in a noisy room in the first place , The staff were very helpful and accommodated our request to move to a quieter room on a higher level as there was construction work that was very noisy and impacted rooms on the first floor 
74847,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The fact that their staff lost our stored luggage as the room wasn t ready even though I d requested early check in The cups in the room had lipstick marks on them so clearly hadn t been washed properly Mini bar would not open so staff had to rectify Check out staff member hardly smiled and didn t even ask if we d enjoyed our stay and we didn t Will definitely not be returning ,No Positive
74848,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The fact that we only stayed one night would have liked to have stayed longer, Service was just fantastic didn t ask for an upgrade but was given one thanks 
74849,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Staff not helpful especially at reception Didn t speak good English mostly Room wasn t ready Arrived 11 30pm off a flight and had booked twin bed room All wrong when got there Had double Had to wait til morning for change Kettle didn t work Tried to charge for mini bar and room service that I didn t even have Said they would upgrade me to better room however wasn t any different Rooms no view Looked into wall Over charged and no breakfast or foods included No help for directions to places in London when I asked Staff didn t seem to know ie nearest tube stations etc Quite far from main attractions When it said that it was pretty near Half hour walk to London eye etc , Gym being available at any hour of the day 
74850,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Upgraded to a river view which wasn t worth the extra 45 a night one of the doors was coming off on a cupboard The food though is excellent but beware I bought two Rum and Cokes and wh n the bill came I nearly fell off my chair 10 each it s 2 50 in my local
74851,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Room was a little bit tired carpet had a tear in it so it looked poor , Breakfast was great Being upgraded to a suite on arrival Staff very helpful great being able to leave our luggage for sightseeing after we checked out
74852,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Never figured out how to open mini bar and forgot to ask Breakfast offer was too expensive for us Reception staff not anxious to help with problems I asked for change and was referred to the restaurant who said the couldn t give it to me either Place next door is too close for comfort , Concierges Tony and Janosh were very helpful and friendly Room was spacious with a partial river view Loved the view Good suggestions from Tony and big help with a travel problem from Janosh Great location Liked getting a fruit bowl as a welcome Liked the panels that had buttons to control lights and more 
74853,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Location was 2 miles from embankment so couldn t walk and Victoria line about a mile but not the best line to be near when you want to go out in city , Room was lovely staff were really helpful and gave us a treat as we were celebrating
74854,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The house keeping standard was a slightly lower standard than expected but they were only minor issues , Resturant is amazing Concierge also very happy to help with special requests 
74855,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Our bed was not made or ready when we arrived which was fine but the manager was quite rude and defensive She tried blaming us explaining that twin rooms were in demand We had booked this room months in advance so didn t appreciate her rudeness or excuse It took three room attempts before we were settled It was midnight so we were tired and would have just liked an apology rather than an excuse , The rooms were lovely and loved the 24hour room service 
74856,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Building next door builders could see straight into my room so had to keep curtains closed Breakfast very pricey A fair way from the tube, Pleasant staff and decent service Good central location
74857,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room looked at another hotel the pictures used by the hotel have a Thames view The heating did not work on the first night The electric operated curtains didn t work, The staff were lovely and very helpful

74859,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Only issue was the construction that was going on Awakened each morning by the sound of jackhammers , The bathroom was modern and had a separate shower stall in addition to a tub 
74860,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Some staff could have better attitudes , The location is nice 7 minutes walk to metro station the area is even nicer walking distance to main attractions cruise hop on hop off buses etc The rooms r big and clean also equipped with really good facilities The stay was a pleasant The price value was really good 
74861,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Only supplied one keycard and there were two of us The keycard worked the lights and air con etc My husband went to the gym leaving me in the bath and took the card to get back in It went pitch black after he d been gone 10 seconds Also had made requests by email for feather pillows and a fan and my husband told the hotel that it was a trip for my 50th Got a lovely email back saying that housekeeping had been informed of my requests and there would also be a nice birthday surprise in the room for me Got there and nothing Rang down from the room to request the fan and pillows twice and they didn t answer the phone either time so we left it The birthday surprise was that there wasn t one , Breakfast fabulous large buffet with everything available 
74862,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I asked to book in for 2 and we had to check in for 3 which I don t know, I loved the staff bar and food Also the room and view was amazing I would recommend it to anyone It was also my birthday and there was prosecco in my room which was lovely
74863,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Would of been ideal if the hotel had visitor car parking with the hotel property Especially with children we had to park a fair distance away from the hotel simply because car parking costs , The location was brilliant with attractions close by Staff were very helpful and polite with our needs 
74864,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Noisy building site next door Housekeeping came into room at 8 25 and woke us up Paid 50 room deposit not yet paid back into my account after 4 days, Clean
74865,Park Plaza London Riverbank, when i got there the telly was broken and it took 30 mins to get another one I was out the whole of Saturday came back and my room had not been cleaned and I left the sign on the door to clean room also when I woke up there was a bug in the room due to the fact it wasn t cleaned the night before, the bed was fine

74867,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The desk assigned us a dirty room After they assigned a new room with tobacco smell The third room seems as if everyone has used it The definitive room has blood stains in the duvet The maids do not change the bed linen every day and you need to demand it Incredible for a 4 star hotel in one of the principal european cities , The location near the Thames river and the city center 
74868,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Torn carpet in junior suite Noise from railway line Drinks in bar were not added to Bill Waitress rang at 22 00 hrs wanting payment asking us to go to the bar when we were tired and ready for bed Eventually she came up to the room to collect payment as we had exceeded our credit limit Finally we found a shower cap wrapped twice round th smoke alarm , Staff very friendly and helpful Second room we stayed in very comfortable apart from loose toilet seat

74870,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room did not have the wow factor it was a little dull and could of done with a little something to brighten it up or make it a little more happy I had also asked if there was anything they could possibly do for me as it was my boyfriends 21st whether it was a room Upgrade decent view or as simple as a little treat in the room but I had got nothing and as a younger person confronting someone about this or asking for this was out of my comfort zone and considering I had already asked and got nothing I felt awkward to go and ask again for something to be done Checking in took a while as there was a trainee on which is understandable but the woman training her was a bit unprofessional about it and things took longer than they should have It s not a bad hotel but I wouldn t go back , The bed was comfy The lobby was beautifully decorated

74876,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Our deluxe room on the 11th floor was nice with a great view but it had a locked connecting door This proved to be a problem at 1 30am due to very noisy people in the room next door we re all for people having a laugh but honestly they were so so noisy shouting etc we dont think the connecting door helping to lessen the noise We ended up having to ring reception who did send someone up to listen soon after that the noise did stop but after a long day and needing a good nights sleep the next morning left us feeling far from refreshed , Location staff were very helpful concierge was great very chatty and funny

74891,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I would ve liked a river view however we were told there were no twin rooms with river views Our view was of other windows and a scruffy looking roof below It didn t affect our trip however and we saw plenty of the river on our rather noisy walk to tube lots of building work in the area , Spacious and very quiet room with very comfy beds and a sizeable bathroom too Helpful and friendly staff

74909,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Would have preferred a notification of the building work before arrival and didn t enjoy the electrics cutting out in the room twice meaning having to have the maintenance guy out on both occasions , It s a nice hotel which is clean and the staff are good always willing to assist 
74910,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Our fridge broke and was not fixed Our key was taken from our room by the house cleaning staff and we had to fight to get a new one to be honest the cleaning staff barely attended to our room each day When I tried to order room service I was rudely spoken to by the employee about how busy they were and what an inconvenience it was as if it was my fault Overall we felt the customer service was not what would we would expect for this type of hotel , The concierge was always very helpful 
74911,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The only negative was that there was no mirror near to the location of plugs so I couldn t see what I was doing when drying my hair with the hairdryer, Staff very helpful and pleasant and room lovely

74915,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We were not made aware of the building work when booking and as this was a special anniversary post cancer treatment weekend we may have looked elsewhere if we had known The scaffolding and cranes etc made it difficult to find our hotel and at times it was noisy The view from our room was not very nice The remote lighting was tricky at times to manage in the dark , We liked the location by the river with the views of Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament Generous tea and coffee facilities with nice Elemis products in the bathroom too The bathroom felt luxurious with separate shower All the staff were very polite and a credit to you

74920,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Our first room had scaffolding all over the windows We complained and were upgraded to a suite which was big but still with awful views over a noisy train line The bathroom had limescale all over it and the furniture was all chipped and broken We had a balcony a tiny pointless outdoor area only big enough for one person standing that was covered in pigeon poo Didn t really add much to the view Everything was just generally a bit tatty worn and tired Very disappointing for a birthday stay especially for over 100 and with no breakfast even included , The bed was comfy and the suite they upgraded us to was big The lobby looked fancy 
74921,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Carpets needed replacing and they were in the process of that when we left Robes were in need of replacement , Location is great Within walking distance of many London attractions View of Big Ben and Westminster from room 
74922,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, The free room upgrade was great I have always considered all accommodation as simply being somewhere to lay your head But the river view was amazing watching the world come to life at 5am was absolutely beautiful and so appreciated I ve definitely been converted now All front of house staff were polite attentive and approachable Location wise the hotel is about a 10 15 minute walk from Waterloo Station just the other side of the Lambeth bridge so Central London is easily within walking distance 
74923,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Coffee in Chino Latino expensive and service not great Renovations are going on and so some areas were closed off but it didn t really cause any issues , Chocolates and card in room for my birthday very nice staff made to feel special Great location on river and great price for Pride weekend

74926,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The service and booking in time your website said no deposit I was charged 25 person deposit x 2 that was 50 and should of been stated I ve atYed in hotel Before I was never charge also they moved me from room 313 to room 915 it was next to construction site, I was happy that my room the next day got changed due to the 1st room was uncomfortable and the bathroom was a slip hazard they gave me a disabled room I m not disabled and if I had known that I was gonna get this service I would of book with travel lodge I waisted my weekend unrelaxed I got disturb 3 time s and I had do not disturb sign on door I m not happy with my stay

74931,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Nothing Didn t try the breakfast as it looked expensive for what you get but there s so many breakfast options in London that you don t need to eat at the hotel , Excellent very comfortable spacious and well supplied room Very good soundproofing made the room very quiet

74934,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room looked as though it lacked a little attention to detail Dust on the counter and mild stain in the shower There was also work being done on the opposite room which was a little disturbing The staff were polite but lacked that little bit of personalised service , The beds were pretty comfy and the bathrooms were modern The lobby area also seemed pretty social and relaxed 
74935,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Fantastic view over the river to Westminster bed was really comfy and had a great night s sleep it was a delight to find that the shower was separate from the bath Few minutes walk from Vauxhall station so location perfect 
74936,Park Plaza London Riverbank, See above Shabby , The rooms were very tired with chips out of most of the black furniture making it look very shabby compared to the park plaza Westminster bridge and park plaza county hall which we have stayed in many times Building site No outside space Poor availability of taxis outside hotel No drinking water in room Good breakfast though

74943,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Hotel under significant building works so my Riverside View which I selected the hotel for actually looked out over a scaffolding and construction site together with a crane operating on the top floor I had booked the hotel as we were returning late after a concert and had booked the day off work and the 12pm check out also appealed to me Sadly the crane and drilling in the corridors that reverberated throughout the hotel meant that we were not able to sleep past 9am There was no onsite or nearby parking it felt like the only parking option was the concierge at 45 per night Nearest parking we could find was over the river 1500 metres away A real shame as I had paid a significant sum for our 5th Anniversary and wanted to stay somewhere more upmarket than the normal Hilton we booked But sadly disappointed ,No Positive
74944,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The hotel is a fair distance from the tube stations Vauxhall was nearest and a short bus journey to the station from right outside the hotel was a welcome find The toilet bowl was dirty and the shaving mirror was defective a bit more attention to detail would be good , Lovely hotel great room very helpful staff Even though we overlooked the railway lines and there was extensive building work going on we were never bothered by noise Breakfast was fairly priced for London and plentiful 
74945,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Far too long to check in Grubby shared areas dusty bedroom grey net curtains and despite the request no non allergenic pillows Took 45mins to find one pillow I was given a foam rectangle that was impossible to sleep on please see photo I slept on a towel appalling service , Nothing
74946,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Just simple thing in rooms could have been better such as no soap left in bathroom and even though the suite was for 2 people there was only 1 bathrobe, The staff were very friendly and helpful
74947,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The staff were not trained well Our food was dropped on the floor once when sent out for heating the second time it got dumped into the bin as the staff member did not know English There were two conditioners kept along with two shampoos some days instead of a shampoo conditioner a body lotion and a shower gel One day the sugar was not kept in the cupboard We need to ask for water each time to make coffee and it is not complementary on a daily basis If you would like to heat your own food you will have to pay 5 pounds per service The mini bar within the room is also not complementary However the view was amazing from the executive suite , The view
74948,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Staff should not knock on door at 830 on a Saturday morning to clean the room And then again at 8 45 Not very attentive , Great bathroom wonderful staff at check in

74961,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The check in was very impersonal we were given no direction as to where things were in the hotel no breakfast times or check out times Although free the WiFi was inconsistent and the beds had no mattress toppers meaning they weren t very comfortable We were 2 women in 2 rooms they allocated one on the 1st floor and the other on the 11th floor , Hotel is in a good location right on Embankment opposite the Houses of Parliament and less than a 10 minute walk from Underground stations

74965,Park Plaza London Riverbank, No where on website did they explain there would be large building works going on outside which spoilt view and terrace area check in just before 2pm not all rooms ready bathroom smelt funny and overall room not cleaned to 4star standard still dusty and in need of modernisation marks and cracks on walls side cupboards, There were some 4 star facilities like mini bar
74966,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I did not like the over zealous obsequious nature of the door concierge entrance staff I am aware they want tips but I do not need to be treated as an invalid or an ignoramus Equally if you want me to pay for drinks then get me to pay when you serve them considering you have my card details and my room number I do not expect to be followed to the lifts for a signature, An lovely location well maintained and with excellent rooms
74967,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room seemed to be a bit old Bathroom was good but the beds were not comfortable at all And it is dark in the room as well , Breakfast was very good Location is fine too The staff is helpful 
74968,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Construction works surrounding hotel Commenced working at 8 am Terrible Couldn t see where you were in London as surrounded by billboards and scaffolding,No Positive
74969,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Expensive charge for bottled water in room and the bottle in the room was opened and half drunk Room size was small, Convenient location and pleasant staff and service
74970,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Only the coffee in the room it s a shame when such smart hotels cannot provide proper coffee as you would get in American hotels , Welcoming comfortable hotel with lots of amenities that you would expect in a good location 
74971,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Take more pride in the hotel by having nice clean rooms , The staff were very good We got upgraded after someone had spilt beer all over the floor and not cleaned up Only thing that was bad that the rooms were not very clean
74972,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Thought breakfast very overpriced 40 for continental , Friendly helpful staff on Reception and staff member in another dept when I had trouble with my iPad n
74973,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The carpet in my room could have been cleaner , Good value for the location which is convenient to Westminster and the West End Good sized well equipped rooms and excellent bathroom 
74974,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Bed was a bit hard for my taste but I like super soft mattresses They did put a topper on the bed to ease my discomfort , Comfy bath tub Nice breakfast buffet Awesome view Very close to some of the best attractions The staff are A 
74975,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I was not aware of the on going construction work at the hotel before we arrived These construction works made it hard to find the hotel I would of expected a discount in price for this also the smell of paint on level 3 was off putting and got on my chest The maids woke us up at half 8 in the morning and this was not appreciated We didn t get told where to go for breakfast and the first day we ended up in an upgraded breakfast at a price The view outside our window was of train tracks Not brilliant , The staff were friendly and very knowlegdable Nice decor and good cocktail choice at the bar however could included more choices Clean rooms 
74976,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I was disappointed by the bad odors coming from the pipes I changed room but the odor was still there and by the works at 8am on a Sunday , I ve been there several times I find the hotel rather good Also I appreciated the apologies for the inconvenience and the late check out offered 
74977,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Wasn t informed of works being undertaken at hotel prior to trip Reception staff were rude View out of large window was rubbish Booked twin room and beds were next to each other like a double , Comfortable bed Good breakfast choices Nice hotel 
74978,Park Plaza London Riverbank, There was a problem with the air conditioning in our room so it was a bit too hot at night We were offered a change of room but had settled in and didn t bother just opened a window instead , The staff were all very helpful and there were plenty of staff around all the time The room was clean and had everything we needed When I made a request it was dealt with promptly and then a follow up call from customer services checked that I was happy The housekeeping staff worked quietly and did not make any noise in the corridors when cleaning other rooms so we were able to sleep as long as we liked The check out time of 12 was good Our room on ninth floor was quiet Good hotel for a mature group Bar was very nice and again staff very attentive and pleasant 
74979,Park Plaza London Riverbank, No choice of pillows surround sound or soundproofing all were advertised We were in what could be used as an adjoining room and the noise from the room next door was ridiculous just from them chatting and kept us awake until gone 1 am We mentioned this upon checkout and were told to mention it when checking in next time I was so tired when I got home it would have been more relaxing to spend the weekend with my hectic six year old rather than have this break Ordered breakfast to the room and pancakes were burnt And the building itself is still a construction site which isn t mentioned anywhere when booking so sitting outside in the sunshine as pictured is not possible , Executive double room with river view really was an amazing view 
74980,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Menu on offer in resteraunt didn t give a great choice Disappointed breakfast wasn t included , The bar food was excellent and very helpful staff Room very comfortable and quiet Excellent toiletries 
74981,Park Plaza London Riverbank, nothing , the staff were amazing so friendly and helpful the room was great we got upgraded we had the most lovely time I had chocs and wine for my birthday in the room too perfect going back on 01 07 16 with husband 
74982,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Just that noise and view of course , Room fine railway noise dreadful Husband in st Thomas s hospital I needed rest at night but couldn t sleep because of trains 
74983,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Rooms are uncomfortable and during my stay there was smell in the bathroom poor cleaning services to be improved There was nuisance during my stay it looks construction , location not so bad
74984,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We were upgraded to a room that had a construction site right below us and the were making quite a noise in the early in the morning, Good sized room with comfortable bed and decent facilities 
74985,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The first room I was given it was on the first floor tar polin right outside the window the room was also very dark , The view from my room and the service
74986,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Strange policy for payments If you guarantee your booking by credit card they demand this card to be displayed at check in even if you are going to pay by cash After I ve paid by cash a full price of booking at check in the receptionist charged me additional 150 pounds cash deposit for minibar I didn t count on such kind of expenditure so it was very inconvenient for me to have deposited this unplanned amount ,No Positive
74987,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Place is still under construction which means a gauntlet of contractors and barriers on your way in Some drilling and construction happened outside of the room during the day , Bathroom was excellent especially full sized bath in addition to shower View is fantastic 
74988,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Ugly View of roof with air conditioning units Bathroom cleanliness but have already fed this back to customers relations manager who was the right character for that role excellent service Bar prices too high shouldn t be the same as roof service , Comfortable bed slept 11 hours Excellent breakfast although cost was much too high for a breakfast 
74989,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Beautiful hotel very clean and the staff couldn t do enough for you Lovely breakfasts fab location right next to the Thames and 5 mins to tube Thank you for making our weekend so special 
74990,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The building work going on in our corridor both in the early evening of Saturday and from 0745 hours on the Sunday morning was disappointing and disturbing This hotel is located in a quite location so when the building work is complete a more relaxing atmosphere will be experienced, Central location of the hotel and the friendliness of staff
74991,Park Plaza London Riverbank, check out was a disaster they refunded the deposit to the wrong account and till this day they are trying to charge my credit card for the amount I paid I tried emailing them several times no response very unprofessional ,No Positive
74992,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I had been emailing the hotel prior to my arrival as it was my partners 30th bday and wanted to upgrade our room The staff member i was emailing had said they would arrange baloons and flower petals to decorate the room at no extra cost of i would like I said yes that would be lovely however when we arrived into the room this wasnt done Very disappointing as this was a special occasion There was however a bottle of champagne in the room which was nice of the hotel Aside from this we really enjoyed our stay and the hotel was beautiful and i would reccomend it , The toiletries were lovely and the bath robes and slippers made us feel very relaxed and destressed 
74993,Park Plaza London Riverbank, N a, Overnight as had early start the next day Very quick service at reception and very quiet rooms which for me is an essential component for a good nights sleep 
74994,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The decor was quite dark which I found less pleasant The free WiFi was glacial and certainly slower than my phone s Internet connection so I didn t use it , Everything was perfectly functional and well priced It was the best value offer near Waterloo albeit a 20min walk for the date available 
74995,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Further away from tube stations than I expected which was my own fault but not ideal with bags and in pouring rain , Executive river view room was very spacious with very good facilities and was worth the upgrade
74996,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Nothing negative to say about this hotel everything was excellent , The staff was wonderful The rooms were very well kept and clean the overall decor of the hotel was very nice 
74997,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Room service was a bit restricted but then again perhaps one doesn t need a gin tonic after midnight , Nice room size nice bathroom Big buffet breakfast Great WiFi I especially liked the lobby area it has a really relaxing atmosphere with plenty of couches and comfortable seating After check out I had a bit of time to kill and it was raining so I spent some time on the internet planning my next day s adventure 
74998,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The Hotel is having building work done We tried to check in at 13 00hrs the room wasn t ready that was ok but when returned to the Hotel hours later the room still wasn t ready and we had to wait 40 minutes , Location
74999,Park Plaza London Riverbank, View from window could of been nicer Overlooked 10 tracks of railway line Other side of hotel overlooked the Thames There are currently building works going on outside the hotel with large hoardings in front of the building so it s not that easy to see from the street whilst the works go on There was no noise from building works , Friendly staff throughout hotel Given upgrade on arrival to junior suite Lovely walking along the south bank in the sunshine Definitely would stay here again 
75000,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The bar staff were so rude when we opted out to pay the optional service charge giving us dirty looks and asking why we didn t want to pay it , Reception staff were lovely and food was great
75001,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Stain on dressing gown Out of date milk in the room Building work outside hotel no mention of this when booked, Good location and able to upgrade to view of Thames
75002,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Messed about at check in three times and couldn t access my room until 3 30 even though check I m was at 2 I was told my room wasn t ready as someone was still in it Also they apparently upgraded me but didn t tell me and the room they d upgraded me to wasn t ready In the end they gave me my original room none of this made sense The building work let s the place down its a mess and quite noisy The staff don t seem to know what they re doing I was told there was nothing to do near the hotel and the place isn t friendly , Lovely view
75003,Park Plaza London Riverbank, There were many visible damages to the room on arrival which shows lack of care consideration Also 3 50 for one bottle of water is pretty ridiculous considering the price of the room The fact that the room was poorly cared for ripped up carpet burns to carpet damage to closet door , Location heating
75004,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The cost of the buffet breakfast was excessive considering the meager choices offered The location is optimal but sad to say there was a view into an office building , The staff made our stay very pleasant They were helpful and considerate of our questions and concerns 
75005,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The fact that you could not order an appetizer and a drink in the bar for happy hour Too darn many rules I dont like automatic tipping Americans tip , Concierge was awesome Room wAs nice after an upgrade fee was paid 
75006,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The preauthorised amount taken from my debit card wasn t made clear at check in but when I asked they explained perfectly , The staff were super friendly the food from both room service and restaurant point of view was speedy and delicious Great location of you don t mind walking Covent Harden is 1 2 hour away good smoking area terrible I know but it s important for some people Overall a fantastic mini break away 
75007,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Nothing my only negative would be the stain on the carpet of the room Everything else was excellent , Location room upgrade friendly and helpful staff
75008,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Breakfast too expensive but ideal Corner Caf a short walk away Lots of the rooms have no view other than other rooms , Ideal position for trains to Twickenham lovely clean hotel comfy beds very nice Bar area
75009,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room the view the sofa had a massive hole in it in plane view room was smaller than living room , The bathroom and the people I spoke to prior to me arriving 
75010,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We were made fun of Half our day was wasted when checking in Previous to a telephone conversation we were invited to check in in one hour We arrived after 2 hours and were told there is construction work in the hotel and surrounding it with noise problems We were told that rooms with view towards the inside of the hotel were only available in a 4 star hotel we were told to wait until 2 it was 12ish so we went for a walk and when we came back at 2 the room was not ready at 2 20 the room was still not ready but we were offered a voucher for a drink which excluded cocktails and alcohol basically soo cheap dont give it if you dont want to offer it we threw the vouchers away After checking in the room smelled like fresh paint as the hotel was under construction and gasses were coming in from ventilation dont go there there are other options and the pictures are a misrepresentation of the hotel at its current state , Nothing
75011,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, The hotel location was convenient located within walking distance to the London Eye and Big Ben There was always a black cab waiting outside the hotel for when we wanted to travel a bit further There are some small cafes and a grocery store with ATM right next store Overall the staff was very friendly One memeber of management was a bit rude but this was quickly forgotten as everyone else from the Receptionist to the Cocktail Server went above and beyond to assist us The carpets look like they could use a god cleaning but everything else was very nice and very clean It was a fair price for location and offerrings I would stay again 
75012,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Booking a TWIN ROOM I expect separate beds not just a double bed with two single duvets this is not adequate Rooms are very small , Bathroom was decent
75013,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Was not informed about the deposit taken from my account or how much it would total to Also wrongly charged for minibar drinks that we didn t have Too many calls to the room for silly things TV remote decided to stop working on second day as well Runners buffet was pretty poor everything overcooked and bolognaise which was tasteless a shame , Great location lovely relaxing bar staff friendly
75014,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We booked a superior double room Was very disappointed that we didn t have a sofa bed even travelodge have these To me it was like a basic double, Location was excellent for our needs Warm welcome and concierge was very helpful when we needed to leave luggage for the morning The chip sandwiches are excellent from their 24 hour room service 
75015,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room 811 was very noisy with the nearby train line so didn t sleep well Left my iPhone charger in the room Housekeeping has it but after 3 phone calls still not heard how it will be returned to me , Location
75016,Park Plaza London Riverbank, They are working on improving the hotel so there is a lot of work going on outside the hotel but I am sure it will be excellent when finished When serving snacks in the bar there will always be a risk of mess on the floor The bar team need to be quicker to clean up , The staff were excellent and very professional The location was perfect and the rooms were of a good size 
75017,Park Plaza London Riverbank, no bed side charging building work in the morning was disruptive to a lie in on a day off work There was no warning or apology for this either , Great room with views of Westminster
75018,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room was a little hot even with aircon on and was a little dusty , The was lovely and comfortable and the view out of the window was amazing couldnt of had a better view 
75019,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Didn t eat or drink at hotel so just checked in and out but can t think of anything that we could complain about , Location was very good Staff helpful Good nights sleep 
75020,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I requested a wake up call at 8 20 I was called at 7 and could not sleep again I wanted to add the breakfast only for the first night when I checked in which was 13 GBP as far as I remember to try and decide for the next days The next day I wanted to have breakfast again at the hotel and they told me that it would be something like 21 GBP because only during check in it is from that cheaper price I had not been informed about this when I requested to have breakfast for the first morning The view from the room was other rooms It was a bit of walk to the next tube station , In general it was a clean and comfortable hotel I would definitely recommend it 
75021,Park Plaza London Riverbank, There was heavy drilling when we arrived we had to move to another room following a long journey to get to the hotel The bed was VERY hard we only found the pillow option leaflet the day of our departure The shower tray did not contain the water flooded the entire bathroom The fridge space for guests was far too small we had to keep moving the minibar items out The carpet was filthy although we were told the room was not generally offered to guests We had to wait past the 2 pm arrival time for our room to be ready Building works next door meant noise and goings on all day A reduction in tariff would have been welcome as we were not told of this prior to our arrival and paid a supplement for a river view room , The location the staff 
75022,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Housekeeping walked into my room at 9am when i was asleep in bed with my partner There was also a crane operating literally out side the window of my room along with a construction site Very upsetting considering the price of yhe room ,No Positive
75023,Park Plaza London Riverbank, When we arrived at 5pm our rooms were not ready We were told that the adjoining rooms we booked had JUST been finished they had painted them that day and expected us to sleep in them Disgusting We were eventually given other rooms not adjoining as requested The furniture in the rooms was scratched and marked after spillage of a drop of water we cleaned it up and the tissue was really dusty and dirty Bathroom was clean We asked if we could have a complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience and after a long discussion with the manager we did get this Although we had gone to hotel to celebrate a friend s 60th birthday we were hoping to get adjoining rooms so that we could celebrate in our rooms but had to go out instead Won t be going back Also we looked out onto scaffolding at the side of the building , Comfortable beds 
75024,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The bed was exceptionally comfortable but the furniture was a little tired chipped edges and the small bathroom mirror was broken along with the toilet roll holder , Location was great and staff very helpful We had planned to hire Santander bikes and the docking station was pretty much outside 
75025,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The hotel bar is so expensive We spent 150 on drinks between 2 of us in an hour Most expensive bar I ve ever been too , Hotel is in a nice position and room was lovely Even got a bottle of prosecco on ice for my birthday 
75026,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Food vegetarian platter was not good particularly edamame beans were tough and unpleasant I raised it with the waitress with no satisfactory response At 20 for the platter I would have expected every item to be exceptional , Bathroom was good 
75027,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The disruption due to current building projects in the very near vicinity It would have been helpful to have been informed of this prior to our stay Whilst the view was good the curtains fit poorly barely meeting in the middle when closed leaving a stream of light visible , The river view made our stay The helpfulness of all reception staff receptionists doormen and concierges are to be recommended Excellent customer service pre during and at the end of the stay Attention to detail to help us celebrate a special anniversary complimentary chocolates swan towels and petals 
75028,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Shower in the room leaked all over the bathroom floor Room was bit more basic than expected , Location was great Staff were very friendly Lobby and rest of hotel were very elegant looking compared to our room 
75029,Park Plaza London Riverbank, It took a while to get my luggage sent up had to ask front desk a couple of times The building works at the front of the hotel and the noise from the building works should have been mentioned before hand, Every thing was amazing from the view to the food 
75030,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, This was a present for our parents 60th All they could say was how great the hotel was perfect location and very friendly staff The special touch of an upgraded room with a fantastic view a bottle of wine chocolates and card just topped off the trip Thank you so much we would highly recommend you 
75031,Park Plaza London Riverbank, It was odd that the kettle flex couldn t reach the wall socket near the tea making facilities in the room So much loving attention to state of the art design and yet rather a basic miscalculation Not a problem though just an observation , Breakfast was worth the extra money excellent and lots of choices Very friendly service too Useful info about nearby buses etc readily provided on request Our room was spacious and quiet 
75032,Park Plaza London Riverbank, They need to allow guests access to stairs We could not access stairs from our floor and the lifts take ages to arrive and were full , Staff very friendly and helpful Great location on the river 
75033,Park Plaza London Riverbank, They could have mentioned the extensive building work going on could not keep the window open due to very noisy contruction work from early in the morning The AC was also quite noisy and could not be left on while out so the room got very hot and the air turned stale during the night , Clean and nice facilities Nice staff 
75034,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Nothing, The location is great and the hotel itself is excellent very clean and with all the facilities you need The room was brilliant with a great view of the river thames and the houses of parliment could not ask for anything better
75035,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The hotel is a building site at the moment so influances my opinion in what is probably a much better hotel when not under construction the rooms are dated and my toilet ran out of water , The staff are excellent the food is good but very expensive 
75036,Park Plaza London Riverbank, bath mixer tap was broken so couldnt have a bath only a shower also only one extra pillow could have done with 2, the bed was comfortable plenty of storage room
75037,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The clearing of the room was bad and the staff not that welcoming The way of dealing with residents in this hotel isn t that good They talk to you is like they don t care All staff members including guest relation reception and others The manager wasn t that good he didn t take action to my compliment regarding bad room cleaning that I ve submitted twice Wifi connection was weak , This hotel location is nice and kinda luxurious as to furniture and other stuff The food was good Al hamdillah Wifi covered in the whole hotel apartment 
75038,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Most , The room was supposed to be of the river it wasn t No hot water on our return in the evening Despite three calls for directions no one told us there was work going on outside and the sign was obscured Checking in took 20 minutes Cleanliness of room was sub standard We ve stayed at the plaza at Westminster and always good Already sent an email to the hotel and no response We asked for some sort of compensation We ve heard zero Terrible service 
75039,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Wasn t told there would be noisy building work going on Was offered an alternative room but one overlooking railway and one closer to the building work Would not have booked had I know there would be building work as here for an anniversary Room is also internal so very dark Room was hot and the air conditioning was very loud and inadequate Bed was very uncomfortable and only three thin pillows for two people bed runner was stained Overall disappointing stay and would not recommend Hotel looks lovely in the lobby but the carpet in the hall way and bedrooms faded and the the rooms look tired , Good location friendly staff 
75040,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Breakfast prices were very expensive so we took our own but there are plenty of places you could buy breakfast at a reasonable cost nearby Mini bar prices were also very high One electrical socket was loose , Very slick and friendly check in Comfortable bed Excellent location Modern and clean Good wifi Good sized room 
75041,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room was not well cleaned We had tea stains and chocolate on the menus and dirty towels left in the room Also we are very unhappy that we were not informed of the building work After requesting to be away from the building work we were placed in a room with an industrial workers lift directly outside the window making our stay very uncomfortable ,No Positive
75042,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room we were given wasn t river facing and liked over rail tracks The noise kept us awake , Good location only a short walk to the London Eye 
75043,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Minor point but the carpets on corridors need renewing they look terrible, Staff were fab Lovely room Hairdryer Iron and ironing board in room Good free internet
75044,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Inside of main window in room needed cleaning Glass tumbler was chipped along the rim Decor in room ready for being revamped also some furniture in room seen better days , Booked executive room and the view was stunning Very impressive main lobby area 
75045,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, The staff were really accommodating champagne and a birthday card for my partner on arrival The view was magical in the evening when we arrived back to the hotel Definitely stop again
75046,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We couldn t change the temperature in room so had very little sleep as too cold and the water pressure in bathroom was poor so unable to have bath and only able to have shower , We like the location and the atmosphere of the hotel Cleanliness standards are high 
75047,Park Plaza London Riverbank, not great sound proofing i could hear conversation from next room and someone snoring at night Building work within and adjacent to the hotel is ongoing so can be noisy during the day However its a fantastic location with great staff comfortable beds and very clean so i d return There is a good cafe on black prince road for breakfast at a fraction of the hotel cost , Great staff excellent location 
75048,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Not a lot , The Staff were extremely professional There was also a problem with the room next door playing a Guitar quite late which the staff sorted out Very promptly 
75049,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The hotel is not finished and I think it s very expensive for what it is , The hotels location is fantastic can t really get any more central than it is 
75050,Park Plaza London Riverbank, check in disk is not helpful especially on leave once the money is paid , The cleaning stuff is working non stop Concierge let a mouse get out by opening the main entrance door to him was very kind of them not to kill him 
75051,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Room was a little worn Could do with some new carpets especially , Stunning views handy location Staff friendly and helpful Comfy bed Quiet room Some excellent cocktails in the bar Generally satisfied 
75052,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The rooms I was initially offered as even an upgrade were unclean The breakfast facilities are small compared to the size of the hotel and number of guests so there was a large waiting line in the morning to get seats for breakfast , The staff was very friendly and accommodating 
75053,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Unfortunately the hotel adjacent to the Park Plaza was having major refurbishment build and we did ask that we didn t want our room to face onto the building site The reception tried moving us but we still ended up in a room where we were looking out onto the building site and we had to leave our curtains closed both mornings whilst we showered and dressed as men were literally working a few feet from our window , The room was lovely and clean and comfy bed and the staff friendly and welcoming The concierges were very helpful and informative 
75054,Park Plaza London Riverbank, All was good building work going on but didn t hinder our break, Position of hotel on the embankment made it easy to get into the centre of the city
75055,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We could not get into the bar because there were not enough seats The member of staff was very apologetic but could not offer us any other place to sit , Everything worked and it was warm clean and comfortable 
75056,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The bathroom had no source of heating in there thus making it quite cold when stepping out of the shower No bath too , The bed was amazing breakfast very good and room very clean and tidy 
75057,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, I arranged a weekend stay for my girlfriend and I for what she thought was for her birthday however I was planning to propose to her over the weekend I contacted the Customer Relations Manager Joe Cunningham who could not have been more helpful in making the weekend as fantastic as it was Firstly we were given a free upgrade to the executive room with a view and what a view it was Including Big Ben Westminster the Thames and the London Eye The room can only be described as extremely well looked after clean and modern with all of the required amenities a young couple should need for a weekend break On our second night after I became engaged to be wed as a way of celebration Joe arranged for a large bottle of prosecco strawberries and a strawberry cheesecake gluten free to be left in our room and beautifully arranged with rose petals by his assistant Yann I can not thank Joe Yann and all of the staff at the Park Plaza Riverbank enough for making our weekend so perfect and we will be returning on our next trip to the capital Absolutely fantastic 
75058,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We got three glasses delivered to our room we didn t ask for and in the morning a phonecall but wasn t there when we answered Also cleaner knocked on our door in the morning for no apparent reason , The reception staff were excellent let us check in early and upgrade for no additional cost Overall brilliantly clean and good location for what we wanted 
75059,Park Plaza London Riverbank, There was a minibar in the room as fridge But you can use only a half shelf in the minibar as fridge In my opinion it is very very small area , The room was very clean and nice The location was also good There was an electric kettle in the room so we could drink a hot tea or coffee anytime 
75060,Park Plaza London Riverbank, One of our door keys would work but it s an easy fix , The staff were exceptionally friendly and were very efficient at keeping us on the right track when navigating london The young man on the door inside kindly asked about our day gave suggestions on things to do and gave general good chat 
75061,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I was very disappointed with the behaviour of the receptionist upon checking in I found her to be very rude I don t particularly like small talk and prefer to just get my room key and go but I don t appreciate someone being unpleasant towards me for no reason I was also disappointed with the in room dining service as I had previously enjoyed the risotto balls mini bites which the hotel website still had listed on its in room menu when I booked but they were not on the menu when I arrived The food I did order was however delicious bang bang chicken margarita pizza I order late night dining one of the nights after returning from a night out in London and I paid in cash however it took quite a long time for the server to return with my change Lastly I had requested a quiet room to stay in and was put on the 8th floor which I would have thought would be very quiet However I was disturbed after both night s sleep due to either banging within the hotel or the construction work that was happening outside of our window on the Monday of our stay The room service and the quiet stay could be a matter of bad luck The main disappointment was the behaviour of the receptionist when I arrived , I had stayed in the hotel a number of times while travelling for work and I wanted to treat myself to a personal weekend in London The location is great we could enjoy the city and be able to walk everywhere we wanted to go The room was a good size and is very clean and tidy Everything I needed was available in the room so I didn t need to contact reception for extras ironing board iron hairdryer etc The bed was a great size and very comfortable Upon checking out the receptionist was helpful and friendly

75065,Park Plaza London Riverbank, There is ALOT of construction work going on around the area but we didn t hear any noise from it at all even though when we woke up we realised they d obviously been working for several hours , We stayed here as we were attending a concert in o2 academy Brixton which was around 10 mins away in a taxi It was looking over the Thames and around a 15 minute walk to the London eye Also much cheaper compared to other hotels I had priced and the hotel was amazing

75075,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Not to be ripped of by the price of prosseco When I pay 38 for a bottle I know there will be I price increase from what it was brought as but the fact it was a 11 bottle of prosseco originally and I had to pay 38 is not on Also when I was told that the holding charge paid would be refunded within 24 hours I don t expect to have to wait 5 days to get my money back Also when I order room service and I get told it will be 10 minutes I don t expect to have to wait 50 minutes , Bed was comfy shower was nice

75085,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Only thing I have to say negatively is that we ordered a steak via room service and it didn t come with a steak knife , Rooms were spacious comfortable and very clean The staff seemed to do everything in their power to make our stay as comfortable as possible 
75086,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The hotel is still under construction sandwiched between other buildings also under construction Covered in scaffolding and with workers banging drilling sawing from around 8am onwards Soundproof rooms not soundproof , Nice enough location views of parliament 5 10 min walk to Vauxhall tube station Pleasant enough decor 
75087,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Too warm in the room and the fan we were provided with wasn t effective , The location is wonderful the staff were very helpful and the decor is lovely 
75088,Park Plaza London Riverbank, It seemed like the information we asked for wasn t looked at when we were checking in Then when we needed something we were asked about 3 4 times if this was provided which is a good thing but it was like the left hand didn t know what the right hand was doing and it was over a simple thing like opening the bar fridge Service is great but a little disjointed that is all , Love the bed 
75089,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Room was tired Curtains didn t close all the way and were tatty Appears the hotel is being upgraded on the outside hopefully this will continue on the inside , Walking distance to activities on South Bank and beyond Easy reach of tube stations 
75090,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We were disturbed on the Saturday night by a party being held in the suite next to us we didn t complaint on the night as it was someone s birthday and didn t want to spoil it But a bit more consideration for rooms either side of a planned birthday celebration would have been better , The quality feel and look of the hotel from walking into until we left it was excellent

75093,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The hotel is expanding and the view of a building site below was a bit off putting but didn t spoil our stay , This hotel was amazing Friendly staff nothing was too much trouble The room we had was fantastic with a great view of the thames and the houses of parliament

75116,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Where do I start I m not one to complain but our travel was something that I would not like to do again when we arrived the hotel was stunning and mind blowing I thought we hit the jackpot then we are sent to the room which was room 341 which was a suite well when we got in there the first thing was the view well there where doing building work right opposite our room so you can imagine the view we had they had two powerful spot light shining straight in the room so you can not see any out the window because of the light blur it was a lot worse because the Windows where very dirty so that spoil our view as we had to shut curtains as soon as it started to get dark The other thing is as soon as you walk into the room there is a massive stain on the carpet curtains where all stained The sofa was like sitting on pavement slabs very uncomfortable We ordered room service got half chicken which was the driest chicken I ve ever tasted I also ordered room service again on New Year s Eve which was a simple bowl of chips and garlic bread that never turned up said it would be 20 30 minutes an hr went past and still no food so I called them again and the told me that the guy had already left I said has he left with my order he said no it will be another 20 minutes I said this is a joke just cancel my order that you never even got I got no apologies of him at all I complained at the front desk and after 20 minutes the offered me 30 pn of the room which was still not worth it as we saved for a long time to see the fireworks display we paid around 700 for 3 night which is the worst money I ve ever spent and that was with no breakfasts not happy spoilt our break , Staff where very friendly who we spoke to expect one room service the hotel was very impressive until we got to the room then went down hill from there 
75117,Park Plaza London Riverbank, They charge me for the mini bar but they didn t tell me at all I need to pay for it is absurd I hate it I will never go back there at plaza hotel, i like just the building
75118,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room was rock bottom basic with a very noisy bathroom and a view to a construction site Unpleasant Breakfast was cold really not appetising at all , Location
75119,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We asked for a room with a nice view as this was a Christmas gift when we got there the room we were given was opposite a building site so the view was awful The builders were drilling early hours of monday so we was rudely awakened which didn t bother us as much as we was up early but we had not been given warning that they were building work going As it was a Sunday night an not particularly busy I would of thought we could of had a much better room than we was given for the price especially , Good location to get into centre of London room was clean an spacious 
75120,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, I stayed in the executive suite and the view was breath taking Staff was so friendly and helpful Facilities were great ice bucket and glasses with mini bar a little space to put your personal items in ice machine on same floor as the room I found the bar and restaurant on the expensive side and decided not to eat there but had a drink Again the staff were lovely Very clean and modern bar If I visit London again I will look to stay in this hotel again as the location was fantastic 
75121,Park Plaza London Riverbank, This hotel is undergoing a major reconstruction The rooms are very hot and noisy from outside train road construction which starts early making for a very disturbed sleep , Good breakfast
75122,Park Plaza London Riverbank, N a , Quality Service all staff were very polite Valet parking service top class everything taken care of Ignacio at the reception desk has served us before and he remembered us which was very nice The food at Chino Latino was fantastic We also had breakfast and very happy with the service A first class hotel at an affordable price with an exclusive experience Simply the best We are coming back to this hotel in future 
75123,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I have actually cut my shin on the ledge around the bed as I hit it when walking up to the bed and didn t expect it Also taking a payment from my card to guarantee the hotel when I had already pre paid Still waiting for funds to be returned , The bathroom and bedroom facilities and the comfortable bed

75125,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, The location it was super close to the attractions WE woke up every morning to a beautiful view everyday The staff was very nice too Its good to know that they have halal menu as well even though its not much but glad to know that its there 
75126,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We upgraded from our original room but the upgrade was somewhat outdated and jaded Disappointing considering it was supposed to be a more superior room I believe it would benefit from refurbishment The main problem however is the work being done on the hotel and the machinery fixed onto the exterior of the building to transport building materials We were woken on the Monday morning by the loud noise and vibrations caused by this machine We were not warned that this could be a problem nor were we warned that our room backed onto the railway lines and the trains could be heard in the room too Disappointing overall, Ideal location good restaurant and bar as well as very helpful and pleasant staff Very good selection of foods for breakfast
75127,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Toilet brush not seen in my room, Very expansive rooms Convenient Staff very friendly polite and courteous Always very willing to offer assistance
75128,Park Plaza London Riverbank, There were massive amounts of construction work being done just outside our room this massively impacted our trip in a negative way Couldn t hear myself think in the morning let alone sleep Raised this with the staff and got a rude response that nothing could be done , It was a lovely facility 
75129,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Service charge for bar area extravagant should be allowed to get you own drinks and food Breakfast and dining really satisfying, Lovely room no mention of building works but this never affected our stay and we slept well for two nights 
75130,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Unclean overpriced hotel dirty rooms dirty windows burned carpets unclean towels room with a view view of the construction site all in all horrible experience,No Positive
75131,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The only thing wrong with the room was that the carpet was in a poor state of repair with stains what appeared to be burns in it , Proximity to Vauxhall Station which made transfer to the city quite easy Reception area was very attractive 
75132,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The builders next door woke us up around 7am then less than an hour later the cleaner woke us up as well Bathroom was dirty air con didn t work , Brilliant location easy to get around London from the nearby Vauxhall station Large comfy bed easy check in 
75133,Park Plaza London Riverbank, No air conditioning switched off for winter which should be fine However the heating was turned up high all over the hotel and the windows didn t open more than a crack Thus very hot in the room Fitness centre equipment needs maintenance as equipment is worn Construction everywhere Adding floors to the hotel new builds on all side No mention of such when booking Cacophonous building noise from 8 am Saturday not a great start to the weekend , Location is great 
75134,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The bathroom did flood probably due to leaking pipe under the bath but did not spoil the over night stay , Excellent location at a fair price Room had a superb river view Good choice at breakfast buffet and quality high but at 20pp reduced to 13 if booked when checking in you would expect this 
75135,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I was given no room with a view , It was quiet Slept very well I understand that there are still some refurbishments to be made for the next 4 6 months I am a Certified Travel Consultant for Extreme Travel I have access to 1 400 travel agents in the UK I am one of 40 000 known travel agents globally It would be in your best interest to offer me any upgrades you have As I would like to offer my personal business clients on anything that will enhance their hotel experience I would like to be contacted by your hotel in about the next 4 6 months to experience your new refurbishments If there s any familiarisation trips to your hotel regarding the above feedback I would like to be informed 
75136,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Thought my room was awful Bed uncomfortable very strange shape room Shower was woeful All in all really poor value for money , Front desk staff were friendly and helpful
75137,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The hotel room was freezing here The heating was broken , The hotel was lovely the staff were friendly and inviting The hotel room it self was beautifully presented and clean 
75138,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Busy out of the front of the hotel on the friday night About 10 minutes walk or so from Vauxhal underground not bad but could be closer , Room was a very decent size Nice and clean Comfortable sized bed for 2 
75139,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Building site next to hotel , The bar and the restaurant attached to the hotel is brilliant The staff are friendly and helpful It was my girlfriends b day and i ordered something for room service the chef and staff excelled my expectation Thanks for a great surprise and the effort put in by team Well done 
75140,Park Plaza London Riverbank, My room was directly beside a building site I had to keep my curtains closed as workers were literally metres away The carpets on floor 4 are filthy and should be replaced Some of the staff serving breakfast clearly don t want to be there and make a good job of avoiding eye contact , The location
75141,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The air con was not good atmosphere in room very stuffy We were lucky to have breakfast early on Sunday morning as a queue soon developed and it was impossible to get the lifts as there were so many people trying to get down for breakfast, The location was important for us as it is opposite Tate Britain
75142,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Was not so keen on the breakfast experience Very busy quite cramped tables no saucers to put tea spoons on so had to put on table between drinks A lot of queuing for toast or waiting for buffet t be topped up Waited 20 min for Kippers order lost , The room was very comfortable and the view of the Thames was magnificent especially at night when everything was lit up 
75143,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Air conditioning wasn t working and the room was far too hot which spoils it really Also at reception when we booked in we were told that the locality card we were given would give us 5 off the restaurant and bar so in the evening on our return we went to the bar for a cocktail only to be told we couldn t use the card for drinks only food Not very well explained from reception The lovely lady in the bar did take the 5 off in the end as she said she wanted us to be happy and that we would feel happy there she was wonderful and handled the situation perfectly , Staff and location
75144,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The breakfast venue was packed The breakfast was luke warm and the toast making facilities were completely inadequate Not a good experience and not value for money wish we had eaten out , The Location was good and the room was clean and pleasant though the view wasn t at all good We were in room 206
75145,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Although I requested a river view if possible as shown in the pictures on the website we unfortunately were overlooking another building and there was a roof of scaffolding between our building and the other one so the room was dark and it wasn t possible to see what the weather was doing There was no mention of this work prior to the trip There was also lime scale marks on the shower cubicle the biscuits were not replenished and there was no bin liners in the bins in the room or the bathroom , Location on the Thames close to Vauxhall and Westminster tube stations
75146,Park Plaza London Riverbank, For the price I would have expected breakfast included in the price and slightly better quality For a full English slightly disappointing no fried eggs and the mushrooms had absolutely no taste , The room was a little on the cold side but nevertheless comfortable this may have been an issue if I d spent more time in the room 
75147,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Building work being carried out either side of the hotel which spoilt the kerb appeal and might be noisy on weekdays , Birthday treat for my wife Chose executive room with superb views of London Complimentary bottle of sparkling received from the management Everything we could have wished for and more 
75148,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Bleach on room carpet looks horrible Doesn t cost much to replace Only one small bottle of shampoo etc which I used to go out first night leaving nine for partner or following morning again small detail would be good to have more We were offered room with a view although noisy from construction site we accepted The view was into a wall , Lovely hotel great price Bed very comfortable 
75149,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Check in and out was speedy with pleasant staff Room was sparkling clean and we wished we had time to stay another night Will certainly return here when we next need to stay in London
75150,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The rooms were very chlostophobic and dark i couldn t sleep at night due to rooms were very warm even though we had ac on i was up most of the night felt dizzy , Location of the hotel was perfect for us
75151,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We were made aware there was building work on We were woken at 8am every morning Only suggestion I d make is a wonderful riverbank view but only 1 chair to enjoy it It would have been lovely to sit together instead of one on the chair and other sit on the bed , We stopped for our belated honeymoon We stayed in the river view room Complimentary prosecco and chocolates 
75152,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Hotel had a problem with the heating for this particular room which we weren t advised about until we asked this was early hours of the morning we were invited to change rooms however this was inconvenient giving the time of the night Also building was shrouded with scaffolding which we we re unaware of until arrival this altered the view but didn t impact on our stay too negatively , Great location ideal for central London and amenities 
75153,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Had to wait over an hour for room to be ready despite arriving after checkout time Several flies in the room , Location was excellent with views of Westminster and the London Eye 
75154,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I was really impressed with the hotel rooms and service the only thing that was very disappointing was there was clearly rust in our bathroom mirror which I would have thought that would have been replaced although it was a lovely hotel I really thought this let it down there was also a crack in the mirror of my friends room mirror to again a little upsetting,No Positive
75155,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, The hotel staff were very friendly the room was clean but there were little areas that could be improved such as frayed carpet in places Breakfast was excellent staff were friendly and accommodating definitely would return again 
75156,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Severe building works next door means you don t get much sleep Room was overpriced for what it was and could do with a bit of TLC, Great bar area and very welcoming lobby
75157,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We booked an executive twin room which was on the 5th floor The view was of the building works next door there was no view of the river we were expecting and the Windows did not keep out the noise So we asked to upgrade to the next room available So we were moved to the 9th floor the view was amazing much better then before However at 8am we were woken up by builders working on the top of our hotel Our phone also rang at 8 20 and 8 30am with no one on the other end we did not ask for a wake up call , Staff friendly and polite The view from the room once we moved was great 
75158,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Lots of building work going on around and also on the hotel View from window was of building site next door not mentioned by Reception staff when booking in , Location was within walking distance of Vauxhall tube station
75159,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Building site next door was very noisy and also room service was poor failed to replace the tea coffee and sugar we had used the day before, Location was ideal for the location I was going to being Westminster also easy to get about London with Vauhall station being 5 mins to walk to
75160,Park Plaza London Riverbank, No parking facilities and being charged 25 extra per night for the privilege of looking out onto a building site and the builders looking directly into my room,No Positive
75161,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The heating didn t work properly Also the rooms aren t sound proof That is you could hear any move in the corridors , The staff are very friendly and the room service menu is great Takes a bit of time but it s really good the stake wasn t but everything else was great The beds are very comfortable 
75162,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The carpets in the room could do with changing lots of dirty marks and burnt through holes The walls were very thin and we had an awakening one morning by the neighbors Also we would of liked to have been told about the builders outside of our window as we had to have our curtains shut during our duration so we could have privacy , The staff were great and very friendly The bathroom was very clean and shower was brilliant Beds were very comfy Good location 
75163,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I requested a room on a high floor with a river view However our room was on the first floor and faced the side of another building so it was really dark So dark in fact that during the day you still needed all of the lights on to be able to see anything Felt very dingy and depressing , Staff were friendly Hotel seemed clean and bathroom was nice 
75164,Park Plaza London Riverbank, When you charge a certain rate for a room and amenities you cannot present a room in disrepair or poor maintenance , The location and general view was great 
75165,Park Plaza London Riverbank, staff could be more friendly and open to listen , rooms are comfortable breakfast is OK walking distance to big ben london eye covent garden oxford circus etc very close to vauxhall tube
75166,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, The staff were very lovely and welcoming It was my birthday and they upgraded my room and they gave me complimentary prosseco and truffles Excellent customer service made me feel welcome Very good room size and the wifi is pretty decent 
75167,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Not being informed before the booking that there is construction work being undertaken all around and on top of the hotel , Room Size view from the room if you did not look down or to the right 
75168,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Breakfast was fairly cold Room was quite chilly couldn t turn the heating up even when up the air coming out was still cold, River view is amazing Rooms clean spacious tidy Staff are friendly and helpful
75169,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Fabulous view over the river Thames good breakfast and a really comfortable bed Great location helpful and polite staff Would highly recommend There is currently some construction work taking place next to the hotel but we were not disturbed by any noise 
75170,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The location It takes a while to get to this hotel compared to others I ve stayed at , The gym was good compared to other hotels I ve used My overall comfort in the hotel was excellent especially for this price 
75171,Park Plaza London Riverbank, requested a quiet river view room as our anniversary upgraded to a room overlooking dirty railway track noisy trains and bird droppings on balcony tiny bath that could barely fit 1 person fresh milk was out of date 2 days in row when we were leaving staff bought up fruit and bottled water for next guests admitting they had forgotten us, staff location
75172,Park Plaza London Riverbank, the lobby and lounge and all that is really nice but the furniture in the room is quite old some bits broken Bed could be better a little bit harder , Nice staff and nice beakfast nice bathroom
75173,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Everything was good There is mention of construction nearby by other reviewers but this was not a problem and had no impact on the enjoyment of our stay , Very modern and well maintained hotel Clean rooms and having kettle milk biscuits etc a welcome touch Staff friendly and helpful We were staying in London to celebrate our son s 21st birthday and the hotel customer services made it memorable 10 minute walk to tube station London Eye and all that s happening on the South Bank Definitely stay again Chino Latino restaurant is off the hotel lobby and definitely worth dining in 
75174,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Fantastic hotel brilliant views of the river thames upgraded to get but worth the extra money reception staff excellent lorent I think he was called breakfast fantastic a wide variety Booked very late so probably could have saved money if we had booked previously A wonderful experience 
75175,Park Plaza London Riverbank, No hot or cold water in the morning which made attending a business meeting a tad difficult No apology received or even a voucher for free drink issued as compensation which is a pity because management missed a great moment of truth opportunity to make a difference , OK location pleasant facilities great food in main restaurant and lounge 
75176,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Small matters really but breakfast room a little bit hectic when busy which resulted in insufficient cutlery being laid on table a couple of times while room cleaner did not leave sugar most days , We were upgraded to a suite with stunning views of river Houses of Parliament Big Ben etc Suite very comfortable Breakfast food was of very decent quality Door staff very pleasant 
75177,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Building works tower next to hotel made us wake up to building workers bout 15 feet away from our window goodbye privacy goodbye supposedly good views over London , up to date modern clean comfortable
75178,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Thank you, The location was great near to Big Ben london eye the bridge and vauxhall station 10 minutes walking there is supermarket in the next building clean and comfort rooms 
75179,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Was charged for a breakfast I didn t have and felt I wasn t believed and did not get an apology for their mistake Rather a third degree attitude on what I had purchased just a drink from the bar with cash and not charged to my room Not a The best location for public transport , Comfortable and well equipped room 
75180,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Unfortunately building contractors were working on the hotel roof using power tools as we were on the 8th floor this did impact on our stay especially as I was having a weekend break due to suffering from wiextreme migraine , You always know that you are going to receive excellent service and provision from Park Plaza Hotels 
75181,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Just the building works but we had been pre warned so not an issue, Staff were amazing couldn t do enough for us Close enough to walk to most things 
75182,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Had to move rooms because smoke smell in first room Carpet had stains and torn in areas Construction site outside room , They had a good size bath tub with luxurious toiletries Ample tea and coffee supplied Reasonable size rooms 
75183,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The bed could have been nicer but the extra pillows in the closet and the safe make up for it , The area was very convenient and noce Not too far from the action We took a cab ride from Leister Square and paid 10 Pounds which we think was not bad The tube station is about a 5min walk and the cw ter of town is about a 15 min walk away and the walk is lovely I enjoyed my stay and would recommend Rooms where very comfortable and had enough space New and clean 
75184,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Hated the fact that there was a lot of construction noise from 8 20am on both Friday and Saturday I appreciate that this would happen in the week but was very disappointed and annoyed to be awoken on the weekend Due to this I thought the room was extremely overpriced , The bedroom facilities and hotel in general 
75185,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Noise from refurbishment of room next door started with drilling and hammering at 8am Had to change rooms after first night as first room was a double rather than twin as booked , Helpful staff 24 hour reception 
75186,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Did not pre pay breakfast but when we asked we were referred to area and then were charged 41euro for continental breakfast for two A touch expensive,No Positive
75187,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Building work we were told that work started at 8am which was fine as we knew we would be up by then so it wouldn t bother us but on Wednesday we were woken at 7am by the building noise Its greay that you provide herbal tea choices in the rooms but they weren t replenished so we ran out , Bathroom very nice good shower 12 00 checkout was really helpful 
75188,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Construction hall carpets were tired and stained, Location price size of room staff on desk decor of room bathroom was clean spacious bright modern
75189,Park Plaza London Riverbank, My only slightly negative comment was the room itself was a little cold The air con either blew cold or not at all Aside from that though I would definitely stay here again and have already recommended a friend, Booked to stay here for my partners birthday The hotel exterior is beautiful and the interior to match All the staff were extremely welcoming and happy to help even at 3 am when we ordered room service and locked ourselves out of the room We booked an executive double with river view but upon arrival were told weve received a COMPLIMENTARY upgrade to a plaza river view suite Beautiful 
75190,Park Plaza London Riverbank, It s a bit dark in the restaurant Although that could be called atmospheric , Everything The location staff environment and food are all great 
75191,Park Plaza London Riverbank, they ran out of coffee at breakfast the staff said they would bring my husband a coffee to our table but it never arrived , the room was spacious and clean and the breakfast had a wide varied choice 
75192,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Expensive especially for breakfast Carpet in the bedroom very marked and appeared dirty They had a conference going on at the same time and this seemed to overtake all other guests , Ease of check in and check out
75193,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, The hotel staff is very nice and extremely helpful The location offers an easy walk to Westminster There is construction going on next to the hotel but it was very quiet in our room 
75194,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Very dirty carpets in rooms in my room and in my daughter room as well and in the corridor very dirty sofas and armchairs smelly pillows old furniture broken wardrobe cleaning up was not done properly at all minibar was not replenished on the second day we stayed for two nights porters did not care did not help us with our siutcases when we arrived even though they could see we had problems with it terrible experience we stayed there for a couple of times in the past the hotel was newer and much better we will never come back again, Beautiful view nice and helpful reception staff new bathroom
75195,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We wasn t aware that there was building work going on all around the hotel It could sometimes be quite noisy The carpets in the hotel make it look quite dirty as they are full of stains We were on the 8th floor I have stayed in much better fancier rooms with hints of personal touches for a lot less money The staff in the restaurant at breakfast need to learn to smile more and be more friendly , The staff in the bar were very accommodating and friendly 
75196,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The breakfast was so expensive that it was cheaper to eat out could do with lowering the prices or having a small cafe that is cheaper than the resturant , Hotel was so much closer to the tube station and London Eye than expected Work was being done on the hotel during our stay but we never saw or heard anyone Rooms spacious and had everything in the room that anyone could possibly need 
75197,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The food we got from room service was probably the worst thing I ate in years Only I was starving I would have sent it back Iceland would have been embarrassed to sell that so called food , Great location the staff are a credit to the place 
75198,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We have stayed at this hotel before and had a lovely time but this time we were disappointed I had been made aware that there was some building work on the roof but when we got there it was a huge extension being built Also there were building works going on on both sides of the hotel I asked for a river view We got a building site with a small glimpse of the river When we arrived the breakfast was not included and so our stay became very expensive with an extra 48 00 on top of the price We had to have breakfast there as there is no other places near to have breakfast This is where the river is a lovely location if you can see it but everthing is a 15 minute walk We had a lot of problems with our keys and so had to keep getting new ones I spoke to the hotel about the fact that I was not happy with the room and was just offered an inside room I had booked the hotel because I like the river In the mornings all you could hear were workmen and they could easily see into your room I spoke to another visitor and she said they went past her room in on a platform The breakfast was reasonable but I felt I was in a school canteen, The hotel has polite and caring staff who make you welcome The hotel has a relaxed ambiance about it and you feel comfortable when you arrive There is a quick and easy lift to your room and if you want your luggage is taken there The room was light airy and clean The bathroom was well decorated and had a really nice bath and shower I needed to find a restaurant and the concierge was very helpful
75199,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I didn t like the noise from the construction and the workers able to look directly in the room It would have been appreciated if the hotel management would had offered a free drink of choice for everyday of inconvenience Also disposable slippers since the carpet needs regular cleaning , The size of my room and the bathroom facilities and comfortable pillows Room service was very prompt and affordable 
75200,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The staff attitude was horrible the hotel charged us for things we didn t request which took a lot of time of arguing when i checked out which made us late for the airport ,No Positive
75201,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The decor and furnishings of the room are so minimalistic that it felt empty Also there is an outer glass wall covering the entire building and this outer glass was dirty and badly needs cleaning , Great value for money We booked a room with the River View and it was very spacious and did have a great view of the Houses of Parliament 
75202,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The wifi drops out occasionally but this is the case in most large hotels apart from that there is nothing i could find wrong with this hotel, Ive stayed at this hotel a few times now and never had a bad experience The staff are very diligent and extremely helpful The rooms are clean and comfortable and the bathrooms are clean and the house keeping is very prompt and quick It has a limited fitness centre but enough to keep you going and give you a good workout Id recommend getting a river view room as the views can be quite stunning early in the morning also location couldn t be better and i will stay there again 
75203,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Our roon 133 was by the door towards banquet hall so when stuff and people passed though the door it was noisy and we were scared , Exellent entrance and good staff we liked
75204,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Lighting in the room was very poor you either had to have all the lights on or very bright spotlights that were too strong to relax by Room felt a bit tired compared to how plush the lobby reception was , Very impressive reception and lobby facilities which was all I had time to use Quick room service 
75205,Park Plaza London Riverbank, If you upgrade to a suite you don t get executive lounge access unlike with some other hotel chains Exec lounge access is a separate package , Chino Latino the pan Asian restaurant within the hotel is excellent The food was fantastic and the staff were knowledgeable and friendly 
75206,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Bedroom TV did not work but hey early days still time to fix it Didn t fancy eating dinner there as nothing on the menu appealed, Staff and apartment were wonderful
75207,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Breakfast was very expensive so ate elsewhere , The location next to the Thames the room itself the bed was ultra comfortable and the bathroom was really nice with a separate walk in shower as well as bath etc Nice toiletries too It was very quiet on the 7th floor heard no noises at all 
75208,Park Plaza London Riverbank,No Negative, Great place Perfect location Staff very helpful Concierge was especially helpful Solved many tourist enquiries Would definitely stay here again Great
75209,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The entrance was too dark Ordered newspaper didn t get it Housekeepers didn t clean our room the first day Room a little too dark , Staff was very nice and helpful Breakfast was very good 
75210,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The menu was limited and expensive Food was nice but no local beers , Location was what we needed Construction work was a little annoying Rooms were spacious and clean Comfortable bed
75211,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The bar staff could pick up their game a little , Overall a very clean and tidy hotel Staff were very accommodating Close to Vauxhall Station and a bus stop out the front made it very convenient to get around but the walk into London was pretty easy as well 
75212,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I am required to use a cpap machine when I sleep Since there was no suitable power outlet near the bed I asked the Concierge for an extension power lead as I have done many times at other hotels and have been provided one without hesitation The Concierge told me to go to the shop and buy one Eventually the Reception staff were able to provide me with one , The facilities ambiance room view and staff with one exception were excellent We were thrilled with the gesture of champagne and chocolates in recognition of our Golden wedding 
75213,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The first ever hotel I have stayed in with no toothbrush provided but there was a little convenient store just next door , It was a last minute cheap stylish fancy hotel that we found online was definitely not what we expected The staff were approachable polite and helpful A brilliant experience would love to recommend this place to family and friends visiting London this hotel was also located along the river Thames where all the famous landmarks are situated 
75214,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The room was a little noisey mid morning the hotel was having some work done The only fault I could find is the hotel room was situated within the hotel so the view was very poor no natural day light When looking out of the window it looked like a block of council flats , I liked the location it wasn t too far from the nearest tube also it was in walking distance from Westminster The breakfast was lovely lots of different choices The bed was comfortable and the pillows were feather I slept really which is not the normal for I felt the hotel had a laid back atmosphere 
75215,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Having to pay 50 extra per night for the View of the Thames The fact that the Hotel was next to a Construction site that None of the staff I had spoken to on the phone Prior to my trip had told me about Meaning that on my last full day in London I had to suffer Drilling that sounded like it was coming through my walls banging I had the Up grade refunded by a different Manager but No mention of a free night or a refund on the Awfully Dry Chicken Biryani I had in my room I d even taken 2 pieces of chicken to the duty Manager Tom the next morning he said he d see the chef , View from window most of the staff were Very Helpfull Duty Manager didn t help much The other Manager I Saw briefly was far more Professional very nice Breakfast was lovely even if they did forget my poached egg 
75216,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The consturction work next door and on the floors above Although the workmen finished at a good time the vibration in our room during the afternoon was a little of putting, All of the above High floor had excellent views
75217,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The carpet in the hall ways need either replacing or a really good scrub The building site next door was a little irritating , I received a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite Lovely and clean The staff were very friendly and couldn t do enough for me 
75218,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The doorman were extremely judgmental and that was a shame , The reception staff Ben was very helpful and friendly Rooms very quiet and air con was great 
75219,Park Plaza London Riverbank, The usual grumble of the expensive bar prices which unfortunately I expect I would of stayed longer in the very nice surroundings of the bar if it was not expensive, Staff extremely helpful epitomised by the concierge service 
75220,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Decor is a bit tired and frayed My first room the lock didn t work so I was moved the next one worked but required 2 hands to unlock it again I had no inner net curtains in the second room the next building is very close so you need them They reappeared on day 4 , Great location and polite professional staff Good price too 
75221,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Whilst we paid for a river view the room looked into an adjacent building site with the river at an oblique angle Fortunately it was the weekend and there were no workers on site otherwise they could have looked straight into our bedroom The free bottle of Prosecco and chocolates partly compensated for this The hotel is being extended and is surrounded by building sites , Despite being south of the river it is possible to walk into Westminster or Vauxhall we like walking and access the tube network 
75222,Park Plaza London Riverbank, I was given a room on the top floor and was not made aware by the reception staff that very noisy works were going on above me to extend the hotel upwards There was noise when I got into the room at 5pm and an unbelievable racket commenced at 8 in the morning so much so that you could not stay in the room The rooms on the top floor are not fit for occupation under these conditions and should be not made available or sold at very discounted rates There is also no natural light into the room due to a canopy over the central atrium so it feels like constant night time when you are in the room , Nice room and good location
75223,Park Plaza London Riverbank, We had to wait 2 hours after check in for our room as it wasnt ready we had been told our room was on of the nicer rooms but when we got it the state wasnt good at all Door frames had alot of wear and looked really old Also it was my partners bday i rang prior to our check in to have something arranged in the room for him Once we got to our room after the 2 hour wait nothing had been arranged or put into place Also te building work was an off put,No Positive
75224,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Wasn t aware that building works going on Didn t particularly affect us on a weekend but should have been told , excellent location easy to get to 
75225,Park Plaza London Riverbank, Poor coffee and tea making facilities no iron awful smell from the drains dodgy light fittings Woke up very early due to trains and building work outside window Wouldn t advise upgrading to an executive room as it certainly didn t feel or look like one , Good location quick check in fairly helpful staff
