136479,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, A rather ugly modern concrete building not typically Parisian , very comfortable bed room modern and spacious and clean Large and varied breakfast buffet Hotel very functional with air conditioning which was welcome in warm weather if a little modern and bland convenient for metro 
136480,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Coffee in the room could have been a little more generous more milks etc probably could have got them but did not ask , Nice staff at reception helpful when needed beds bar area and easy to find

136483,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The bedside reading light wasn t bright enough , Staff location cleanliness and comfort Plus the free drinks made available was great as it was a very hot few days 
136484,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The only thing I would change was the paper coffee cups in the room and I should have asked for more milk But that s my problem , I missed breakfast as I slept in but the wine was good in the afternoon service great especially check in where every thing was explained i asked the reception to book taxi s and they explained the cost time of the journey roughly and organised the taxi promptly I would definitely go back again This is the best comment a hotel could have 
136485,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, They held 450 out of my account even though the room was only 369 Not over charged just held just in case Then charged 20euro for a breakfast dont get brekkie here go to cafe down road get brekkie for a fiver Also there s a city hotel tax which you only find out about at check out but apart from cost nice place good location There s another mercury 10 min up the toad that s in a dodgy part so book here not there , Location
136486,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The squeaky bed , Silent and spacious room with good bath room facilities Breakfast was super with healthy as well as tasty extras Almost perfect location in attractive part of city 
136487,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Bed was too hard Needed more pillows Air conditioner had very little power keeping the room too hot , Location and the terrace bar restaurant Great value 
136488,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Proper cups for tea coffee in the room A breakfast menu so that we could have made an informed decision about breakfasting in the hotel As there wasn t we didn t The bed was so hard I woke stiff and sore every morning, Decor is stunning Separate shower and toilet appreciated We might go again 
136489,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, I have never encountered such bad staff I booked a total of seven rooms and our flight was delayed so they called my colleague at 2am to see if we were still taking the rooms Also one of the group paid a cash deposit and we were unable to change this to a credit card deposit during the stay for no reason at all Literally the worst service ever , Th bed was relatively comfy and had a good location
136490,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Old carpet in halls smelly shower dodgy and broken like showering with a tap pressure so bad Hair dryer poor and we were very disappointed , Location
136491,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The breakfast staff were extremely understaffed One member completely ignored me when I asked for a glass for juice I waited for 20 minutes until they brought glasses The coffee machine needs clearer instructions on how to use it After 2 attempts I gave up and had hot chocolate instead I saw others struggling with it too The bathroom shower was very cheaply made however it had good water pressure so it didn t bother me too much I requested a room with a bath but only got a shower I wouldn t have mind so much had the receptionist at least acknowledged my request And that particular receptionist was quite unwelcoming when I checked in , The breakfast was absolutely delicious The room was spotless The lobby smelt lovely Great location 
136492,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur,No Negative, Very comfortable hotel for a family of 3 Good breakfast nice bar to spend the evening Very good location Moulin Rouge is just around the corner Very helpful staff helped us quickly with getting all necessary info and tickets There s a parking just next to the hotel so it s easy to get all the luggage to the hotel Metro station is also there Overall we really liked the hotel 
136493,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The carpet was filthy The beds were uncomfortable and I don t know whose hair the hair dryer would dry The staff did not know where a laundry was in the neighborhood There is no way this was a 4 star hotel ,No Positive
136494,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Not sure why but in the morning for breakfast they wanted us to eat in what resembled a meeting room very dark and boring Yet across the way was a bright and modern eating area with access to an outside courtyard We refused to eat in the boardroom and enjoyed the outside courtyard First Bedroom was ok but clear it was aimed at business people but due to an issue with no Aircon we were moved to a room on floor 6 which was very nice, Very clean and Modern Depending on room went from nice to very nice 
136495,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur,No Negative, Location close to bars restaurants public transport On a very busy road but no noise inside Rooms spacious comfortable and very clean Staff very friendly and helpful 
136496,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The air con wasn t working which made the room very stuffy No face towels shampoo or conditioners were given and we were only given flimsy paper cups , The location was convenient
136497,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The room view wasn t great but can t really blame the hotel for this They did not have umbrellas when it was lashing rain a few times apparently they ran out of them Some little fittings such as the soap dispenser and fittings on the shower were loose or fell off Just a little bit of maintenance needed but not a big deal , A nice quiet Hotel in a very busy area in Montmartre Very warm and comfortable Good security presence There is also a nice restaurant bar on the roof terrace and again is very relaxed 
136498,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, A little out of the way Plenty of restaurants in the area but down the block and around the corner seemed not to be a nicer area of Paris , Very Nice modern remodel done in 2016 Staff was very helpful and spoke very good English with my broken French Everything looked great and was very accommodating Room had enough space for my wife and myself Bar was very nice with good selection of wines 
136499,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, First two days were ok however on the third day our anniversary the whole purpose of our trip when we returned to our room during the afternoon 4pm we found that the bedding had been stripped all the towels removed and just left in a mess This greatly upset us as we had planned to go out for a celebratory meal and wanted to relax and get ready for the evening We couldn t actually get back into our room until after 5pm This was after we had a conversation with the hotel management and no attempt was made to give our room priority and we were still guests it was almost as if they had thought we had checked out Response was totally unsatisfactory and no real explanation given Struggled to get tea bags daily in our room plus the fact that there was no smoke alarm and paper cups provided for hot drinks totally unsuitable This left a sour taste and rather spoilt our special day We know mistakes do happen but what upset us most was that there was no sense of urgency in resolving our problem and we had to de camp to the lounge area for over an hour with a token gesture for two free drinks , Breakfast was good with a wide choice Location was good for Montmartre 
136500,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, A lighter breakfast e g only coffee and croisant was not an option Anyway the staff arranged it when we asked it , The outdoor terrace was very nice The environment beside the Montmartre cemetery was peaceful and the cemetery itself really beautiful Good connections with other neighborhoods e g a bus to the Opera where you can take a bus to the airport departed right next to the hotel 
136501,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Staff were rudish and unclear about the payment scheme also asked me to leave 100 deposit in card that would not be taken on departure told me it would be refunded So it had been taken and 24 hrs later I still haven t had it back Towels were dirty in room shower nozzle came off n my hand Room with view was not the case Bed ok but struggled to sleep in it in 2nd night Came home with back ache , The room was a nice size in a good location Water was hot 
136502,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The reception area of the hotel is very confusing There is no sign to indicate what area of the reception desk is for check in or check out There is not a clear queuing system and other guests just walk in and get served before those that have been waiting in line We had to wait over 25 minutes before being attended to This would have been longer had a member of staff not decided to call us over to check us in before a guest who had just walked in off the street I mentioned this poor queuing system to the reception staff and they acknowledged this was an ongoing issue , Reception staff were extremely welcoming and helpful
136503,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The double king was two beds put together badly we had a room mix up and the TV broke but staff were quick to fix the issues , Staff were great good room size and relatively modern for a Paris hotel
136504,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The breakfast was a little expensive for our budget but we enjoyed to food from the Turkish place opposite , Being close to many take away and sit down cafes and restaurants we did not have breakfast or evening meal in this well appointed hotel We enjoyed the benefits of the area The room was for us luxurious and the bed was great Facilities were also excellent 
136505,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, No light at desk under the TV Was a bit dark to work there on my PC I moved the coffee machine over to the table at the TV and worked on my PC where the coffee machine was located This desk has a light , Near metro Friendly staff Proper coffee machine in room 
136506,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, This is a modern property It is Paris but could be anywhere Not a negative just a matter of preference, The rooms were large for Paris and at a reasonable price We had a good view from our window and walked a long block past the Moulin Rouge to the metro with no problem It was a good place for a comfortable nights sleep with friendly front desk staff Big bed and modern bath Elevator fit people and luggage Small refrigerator water heater with tea and coffee 
136507,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Add conditioner to the bathrooms I am use to have hair products in the bathrooms Only having shampoo through me off guard and I had to go and buy my own If I knew I would have brought my own Rand vs the Euro Not so great and I have never bought such expensive conditioner in my life , Breakfast was great nice comfortable beds friendly staff 
136508,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Our coffee machine was broken and not replaced But that was only a small problem , This is a most wonderful hotel in the most wonderful location Sacre Coeur in Walking Distance the buzzing life of Montmartre in front of your doorstep The hotel is chic clean friendly very esay going and has a beautiful bar to relax in The staff behave as if it s a joy to work there and to serve us We had a fantastic view over Paris including the Eiffel Tower our room was spacious and perfectly equipped This was our second stay at the Mercure we are already planning the third 
136509,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The food menu with Could have been more diverse , The rooms were very cosy and the staff were very friendly Found my stay very very welcoming and would recommend to anyone I ve stayed at 2 different Mercure hotels now and on both occasions been very satisfied 
136510,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Paper cups for beverage No breakfast tea Only two small pots of milk English cinema channel showed French films in the evening so no tv entertainment when we came in at the end of the day,No Positive
136511,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Nothing to add here, The property was fantastic Staff very accommodating and quick to resolve guests issues Great bar and lounge area and again helpful and welcoming staff The location was easy to access and close to all tour bus stops and the fabulous Moulin Rouge 
136512,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The bed in our first room was thin and rock hard Our first two nights we slept very badly I reluctantly complained and the customer service was excellent upgrading us to a nicer room for our final night However despite the beautiful room the mattress was pretty much the same and still very hard and uncomfortable A shame really as the hotel itself is awesome , Great location and easy walking distance to the metro Great views from the upgraded rooms 
136513,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Room was cold with heating on one water bottle for a double room To top it off the staff were extremely rude and not friendly to new tourists They did not show any desire to help us and worst of all spoke in French to each other about us and laughed Making it quite clear they were speaking about us I did not find this friendly or welcoming as someone visiting the city , Besides the location with its close proximity to attractions and underground there wasn t much else to like 
136514,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Would have liked that the hotel included the breakfast it was somewhat expensive , Beautiful hotel with great location It was really close to the Moulin Rouge where you can take the tour buses Had nice places to eat next to it and souvenirs stores

136518,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Some broken bits that would have been easy to fix e g broken toilet roll holder and panel of the bath hanging off a little bit big greasy handprint on the wall Which was a shame because it would be so easy to fix but it did ruin the impression a little , Friendly staff really nice and clean hotel in an amazing location right around the corner from the moulin rouge and subway stations place de clichy Really clean relaxing hotel to come back to after a day of walking around paris the bed was really comfortable 
136519,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Breakfast was the same every day at least some changes could be made now and then No vegetables for breakfast But there were fresh juice and fruits still , We were offered a nice room with a view to the Eiffel Tower which was a gift a privileged room It was clean enough but less than expected from a 4 star hotel The bed was comfortable and the staff polite 
136520,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Hotel overheated Bed not comfortable too hard Breakfast low quality scrambled eggs had a green tinge and smelt off bacon greasy congealed scraps Dining room furniture shabby and carpet old and dirty Staff hard pressed and some seemed unhappy with their jobs I do not like the way French chain hotels vary their tariff almost daily Creates a sense of exploitation We stayed a total of 5 consecutive days adding 2 days to an initial booking of 3 Yet the posted price changed to a lower price on our 2nd additional day after we had booked and payed in advance at the higher price These sorts of price games are Not Fair , Location Staff helpful and responded positively to problems with bed giving free upgrade to better room 
136521,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, if you are travelling with children you may wish to know that the Moulin rouge pigalle is just around the corner and that it is a sex shop district with lots of gadgets etc on full display , location was great hotel a stones throw from place de clichy metro quietness of room Room great size with great facilities garden terrace in hotel near local shops brilliant transport links near metro 2 place de clichy great for the airport and metro 12 pigalle 10 minutes walk for place de concorde etc

136525,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, On arrival I asked to have my stay extended by a day and the receptionist said that had been organised I was then thrown out of the hotel a day early as the booking had not been made There was no offer of help for me to find alternative accomadation ,No Positive
136526,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, I opted out of the breakfast It is very expensive and outside there are several caf s where you can grab something cheaper, The rooms were very clean The decoration is good and in general maintenance is great The hotel has a great service for printing The location is good it has very quick access to two very well connected subway lines
136527,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur,No Negative, The hotel is situated in a very good area you ll find arround plenty of caffes and restaurants and the Moulin Rouge 5 minutes walk from the metro station It is very quiet the room we had was spacious enough great value for money 
136528,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The toilet made you feel like you were sitting in a cupboard and then have to go to the bathroom to wash your hands The bath was very small I m slim so not a problem for me but not too good for larger clients , Large comfortable bed with nice bedding 
136529,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Very little to say here , Hotel was very clean and in a very good location for all sights etc We had the breakfast option and that was a very good start to the day 
136530,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The staff was horrible Unprofessional Unsympathetic Unkind Unpolished Unaware We myself and my group of 5 clients booked our rooms on booking com when the rate was better than the rates for existing reservations made directly through the hotel I booked with booking com and canceled the other At arrival the staff said there were no reservations and refused to look for the booking com reservations They would not allow my travel clients to check in after several hours of flight from the U S and were very rude to them The staff even gave my clients an e mail my office sent them which should have been internal information that should not have been forwarded to any client This email clearly outlined the reservation that were canceled It had the reservation numbers as well The staff didn t bother to look for the valid reservations and showed no care about the plight my clients faced especially since I was delayed All they had to do was take a few extra minutes to look in their system My flight was delayed but I had a layover in Istanbul I called and spoke with the front desk staff Gave them the confirmation numbers given by booking com but the staff refused to listen I had to speak with several people incur high phone charges and even raise my voice to force someone to listen to me My client placed me on the phone with receptionist She again reiterated the reservations were canceled I advised her of the valid confirmation number She ignored me repeatedly simply repeating the reservations were canceled I had to literally raise my voice to force her to look up the confirmation number She then said oh I found it But this was after she continued to be rude and unprofessional forcing me in desperation to raise my voice with her It was very frustrating and my clients were very effected by the lack of professionalism and empathy they were shown Each day was an issue , The facility is very nice The rooms were great and the proximity to the metro was great as well 
136531,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Nothing really it fulfilled our needs , My wife s second visit to Paris First in 1981 This was my first So The Mercure was an inclusion to the whole trip about Paris It was important that the positive nature of Mercure added to the overall satisfaction and yes it did WE loved the high position of our room seeing over the rooftops of Paris Well insulated for sound and roomy 
136532,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, For how much the room cost I would say the rooms are quite basic We had to put out our own pillows there were no complimentary snacks or toiletries and the windows were quite small , The hotel is in a great location really close to Montmartre The staff are friendly and the rooftop bar is great for a night cap 
136533,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, There were no room slippers, The location was very near to a tube station it was really convenient to travel The staffs were friendly helpful 
136534,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The rooms were not very soundproofed you could hear everything that was going on in the hallway and room next door although I didn t hear any outside noise The only toiletries provided was a bar of soap and a combined shower gel shampoo which was a bit disappointing , The location was excellent easy walk to the metro as well as the streets of Montmartre and the rooftop terrace was a nice place to sit an have a drink The staff at reception were friendly and efficient 
136535,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur,No Negative, Wonderful Great location super friendly and efficient staff with comfortable rooms Near by secure car park was a bonus This will be my hotel of choice in Paris going forward

136540,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur,No Negative, Located in a lovely area with plenty of cafes and places to eat close to a well connected subway station and we also had a nice walk up to sacre coeur from the hotel We re allowed to check in 30 minutes early as this is when we arrived and hotel held our luggage for us on our last day until our Eurostar which gave us a full extra day to explore without having to carry luggage around Paris
136541,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Didn t feel safe in that area too many sketchy people at night Not like the Latin Quarter The rooms were outdated The carpet was terrible looking I thought the pattern by window was a bleach stain until I saw my daughters room was the same The glass door in front of sink was gone in our room We had to get 2 rooms for the 4 of us Remember if you call a cab to airport they start charging as they drive to you We paid 94 , Lovely looking lobby Helpful staff Walked to Sacre Coeur in the morning for view Close to subway 
136542,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The service at the bar was a little disappointing sitting outside for a few minutes until realising that we wouldn t get service unless we went to the bar one evening I went for a glass of red and the bar tender was glued to the TV when I then asked him about the wine he shrugged and said he didn t know anything about the wine he serves Really , The location was great for us we didn t want to be surrounded by the busy tourist hotspots so staying here was ideal 
136543,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Would have liked real shampoo and not bodywash Toilet room was a smoking room for someone Staff were not very friendly welcoming when coming and going Would have liked a lighter comforter for the summer months , Liked the bathrobes safe free drinks bed Liked the apples in the lobby

136549,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The cleaner barging in at 9am without knocking And then again at 11pm yelling at me checkout was a wonderful 12 noon Don t know what the problem was with het, Great clean good location
136550,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Arrived to find the room we booked was not available Needed 2 adjacent rooms given we had 2 adults and 2 children Hotel staff sent us to 2 different rooms that weren t adjacent and then finally the 3rd try was a success This took over an hour and everyone was really tired and frustrated No apology for the hassle from the hotel After asking if we could get a complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience there was little interest in anything of that kind Beds were uncomfortable Rooms were not serviced we were there for 2 nights Got a refill on the minibar water and soda only upon request Correct price was not captured at checkout Overall not a good experience I m sure under the right circumstances this could have been a good experience and staff going the extra mile to make us happy with our choice would have made the world of difference but they made no such attempts We certainly won t be coming back , Good location Trendy looking hotel
136551,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Hotel Location Neighborhood is not very clean sometimes feels unsafe at night Rooms made for 2 people does not comfortably sleep 3 people , Very Clean Modern Room Decor and Amenities Comfortable Sofa Bed

136555,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The maids didn t clean the room well each day leaving rubbish bins full and pillows or towels on the floor When we called room service twice we were told we had to go from the 7th floor to the first to collect our order ourselves We were told we were not allowed to have larger glasses for drinking water as they were for the bar but if we wanted to order room service i e coke or a cocktail they could provide the larger glass Once leaving we requested a taxi be called We then got it the taxi outside the hotel only to have another taxi block us of and abuse our current driver to which hotel staff then joined the argument over the fare rather than resolving the issue The pillows and towels where also very small and the toilet very cramped and without and exhaust fan The air conditioning in the room also did not work well resulting in hot and smelly nights Very dissatisfied customers We stayed for both business and leisure , The bed was comfortable

136571,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The gym is a bit small and has no mats The breakfast was very disappointing and not worth the money There is a large variety of food but it is based on bread and the bread is the same quality as what you d buy at an American supermarket which is just a shame as there are a number of fine bakeries in the area , The staff were really helpful and kind The location was great The room was clean and comfortable There s a delicious restaurant across the street Le Grand Phenicien
136572,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The bedrooms overall were spacious and comfortable This was our second time staying in 3 years and I did notice that there was a bad smell coming from the drains in the bathroom and WC which was a bit off putting The bathroom suites and tiling could also do with upgrading within the room we stayed in to really put the hotel a step above others , The staff were very helpful and friendly and really put their best foot forward the hotel should be very proud of their efforts to ensure guests have a great visit to Paris and the hotel itself The hotel was modern and the public areas were lovely The location is perfect and very lively Paris is very accessible from the area 
136573,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, VERY unfortunate timing arrived on the morning of Friday 13th So very sad , The location was perfect close to the Sacre Coeur shops restaurants bars Moulin Rouge etc all within close walking distance Hotel staff were all very helpful and friendly 
136574,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Rather basic room bordering sterile with some noise from adjacent rooms There were no bathrobes and no shoehorn Wifi slightly erratic had to log in several times , Clean modern room not too small No noise from the street Decent beds 
136575,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Tiny room old dirty carpet cheap furniture poor cleaning if not absent no minibar choice all in one shampoo gel soap conditioner lotion hammered to the wall no toiletries like pictured on the website plastic cups and glasses in what universe is this a 4 hotel Insufficient breakfast choice not worth Eur 20 advertised choice of gluten free treats was in fact one kind of roll over baked from outside and gooey inside every morning , Excellent location close to underground within walking distance from points of interest Friendly staff Comfortable beds Quiet room Fitness facilities Good coffee in breakfast area 
136576,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Staff was confused about breakfast being included in the room rate which led to some hassle , Clean comfortable and a great breakfast Location was good for my needs but not in the heart of everything That makes it a better price than other comparable properties in fancier neighborhoods 
136577,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The coffee machine and iPod dock didn t work and the room was really hot even in the middle of November Would have preferred a kettle instead , Good view and location Clean and modern room comfortable bed Would stay again 
136578,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Probably just that the window didn t open wide enough , An excellent location close to Montmatre Place de Clichy and Pigalle Reasonable breakfast pleasant terrace and great views of Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe from our room The room was clean and well maintained and benefitted from a separate toilet We would happily return there 
136579,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The bar is dreadfully boring Pillows were hard , My husband and I stayed here for our 24th wedding anniversary Amazing location in Montmartre right next to the famous cemetery The staff is excellent they handled reservations and taxis cheerfully and efficiently Pay for the Prestige Room for a high floor and a view of the Eiffel Tower it s very romantic to watch it sparkle on the hour And right near the P de Clichy subway 
136580,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, On the morning of our departure we had three separate people knock on our door and come into our room , The position is fantastic The hotel has been renovated since we last stayed there and the room we stayed in was well designed and very comfortable And there was a fabulous view across Paris 
136581,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Too expensive for a tiny small room Only 1 complimentary bottle water for 4 days didn t get us refresh All in one body wash and shampoo No iron , Location Atmosphere 
136582,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, All good , The room was very comfortable The decor was fantastic and the bed was a great size The view was good you pay for what you get The proximity to Metro stations was very good 
136583,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, We were put in the overflow room for breakfast the first morning where everything seemed to be a lower quality tinned fruit not fresh paper cups not china no cutlery initially fewer selection of breads no nespresso coffee machine very disappointing especially as that morning was our first wedding anniversary morning The key cards to the room only ever worked twice and had to be therefore constantly reset Was slightly disappointed at paper cups in bedrooms for hot drinks especially in a privilege room , Our view was lovely 
136584,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Indifferent attitude of reception staff Room not serviced until late afternoon on two occasions reception s attitude was not our fault Breakfast not worth the charge made better value available outside , Good location excellent for transport links by Metro or Bus Good choice of restaurants nearby 
136585,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Only one reception staff To ask a simply question we had to wait for 15 mins until 3 guests had cleared their payments All we wanted to know was the direction to the nearest Hop Hop Off Station Suggestion Have a Frequently asked questions with answers list in all Guest Rooms so that Guests will not have to interrupt the the Receptionist cum Cashier cum Guest Relations Officer all in one person , Easy access to the Hop On Hop Off Coaches
136586,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Mentioned to front desk that the thermostat control for air circulation heating and cooling wasn t working so they brought up a fan to correct the situation Good thing it wasn t hot out Make sure you check out everything in the room upon check in to confirm working condition Hotel s breakfast prices too high , Great location for walking Montmartre and metro station close Lots of bistros in area

136590,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, We found the outside bar area bait expensive , Our room was very comfortable clean with a lovely view of Paris the top of the Eiffel Tower 
136591,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, The bathroom shower was insufficient to cover its spray so floor was soaked and as the shower had a two way door therefore the steam from the shower filled up the room , Nice view room facilities really nice and modern design 
136592,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Staff was not helpful and actually seemed bothered when asked for assistance Had to call for extra pillows 4 times refrigerator froze up and standard answer was no one was available to fix Wanted to get ice since fridge did not work and was told to go to bar bartender was annoyed and just gave a cup full Did not replenish any toiletries in room floor was stained in many places etc , Location was fine linens were clean room was quiet

136602,Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacr Coeur, Lot of overdressed staff flouncing about but didn t really know the area unable or unwilling to give directions Not the most helpful Parking advertised but turns out to be a public garage vastly overpriced around 25 euros a day Rooftop balcony listed but on 1st floor Bad for taking photos, Hotel was convenient for our visit Close by Metro near lots of eating places
