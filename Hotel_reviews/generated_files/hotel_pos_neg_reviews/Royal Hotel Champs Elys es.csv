151206,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Room to small The bathroom was not spacious enough The design of the room was not appropriate They did not provide coffee and tea even cattel Was so poor, The location
151207,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, The shower didn t really work the hallways were slightly claustrophobic the area around the hotel was kind of shady but a lot of Paris is, The hotel was old and quaint a great place to rest your head in Paris Close to the metro and Arc de Triumph Would stay here again for sure
151208,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, TV didn t work the first two nights Was very sporadic , Location location location Better than expected room size 605 Bathroom facilities were more spacious and with better amenities than expected 
151209,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Metro movement below the hotel Internet was getting interruptions too much The coach bed was not comfortable Its price is higher than what should be comparing it to near by hotels ex Napoleon Hotel , The place and near by public transportations 
151210,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, I think it s a European thing but the bacon at breakfast was pretty close to raw and the scrambled eggs were runny Overall the 20 I paid for breakfast got me all the coffee I could drink some cut up apples and lots of bread I think it s overpriced They should offer free coffee at least , The hotel is about 2 blocks from the Arc de Triomphe Champs lysees tons of shopping metro and some great restaurants They had spare umbrellas for guests to use which came in handy when it started pouring rain 
151211,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Too dark room not so big But the staff is really nice Good location too , Rooms are a bit dark You can find similar rooms for half the price Nothing too special definitely not a 4 star Hotel more like a 3 
151212,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, TV and wifi did not work and took a day to get fixed Wifi very very poor and slowwhen working Old towels and very flimsy couch bed for the children, Location was good
151213,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, no comments we like everything, our stay at Royal Champs Elysees was the best choice at our journey the staff was magnificent they tried to go out of their way to please you it really made a difference in our stay at this hotel staff of the restaurant was magnificent we really enjoy our short stay there 
151214,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, We order a family room with 2 room But The second room is not appropriate The bed is ugly very uncomfortable to sleep with it , Location in the city center of Paris easy to travel to the whole city
151215,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Would be nice if they advertise photo rooms from this hotel , Hotel okay no tea coffee facilities Room completely different then photos on they website they don t even look close they very poorly decorated old furniture and very small room 
151216,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, The classic room is a very small room bed is queen size and also very small furniture of the room is cheap Wi Fi barely worked Tv had so many problems , Location of the hotel is excellent actually 2 min to the Champs 
151217,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, I just arrived at 12 30 but I could nt check in and they said it should be at 3 O clock exactly There was nothing superb but normal, Very good location nearby Champs Elysee and Arc de triomphe
151218,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, The hotel is dirty and furniture garbage old fashioned The service is not good at all The reception is very badly treated The prices are very expensive room, no thing
151219,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, The staff at breakfast were not as helpful as they could be We came down to breakfast at 8 30 it finished at 10 30 and everything was on on offer but as it got busy food ran out and you had to ask for food to be restocked replenished bacon croissants orange juice pancakes etc Which was done eventually but Only what you asked for which meant lots of empty plates therefore less choice for later guests , Very large room we stayed in the family room Big masiive and very comfortable 
151220,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Nothing I can think of , We just loved it The rooms were very roomy and lovely with an old world charm Our view was spectacular The people were all so helpful and lovely Someone in a review mentioned a wi fi issue we had no problem We will most definitely be back 
151221,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, There was no extractor fan in the bathroom so it became steamed up quickly , The location is fantastic The rate we got was very reasonable The staff couldn t have been more helpful 
151222,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Very good overall Just one feedback When we called and reported that housekeeping forgot to give us coffee we were given the following day with more packs but just left it scattered all over our table Oir complimentary shampoo bottles and tissue box were also left scattered and was not arranged as usual Not sure if it was connected to our complaining that cleaning lady forgot to supply us coffee , Family room was very comfortable for 4 adults Location excellent Generous complimentary coffee and tea Bathroom nice and spacious Clean 
151223,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, No computers available I had to move room because I checked in and Wi Fi was not working and later TV also I had to move rooms and the new one was quite old as was the last floor , Great location I had problems and I had to move room but they gave me an up grade 
151224,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Bathroom has no standing shower cabint but bathtube TV screen is small should be larger the floor is carpted and better to be wodden , The location is excellent view of frideland street from room size of the room was good bed is wide and comfortable 
151225,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, A policy to charge extra s where they can Seems to me this is what the management wants to do A coke from the minibar 6 50 FREE Internet is very slow you can upgrade to normal speed at 8 p h or 15 p d Breakfast 19 per guest Even for Paris these are huge amounts for 3 star hotel Just a few changes and this hotel can be my returning choice for Paris , Easy to reach by underground 20 min from Gare du Nord Few minutes from Arc de Triomphe Check in went quick as I arrived late but as there is only one receptionist check out took long So be aware if you are in a hurry 
151226,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Some noise at night from trains under hotel not a huge issue but worth noting as some people may find it annoying Also restaurants and bars around hotel are quite expensive as you are on the champs Elyse Worth going a bit further out and finding greater value for money, Rooms very clean and staff very friendly Beds very comfortable and it s a nice small friendly hotel Location was very good close to the arc de triomphe and excellent links to transport with the train and metro station very close to the hotel meaning getting around the city was very easy Very easy to get train from airport with only one change 
151227,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Most of the reception staff weren t that friendly rooms in the sixth floor most of them they have split bathtubs than the toilet We had to ask twice to change the room and they kept saying that we are fully booked and they didn t change it until we told them that the next guest was really noisy and we weren t able to sleep they changed the room and it was the same in regard to the bathroom rooms aren t soundproof you can hear even the housekeepers chatting early morning by the door of the room We removed everything from the mini bar but they kept filling the fridge which is not nice that they were checking the fridge though we notified them that we ve removed everything and placed them on the drawer, The location
151228,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Rooms were just too small Once suitcase was in couldn t move anywhere in the room Bathroom was separated from the shower and overall size was just not practical, Staff was very friendly and helpful
151229,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Nothing to dislike unless you were looking for a free bottle of champagne , Excellent location from where we could walk to the Arc de Triomphe Champs Elysees and access metro RER buses etc without much walking Bed was very comfortable and room was ideal for our needs Staff were very helpful and responded to all our needs 
151230,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Every things as wifi was very low and you must pay To incearse to higher speed and the room was too small So you can leave your bags outside , Just location
151231,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, There wet steps leading up to the lift so might be an issue for people with trouble climbing stairs , We stayed in a one bedroom suite The location is a huge plus it is close to champs elysees and everything is a train away Rooms were spacious and clean 
151232,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, TV remote control didn t function properly Room was not always cleaned properly one day we did not get toilet paper for 2 days we did not receive the complimentary coffee in the room , The choice and quality was very good
151233,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Room is a bit old but for me it is compensated by its size Tablet in the elevator had veeery irrelevent data Showed rainy weather forecast with 8 while it was almost 35 outside D, Although the hotel doesn t look new it is comfortable and nice Both room and bathroom sizes surprised usually rooms in Paris are smaller Location is perfect close to metro Arc and Champs Elysees There are places around to have breakfast if you don t want to take it in hotel Both check in and check out were quick 
151234,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, When I was looking at hotels in Paris I knew my husband and I would be getting in at 9am after flying from the U S So we would be jet lagged But it was our anniversary so I wanted to make it special I paid extra at least 50 to have a room with a view and a tub Arriving to the hotel I thought we must be in the wrong place because this hotel couldn t possibly have a view They later said a few rooms did but I don t see how They did upgrade us by giving us a huge room with an awkwardly attached living room and second bath that didn t flush space we absolutely didn t need When I asked why we didn t get a room with a view the desk manager seemed confused why I would care but the entire reason we booked this hotel was to enjoy champaign in the comfort of our room while enjoying the view The worst part of it all was they offered free breakfast the next morning we didn t make it to breakfast but at checkout they tried to charge me From my research you can get a much nicer hotel with better amentities for much cheaper Don t splurge on the view as I did you will be disappointed , The hotel was in a great location to see the city The bathroom was newly renovated and nice but the sink didn t drain and there wasn t a tub which was guaranteed in the reservation the rest of the room was large The bed was ok nothing special The staff was very friendly 
151235,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, First room that we had we found bed bugs and the sheets appeared not to be washed properly unclean room We asked to be moved but they hotel could only fit us into a much much much smaller room It was tiny for 2 people with luggage For the amount of money paid we were expecting a lot more Staff were efficient and did their job yet did not go out of their way to help not provided with a tourist map no friendly chat just gave us our room key and sent us on our way Overall seemed like a dated hotel that was a bit tired , Great breakfast buffet breakfast staff were very kind and friendly and really made our breakfast experience positive We got breakfast included due to having to move to a smaller room normally I would not have paid for it very expensive 
151236,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Nothing is good very bad smell not good food poor amount of food bad smell in rooms, Nothing is good very bad smell not good food poor amount of food bad smell in rooms
151237,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, if you no that you are staying in 1 star hotel it ok you will not cara about any thing but if you are in 4 star hotel and its bad staff and hotel like this you have to really be mad and you can t meet thr maneger , Nothing
151238,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, WIFI The worst WIFI we ever had on our 6weeks European tour They want to charge you 15euro N for high speed internet Not disclosing it on time of booking is very deceiving Otherwise You have ZERO internet at all One more thing that really surprises me the hotel doesn t have a CART to carry your luggage to your room If you have a lot of luggage you need to keep going up and down quite a few times The room is not really cleaned especially the toilet bowl I end up cleaning it by myself which is actually disgusting Thank Goodness I brought my own LYSOL , Location is really at the heart of Paris Our room is huge with a little view of the Arche
151239,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Breakfast is a bit pricey Compact bathroom though it did have a bath shower , Good location only a short walk to the Arc de Triomphe and Champs lys es Comfortable bed Friendly staff Reasonable breakfast 
151240,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Having to leave , The size of the room along with balcony with magnificent view makes this a first consider hotel in this part of Paris Excellent facilities including three wardrobes bar fridge and comfortable large bed Helpful and attentive staff Highly recommend this hotel 
151241,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, We had no problems at all and were very happy with our decision, Room was large in comparison to most Paris hotel rooms and the staff were very helpful It was convenient to be so close to the Champs Elysees and public transport 
151242,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Bedroom was extremely small literally just a bed and desk and not much room Stuffy room no ventilation from bathroom Got the room changed on second day there but nothing fancy Have paid similar amounts in other hotels that are fancier When arrived were not welcomed just asked to sign and given the key not told the lift needs the key to work or any information at all not even basics Toilet tissues are brown paper like and the towels didnt smell nice , Location was good
151243,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Extras were expensive Free Wi Fi was very slow although option to upgrade for EUR 15 0 a day avail Water from the room mini bar was eye watering at EUR 5 0 a bottle Given the EUR 300 price I paid per night felt these should have been included as they would be at the Intercontinental , Superb location close to the Arc de Triomfe 
151244,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Breakfast is a bit expensive but it is easy to get one in the many bakeries , We got a special price so the price quality ratio was optimal Very good location near Arce de Triomphe Rooms well isolated so no noise from the street 
151245,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Everything was good, Great location right next to the champs Elysees About a 10 cab to every other location including Eiffel tower and the Louvre Really friendly staff 
151246,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, The bed linen were disgusting in the first place After day 1 I accidentally spilled orangejuice on my bed in the morning and when i came back in the afternoon they flipped my bed linen and acted like the whole bed was changed Overall poor hygiene , The location was good 
151247,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, The hotel did not provide any food themselves and room service was from outside the hotel so that the food was not hot at all The mini bar was very poor with only two small bottles of water and two coca colas in it The provision of tea and coffee in the room was poor with very tiny cups and only one small packet of coffee and one small packet of decaf coffee , The room was pleasantly warm 
151248,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Our stay wasn t long enough , Excellent location very friendly staff lovely breakfast Melanie who was on at breakfast was extremely helpful telling us where different places were including the local market which we loved We were able to keep our bags at the hotel after checkout to save us dragging them around Paris 2 minutes walk from Champs Elysees Would definitely go back 
151249,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Not really that Royal for me tiny rooms a shower smaller than my trunk didnt stay for long so whatever But if you are in Paris you only sleep in the room anyway , Location and good service However that is expected from a 4 hotel with a Royal 
151250,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, When we booked we stated that we had a 16 year old with us when we arrived our extra bed was for an 5 year old when we first asked they said they didn t have one when I said she couldn t sleep on it they went and a got an adult one I asked for particular room after reading trip advisor and that it was my daughters 16 th birthday But they never read it so if you have any requirements prob best to email,No Positive
151251,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Perfect , Location location location Booked the room with 3beds it was very spacious comfortable and clean Very impressed with the view from my room had a view of a typical Parisian street surprisingly quiet with beautiful buildings across Staff was ever so friendly and accommodating always enthusiastically ready to help with a smile It was pure luck that i found this hotel will not stay anywhere else but here when in Paris until next time Merci beaucoup 
151252,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Room is not soundproof we could hear all the conversations of the next rooms mostly they don t respond to our request saying come down and get it there is nobody else attending the reception desk , The kindness of receptionist staff
151253,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, The room is too small to be a double room I asked for extra cover as I was very cold they didn t have extra cover , The location and the reception stuff
151254,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Not a bad experience as such but found the bathroom to be very small which was uncomfortable , I loved being so close to the Champs Elysees shopping and the Arc De Triomphe 
151255,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, We visited here with another couple and although we both booked a classic double room which in the booking description detailed in below picture had a bath we were placed in a room with a tiny shower and no bath the shower was so small that you bashed your elbow on the tap and brushed the shower door as you turned We complained to the reception who told us that there was two types of double rooms and the ones with the bath were all booked We could only get a bath if we paid for an upgrade we found the receptionist very rude and unhelpful I find this really outrageous as they advertise the room as with a bath In our opinion a double bed was shoved in a single box room and attempted to be passed as a double The whole room was tiny Our mini bar only had one soft drink when we arrived and they tried to charge us for the listed contents of the fridge when we checked out good location but disappointing room for the expensive price you pay for a supposed 4 star hotel We traveled many countries in Europe and this hotel was the worst , The good location
151256,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Housekeerping didn t change the bed linens the whole 6 nights we were there , The location was fabulous and the staff was very friendly and helpful 
151257,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, The walls of the rooms are very thin so you can hear those in the next door room but for a night its not a bit issue , Excellent location of shopping and sightseeing
151258,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Wifi service tv channels are limited need to pay for good service of wifi and more tv channels , Easy access to most of the location which I would like to go 
151259,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Staff was not welcoming informed upon Check in Wi Fi is 30 min low speed free 5 euros high speed for 30 min and 8 euros for 1 hour this is not only false advertising but absolute theft Hotel is a Day use Hotel , Location near Champs Elysees
151260,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Slight problem with electricity in room when we arrived and found hand towel covered in make up which was quickly replaced, Staff very attentive and helpful recommending places to eat Location was perfect close to metro and walking distance to Champs Elysees
151261,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Although we didn t hear any noise from the streets we did hear other guests talking Luckily for us they weren t too noisy guests , Excellent location rather spacious and comfortable room
151262,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es,No Negative, Easy location to metro and buses great view of the Arc from our room immaculately clean with a very friendly staff Room was large even with 4 people in it and so was bathroom Beds were so comfortable and hotel was so quiet Excellent hotel Would definitely stay here again 
151263,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, The shower could have been better The bed was quite hard Needed to borrow a mains adapter but a working one could not be located we had to buy one in the end , The location was great Great view Good proximity to the Metro Staff were friendly 
151264,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es,No Negative, Very close to Metro RER station walking distance to eateries and shopping street Fantastic housekeeper kept our room clean and tidy everyday 
151265,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Everything It was a shoebox Completely characterless I only stayed there because I went to Paris at last minute In a very very busy time The shower you couldn t even turn around in it it was a sad joke , That it was a room and it was s good kocation
151266,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, I was supposed to have a 3 15 am phone call to wake me It never came I asked the night before for a Regular paris Taxi to take me to the airport When I came down the driver was already there but he spent 10 minutes trying to figure out where the airport was When I got into the Taxi the meter was already set on 15 00 Euros It was 4 00 am and there was no traffic I was told the Taxi to Orlay airport was 40 00 45 00 euro It was 55 00 and the driver locked the doors until I paid No Taxi ever did that in the many times I traveled to Paris I will never forget that I do not trust the staff who calls a private driver and the driver doesn t know where a major airport is located Shame on him and shame on your staff I will not stay there again , Clean good value but not good guest relation services A woman staff member was wonderful but the man kept putting himself into our conservation when she was helping me 
151267,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, I guess what felt like a bait and switch The Executive Rooms offered on this website are not all the same Be aware if you book an Executive Room with a view of the Arc de Triomphe confirm with the hotel that you will actually get that room not room 105 on the first floor I did not get the room as advertised on this website or confirmed by Booking com and no other Executive Rooms with a view of the Arc were available at the time To the hotel s credit I was offered an Executive Room on the third floor but only for the second night it was Paris in the summertime after all I get it The staff was helpful in addressing the situation but unfortunately this still would not have had a view as advertised and it would have been inconvenient to change rooms mid stay My intention here is not to complain like a child or bash the hotel as I think it is in fact a nice hotel I just would prefer that they be a little more clear on what you are actually buying when you book through Booking com On a side note just be aware in general what you are buying from Booking com I think it s a good service but when you don t get what you paid for you ll get a response saying the hotel is responsible for their page and there is nothing we can do And the problem is that since you have already prepaid for the rooms there really is nothing that you can do either , Location is great Easily accessible to many attractions in Paris 
151268,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, price should be fixed in pounds Stirling not changed after the booking it may be in the terms agreed but changing the price afterwards leaves a very bad taste of suspicion, staff in Parisian hotels and restaurants are not known for their welcome or helpfulness the staff at the Royal Hotel were professional and very helpful they worked as a team that was clearly evident and the results showed
151269,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Confusing experience with the breakfast thought it was included but turned out it was not Amazing food and great service though so it was worth the extra money in the end just be prepared to pay for breakfast when leaving , Amazing location literally steps from the L Arc de Triomphe and the Champs lys es Metro stop right outside the doors and many great restaurant choices nearby Great staff beautiful rooms Will stay there again for sure 
151270,Royal Hotel Champs Elys es, Room was incredibly average and the bathroom was tiny Not like the images on the website The view from my room was of a concrete wall Unappealing , Location was great Literally a two minute walk to the arc de triumph and avenue de champs lys es
