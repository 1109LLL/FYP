453898,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, Everything was excellent , Very comfortable room clean quiet very friendly and polite staff close to the city center and next to a metro and train station I highly recommend this property 
453899,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, Definitely the security We stayed here for one night and my boyfriend s backpack was robbed from our room while we were sleeping Very early in the morning we noticed that the door was opened and we called reception When the guy from the front desk came upstairs he found the backpack in our corridor left on the floor without some valuable belongings his Laptop Apple Macbook Pro and his RetroCamera Fujifilm X100T When the police came they checked the door and the lock was not violated Therefore it looks like we did not lock the door properly when we arrived And it was easy for the thief to come and take the backpack that we left close to the door But how surprised we were that there were not any security camera on the floor to follow this robbery incident The hotel has them on the ground floor and according to the guy at the from desk he did not see anyone leaving the building between midnight and 6 00 am of the day of the robbery Anyway we realized there is no way to follow this case since in this hotel BTW is a large hotel chain they do not have security cameras in that floor We feel really disappointed and since it seems that guests are not covered by hotel s liability in this type of incidents I consider highly important to share our experience to prevent future robbery incidents I am sure the thief knew about these security holes and that the risk of being caught is almost nule I recommend that if you choose to stay at this place double check that you close properly the door since is the only security they offer , If you are traveling by train the location is very convenient The room is tidy and clean 
453900,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, Do not use this hotel if you are in a long or high vehicle the turning space for the underground car park won t allow you in On Street car parking would have been OK if the blond woman across the street did not insist on leaving 3 4 car length of gap each end of her car Had to check out 2 days early after spending 4 hours looking for a space , Bed comfy rooms very spacious Helpful English speaking staff 
453901,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Close to main train station and underground station Easy to go around Vienna Good place to stay Close to a big mall with easy have good food and things to enjoy 
453902,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, None, Great location 2 minutes to the main train station excellent facilities and most important very friendly and professional staff in the front desk who are really good 
453903,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, The only issue was that my room was a little cold and I couldn t figure out how to adjust the temperature , I was in transit to Venice and only stayed there overnight The place is spotless modern and about a three minute walk from the main train station My only regret is that I couldn t stay longer 
453904,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna,No Negative, The room was very clean and towels were changed everyday No need to wear shoes in the room as it has a comfortable carpet The wifi connection was perfect 
453905,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, There has been a miscommunication between booking and the hotel because we ended up with 3 rooms instead of 4 and the beds were not separated like I had asked they were all queen beds except for the extra beds that weRe added to the rooms by the staff an hour after we arrived, Excellent staff
453906,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, It was all good, The Hotel was located very close to the main rail station and access to public transport was excellent We liked the newly refurbished room It was clean and comfortable The air conditioning worked very well as it was hot during our stay The bed was extremely comfortable The staff could have been more friendly but apart from that we had an excellent stay and would definitely recommend this hotel 
453907,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, Water in the bathroom is sometimes cold and sometimes hot a bit difficult to adjust the temperature There is only a bottle of water everytime you check in no matter how many days you booked , near to the train station and there is a large supermarket in the train station The tram station is nearby too very convenient 
453908,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, We wanted a coffee in the morning but they told us the bar was closed and we have coffee at breakfast area Sad to say it was instant coffee , All was great hotel very clean and recently renovated We had rooms at 7th floor with balcony We enjoyed the rich breakfast Rooms very nice decorated and spacious Good wi fi parking was possible at the hotel s underground garaje I stayed here before when it was Delta but it is more beautiful now as Azimut I recommemd this hotel Location was great you have three metro stops to Stephanplatz via U1 
453909,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, No Kettle in the room Only one power socket near the desk Coffee point in the corridor meant you had to be fully dressed to have a cup of tea , Cleanliness
453910,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna,No Negative, The location is near the Wien Hbf where are SPAR and small shops for foods and water The staffs are friendly and helpful The room is clean and comfortable 
453911,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna,No Negative, The hotel just state in front of the main train station very easy to go to the train station if you have many luggages There is few restaurant at the back of the hotel and some shopping center if you would like to buy some things The hotel reception is very helpful and super nice I must thanks for her super support me Shame I forgot to ask her name but she is Bulgarian lady and I hope her manager should be pound to have her in the team 
453912,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, I was given a room on the 6th floor and there was a strong smell of painting in the corridors and in the room was the same I felt almost sick Do they know that breathing solvent paint fumes for too long can cause headaches dizziness and nausea And corridors and rooms are not ventilated So I was told that they are renovating This was not mentioned anywhere at the time of the booking made on bookings com Hotels should inform guests of renovation works before the booking I would have not booked this hotel if i knew it However I was moved to the 4th floor which was ok TV s are completely looked All tv remote control functions are locked TV plugs for your USB and HDMI are looked Only 2 English channels CNN and BBC Basically nothing to watch on tv for a foregneir No minibar in the room No room service No restaurant When the guests close the room doors the walls where you lie with your head are shaking Check in at 3pm And check out at 11am Inconvenient hours And we lost 4 hours of our stay How can this hotel be a 4 Receptionists were amazing very nice polite and smiling That s nice for a change , The staff
453913,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, Was in process of renovation during my visit April 2017 Noisy smell of stain breakfast in the lobby Hopefully would be better after the renovation , Very close to HBF good for train trips 
453914,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, staff speak very bad english I missed hot water heater in our room Breakfast is very expensive for what you get , very clean every day fresh towels great location 
453915,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, Staff is not trained to give you any information about city tours and they do not sell any tickets, Just a four minutes walk away from the train station and the City tour bus stop you do not need taxi for that distance
453916,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, I checked out from this hotel last Feb 24 and i couldn t believe they charged me not once not twice but thrice The lady at the reception who checked us in seemed apologetic because she knew I was charged twice and I accepted since it can happen Upon checking out the new lady doesn t even care if my bank texted me about the charges FYI I receive text everytime I purchase something and she literally said I do not care about your bank Since I am catching a flight back home I ended up paying AGAIN I emailed the hotel since I left and no response until now , Location
453917,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, Our room had a view to train station when window is opened it was little noisy but with closed windows it s a lot better , Breakfast was really good a lot of choice and good coffee Wifi is also really good in all areas of the hotel Hotel garage easy accessible and not expensive Location is great metro and tram are 3 4min walk 
453918,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, I preferred a non smoking room but it was not available However the shift manager offered to move me to a non smoking room the next day I was very pleased with the staff s friendly attitude which can be an example for other hotels , Convenient location large rooms very friendly staff good quality for the money 
453919,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, Could use a bit more variety in the breakfast Gets a bit dull after the 2nd day Too few hot items and too little selection of yogurt and cereal Glasses were dirty frequently Could use a mini fridge in the room Need to have a steaming iron in my room Awkward and super inconvenient to have to go to the maid s closet to use it At least they should have one they can take to your room Ugh , Was nice to have hot milk for my coffee 
453920,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, The carpet in the rooms was not very clean They did not have a dinner option only non vegeteration sandwiches or ordering option you would have to call a restaurant yourself which is not easy for non German speakers without local telephone numbers for people arriving late in the evening , The beds were clean the rooms well warmed up 
453921,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, Pillows were not the best quality and there were only two in the room one per person I am sure they would provide another if needed or asked but I was too tired to ask , Staff was extremely friendly hotel was meticulously clean breakfast was good location was exceptional to the train station 
453922,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, Vending Machine at the lobby didn t drop my M M pack D Nothing else , Breakfast very close to train station Clean room Efficient staff Locker room free of cost Fast Wifi 
453923,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna,No Negative, We travelled by Autozug from Dusseldorf Azimut was in excellent location near station with secure parking for us to leave our car before onward journey to Carinthia 
453924,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, The staff were really good but could have been more warm friendly It is the German way they appear very abrupt but I don t think they mean it Could have shown an interest in their guests fur example , Fabulous 
453925,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, No Tea Coffee facilities in the room No instructions in room for English TV programmes , Great Location to train station underground giving access to virtually all of Vienna Clean spacious rooms 
453926,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, Can be a little noisy from traffic if you leave the windows open , This hotel is very close to the Wein HBF and ideally situated It is perfect for the train traveller and very price competitive Provides a very good breakfast and is very confortable
453927,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, The carpet was a bit faded Yes that s the only thing I could possibly complain if I badly wanted to find something to complain about In reality nothing to complain about , The noise insulation of the window is extraordinary It does its duty very very well and it s needed because the hotel looks down on a busy street The wifi is extremely fast I measured 45 mbit down The location is superb a few steps from the Hauptbahnhof Tip there are cheap trains not the expensive CAT going there from the airport
453928,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, An addition of fridge and water heater plus tea and coffee package seems appropriate for a four star We heard that the breakfast is amazing but feels that 11 euro per person is too much so we opt out , Helpful staff we got an early check in since there is a room available The location is great Wien Hbf is only 1 2 minutes away by foot The room is comfy with AC and a spacious bathroom Wifi works well 
453929,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, The room had nothing but a hair dryer and a TV No fridge minibar iron press Might have been available per request but not in the room Not really worth 80e a night Ive been in better hotels in Vienna for less , Location is great Just opposite the main station Clean 
453930,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, CCTV s are totally needed at the front entrance because we ve nearly been robbed while waiting for the keys to open the garage Not very clear and inconvenient parking system , Nice members of staff and convenient location near highway and the train station 
453931,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, Food good staff were either too busy or not around to take our room number on both days We stood there waiting until we have up and just found a table ourselves ,No Positive
453932,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna,No Negative, We were just staying one night as we needed to catch an early morning train from the station which is directly across the road a 2 minute walk so the location was perfect for us Good but basic accommodation
453933,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna,No Negative, convinient location when travelling through Hauptbahnhof in walking distance to historic military museum and beldevere a few stops from Stephansdom etc with the u bahn 
453934,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, Cannot say any negative thing , We needed a one night stay in Vienna close to the Main train station The hotel was very close to the station The room was quiet the staff was helpful The hotel is also within walking distance to the Belvedere
453935,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, Ambience could have been better Need more responsive staff The triple bed room was very short on space It was a double room with an extra bed adjusted instead of seating area so no seating , The hotel is more fit for a short business trip It does not offer ambience for a leisure trip with family 
453936,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, It is not a high grade hotel as you can guess But no complaint You could stay a hotel inside the town if you do not like to take metro tram but it might be much more expensive with the same grade one , Overall value for money the location is excellent No comment about the breakfast as I haven t had breakfast in the hotel the Spa supermarket the Central station for anything you like to eat is just around the corner 
453937,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, Speaking as a tourist I don t like the Favoriten Vienna district , the structure is just few meters away from the new Main Station where we arrived and left the day after 
453938,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, The pillow is not comfortable the staff not very friendly The room only provide 1 0 5l bottle of water when there is 2 of us we need to request it at the reception counter because the whole building s phone is out of order , Cleanliness near to the main train station which is just 5mins away 
453939,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, The staff have serious case of bad attitude My friend and I stayed 2 nights at this hotel and on the second day when we came back to our room her money was stolen from her wallet that was stashed deep inside her backpack We found out from the room access log that the only people who went into our room were the manager on night shift and the housemaid yet we got no apology whatsoever from the manager whose card was used to access our room He kept saying that his card was probably stolen or copied by someone else and the other hotel staff on duty defended the housemaid saying that the person had been working with the hotel for more than 10 years They used very accusory tone when they said that we shouldn t have left our stuff in the room They should at lease apologize for what happened right in their hotel which was clearly committed by their own people So the worst part about this hotel is its staff who are inconsiderate dishonest and not helpful by any standards , It s very close to the main station 
453940,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Perfect to visit Viena and also to get to Austria center Viena because of being very close to the hauptbanhof with access to the U1 Great wifi fast and free no interruptions 
453941,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Evangelo helped us to exchange our 500e to small money More than my expectancy to get such a service from the hotel staff No need to worry to reach everywhere in the city or going to the airport 1 min to train station 1 min to supermarket Everything is easy 
453942,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, No fridge or mini bar in the room which is strange for a 4 star hotel Would delete one star for that , Nice and clean room Hotel located on a quiet street ca 200 metres from the Main Train station not far from shopping and a few good restaurants Staff ok but could improve Very good value for money 90 for 2 nights 
453943,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, Breakfast was mediocre and staff were overworked as it was New Years time when we visited Can improve their selection and service , Decent room with good heating and hot water Bed was comfy and staff was super helpful
453944,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, Slightly far from city centre but with good connections tram metro Breakfast not included 11 , Location is perfect if you re taking an early train from main station also very easy to find Direct train from airport Good wifi 
453945,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, The room was without refrigirator mini bar , Location was excelent just 5min walking from Hauptbahnhof It had everything we needed Would go there again 
453946,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna,No Negative, When you get off the bus train you can easily come across with this building The room was very clean and the staff were friendly Actually I didn t spent lots of time in the building it s a perfect place for reach to transportation but for the sightseeing it s little bit far to reach 
453947,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, Nothing, All available materials are up to average Most of all staff s service is the best in the Wien I have problems because my trip period is in Christmas holidays that almost restaurants are closed But staff called to about 10 restaurants and finally found it So I can have a meal Thank you very much
453948,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, This is not a 4 star hotel In the room there is nothing extra no boiler no cooler Carpets in my room were old and dirty It is cheap hotel near city center Do not expect much Hotels personnel told me that theirs parking place is full and I had to wonder for half an hour to find any parking space in the city if you are coming with a car be careful , WiFi is working fine two elevators so I had never to wait good localization

453951,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, The hotel offerings are minimalistic and the the hotel atmosphere is neutral It does not correspond to what you would expect of a 4 stars hotel Breakfast was seriously improved during our last two days , The staff was very nice
453952,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, there was no black tea at the breakfast at the last two days The coffee was always cold , I liked the efficiency of the staff at the reception I also liked the food at the breakfast 
453953,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, Breakfast quality was horribly cheap selection small breakfast staff unattentive and loud in clearing tables refills only on request Was included in my booking fare but definitely not worth 13 EUR when booked optionally on site , Location room free WiFi in room working well
453954,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, I asked to the recepcionist an extra blanket at night and the guy said that they did not have and only in the morning but inside the room it is written that if you need any thing like extra pillow or anything else it was just to call the reception but in my case at night did not work , The hotel is very close to the train station the breakfast is good the room is confortable and with a good size 
453955,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, I used my Visa card and booking com to reserve my room First booking com freezed my account for total amount of payment 204 euro Then I payed with the same visa card the total amount of stay After checking my credit card account I found out that You freezed my account twice so I must wait and cant use my 204 euro for certain period of time ,No Positive
453956,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, Not much room but had a tripple and rarely are in Europe Had air conditioning but during heat wave we had could not keep the room too cool although comfortable enough , Hotel now has wifi at least on the fifth floor Beds were a little too hard but not too bad Very clean Nice private bath with shower stall hair dryer and soaps Not a ton of character but very nice hotel by Eoro budget standards EXCELLENT location just yards from the train station and underground with 2 stops to old town Area very safe and residential shopping street a block away had anumber of good resable restaurants and we ate near the hotel every night Great coffe house satellitr Ompolaa right in the train station for yummy breakfast Very pleased and would stay again 
453957,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, Pillows very poor and design of hotel meant the heavy rain made for much noise against windows and window sill bathroom sink was cracked, Excellent location as we had to be at the station early literally two minutes walk
453958,AZIMUT Hotel Vienna, Very rude receptionist He told me I didn t have a booking We were extremely tired and he took half an hour fiddling with things before he let us check in At 1 30am The whole place was pretty dreary Breakfast shut at 10 Which is quite unfair on guests arriving from late trains Seeing as it s right next to a train station The room was cleanish But the floor was dirty Bed was quite hard and uncomfy also the aircon didn t work so we all woke up in hot sweats , The man at the front desk gave us a kettle when we asked for one for the room Though it should have been there already
