499434,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, We had booked an executive room and although it had a great bathroom the room itself was quite small at the back of the hotel and looked nothing like the pictures of executive rooms on the website Even worse at 7pm each morning there was building work carried out directly below are room We were not warned about this I was a little disappointed , The staff were really friendly The room was very well serviced The breakfast was nice 
499435,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Disappointing stay tiny room with windows giving straight to the neighboring roof which I could literarily reach out with my hand tiny bathroom with lack of hygienic disposables only one power plug in the room which in additional was out of service half full already opened bottle of wine in the minibar wi fi connection almost dead not to add very poor service during the breakfast Not worth a half of it s price , Good things are quick to list the location is good and this is it 
499436,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, It s in a beautiful old building so be warned the steps are steep and there are many confusing stairs and corridors Just remember where yout room is and you won t accidentally try and enter someone else s room with your key card p It s a small room but perfect for a solo traveller looking for a bit of comfort , The bed was amazing I was tempted to just stay in all day Location is close to the museums and about 20 minutes to the centre It s a nice quiet location which felt more residential than touristy 
499437,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The rooms even the standard double room are very small Also they have some ongoing construction that can be REALLY loud unfortunately, Great location a 5 min walk from Leidisplien 
499438,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The bathroom was a bit dark and the stone basin was getting calcium buildup and needed a bit of attention Some body lotion would have been welcome Otherwise it was great , The art and objets d art were great and and a there was a very good selection of quality magazines and coffee table books The bar bar snacks and breakfast were particularly good 
499439,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam,No Negative, Nice property overall but the first night I was placed in a basement room with a tiny window less than 3M2 during a heat wave There was a door to the courtyard but as a woman alone I couldn t leave that open I couldn t breathe and slept not a wink There was scaffolding outside my room the windows were dirty and construction started at 7am On top of it the room was THE smallest room I have ever been in the shower so small that it was impossible to get into it without flooding the floor For this I paid 220 Euro When I spoke to them in the morning they agreed to move me and offered me a free coffee They seemed not surprised so I suspect this happens a lot though this room should never be rented Very disappointing behavior Despite the fact that my second room was fine I would not return 
499440,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, No complimentary water adn the breakfeast was way too expensive, Samantha the lady at the dest was phenomenal i had a bit of a panic as i thought there was a mistake with the booking and she solved everything
499441,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Everything was going well Was really proud of the choice I made and was ready to recommend this hotel and give it a nice review until I got to the reception desk to check out Here s what happened 1 When I booked I opted that I payed at the reception desk on arrival It explicitly stated that I am not required to make any payment in advance This option was more expansive than paying in advance Immediately after the booking was completed I received notification from my bank that my account was debited with the whole amount that I should have payed on arrival I contacted the property and they said that this is a just a way to guarantee my reservation and that this transaction will not be completed and the money will be released after I made the payment at the reception desk 2 So I got to the hotel and at check in I they required to block another 50 Euros from my bank account as deposit Instead of blocking another 50 they blocked the whole amount that they ve already blocked when I made the reservation 50 Euros That was kind of awkward but I just wanted to enjoy my holiday and did what they required 3 Now the real shock was when I wanted to check out They said that I have to pay for my stay I said that I have to transactions pending with them and they can just complete one of them and take the money from there But no they wanted to do another transaction on the account that the two transactions will be released and the money will return to my bank account So in order to pay X amount for my stay they charged 3 times that amount from my bank account The first two transactions were released several days after I left 10 days to be exact So during my holidays I had money blocked on my bank account money I couldn t use , Very comfortable room Had all the facilities needed Good location 
499442,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Girl who checked us in kept getting confused on how we wanted to pay and kept trying to charge us deposits even though we were paying in full up front , Location was excellent and the rooms were perfect
499443,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The beds were uncomfortable real troughs and the Wifi was extremely slow My companion had to go to a nearby Starbucks to get work done They need to put a locked Wifi system in place , Location is good both for walking to the major museums and the beautiful historic Jordan neighborhood Away from the overly congested central city The restaurant was lovely and we enjoyed the communal tables 
499444,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, We were one level below reception so at all times of night morning it was very noisy with the creaky floor and booming voices above us Housekeeping storage was also just outside our door very noisy and there were privacy issues if blinds were open , The room was large and had nice styling Bed was big and comfy Bathroom had a big bath 
499445,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Room was in a cellar with almost no day light and very noisy It was not possible to sleep after 6 00 am That place is not suitable at all for a 200 CHF a day room , Location
499446,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, No milk in the room and no complimentary water in the room, The hostess Samantha was amazing I was stressed when I arrived over cost and rooms etc but she was a lovely person to me and just sorted everything out
499447,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, WiFi was extremely slow Room felt a bit tight and claustrophobic Considering the price it wasn t very good value , Staff friendly and efficient and location very good
499448,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, We were first put in a very tiny room we asked if we could be put in a larger room due to the cost of our stay as we were not going to pay nearly 500 for 2 nights and stay in a room where you could hardly walk round the bed We were then given a larger room which was great ,No Positive
499449,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, I was preauthorised for the room on my card when i selected pay at hotel for a higher cost Not only did they take money they were not permitted to they did so twice costing nearly 400 When questioned about this they said there was nothing they could do and i would just have to wait for the money to be retured Highly inconvenient, The bathroom and politeness of the staff was fantastic and the balcony made the room
499450,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, bed was rather small and way too soft which mad it not comfortable Small room is super small sufficient for 1 3 night stay during summer when you are out all the time anyway but very claustrophobic inside Crazy expensive and we had scaffolding outside our window with workers making noise not something we were informed to expect for 260 a night in small room that s rather shocking No breakfast included and very expensive to buy Staircase to our room was more like a ladder Fine for us although it would be close to impossible if we had any bigger luggage than our small bags Can t imagine any older or larger people being able to climb it Staff misplaced our luggage and we wasted time waiting for it to be found without much of an apology nor any compensation for stress and inconvenience It s a nice hotel and normal rooms looked lovely but the price is just ridiculous and we hadn t have good experience with staff so definitely won t be coming back , location and design nice bathroom Nice decor of the hotel and rooms Lovely art 
499451,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Initially we were given the wrong directions to our room We were told that our room No 304 was located on 3rd floor it wasn t It was on the 2nd floor The room was VERY small more like a closet The bed was very uncomfortable it was more like a hammock My partner had to sleep on the floor the first night before the team changed the mattress topper The room was very noisy as it overlooked the courtyard we were woken up before 7 am by the team setting up for breakfast and also by noisy patrons having breakfast The bathroom was very small I banged my head against the wall whilst getting off the toilet I m only 173cm tall The lift did not stop properly and my partner tripped over the gap between the lift and the ground floor thereby jarring his back It was far too expensive for what we got , Great location friendly accommodating team 
499452,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, One thing that I felt a bit inconvenient is that there is no elevator for me to go down to my room but stairs Not too many but still a bit difficult when you re lifting a 23kg luggage , Excellent location not only close to the tram bus station but also near Leidseplein where lots of restaurants located 8 minute walk to Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum around 5 tram stops to get to the Centraal station 2 5 hours to get to Giethoorn and 30 minutes away from Zaanse Schans The food was okay breakfast is in buffet style The staff was friendly in general The room I got was under the first floor but it s unlike a basement since there s an open outdoor area where I could still go out from my room 
499453,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, When we arrived there was scaffolding outside not ideal but not really a problem What was a problem is that we were told to go out floor and when the lift opened I honestly thought we had gone to the basement by mistake Work men s shoes all over tins of paint stepping over debris on our way to the room was not ideal Maybe if we d had an indicator this would have helped it was pretty shocking , The staff were lovely
499454,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, There was construction occurring which we didn t know about Work started at 7 8 am each day The bar restaurant had terrible service The hotel offered us 2 complementary drinks and when we went to the bar to order a beer a cocktail we were told uts only beer wine or soft drinks included I asked for a cider and the server didn t know what I was asking for I then said ok just a Riesling white wine please and he said he didn t think they had that either , Beds were comfy rooms were larger than I expected quite stylish 
499455,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Tiny single room very narrow hardly a space to sit except on the bed Black carpet furniture and curtains made it depressing Pillow case had been slept on when I arrived so I had to ask for my bedding to be changed The face towel still had marks from someone s make up The d cor left much to be desired Having scaffolding outside the building didn t help either , Staff were helpful but not particularly friendly The location is excellent 
499456,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The room was very small and the shower didn t work well slow water and I have to wait for long time for hot water , Hotel location is very good very close to the city center 
499457,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, We visited the hotel as a group to celebrate my husbands 40th Birthday When we arrived we were given our room keys and made our way to the Basement to where our rooms were As we descended the stairs the smell of paint was very obvious however there were no signs to suggest decorating was taking place To get to our rooms we had to step over paint trays full of paint and to my annoyance when I entered my room I realised I had got paint on my new shoes and all up my trousers The following morning painting commenced outside our bedroom at 7am waking us all up and to gain access back to reception we once again had to complete an obstacle course to exit I took photos and showed them to the management who at the time did not say much When I checked out they had reduced my room rate however not the other two rooms in my party who had encountered the same experience and did not offer to replace my now ruined new shoes or trousers Very disappointed for the price we paid ,No Positive
499458,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, This is the 3rd time we have stayed at the Vondel and every time we have booked a TWIN room When we go to check in they never seem to be aware of this and we have to wait whilst they prepare our room Our free time in Amsterdam is very limited so this is always disappointing On the good side they do provide a complementary drink in the bar whilst we wait and we will definitely be staying at the Vondel again , All the staff are very friendly and helpful and we always enjoy eating in the Restuarant 
499459,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The bed was made each day but attention to detail was lacking One day I won t have face or hand towels empty complimentary water bottles weren t removed used towels left for collection wasn t collected , The location was perfect Centrally located with ample transportation options 
499460,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Sizes of the room and bathroom are suitable only for very skinny person I m not sure that size is allowed in other countries Shower cup body lotion vanity kit are available only upon request 4 stars I didn t find them ,No Positive
499461,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Nothing The only thing to mention though is on booking com website it mentions a rooftop terrace bar but there is not one at all There was scaffolding on the Hotel Vondel work being done in the garden so maybe it is being refurbished However it did not spoil our holiday in any way , The really helpful friendly staff especially the lovely young lady who served us at breakfast The comfy beds the beautiful flowers the delicious breakfast the location the cleanliness I wish I could have stayed longer I will return 
499462,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, i have asked for a bottle of water at the bar to bring to the room they filled up a bottle from the tap at the bar and charged me 4 50 euro for it i wander what would have been the cost if i did order beer ,No Positive
499463,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, If I have to find something wrong a couple of times coming back from my business meeting about 4 4 50pm i found the staff cleaning my room and I had to wait in the lobby for a while Other than that the stay was great, The restaurant was excellent both for breakfast and for dinner the staff is always kind and smiling the hotel in general is very well furnished the ambient is warm and make you feel comfortable My room was claimed as a small one I had to change the dates at the very last second and I could not find a normal one Actually for one person I was travelling for business that was perfectly fine and a bit cheaper as well The location is excellent walking distance from city center and few steps from the bus stop to the Airport and right behind Van Gogh museum The room and bathroom were very clean and the towels changed every day even if not required 
499464,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The plugs for chargers were in an weird spot under the console table and difficult to access , We loved the rain shower head great bathroom and very clean and fresh Our beds and pillows were comfortable Great storage in closet Three of us felt like there was plenty of space and beautiful high ceilings Furnishings were functional and interiors smart The neighborhood was absolutely lovely totally accessible to public transportation on a very quiet street Beautiful surroundings close to restaurants and museums and a great market a walk around the block We would return to stay again for sure Loved that there was a fridge in the room as well as a tea pot to make tea or instant coffee in the morning 
499465,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam,No Negative, Extra friendly and welcoming staff They took the time to show us on a map what to do in Amsterdam the different areas etc We also had something we asked for for the room and they arranged it in 10 minutes Before arriving I send an email with some special requirements and they answered in the hour and all was right when arriving Great location near everything but still not in a crowdy or touristic street Very pleased with our stay 
499466,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, A lot of foot traffic could be heard from the room throughout the night room 101 , The bed was huge and comfortable bathroom was spotless clean Service was quick staff were super attentive
499467,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The service at dinner was very slow not the fault of the waitress but something had gone wrong in the system , The room was excellent and our wedding anniversary was acknowledged with balloons and a drink in the bar
499468,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The small room was VERY small Maybe a little too small for a pricey 4 stars hotel room although it is a boutique hotel in an old building Wifi wasn t very reliable, Bed super comfy Couldn t get up in the morning Best location for a relaxed vacation Very clean friendly staff 
499469,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Didn t like about the house keeper forget to lock my room after done with the cleaning and the hotel are very noisy from the room next door and the street , Staffs are very friendly and helpful feeling warm welcome make me very happy about staying there 
499470,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Awkward position of bathroom involving step up or step down approach Could cause a fall Wardrobe storage limited , Great breakfast friendly staff quiet location and could open windows for fresh air
499471,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Rooms are very small Even for the europe standarts Architecture is very complicated You cannot find your room Housekeeping is bad They don t come until 5 6 pm , Staff is helpful Location is good 
499472,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam,No Negative, Second time staying here Hotel ideal for visiting sites in a quiet location Stayed in a basement room beside garden found it very quiet peaceful Staff very helpful Very close to restaurants bars 
499473,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The room was called a small double room but the distance between the foot of the bed and the wall was just too small a normal sized person has to shuffle across The walls were very thin and we could hear the next room using the bathroom and brushing their teeth The room was generally stuffy but the aircon worked well , The hotel was stylishly furnished and in an excellent location near the park The staff were helpful There was nice art on the walls 
499474,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, i was really unhappy about the fact that i was quoted a fixed amount for 6 days i needed my bill split for 4 days and 2 days business and person and and it was informed that the cost was not evenly spread this wasn t highlighted at all on booking com i ended up paying the same amount for 2 days personal and the same amount for 4 days business where i traveled , bed was quote comfy staff very courteous 
499475,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Payment methods firstly took 2 deposits but refunded one and numerous payments were added on to final price which I was unaware of, Room decorated modern and was very spacious
499476,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Minuscule room at the top of very steep narrow stairs Overpriced poor value 20 euro per person breakfast offer was unrealistic when there are so many options for two for less money Not a 4 star hotel , Location
499477,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Very poor wall isolation people waking you up talking early in the morning very thin walls between rooms which leads to no privacy , Very comfortable bed
499478,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Although I was out of the room until 3 p m it still had not been cleaned , I loved the quiet cosiness of room 408 The food at the restaurant was superb Great shower 
499479,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Even though I ve asked for room in upper floor we got room that literally located at basement under the ground with scary steps in entry The ceiling is very low and you hear all the movement in the sidewalk that is just outside the window uncomfortable feeling moreover we had a leak in the shower the sealing between the shower and the bathroom wasn t good and all the bathroom were flooded with water after a short shower Although the room is renovated the level of the facilities isn t high , The location close to public transit casino and museums
499480,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Only issue I had this is the first time I ve experienced this after numerous stays The cleaning of rooms was very late in the afternoon , Lovely room with a big comfy bed Reception staff were helpful friendly The location of hotel is within walking distance to all of Amsterdam s attractions but for those less mobile tram stops are only minutes away 
499481,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, We booked a twin but were given a double This is not ok since we chose the hotel because of the availability of twin rooms Room was in the basement Very dark To open the windows we had to climb the furniture The smoking corner was just next to our window , Location is great Design is pleasant Very friendly staff 
499482,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The bed was too small I could not fit in it Consider the average height of Dutch men I was very surprised to have a bed that short The mattress also was very cheap Ikea style , Location
499483,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The rooms are not soundproof Being an old period property the floors are wooden so not only so you hear when people move you can also hear their conversation at 3am The hotel wifi is super slow never got more than 1mbps The noise levels will stop me from staying there again , Location is great in a beautiful neighborhood The art and the decor in the public areas and room were really cool The staff friendly and the room although small was comfy Once I figured out how the shower worked it was great 
499484,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Although the squishy pillows were comfy for relaxing and watching TV I would have liked a harder pillow to sleep on , The bed was like sleeping on a cloud The bathroom was lovely
499485,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam,No Negative, Great hotel great rooms with exta effort they decorated our bed for anniversary which was a nice touch Would definitely recommend and stay there again 
499486,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Dont be fooled by the pay at the hotel advertising The hotel policy for taking numerous deposits on credit cards is really confusing I payed initial deposits for each room a week before arrival then the same deposits on the first night then paid in full on the last day meaning the hotel held over 1000 on our cards combined leaving some of our group short of spending money If we had known we would of stayed elsewhere , Service at the bar was excellent
499487,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The size of the room is very very small no electic sockets in the room Incredibly overpriced, Bed was very comfy location was great very bear to leid square where you can find all eateries and entertainment
499488,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, the aircon was difficult to manage and the handheld shower head had been taken away so there was only one over head shower , bonus is that we had a balcony did not expect this
499489,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Steep stairs led up to our room but the staff only thought to offer us help after we had carried our bags up the first flight We knew the room would be small but we were surprised to also find it overfurnished The bathroom was poorly ventilated and the windows could only be opened half way hitting the bed and blocking passage The bed was short and the pillows very long and shapeless The WiFi was so slow it was essentially unusable both from our room and even from the lobby During our evening drink in the bar we were accompanied by two mice running around on the floor , The hotel was conveniently located close to Leidseplein Vondelpark and the museum quarter Our room faced the garden 
499490,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Received email asking if I would like to upgrade from a basement room to a suite to which I replied yes And after confusion on arrival when the lady at reception had to check with her manager and show her the email I was told there were no suites and the email was just to confirm if I d like an upgrade if one was available the confusion suggested to me that they made this up there and then to cover for the fact they d messed up This was unfortunate as the basement room was right next to a stair case which was very loud and had windows to street level that were also very loud , Nice decor and large comfortable bed
499491,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The room was in the basement we had around 15 steep steps stairs down into the room so therefore the room was obviously below ground level in fact the bottom of our window was level with the footpath outside The noise of people walking past in heels or people pulling cases and also cars sitting with their engine s running in the early hours was really bad enough to wake us out of our sleep The bedroom was dark and in need of a bit of tlc, Very comfortable beds modern attractive bathroom Good location
499492,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Cold plates us Brits like our plates hot but this seam to be a thing everywhere we ate in Amsterdam even in expensive restaurants , Our 1st room night was in the basement which I was uncomfortable with the bed was really comfy if your like me you need to state this at the time of booking as it a standard room but the staff very kindly moved us into a suite upstairs as it was our anniversary they gave us a bottle of wine we dined in the joost restaurant they gave us 2 glasses of cava lovely the dinner was a Dutch meal very nice the staff were so nice friendly very helpful made us very welcome the hotel is so central unlike here the public transport was brill We loved it would stay there again just because of the staff 
499493,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam,No Negative, The bed was amazing very comfortable The shower room and bathtub were also a delight The staff were super friendly and helpful I would deffiently stay here again 
499494,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Toilet very strange wash basin you can t use it properly TV from the history carpets old everything very old Gave me the room with noise from building site all very bad ,No Positive
499495,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Probably one of the most noisy hotels I ve stayed in Constant banging from rooms very very badly insulated rooms and can hear every single person walking past the door Awkward room layout room not maintained well no soap or shower gels charged for an extra hour for checkout no complimentary water after 200 per night Jacuzzi in room not working bath didn t fill Won t be staying here again No value for money at all ,No Positive
499496,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, TV very old since the 90s not joking remote control partially functional corridors and moquette really outdated Not 4 star hotel Overall ranking 6 , Close to Vondel Park and Leidseplein I asked and got a foam pillow Helpful personnel 
499497,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, We booked a souterraine room but it was nothing like the pictures and it was very noisy We can hear everything from reception and the kitchen, Breakfast was good and the bathroom was amazing Although the room wasnt what I expected it was still amazing Really clean very modern and more than enough space for two of us
499498,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, It looks a bit worn out and from time to time one might find a small bug in the underground rooms It happened to me I complained and I ve got immediately upgraded to an executive room plus a complimentary bottle of wine , First of all the staff was very polite and helpful The hotel is relatively ok but 4 stars is a bit of a stretch Good breakfast Good location 
499499,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam,No Negative, I have literally lived at Hotel Vondel off and on for the last 3 years All of their properties are lovely I highly recommend their hotels especially for a first time traveller to Amsterdam they are all centrally located and the staff is ALWAYS very helpful 
499500,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, We were put in a Twin Room and not a double although they did come and lay one sheet over the 2 beds for us On our first stay we were given bath robes and slippers on our first night however on this occasion we were told there were none available we were told this twice by the same receptionist I thought something was awry I waited until there was a new receptionist and was promptly handed fresh robes and and slippers Was there some kind of personal vendetta the receptionists had against us The mind boggles Anyway it was an alright stay but the slipper and robe debacle did take up a lot of my time , TV in the room was good and the overall stay of the hotel was good it was our second time staying Wi Fi was ok Friendly staff and the room service was excellent Really clean and well kept environment 
499501,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The hotel is very noisy so is very hard to sleep at night because you can hear all the voices the steps etc of the other costumers The bed is extra small for two people they say it is a queen bed but was very very small The room was very small as well somehow not expected from a 4 stars hotel double room Light was coming in the morning from the window and was impossible to completely cover it with the curtains , Location is super friendly staff and very clean 
499502,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Wifi is slow Narrow passengers but I guess it s normal for old Amsterdam buildings, Location is good just beside the Leidsplein Airport bus 197 takes you there directly 
499503,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The wifi was really slow but it doesn t really matter because the purpose of a city trip isn t to stay in the bed room to chat , The bed was as good as the comfort we could expect in a five stars hotel It was like sleeping in heaven 
499504,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, we were out every day from morning till 17 18 on the afternoun The 2 days we returned to the room we found the maid cleaning the room and we had to wait for this , Small but really nice and comfortable room excelent location easy going stuff
499505,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, You can hear everything from the next door Please fix the wall problem Can t sleep The night shift staff is not friendly Called from the airport many times for directions and no one picked up the phone The explanation is I was inside and didn t hear it , Good location and very good breakfast 
499506,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Rooms can be a bit small and the bathroom floors tend to get very wet when in the shower Might be a bit noisy in the summer as we were on a low floor at the front and could hear street noises which did not bother us but could be a problem when busy , Lovely staff all are very helpful and knowledgeable Hotel was central for us Close to trams and eateries etc We were upgraded which was a lovely gesture 
499507,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The dinner menu was a little disappointing especially the vegetarian options The dessert menu was great though especially the dutch treats , Staff were friendly beds were comfy great value for money Location was good about a 20 25 minute walk to the centre however but overall a great stay Restaurant interior was beautiful as well and the bathroom was lovely with a big spacious shower and bath 
499508,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Reception did not explain the card blocking properly and was left to pay full amount a the of stay without option to take of the blocked deposit , Great location for exploring of Amsterdam as you are right on the border of the main part of old city and right beside the popular night life part of the city Hotel is very clean and well designed Maybe not worth the charge but still worth it 
499509,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The room stayed cold throughout our 3 night trip even though we had the heating on high Room was a little strange in layout as it was at the very top of the hotel the attic Overall probably would look for a different hotel if we were to go back to Amsterdam , Friendly staff and very good location 
499510,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The rooms are quite small and they could use heating in the bathroom also when not in the Summer The Wi Fi could use an update , Excellent breakfast really comfortable bed and pillows Very nice staff and good service Location is good just at the edge of the central ring where you can find good restaurants and pubs that the local people attend not that many tourist traps as near Dam Square 
499511,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The staff is different everyday so attitudes vary from very friendly to cold and perfunctory the rooms are small but cozy , Located in the heart of Amsterdam
499512,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The room had horrendous stairs to get to it , The staff were extremely helpful seeing as we were a party of 30 Was in a great position of the city with good transport links 
499513,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Breakfast very poor definitely not worth 19 All hot food bacon eggs etc was always cold help your self breakfast area far too small Really disappointed At the bar the pint glasses were only rinsed out not properly washed , Staff were great very clean great location 
499514,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The room was very small just a little place to walk around the bed not more Very small bathroom not bigger than those in low cost fast hotels Elevators also very small staircase very steep looks nearly like a ladder and narow corridors For theses reasons this hotel is not worth 4 stars, A lot of staff really helpfull Good equipement and a very nice bed
499515,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Room was slightly smaller than expected but as we spent very little time in the room it wasn t too bad , Staff were very helpful and friendly Hotel had a great location with just a few minutes walk to the museums and park We even received a complimentary bottle of wine to celebrate our anniversary A very lovely touch 
499516,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The room was extremely noisy We heard exactly what our neighbor said en we heard footsteps from the guests above us We travel a lot and we are not picky but this was a big disappointment , The location is perfect Close to the Leidseplein Museums and public transport
499517,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Nothing Everything was great There s nothing that could ve been Improved , The room was beautiful Location was very close to the places we wanted to see The staff were so lovely 
499518,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam,No Negative, Great quirky hotel and the beds are so comfy Staff tried to help in any way they could when asking for recommendations on where to eat Great stay overall no complaints 
499519,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The first night I choose the basement room by mistake as it was labelled in Dutch on booking com I don t recommend the basement room and the breakfast is not so good considering that you pay 20 euros for it , Very good value for money and the location is great Staff is very helpful and room is clean and comfortable 
499520,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The heater pipe in the room keeps making a very loud noise day and night Got woken up several times at night , Super nice room and shower Bed was very comfortable Reception staff friendly and even helped me mail the postcard

499522,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Nothing it was a fantastic stay , We received a free bottle of red wine for our anniversary which was a fantastically nice touch It was so conveniently located 
499523,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, For a business traveler not the best hotel Wi FI Internet poor Booked a double room but was given a single room When I brought to the attention of the guy at reception he told me they would try and change it the next morning knowing that I was only there for one night , Location was OK
499524,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The souterrain room could have a sound insulation , This hotel is close to Vondelpark and you can walk to the museum square The room and bathroom are so confortable The staff is very polite and gave us all the info we needed Don t miss the hotel restaurant 
499525,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Dirty rooms so dirty that personal items that previous guests have left behind are still laying on the floors Bathroom sinks are stained with the toothpastes of previous occupants Spider webs They have the cheapest furniture possible The money you pay is not worth it Location is the only thing to consider , Location was the best thing to like 
499526,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, My room should no longer be sold at in its state Maybe just as a add on for kid to ajoining room A joke to charge 125 excl breakfast for it , Location
499527,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The stip and narrow stairs to the room with 2 big lugages it was difficult to climb up on the stip and narrow stairs to the room , Bed was comfortable room was clean good location 2 5 mins walk to Canal easy access from Schipol bus no 137 tram no 1 to Amsterdam Central Station just in front of the block

499530,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, breakfast not included and quite pricey even if I have to say it was superb amazing quality and a lot of choices and I think very few hotels include breakfast in the price of the room so it s a bit annoying but very common, amazing location very quiet street not in the chaos of Old Town but perfect for exploring the city beautiful building helpful and friendly staff super clean room we ve been updated to a larger one with huge bathroom and jacuzzi comfy bed I will definitely choose it again for a future visit to Amsterdam
499531,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Everything was perfect , The suite overall was perfect but the bed in particular was amazing You never know what you re going to get for a mattress in Europe but this bed had the added comfort of a 3 inch memory foamer pad on top of the mattress 
499532,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Small rooms but that is a lot about any hotel in Amsterdam wifi is rather poor , That was a good experience hotel is well located rooms are clean and friendly enough stuff Nothing special but would recommend to stay there 
499533,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, wifi was too slow in the room, location excellent close to museum and shopping area Simpathic atmosphere Ivasked for a small single room anf the room had all i needed the bed very comfortable
499534,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The shower is not the best Spacious and nice but water pressure is very low Also it could be nice to have body cream ans a separate shampoo than body lotion for a four stars hotel , Well decorated convenient and pleasant
499535,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Controversial room pictures at booking com as for the surterrainean room you post top floor room pics which mislead me again and resulted in incorrect room booking , Reception staff was very nice and friendly 
499536,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, I feel the pictures online look way better than the room we got The building is old and there were several bugs coming out of the bed headboards Hotel staff did their best to clean up the room after we placed the complaint , Excellent staff excellent location Clean and comfortable room 
499537,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The pillows were very lumpy and odd sizes and the mattress was too soft Room was also very small standard double The d cor of the room was quite shabby and in need of re decoration but communal areas reception restaurant were pleasantly decorated he breakfast was very poor not enough hot food soggy scrambled eggs poor selection and definitely overpriced at 17 euro each Location is OK but you do need to get the tram into the centre i e Dam square shopping Anne Frank house etc , The shower was very good plenty of hot water Good location for the museums
499538,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Hotel restaurant not that great Did not get my son s burger right and brought me the wrong main course twice They kindly compensated without asking on their mistake so no issue there but the food was pretty ordinary, Super comfy bed quiet residential street 1 block from Starbucks supermarket and good Indonesian restaurant close by Great location for museums and PC Hoofstraat
499539,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, A little loud from the hallway my room was located next to the elevator , Location was great easy access from the airport with a bus that stops 200 m from the hotel Breakfast was nice both buffet and a la carta included in the rate WIFI worked well
499540,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, I was in a ground floor room The corridor leading to it was quite shabby There was no view apart from people s ankles walking past The TV had a very poor signal and majority of channels were quite fuzzy , Excellent location with a comfortable bed Staff very friendly I arrived early and was provided with a room 2 hours prior to checking in Nice and spacious and clean 
499541,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, room was ridiculously small Very loud voices outside all through the night Staff was not very welcoming upon my arrival after having travelled for 12 hours Started to argue about my cc although I had prepaid the stay Very unpleasant and left a bad taste in my mouth Came in for breakfast at 10 20 am very much on jetlag and although brfst was until 10 30 am was told that I could not get special items kitchen was closed ,No Positive
499542,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Staff didn t handle checkout and payments well Room fridge was not clean , Bed and bathroom were clean and comfortable Location was superb Value was great 
499543,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The fan of the airconditioning was too hard even in the low status cannot be switched off There was no shower gel offered in the bathroom only handsoap , Perfect location close to the best places in the city but quiet during the night Clean and spacy room nice bathroom friendly and professional personnel 
499544,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The minibar fridge was not fully working and water pooled inside There were mosquitos in my room which bit me on several nights despite my best efforts to kill them all The previous guest had clearly done the same as their bloody dead squashed bodies were all over the ceiling and walls Though this was disgusting and unsightly the maid never cleaned them away I was there for 4 nights On check out the receptionist offered to ignore my minibar bill as compensation I explained that my employer would pay for that so it was of no compensation to me She then said she would get her manager to ring me the following day I m still waiting There were cobwebs in the bathroom above head height which were never cleaned The pillows were huge but provided no comfort or support It all just felt grubby and tired , The breakfast was decent 
499545,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The place was extremely over priced for what we received We were put in a room located in the basement of the hotel that smelled like mold sewage The room was extremely small and was covered in mosquitos 10 dead mosquitos on the walls The staff offered to spray the room while we were out but left the dead bugs on the wall It was ridiculous for what we were paying I would never stay at this hotel again I am sure the rooms on the higher floors are better but if you are going to stay here I would recommend calling ahead to makes sure you are not put in the basement , The location was great easy access to Vondel Park and great restaurants and bars 
499546,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Air conditioning was a bit noisy , Rooms and beds very comfortable for group of friends on weekend visit to Amsterdam Hotel was close to museums restaurants bars We were within walking distance of all the sights 
499547,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff was very friendly and helpful The location is great I did not want to stay in the central part of town so this was perfect for me Only few minutes away from Leidseplein where we took the tram and we would be in the central in 10 minutes We had breakfast once at the hotel and it was almost 20 euros It is good value if you eat alot but I thought it was too much for couple of croissant and a cup of coffee We had fresh sheets and towels daily except for the second last day which was annoying we had a small double room and although its small it is actually really good size with a nice bathroom and a tv I recommend this hotel to everyone and I really loved the location and how nice the hotel looked 
499548,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, To begin with I fail to understand how a 4 star hotel could possibly have a basement room The next day when I was moved up and for which I had to pay extra they moved me into a tiny room I couldn t sleep properly for the two nights I was there There was so much sound coming into my room that I could hear the people from upstairs from the next room and even footsteps I woke up 5 times in the middle of the night thinking someone had entered my room because someone else across the hall was entering their room The tv was from I don t know what century with maybe like 16 channels and only two in English One of the staff was a helpful girl apart from her they were all a little stuck up and when I asked to change my room from basement they told me I had booked that room again I can t fathom a 4 star hotel with rooms in basement I m sorry but it was a very bad experience The breakfast was very ordinary The rates are too high for the quality and service being provided No one even bothered helping me with my luggage on my way out worst decision I made during my 20 day trip around Europe , Nothing 
499549,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The check in process was quite slow and tedious The rooms are quite difficult to find and the lift is extremely small , Comfiest bed I have ever slept in The large jacuzzi bath was a welcome bonus too worth the upgrade although the room itself was quite small so it is not somewhere you would spend the day While the hotel is conveniently located if you are into museums it is quite far out from the town centre if it is nightlife you are looking for 
499550,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Almost everything They had cancelled our booking even though it had been fully prepaid and I had sent them an email to say that we could not take up the first night of the two night booking Then they told us it was our fault and that we had to take the matter up with booking com They offered to sell us the room we had previously booked and paid for for almost double the original price again that was the hotel system requiring them to do do this They did not offer to contact Booking com for us We had to contactBooking com ourselves Booking com is their agent not ours They do not understand their relationship with Booking com After speaking with booking com they offered us a room up four flights of stairs or a lift so small one person could hardly stand up in it When we got to the room it was a double when we had ordered a twin The room was absolutely tiny We complained Finally they put us in a room with twin beds which they described as a luxury room We had arrived after travelling and walking for 8 hours It was 8 pm when we arrived at the hotel It was 9 30 before we got to our room The following morning we were woken by jack hammering outside the window only to discover that outside the window was a major construction site What made it worse was that I had asked if I could see the manager in the morning because the hotel clearly has systems that are completely ineffective This was a complete waste of time as the supervisor repeated that there was nothing that they could do as it was the system Solution If you have to have a computer system that dictates what you must do that is contrary to the good name of your business and your customers then you should also have a policy in place to deal with system outcomes that are contrary to the interests of your customers business In this case the problem could have been resolved immediately by them offering me the room that I had booked and paid for , The staff did their best within the systems established for them by their management and the constraints of the building
499551,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The room was extremely small nearly half of what is shown as example in the room pictures Bed not uncomfortable at all Inside the shower the roof was very low probably around 1 70m in some parts and the wall of the shower was heavily damaged Painting in doors and door frames was coming out from use This is definitely not what I would expect from a 4star hotel , The staff was extremely nice and helpful Very professional from the beginning to the end 
499552,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The ground floor room we stayed in was very noisy you can hear people walking above you closing doors and walking talking outside The space just amplifies the sound , The room was spacious comfortable bed the staff were very pleasant and the hotel is in a great location close to Vondelpark a food store and several cafes right nearby It s also not a far walk to the Leidsplein and central Amsterdam 
499553,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, We were on the top floor A typical European elevator with room for a backpack and a cat It was a real challenge getting everything up and down in 1 trip , The breakfast is well worth eating downstairs for good selection and they were willing to cook Dutch pancakes for us That was the hi lite of the stay 
499554,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam,No Negative, Wonderful breakfast Asked for a room with a review and they honored that request by giving us a super cute little balcony overlooking the road We will stay here again the next time we re in Amsterdam 
499555,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Bathtub bathroom sink espresso machine not working lots of we will fix Cleaning lady that would come back and never showed, Loved the staff Everyone doing everything to be kind and of service
499556,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, on the first night we wanna take a bath in the jacuzzi When I turned the water on I found there s a lot of black dust in the water and I found out it was from the bathtub Looks like it haven t used and cleaned for a while So at last I need to clean the tub myself before using it the second night the hot water pipe in our building was broken so we only took a quick cold shower that night and it s still broken until late evening of the next day during the checking in period 3 pm on Saturday there s only one person at the check in counter The couple on the line before me waited for about 10 mins to only get their luggages in the baggage room We waited for about 15 mins only to ask for a Taxi to the airport We tried to use Uber but it doesn t work somehow Anyway the girl at the front desk was very nice and in the good mood all the time and tried to serve everyone at her best I suppose it just a hotel system that s not right How can you arrange only one person at the front desk around the check in time and even on Staurday , The hotel design is nice The room is quite spacious equipped with jacuzzi and very functional charging outlet The staffs are nice 
499557,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, We were located in the basement and one morning our view was obscured by rubbish bags which blocked out the already little abient light that we did have Also the cleaners were a little over zealous in that they entered our room whilst we were still sleeping on our last morning , Great location for getting around the city also the bed was extremely corny 
499558,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Room close to the garden woken up by staff watering plants at 7am , Excellent location close to trams Vondel park and museums Room in good condition nice comfy bed 
499559,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Breakfast was too expensive for those who were staying at the hotel drinks were overpriced and the room was very small , Really good service welcoming good with additional charges that we asked for in advance of our stay 
499560,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Not very welcoming complecated to go through front door Room was tiny very old hotel Needs updating no usb telly doesn t work No milk for tea Location ok but not central ,No Positive
499561,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Falsely advertise that they have their own parking when you have to pay for street parking or in the Q park nearby We were travelling by motorcycle and found that we weren t allowed in the Q park so had to pay 55 to park in the Marriott hotel nearby , Staff were helpful rooms were clean Good location 
499562,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, There was a massive gap under the door so it was quite noisy when staff began their daily duties There was no remote for the TV, Location was handy to Vondelpark and Leidesplein but far enough away from the action to fairly quiet Public transport options were excellent with trams canal boats and busses within a few minutes Hotel was comfortable and clean and staff always seemed friendly 
499563,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Slightly compact in the layout of the room its a great use of space but can feel a bit cluttered However the facilities and professionalism of the hotel make up for this , Tea coffee choices in the room along with a small chair to read in Shower good and doesn t go between temperatures 
499564,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Rooms a little tired looking breakfast expensive for quality of food and service Possibly due to not enough staff on hand , Reception staff wonderful and very helpful Beds comfortable location ideal 
499565,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The room I booked was 12 m2 but the one I got was not more then 7 or 8 the shower is so low because it s made under a staircase that I couldn t shower standing straight The room wasn t clean under the bed there where dirty tissues and at the desk or next to the bed there is no plug to charge a phone or laptop The room has a connecting door and when the vacuum the room next door at 9 in the morning it wakes you up When I wanted to check out it took 14 minutes before someone extra came the other person was helping an other guest and they didn t even call someone It s a nice hotel but my previous experiences have been way better Last time I stayed here , The location is great that s was all this time 
499566,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Size of the room was really small so I would definitely book a bigger room next time , Perfect location for everything Me and my partner loved it and will be back 
499567,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Small double room as too small bathroom had some mould marks in ceiling as well as cracking and bedroom ceiling also had patch marks on it, Like look up arrival reception and dinning areas
499568,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, A more extensive menu in the restaurant would help , We booked a Family Suite and the accommodation was excellent A very large 2 bedroom apartment good sized kitchen small but perfectly formed balcony great living room and bathroom The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable I d definitely recommend it 
499569,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Recommend directions for using phone The bathroom sink is silly and hard to use albeit the latest style i e bowl on top of vanity Ugh If you want hard boiled eggs make sure you tell the cook that specifically We were informed that the Dutch hard boiled eggs are soft inside Asked twice and described what we preferred but to no avail Not sure if this is true or just a querk of the cook , Fabulous location as museums are nearby Restaurants within walking distance Very good breakfast included and in nice setting Room was large and comfy 
499570,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Booked a twin room was given a double Had to swap bedding for two singles on a double bed No discount offered Room wasn t cleaned by house keeping even after being asked to clean it , Staff were very nice
499571,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The hotel decided to block money in our bank account even though we suggested to leave a cash deposit instead Further more they blocked 50 more then they proclaimed to block so we had to argue with them until they saw that we were right and changed the amount blocked who heard of such a thing Leave my bank account alone And that block wasn t released even after we checked out and got back home Only after an angry email to the hotel they apologized and removed the block This hotel doesn t worth the headache it gave me , Bed extra comfy good location
499572,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam,No Negative, Tiny and adorable room and bath Excellent bed Reception helpful and responsive although they may not have mailed our postcards as promised and paid for Food at hotel restaurant was excellent and so was the service 
499573,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Nothing , This hotel was a good value for the price The area is far enough from the city center to avoid the party crowd but close enough to the better restaurants I read a bunch of reviews before booking this place and some complained about noise in the basement rooms which has I fully understand now because I passed by those rooms numerous times and can imagine how annoying that would be if I was on the bottom floor Bottom line book this place if you re not a ground level the rooms types let you choose 
499574,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Our room was a souterrain but was located right below the lobby and next to the main stair access This meant a lot of noise above and outside the room which was annoying , Location was great near to the main museums and the 197 bus direct from the airport stops very close by Room was spacious and beds were large and very comfy 
499575,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, We stayed in the basement accomodation It has very little natural and electric lights and we could hear every single step or talk outside the street like people were inside the room Also the wifi signal was minimum in the room , Excelent location near the most touristic places in the city
499576,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Subterranean bedroom was dark and noisy at night After two nights we did change rooms Some confusion over paying for the room and tickets for museums which still needs sorting , Friendly staff and good location 
499577,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Very small room Incredible that in 2016 the bathroom is with bath and not a shower The dryer did not work well small bathroom empty amenities We want to rent 2 bicycles for 2 hours and the hotel try to charge us the whole day Very bad relationship price quality service I will not recomend this hotel , location
499578,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam,No Negative, Location was great room was clean it was small but everything you needed was there e g sufficient wall hooks which I usually miss in hotel rooms public transport just around the corner staff very friendly 
499579,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam,No Negative, We loved the boutique hotel feeling and the excellent inteiror design Placed next to Vondel park and all main tourist attractions this place is heaven 
499580,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam,No Negative, Staff are amongst the best I ve ever experienced from top to bottom Took ten minutes to give me detailed directions with highlighted map route when others would have took seconds Restaurant spot on Free computer to use will print your boarding pass automatically for no cost Perfect location on a quiet road but so close to where it all goes off Will return and will recommend
499581,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Room was unfinished bath taps were broken and no water available to bath Despite several requests to fix it was left as was for the duration of the stay Given the high rate this room commands this should have been fixed or a discount offered as a gesture of goodwill Also some windows missing curtains , Location is great staff are friendly and helpful no lift in the loft apartment area but staff promptly assisted with bags to 4th floor 
499582,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, My room was sadly not as clean as I would expect in such a hotel plus wifi was hardly working Avoid room in the basement poor value for money, The location is very nice perfect for exploring the city 
499583,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff are amazing Me and my partner had a bit of trouble in Amsterdam where he got attacked in city centre He got taken into Accidents and Emergency The reception team were great at comforting me as I was shocked and also took very good care of him I wish that the experience in Amsterdam was different however stuff happens that is out of our control 
499584,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, My only complaint if it is a complaint at all is that the bed was too high After a long flight it felt like I needed to stretch before climbing in , I would highly recommend this hotel to a friend Great location and staff was very helpful If you are a Van Gough fan this hotel is for you Try the pancake when you are there loved them 
499585,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, A bit pricey The corridors to our room on third floor needed a refresh , Very nice rooms great breakfast with fresh orange juice and coffee machine to make your own latte Close to the hop on hop off bus and canal cruises and many restaurants 5 minutes away 
499586,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, We were given a basement room with no view whatsoever on querying this we were told we had specifically booked a basement room which was completely untrue The staff were inflexible on changing our room basically saying to us take it or leave it it had already been paid for , great location for the museums and very comfortable bed
499587,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Our bathroom door wasn t a proper door so not very private There was a large group of us though and all their doors were OK , Good sized rooms Lovely comfy bed and pillows Friendly helpful staff Great location Would definitely recommend and stay here again 
499588,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Clean linen delivery was blocking the corridor area around the lift on the afternoon we arrived not a very good initial impression , Great location bus stop for 197 service to from Schipol airport just a couple of minutes walk away Vondel Park literally around the corner less than 10 minute walk to Museumplein and 20 30 minutes walk to Centraal train station Great breakfast buffet and very comfy beds Staff were very friendly and helpful with local info and directions to different locations 
499589,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, the breakfast was slightly disappointing all was fairly dry, The staff were lovely always smiling and happy to help with all requests especially the woman that checked us in Maybel Also the rooms were spotless
499590,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The rooms were not ready until very late The room price was very high 30 minutes before breakfast finished there was no food left and the staff were not replacing it The hotel decor has not been refurbished for over 10 years I stayed at this hotel when it was returned so I know how long ago that was , The staff were friendly 
499591,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, I was suprised in a negative meaning that hotel vondel is ranked with a four star rating In reality its at the most a three star hotel Needs a womans touch , Bed was great and nice with airconditioner 
499592,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Need renovation wall paints and facilities too old toilet washing basin small and just under the shelve makes it difficult to use Too expensive for the quality of the room , Quiet street but in city center very convenient and yet peaceful Staff are helpful and friendly 
499593,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Breakfast was far too expensive It was a self service buffet for 20 per head You had to queue for the one coffee machine the hot food was not very hot I was expecting table service for this price The quality of the food was good but the lack of service and staff let it down Rooms were far too small for 200 sterling per night, The hotel was in a good location and styled very well
499594,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Garden furniture while very smart needs a little clean around the sides , Location style chic and slightly faded comfortable clean big room and super super bathroom Staff lovely 
499595,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Elevator location a little problematic Left early in the morning and may have woken guests with my luggage , Enjoyed the location and general ambience of the space 
499596,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The pillows were absolutely disastrous Way too soft and fluffy all four of them Most hotels have two types of pillows I did not like that i had to pay a deposit and upon return 8 euro were taken out for taxes not clear why those weren t part of the original bill It gave a feeling of being ripped off by the staff , this was my second stay at the hotel I like the bathrooms and the quality of the mattress 
499597,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, nothing, Beautiful contemporary style in common areas and rooms fantastic location accommodating staff and a nice courtyard where you could have drinks
499598,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, On arrival was kept waiting for 15 minutes due to the receptionist kept answering calls the staff should be trained how to prioritise tasks The room itself is very small and it s very difficult to even walk around the bed without knocking into something The decor is rather old and overall I will not call this hotel a Boutique hotel as they advertised , Good location in a nice neighbourhood Room is clean
499599,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Breakfast was slightly chaotic with too few staff trying to cope with food and crockery running out And one coffee machine simply isn t enough There was an a la carte breakfast menu but it wasn t clear how to order staff didn t come to offer to take an order and when a poached egg arrive it was cold and hard On another day the pancake wasn t great The bathroom was very elegant but with a very shallow sink it was almost impossible to fill the otherwise excellent large kettle to make tea , The hotel is a converted terrace of old houses with very steep but authentic staircases It did feel like a step back into real Amsterdam history with modern facilities Staff were friendly and helpful but overworked at breakfast
499600,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam,No Negative, We were upgraded to the Deluxe 2 Bedroom Apartment right on the Prinsengracht canal The view was amazing It was beautifully decorated immaculately clean and in the perfect location The Hotel Vondel staff were never more than a phone call away and helped out on more than one occasion with a taxi and other random questions we had I would definitely stay here again and hope to do so in the near future 
499601,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The wifi wasn t very reliable and the breakfast was very expensive, Great location very clean and comfy room staff were lovely Would defiantly return to this hotel 
499602,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The location of my room was under where breakfast was served so I was woken up every day at 7am and kept awake I did not enjoy this at all The hotel also charged me 4 times for my authorisation and I am currently waiting to get that reimbursed When I called the hotel one of the girls laughed at me and said I wouldn t understand I was trying to explain what had happened and she said she would send me an email instead That was 4 days ago Still no email Still waiting for a final reimbursement , The bed was amazing it really was 
499603,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff was extremely friendly and helpful We needed to leave our bags after we checked out and they were very happy to accommodate us They also helped us get to the Keukenhof and recommended restaurants for dinner 
499604,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The bedding was changed once during our 5 night stay a bit unnecessary perhaps I m pro saving resources A bit stingey with tea and coffee in the room had to get extras at breakfast and no milk provided guess that s the continental way , The bed was lovely I like crisp cotton sheets and fat pillows It was unexpectedly high so you literally had to climb in but nevertheless fine The room was cleaned and the bed made every day when we were out Excellent choice for breakfast which was included in our price 20 euros would have been a bit steep otherwise Smallish room but adequate also nice double shower with good temp and pressure Minifridge handy for storing snacks and milk Safe also a bonus 
499605,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Needed to ask for tea bags etc to be topped up very minor quibble , Good location Room spacious and bed comfortable enjoyed windows opening onto garden Very good bathroom with bath and shower well warmed Pleasant reception area and a good restaurant 
499606,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Room could do with a decorative freshen up , Staff were incredible thank you Anna and helpful in any and all ways My niece was having her 18 birthday they helped make her trip feel very special Lovely hotel great art style food 
499607,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Small room Noise at night from the road outside disturbed our sleep The breakfast was chaotic too few staff no clean tables breakfast buffet was not replenished in reasonable time and most of the hot food was not available , The room had a comfortable bed and good bathroom Good location in smart area residential area The restaurant and public areas are pleasant 
499608,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, We were moved to hotel close by and told we would have an upgraded room but the room was dirty crumbs under chairs and dirty toilet It was on top floor with sloping walls and only a small window This affected our feeling about our stay , Bed extremely comfortable staff very friendly
499609,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Our room was VERY small for two of us Bathroom clean but tiny Lighting was insufficient for make up dressing etc We asked for an upgrade but none was available Sound insulation appalling We booked 3 months ahead so I expected a decent room I would gladly have paid more for room to move Interior of Hotel was in need of redecoration , Breakfast was excellent Dining good The staff were polite Bed comfortable 
499610,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Comparing to two years ago hotel facilities looks tired furniture scratched etc Staff seems to be reasonable until check out time without any prior notice refused to take 500 bill the reason was that there is small sticker in the window not larger than a cigarette pack More over not at hotel description on booking com nor in the conformation was any information about the such restrictions , The locations ie excellent everything you want to reach is close 
499611,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, I didn t try the breakfast so I can t comment on that , The hotel staff arranged an early check in were very courteous and helpful throughout my stay and during checkout The location is amazing in the best part of town The room design is very nice and the bathroom is a very good size 
499612,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, We had a cellar room 111 which was awful no daylight very uncomfortable bed no well positioned mirror except the steamed up one in the bathroom and one in a wardrobe you had to prop the door open with your foot plug in the hairdryer on the other side of the room then do contortionist moves to try and blow dry your hair The kettle was located miles away from a socket and the kettle was broken Why is it difficult to get simple things right Hotel designed by a man obviously, the location
499613,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, Took the Souterraine room against some of the advises from previous reviewers Regretted as the room was really next to the walkway Noise wasn t that bad It came mostly from the lift and the staircase that is right next to the room Almost everyone who stayed on our level use that staircase The lift would have taken too long Imagine the number of footsteps stomping up and down Not sure if book 3 months in advance to get a good rate have landed us in less than desirable rooms Strong recognizable sticky sweet smell coming into the bathroom from the central ventilation system At first we thought it was from the previous occupant Then we realise it s gone by day and it only happens at night Every night , Lobby was tastefully decorated Room was big Short walking distance to the bus stop for the bus to the airport Short tram ride to get to the central

499622,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The bathroom was too small and hard to get around The beds took up a lot of room no much walking space where the table in the end of the beds were, I like the quiet street location by the park Breakfast was great nicely put together with variety of food Like he entrance and staff

499635,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, 1 basement room excesively noisy 2 staff very rude pushed and served an aggravated client ahead of us 3 we specifically requested a certain denomination card to be charged they confirmed but charged a different card that we never allowed them to charge leading to a large forex deficit to us 4 the time and effort trying to resolve this dispute has been excesively prolonged 5 reception staff are placing the blame on us rather than admitting their mistake 6 Hotel Vondel a free cup of coffee will not make up for your negligence and we are highly disgusted to say the least, location is ok
499636,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, We stayed in the basement rooms which I wouldn t recommend It was fine for me and my boyfriend as we spent hardly anytime in the hotel and we are both heavy sleepers You can hear every footstep above you and loads on noise we also noticed a really bad smell one morning from the outside coming in , The room was lovely and spacious and bathroom was perfect Location is good a 25min walk to the main area the Dam and a 2 min walk to Leidsplein a busy area with access to trams for a 5 min journey to the area Our room was ready when we arrived at 10 o clock which is always a bonus

499640,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The first night we were placed in a room which was not what we paid for which was disappointing as we were not compensated for this mix up even though we were put into the correct room after spending one night in a twin room I feel the staff could have been more helpful and apologetic in this situation I also believe we should have been compensated for this , I loved the style of the hotel The decor fit perfectly with the surroundings and was of a high quality The bathrooms were also very clean and decorated well

499657,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, The walls seem quite thin so noise is a bit of an issue The floor of our room was a bit slanted granted that this is an old building but it affected the bed a bit so we slept at a bit of an incline which was actually quite funny , The reception staff was absolutely wonderful helpful and friendly to the max They upgraded our room at no extra cost when they found out it was my partner s 30th birthday and they sent us a bottle of wine from our home country to enjoy Such attention to detail at a very affordable rate The hotel s decor is super trendy and well thought out and creates an amazing atmosphere We were overall very very pleased
499658,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, When I checked in I was proposed an upgraded room for free that is wider and with a nice view I accepted and thanked But I got a decently spaced room with windows buried by an opposite wall roof no view at all Furthermore the furniture was cheap and worn out In the bathroom just very ordinary shower gel shampoo and shower cap were provided The elevator got stuck between floors several times Personnel was essential not caring about and loudly speaking Definitely a quality level largely below 3 stars ,No Positive

499697,Hotel Vondel Amsterdam, My husband and I booked an executive double room for ourselves and double rooms for the children We were disappointed that the double rooms we ordered for the children were in the basement and very noisy In fact both rooms had to be changed after the first night due to silverfish in the rooms and a great deal of noise from restaurant above Our executive room was a huge disappointment as we expected a seating area which turned out to be two small chairs in the corner of the room but nothing near what I would class as executive The room was also small with two single mattresses pushed together and single bedding ie single duvets and sheets Free Wifi was the worst I have ever used and I stay in many hotels thank goodness I wasn t staying on business because the wifi CONSTANTLY kicked you out This happened to everyone in our party of 7 , Hotel was in a wonderful location We took a bus directly from the airport Staff were very friendly and helpful expecially the bar staff
