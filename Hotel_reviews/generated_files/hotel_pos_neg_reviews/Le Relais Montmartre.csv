220711,Le Relais Montmartre, Not so easy to find or get to by car The car park we found is somewhat away from the hotel , Offers all in room services Good bed In the heart of Montmartre 
220712,Le Relais Montmartre, Room is so small that even though the beds were made up as twins they were still pushed together like a double Was traveling with a friend so even a couple of inches would have been nice between us We were so tired at the end of each day though that we just collapsed in heaps of exhaustion and slept fine Air conditioner was not as adjustable as we would have liked but were able to crack the window to cool thing down more quickly , Easy location in best neighborhood in Paris close to Metro and not all the way at the top of the hill requiring a hike up at the end of a long day Charming and clean Nice breakfast Helpful staff 
220713,Le Relais Montmartre,No Negative, The extremely friendly and obliging staff Located on a quiet sidestreet close to metro station Lot different restaurants and caf s near for Hotel We stayed at room nr303 and there was a good bed and view to a quiet street Wifi worked perfectly New and superclean bathroom Well balanced decorated in room and bathroom Effecient cleaning every day Easy access to the metro Breakfast was simple but superb We visited a lot of recommended restaurants but this was one of the few who worked on Sunday after 3 30 AM and the service was very fast and the cook was very clean and the food is very tasty La Bistrot 79 rue Blanche 75009 Paris 
220714,Le Relais Montmartre, Nothing We were totally satisfied , Lovely large room Very quiet Lovely breakfast Everything one would expect Lovely comfortable breakfast room We loved it and would go again So near the action but extremely quiet Tea and coffee available in room 
220715,Le Relais Montmartre, We booked the Comfort Double Room the room was off the reception on the ground floor street facing and incredibly noisy the first night we got no sleep with people even banging on the shutters The following day we upgraded to the Superior Double Room the room was identical however on a higher floor and much more pleasureful If you are booking do not book the comfort room if you want to sleep , Great Hotel very close to the metro with lots of great places to eat in the area The rooms are big and clean 
220716,Le Relais Montmartre,No Negative, Very convenient location about 10 mins walk from Sacre Coeur The hotel is located in a quiet back road off Rue Lepic Blanche metro is a few minutes walk There are some excellent restaurants in the area The staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and speak good English I highly recommend this hotel 
220717,Le Relais Montmartre, Iron provided had exposed wire and no replacement was available wasn t really inconvenient just if you are bringing dresses and shirts to wear you may want to pre book one or bring a travel iron WIFI was not always available 7 10 it was These are just 2 small points it hardly affects our other positive feedback for this great hotel , The front desk were so helpful and friendly The breakfast in bed was delicious and the bedroom was comfortable and very cosy Situated along a quiet road off from the main restaurant lined road of Montmarte with the Cafe des 2 Moulins the Moulin Rouge and Blanche Metro it offers a fantastic location Very accessible and vibrant 
220718,Le Relais Montmartre, The room with two twin beds would have been too small We would not have enjoyed our stay as long as we did , The staff was very helpful We wanted a room with two beds but the room was very small and faced the street noise We were allowed to move to a larger room but only had one bed Was an okay compromise Nice that we could walk everywhere 
220719,Le Relais Montmartre,No Negative, Lovely little hotel with great facilities and friendly staff in a perfect location for seeing Montmartre and Sacre Coeur Blanche Metro is only minutes away and there are plenty of excellent choices for food within walking distance We were delighted with our stay and would highly recommend it 
220720,Le Relais Montmartre, Nothing , The bed was comfortable and the room bathroom very clean Staff made you feel welcome Location in Montmartre is excellent We liked Montmartre so much during our three night stay we only went into Paris once Lots of bars and bistros around Easy to get to from Gard du Nord by Metro From Blanche Metro the hotel is less than five minute walk off Rue Lepic 
220721,Le Relais Montmartre, Buffet breakfast offered at additional cost perhaps a little expensive but lots of other options just steps away , Really friendly welcoming staff felt like home from home Perfect location for Montmatre or 20mins walk into centre of Paris Highly recommended 
220722,Le Relais Montmartre, Absolutely nothing , Staying at Le Relais Montmartre has been absolutely the best experience in Paris The staff Alessio front office as well as the cleaning lady are wonderful people The perfect location with the easy access to metro the lovely inner court for smoking the comfortable room we had the smallest cheapest room it just doesn t get any better than here really Very good value for the price definitely risk less comfortable and very pleasant 
220723,Le Relais Montmartre,No Negative, All the staff were friendly and helpful The room was lovely and clean The beds were so comfortable Nice breakfast very tasty with fresh orange juice The decor was elegant and felt very homely We will stay here again and would recommend to all 
220724,Le Relais Montmartre, I had a singe room and the bathroom was a bit outdated and small , Great location very close to Metro nice little place to stay I would come back any time 
220725,Le Relais Montmartre, The size of the room much too small for 2 people You could barely move in the bathroom, Cleanliness and location very quiet in a busy neighborhood 
220726,Le Relais Montmartre,No Negative, First class boutique hotel enchante Even have iPads to lend out and very very helpful staff I went for La Nuit Blanche and already in diary for next year 
220727,Le Relais Montmartre,No Negative, The staff was superb especially mr Martin Everything about this experience wanted me to extend my stay but we had other commitments that prevented it It was so enjoyable 
220728,Le Relais Montmartre, The room the standard one we got was small certainly smaller than in the photos So was the desk in the room there was precious little room to work , The staff were very friendly They lent me an iPhone charger I had forgotten mine at home I really liked the quietness Even though it is in the heart of Montmartre the hotel is on a side street which is not busy With a room overlooking the courtyard it was nicely quiet 
220729,Le Relais Montmartre, Not much , The understated boutique feel to the hotel Its location on a quiet back Street with numerous places to eat drink and shop nearby and near public transport links to the city centre 
220730,Le Relais Montmartre, Getting used to small hotel rooms but that s Europe , Location was excellent for sight seeing and public transport however listen to the staff when they say in which direction to walk unless you want sleaze 
220731,Le Relais Montmartre,No Negative, The hotel was in the perfect location close to the Metro as well as Montmarte It was a beautiful boutique hotel the staff were very friendly and the room was just perfect in every aspect We had a wonderful time 
220732,Le Relais Montmartre,No Negative, It was our first time in Paris and now we are sure that we will stay at Monmartre district and book this hotel again Great localisation lots of coffees bars and Molin Rouge so close We give 5 stars 
220733,Le Relais Montmartre, Small rooms Russian TV channels had no signal Croissants and other bakery products could be more fresh, Very polite attentive staff it s a strong point of this hotel Good lighting in the room Close location to metro
220734,Le Relais Montmartre, Really would have wished for a slightly larger room I was so glad my husband wasn t along with me because he would have felt cramped For the price I think the rooms could be a bit more generous but this is Europe not the USA and one has to remember that space is a premium especially in the much visited cities like Paris , Bed very comfortable bedding top quality good lighting throughout the room but especially the bedside lighting which is so nice for those of us who like to read before going to sleep I rarely comment on the art decor in a room but the art in my room was particularly lovely in very good taste interesting not invasive Staff very nice and helpful thank you Sue room very clean and very very quiet considering you re in a busy area of Paris although this hotel is off on a quiet sidestreet Easy quick and good access to several major subway lines 
220735,Le Relais Montmartre, It is on a metro line which is a little difficult as you have to change sometimes more than once, This is a Boutique hotel with comfortable bed beautifully decorated and extremely helpful staff We had a classic room which was too small with luggage rather book a comfort room which costs a little more but is bigger We did not eat breakfast so cannot comment There are excellent restaurants nearby I recommend Le Petit Parisien and Le Restaurant hotel will give you directions
220736,Le Relais Montmartre, Nothing it was perfect , Second stay here and not a bad thing to say rooms are spacious compared to the typical hotel in Paris brightly coloured decor which is very clean and comfortable Best location for Montmartre area quiet street friendly staff We will be back again 
220737,Le Relais Montmartre, had room cancelled due to another preauthorisation of card few days before visit didn t get email to inform me I had to put in more funds therefore only got 1night instead of 3 so make sure funds are in your account a week before visit, From the moment you go in hotel smells so fresh and clean Beautifully decorated and spotless Staff very helpful in wonderful busy area Loved it would be back
220738,Le Relais Montmartre, Other than a better deal price wise but think this is normal for Paris nothing it was all great , loved this hotel for a number of reasons Firstly the warm and friendly welcome from Mauricio at reception throughout our stay Secondly location location location as you are beside plenty of restaurants and bars Thirdly beds the most comfortable I have ever stayed in any hotel and the place is spotless The rooms were fantastic with a minibar available with plenty of varied choice Also the room comes with wifi speaker system which was great especially when we were getting ready to go to a concert and could listen to our tunes in prep I ve stayed in 2 other hotels in this location but this was by far the best for both service and comfort hence I will stay again Thanks to Mauricio and the other staff for making our stay an enjoyable one 
220739,Le Relais Montmartre,No Negative, The staff were exceptionally helpful When we were unhappy with our room and asked for another they worked with us to fulfill our needs The location is also excellent very safe and also well insulated and quiet 
220740,Le Relais Montmartre, Would have been nice to have complimentary water in the room only available in the mini bar , Great location very helpful reception staff Lovely rooms Nice bedding towels etc 
220741,Le Relais Montmartre, did not find any probelms all was perfect , Location was perfect a lot of restorants supermarkets andmeny more the stuff was very helpfull and kind There is a Metro station just a block away Neberhood is quiet and the hotel is not located on the main road 
220742,Le Relais Montmartre, Bathroom slightly cramped but nice and clean , Nice traditional looking place with a bit more character than the average hotel Brilliant location in the middle of everything
220743,Le Relais Montmartre, The room although a decent size was poorly designed this was particularly true of the bathroom The separate loo was silly and uncomfortable to use and the shower was poor it was like being dripped on The bed was ok but poor sheet quality The common area was poor and there was no bar Overall this was not of the quality your rating suggested , The staff were friendly
220744,Le Relais Montmartre, Position of toilet roll holder but gee that is so minor, Staff were very helpful location was great walking distance from transport and the views of Montmartre
220745,Le Relais Montmartre,No Negative, The decor of our room was pinks and lime greens I do not know whether the other rooms are as cheerfully decorated but I enjoyed our room The staff was very helpful and willingly answered all our questions about the hotel and the area The hotel itself was not in the middle of the very touristy area so was quiet and relaxing but not far from the restaurants and attractions 
220746,Le Relais Montmartre,No Negative, Perfect location down a quiet side street close to restaurants and bars Excellent base for visiting all the major attractions in Paris being easy walking distance from 3 Metro stations Hotel room was a good size with a comfortable bed twin beds pushed together but absolutely fine and lovely decor Good size bathroom with excellent shower over the bath Clean and quiet The staff were very friendly and helpful We would definitely recommend the hotel and would stay there again if we were visiting Paris in the future 
220747,Le Relais Montmartre, Breakfast was an additional 15 Euro per person which we knew before we booked however the offering looked poor so we had breakfast just around the corner at Paul s however this didn t detract but added another dimension , Staff excellent lovely friendly welcome rooms nicely appointed and decorated very clean and lovely housekeeping staff Service friendly and helpful The hotel is on Montmartre near the Moulin Rouge and was just 3 or 4 minutes away from the metro line And only 15 minutes walk to Sacre Coeur which was beautiful We would definitely stay here again 
220748,Le Relais Montmartre, No negatives but the double bed was just two singles pushed together , Clean room and cleaned every day friendly staff helped whenever Plenty of local cafes around the corner with great selection of restaurants 5 minutes walk to the Montmartre area with incredible views from Sacre Coeure perfect for a few days in Paris 
220749,Le Relais Montmartre, If you travel with kids it s only possible to book the biggest room no matter what is in the reservation confirmation , Nice quiet place in very busy neighborhood Clean and comfortable 
220750,Le Relais Montmartre, The breakfast at 15 euro each was extremely basic the self service was not easy simple things couldn t be easily located We only ate breakfast once and the remainder of stay went to local cafe far better choice taste good service at about the same cost ,No Positive
220751,Le Relais Montmartre, My booking reservation included an upper floor request I got 1st floor because rooms in the upper floors are bigger and can accommodate more guests Beware the room we got was really small for something that is marketed as superior room Quality price relation completely out of proportion even taking into account the location in Montmartre Cannot really understand the top ratings in booking com , The staff is very friendly and helpful 
220752,Le Relais Montmartre,No Negative, The relais montmartre is in a great location The staff all so helpful pleasant from housekeeping to front desk breakfast was great in bed so filling Great restaurants in area for lunch on corner le relais gascon has great price fixes lunch And there is a brilliant shoe repairer directly opposite to deal with any emergencies It s worth the extra to soak in a bath after a long day or an early flight we paid for early arrival The street is so quiet at night and not many hotels have tea and coffee facilities in room 
220753,Le Relais Montmartre,No Negative, Excellent location We booked a superior double which was spacious clean and comfortable The staff were incredibly helpful and polite Definitely stay here again Had a really fantastic stay 
220754,Le Relais Montmartre,No Negative, Very quiet comfortable room king size beds with really soft pillows Staff extremely helpful and polite Great location Always our choice when visiting Paris 
220755,Le Relais Montmartre, The mattresses could be a little firmer although that is is a personal choice , Excellent location cozy room nice Ritual products in the bathroom nice staff
220756,Le Relais Montmartre, Would have been nice if they could serve drinks in the small lounge They do serve coffee , Wonderful friendly and helpful staff Great room with comfortable bed and large bathroom Surrounded by many great restaurants and bistros as well as all manner of shops along the Rue Lepic just around the corner The Sacre Coeur a short walk away 
220757,Le Relais Montmartre, Nothing, Staff extremely helpful and friendly Location great just a few minutes walk to Sacr C ur and some lovely restaurants in the area The hotel is on a side road so although close to the bustle it s nice and quite at night I think the hotel has recently undergone a face lift our room was extremely comfortable and clean This was our second visit we will return again 
220758,Le Relais Montmartre, Nothing, Fantastic hotel in a great location with plenty of really nice restaurents bars and cafes located in the area The room was really comfortable and the staff extremely friendly and helpful I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing weekend away in Paris
220759,Le Relais Montmartre,No Negative, Great value for money Our room was clean and cozy with a nice window good ventilation and noise proof walls Location in the heart of Montmartre was very convenient Brownie point The chocolates left on the table were super yummy 
220760,Le Relais Montmartre, The hair dryer could have been more powerful , The staff was incredibly helpful and welcoming The room was well appointed and spacious Additionally the hotel was in a terrific location 
220761,Le Relais Montmartre, Breakfast is average but I would anyway recommend having it in one of the many brasseries around , Great location in a quiet street walking distance from Rue des Abesses and the metro Room was clean and comfortable although small for a superior The decor is classic and makes you feel at home The staff is really friendly and helpful Good quality for a 3 hotel 
220762,Le Relais Montmartre, Nothing, Lovely hotel off a side street in Monmatre Got there late staff great and welcoming Helped out next day with taxis and travel advice Would go back next time with the family Thanks to the staff for the welcome and friendliness Clean room interesting pink beams but worked 
220763,Le Relais Montmartre, Nothing really , Cozy comfortable clean and quiet Located on a quiet sidestreet close to metro station Sacre cour within walking distance and streets with lots if different restaurants and caf s We stayed at a superior room nr 405 and there was plenty of space a good bed and view to a quiet backyard Large on the wall widescreen tv and Bose soundsystem Wifi worked perfectly New and superclean bathroom Well balanced decorated in both room and bathroom Effecient cleaning every day 
220764,Le Relais Montmartre,No Negative, The staff are fantastic We arrived at the hotel early after checking out of another hotel that was horrible They had a room ready for us and were very welcoming The hotel is lovely in fact I think they rate well above 3 stars and the location is excellent This hotel was recommend to us and I highly recommend it Thank you 
220765,Le Relais Montmartre, Street noise but that s probably because we haven t lived in a city for over 30 years , We were in Paris to attend a concert at a small theatre a few minutes walk from the hotel so for us the location was perfect Metro only 5 minutes away A good selection of reasonable retaurants within a few minutes Very helpful team who arranged airport pick up and return
220766,Le Relais Montmartre, The room reserved three months earlier that was originaly assigned to us was at the ground level with smell of dust and moisture coming from the carpet After stating that it was not what we could accept we received hostile and cynical responses Finally we had to spend additional time waiting for another room to be available for us This new room was acceptable This was the third time we are staying in this hotel and it seems that current staff would need to improve the attitude and learn how to show better respect the customer , LOCATION 
220767,Le Relais Montmartre,No Negative, My sister and I were booked in however there was a problem with one of the rooms so they organised for me to stay at another hotel not far away My sister became ill on the morning we were meant to leave I was able to leave as she was not sick enough for a doctor but she could not travel for 2 days The hotel was extremely helpful and very caring about the situation I would recommend this hotel to anyone 
220768,Le Relais Montmartre, The location when at the bottom of the hill As a solo male traveler that area when I walked through drew to much attention I walked the top after that But the hotel was great, Staff were perfect English great and were pro active in making my visit as perfect as possible Drew me a map on two occasions to maximise my trip Room was nice and location of you go uphill amazing
220769,Le Relais Montmartre, Our only criticism and I wouldn t even categorize it as that is that the room was small However it is Paris after all and I wouldn t expect more , We loved our stay The hotel was great as was the staff They couldn t do enough for us We definitely plan on returning when we visit Paris in the future Great place and in a great location The area around the hotel is exactly what you would envisage Paris to look like with lots of restaurants shops and interesting places to visit It s also close to the Metro and bus system What more can you ask 
220770,Le Relais Montmartre, Room was darker than the pictures on the internet and was on the ground floor so overlooked the internal patio which is used for smoking Bathroom a little tired and could have been slightly cleaner but perfectly OK to use , Convenient location and lovely to explore Montmartre Room was a reasonable size and quiet despite being on the ground floor Breakfast had a good choice and was good value compared to eating at local cafes 
220771,Le Relais Montmartre, Double bed only had one bedside table Rooms on small side , Warm welcome from reception and very pretty hotel with country style decoration Very clean Breakfast nice quality but not included in room rate Very quiet room 
220772,Le Relais Montmartre, Renovation work going on in Neighbouring complex I could have been given a quieter room but it wasn t offered by the hotel because it was a less expensive room than the noisy one I was booked into No warning of course , Location rooms friendliness
220773,Le Relais Montmartre,No Negative, A small yet nice hotel in the middle Montmartre The hotel is situated in a quiet street within walking distance from the main attractions of Montmartre restaurants shops night life etc and an easy reach by Metro to all the other attractions in Paris There are many restaurants nearby some tourist traps others good ones Our room was spacious and clean The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful Breakfast is at 15 euros a person the food and variety satisfactory 
220774,Le Relais Montmartre, Nothing , Excellent location in Montmartre close to all the cafes bistros brasseries and only 10 or 15 minutes walk to the Sacre Coeur The hotel was spotlessly clean and the staff extremely pleasant friendly and helpful We will definitely stay here again the next time we visit Paris 
220775,Le Relais Montmartre, Our room was small but that is pretty typical for Paris Wi fi instructions in English in the room would be helpful , Very friendly and polite staff well furnished tea coffee making in room quiet street but near many good eating places 
220776,Le Relais Montmartre, Nothing, Lovely clean prettily decorated hotel friendly and helpful staff comfy beds Bedroom a bit small but cleverly designed to include everything you need Good location for accessing all parts of Paris by bus or metro and nice and quiet at night after a hard days sightseeing We didn t have breakfast here so can t comment on that but there is a wonderful patisserie just round the corner where you can sit in plus other caf s locally 
220777,Le Relais Montmartre, The kettle wasn t working in our room but staff were happy to provide us with a morning cup of tea , Lovely location really friendly and helpful staff pretty room Staff helped with making restaurant recommendations and directions to places It was myself and my teenage daughter and we felt safe and comfortable 
220778,Le Relais Montmartre,No Negative, The hotel was extremely quiet we had a wonderful night rest because there was no street noise or noise from other guests at all The location was superb in a lively neigbourhood The hotel was also very clean and staff extremely helpful 
220779,Le Relais Montmartre, A few doors down a homeless person layed on an old mattress Not very comforting to see so close to the place you are staying Not really hotels fault though , Very clean beautiful little hotel Great friendly staff 
220780,Le Relais Montmartre,No Negative, The location of the hotel was excellent in a really romantic area The staff were all very friendly and even gave us a bottle of champagne when we told them it was our honeymoon We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to others 
220781,Le Relais Montmartre,No Negative, could not have stayed in a better hotel in the location just off main areas and quite as wanted and easy reach of a large selection of restaurants in easy walking distance and access to central Paris
220782,Le Relais Montmartre, Bathroom facilities unacceptably low standard for the price There is no way you could go back to the hotel looking forward to a shower in fact we dreaded washing Cleanliness could be better not in the communal areas which were spotless but in the rooms and especially the bathroom The pillows were very old and there were a lot of soft furnishings around the room which did not seem fresh On the one hand there is a little old charm but on the other the place seemed dated in not a great way and the facilities need refreshing , Staff are absolutely lovely people and location is nice and vibrant especially during the morning daytime 
220783,Le Relais Montmartre,No Negative, Beautiful quiet room with great air conditioning convenient location and very friendly and helpful staff Half the price of other similarly rated hotels and absolutely nothing I would improve 
220784,Le Relais Montmartre, Price of the breakfast really over the top at Euros 15 so we eat out which was a little disappointing, This is an ideally situated hotel for the Montmartre district of Paris The room was excellent well presented and clean The staff were very helpful and courteous Would use as a transit hotel rather than for a longer stay
220785,Le Relais Montmartre, There was no free wifi available in the rooms internet had to be accessed from the computer in the lobby , Great value for our stay in August for which I believe the usual prices are discounted The air conditioning was very effective and made for a very comfortable stay during the hot time of year
