497515,NH Carlton Amsterdam, It s not clean this time I found contact lenses on my sink disgusting to say the least The staff can be rude anothe rcounter would open and they wouldn t call you seeing that you are queuing for service Can be racist too although I m an NH member who spends 3200 every time I come to Amsterdam alone Funny how you are allowed to be that in a city that stands against discrimination NH are known for their rude staff I say that as a member my father was a member too would say the same The hotel is very old and in desperate need of renovation some cupboards are glued back together it s falling apart Room service is terrible don t think that you ll get hungry at midnight and be served right away They have no problem answering the phone and telling you to wait In some rooms the phone is not working at all Broken The price is rediculous for what you get services at neighboring hotels are much better I just happen to travel with people that love making last minute plans so it s always my last resort try the DutchStay Hemp friendly apartment the albus hotel city centre the hampshire hotel Eden or the ultimate luxury Waldorf Astoria , I ve stayed here 3 times I found the rooms to be inconsistent Superior rooms have a washing seat where you wash yourself after using the toilet The location is great close enough to museums boat rides shopping centers it s really central It s the main reason I return to this hotel Parking is available driving a car in Amsterdam is a nightmare Close to good restaurants if you get hungry midnight 
497516,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The first room I went too had a smell of smoke none of the lights worked in the room and the fuse box was open I informed reception as I went out to dinner I only had 20 mins to checkin and get out again When I returned late that evening expecting a new room to be made available The night clerk assured me everything would be ok However it looked like no one had been up to the room to investigate or anything it was exactly the same as when I left They gave me a new room key three times I had to make the trip from reception to my room and none of the keys they gave me worked Only when the night clerk opened the door could I get in the room They room they moved me to was nowhere near as good as my original room ,No Positive
497517,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Check in was a bit slow , The hotel is central to many of the major tourist sites in Amsterdam Flower Market was literally round the corner and there are two areas were one is able to commence a river cruise within a couple of minutes walk of the hotel Many restaurants and bars nearby in Rembrandt Square Very easy journey from Airport to hotel via Centraal Station 10 minute journey with ticket costing approximately 5 euros We walked the remainder of the way from the station to the hotel approximately10 minutes but Tram 24 stops right outside of the hotel if you didn t want to walk Rooms were very clean if a little careworn Breakfast was well laid out and varied fresh fruit yoghurt excellent selection of breads rolls and meat and cheese Cooked food also available 
497518,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Very old sanitair and broken shower housekeeping knocks on the door at 9 30am on the day of check out after a long night with friends , Location is great people are very supportive they gave me a percentage rebate for the bad experience 
497519,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Way overpriced for an old rundown hotel Only plus is the central location but on the other hand don t believe their statement of soundproof windows so there is a lot of noise in the room from the street 24 7 ,No Positive
497520,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room as the bathroom were very small and in bad shape The price is increadibly expensive for such service Very disappointing , The breakfast was nice and various
497521,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Window curtains have holes old Shower curtains are dirty Omelette stand is not there for Breakfast which is typically required for a property like this No complimentary water bottles in room which is essential for travelers at this time , All Staffs in reception desk are excellent 
497522,NH Carlton Amsterdam, I was not impressed with the state of the bathroom decor The bathroom side was broken and cracked Dont mess around replace it , The hotel is in a great location to be able to access the rest of the city 
497523,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Rude awakenings both mornings whilst displaying the do not disturb sign first morning phone call to the room it s a member of reception claiming I have an unpaid bill when I m actually fact we had paid cash on arrival this he ignored and wouldn t let me speak and then he hung up on me Two mins later he calls back claiming the same annunpaid bill Went to reception spoke to the lovely lady that checked us in and she confirmed everything is in order Second day do not disturb sign on door again and the cleaners knock twice Also the room was quite dirty with food or liquid on one of the walls and dust along the desk Breakfast was a little disappointing too , Some reception staff lovely
497524,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Dark rooms old paneling minimal access to electric plugs However they did leave a bottle of merlot on the desk every night and the staff were great , This hotel has great people working there but the rooms are old and the air conditioning was simply not up to speed We were not unhappy except to say that it is was nothing to brag bout
497525,NH Carlton Amsterdam, There is a total renovation needed The condition of the whole building is so bad that they have too close the hotel for four months for a complete renovation, Only the staff
497526,NH Carlton Amsterdam, long waiting time at reception not enough towels tiny room broken curtains dirty bathroom room generally in really bad condition, comfortable beds nice view great location really good breakfast
497527,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Everything from the staff to the carpets Staff were slow and very unhelpful The room was very dirty and the air con was very noisy The room looked the complete opposite to the picture show on your website therefore i will not be recommending anyone to use your site and I will not be using your website to book anything ever again Which is ashame because I usually use your website whenever I stay out somewhere I will be leaving a review on your site and all your social media account in the next few days I would hate for it to happen to someone else, Bed was comfy Good location
497528,NH Carlton Amsterdam, there is nothing at all good about this hotel the room is extremely small and you struggle to move around the bed the place is extremely overdue for a refurbishment and is not comfortable For the price you pay it is not at all value for money , Breakfast was good quality and well presented Breakfast room is good 
497529,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Very understaffed for checking in and out very long wait Old facilities shabby rooms Broken chair in our room that was not replaced even if requested , Location Breakfast
497530,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Newer bed would be nice and carpet, Staff were super friendly fantastic location Beds were comfy but made creaking sounds so need to be replaced Hotel is being refurbished later this year so with new beds and paint and carpets being new this is a great place to stay They even but balloons up in our room for my sons birthday 
497531,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The noise, The room was comfortable and the bath very spacious Unfortunately it was quite noisy at night with people shouting in the street Double glazing is a good idea 
497532,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Dear Sir hotel customer care I am currently staying in the NH Carlton Amsterdam The experience has been more than terrible When I arrived my booking via booking com did not showed the person in the reception was making me and asking me if I was sure what was my name asked me to return 30 minutes latter They were able to find my reservation and I was given a room after 1 hour and 4 PM Then I went out to eat and when I came back my key did not work the lady in the reception told me the key will not work if it is near a phone or a wallet after 15 minutes waiting no other place happens this I got to the room and the TV did not work I called the reception and they told me to wait for 20 minutes I had to go down and talk with the manager in charge so he could check the TV Some else joined me and she found the TV did not work and offered to check it by a technician the day after She was trying not to even offer to change the room I insisted and finally agreed I had to pack and get down get a new key and change no follow up call if things were working they could not care less I do not know who is in charge but I guess they do not really care about the customer the experience or the property I understand things might go wrong but the staff is not enough not willing to solve problems or the customer I will take this to social media and review it on booking com , Nothing ver very bad experience they could not find my booking via booking com
497533,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The rooms were not offering value for money Our toilet was smelly and taking a shower was a mission, Location was great did not have to use public transport to get around for shopping and site seeing Breakfast was excellent 
497534,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Cleanliness in the room was no up to standards bedside table and lamp seemed not be dusted during my whole stay Breakfast was boring exact same items everyday , Great location Friendly staff
497535,NH Carlton Amsterdam, I would recommend to do some replenishment on carpet so far and interior in the room as it look quite old , Very good location and easy access to many main area Staff and service is good 
497536,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Rooms a bit tired need a refurb and not cleaned as well as I would like a bit dust on shelves and carpet needed a better hoover, Friendly staff and good location
497537,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Didn t like when we arrived they asked for more money at the hotel when everything was already paid for took 50 off us incase we used mini bar ate a snickers bar and a packet of crisps and only received 20 back from the deposit of 50 annoyed how those two things were 30,No Positive
497538,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room wasnt clean we asked again and again but nothing happend The staff didnt do anything untill manger was involved Very bad I trust booking for its quality hotels and reviews i will not order soon , I liked the location
497539,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Pathetic room absolutely pathetic super duper duper small didnot look like anything in the pictures They dont even have a person to carry the bags, They gave me early checkin as requested 
497540,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room was tiny the beds very hard It wasn t possible for two people to use the bathroom The air conditioning was very noisy sounded more like a washing machine and the Windows had been sealed so we couldn t open them instead We asked to borrow a charger but they said that we must give our devices to them to charge which we weren t very happy about , The location of the hotel was excellent and the transport links were excellent Only took forty mins to get to the airport using public transport which was cheap too The hotel itself was quiet clean with friendly staff 
497541,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Older building could use some remodeling poor air conditioning system outdated bathroom , Comfortable bedding large rooms good views if you re on the canal side GREAT location 
497542,NH Carlton Amsterdam, I was over charged on my bill for items I never had Room was nothing like the pictures very cramped extremely noisy even though I was on the 7th floor Web site led me to believe that the hotel won an award in 2016 yet the hotel I stayed at was yet to be refurbishes Will not stay at any NH Carlton chain again , Location 
497543,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Rooms are quite small and some overlook the wall in front Also hotel is old one so be ready for old style room setup , Central location is amazing 
497544,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The bathroom had seen better days and the area round the sink was in need of some repair These facts did not really affect our enjoyment though as the shower worked well and was lovely and hot , The bedroom was very roomy a large comfortable bed and a good city view out of the window We had a pleasant seating area with two sofas where we could relax after sightseeing The hotel was very convenient for all the popular sights in the city centre 
497545,NH Carlton Amsterdam, A couple of minor defects reported to reception were not dealt with broken shower head and magnifying mirror Although we were offered a change of room this was not convenient and we would rather have had the problems resolved Lighting in bathroom could be better , Breakfasts were excellent and staff very friendly and helpful Brilliant location 
497546,NH Carlton Amsterdam, However the cleanliness was very bad The plasma was very dusty The bath was not cleaned properly and the lamps were all dusty, The location was good and staff was helpful
497547,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hotel is Just old the staff was rude the housekeeping got angry because we stayed in the room and she told me I will not clean your room today One bottle of still water 1L costs 8 5 Euro I booked Standard Double or Twin Room and it was different from the pictures , The location is good near public transportation The rooms are clean 
497548,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Although it was a great hotel to stay at the Wi Fi was terrible and would not work half the time even when I paid 20 euros for the extra fast The Wi Fi is not even managed by the hotel so they couldn t do anything about it except removes the fees for the extra Wi Fi I paid If you are a professional looking to work and have access to a stable connection most of the time you couldnt even connect to facebook this hotel might not be the best choice Also some of the power outlets where impossible to use with adapters and none of them where close to the bed None of them where in the bathroom making if impossible to use any curling or straightening irons , The location if the hotel was excellent walking distance from everything The staff was really nice and helpful 
497549,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Really cheap rooms We got a room with a window that we can t close The wind opens it all the time and the rain comes in In addition the water rope in the bath was damaged so we went to the front desk and after 20 minutes they gave us another room in a different floor Me and my girlfriend in the middle of the night moved to another floor and then surprise the room is so stinking again to the desk and we got another room in a different floor no help by the team of the hotel to move the things in this 3rd room we got 2 separated beds even we booked 1 big bed and the air condition didn t work We stayed in this room because we realized that this is a broken hotel , Great location but 
497550,NH Carlton Amsterdam,No Negative, There were 6 of us and we had the three lovely big rooms at the front of the Hotel I had the The Verdi Suite the rooms are clean and the bed was excellent however the rooms could do with a refurbishment and modernising The staff were very very helpful polite and efficient Brilliant location easy to get Tram 24 from the main station and stopped right outside the Hotel Very close walking distance to Dam square and all the other Amsterdam city sights Would definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again 
497551,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Unfortunately when checking in we had to pay a 50 deposit and took an extra 50 for city tax and deposit for if you use the mini bar or breakfast This was not mentioned on booking So be aware before coming as it may leave you short If paying by debit or credit card be aware they will give you the deposit back but in cash So you may receive hidden charges , Location 20 minutes walk from most places 
497552,NH Carlton Amsterdam, There was an issue with my reservation and the staff wasn t very helpful with it Long check in time curtains in the bath plus the drain wasn t working well and they didn t fix it before my departure , This was my third time in this hotel love the view from upper floors the breakfast is great 
497553,NH Carlton Amsterdam,No Negative, Katja a daytime trainee on Sunday May21st was absolutely fantastic We had a piece of art to bring back on the plane and she gave us a box of expired sponges a roll of duct tape and some large plastic bags It was the perfect packing material She was so helpful and thoughtful and VERY smart A for Katja 
497554,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Unproffesional prepared staff they missinformed us on how much we have to pay in total so i would recomand to write on recipt what you actually pay for not only that you payed x amount of money but also what for in detail bathroom was not completly clean and trash was not taken out, Staff was nice position is relative good easy to get anywhere by foot or bike
497555,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The beds were hard and the hotel did nothing to change them despite request the room service was poor not properly cleaned and consumables not replaced no improvement despite complaint Our plumbing had a problem and we were offered an upgrade but the offered room was smaller We requested a late check out and despite having been at the hotel for a full week were told it was against policy and we d have to pay an hourly rate We asked to see a Manager on Sunday but were told that no manager was on duty in the hotel It s a shame a hotel with potential let down by staff who do not see the need to provide good customer satisfaction I will not return to the hotel , The location is excellent the 24 Tram stops right outside the front door great restaurants very close and convenient for shopping sightseeing and central station The breakfast is really good and restaurant staff very friendly 
497556,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hotel is dirty and run down Drains did not work well in shower so hard to take a full shower Bathroom sink drain also slow Although the site indicates air conditioning there was no air conditioning to speak of in our room very very hot Needs an update and I say this because we were paying 300 euros a night for the room on the weekend this was certainly not good value , The property is conveniently located on the tram line so easy to get to from main train station Also located in the heart of downtown Amsterdam so within walking distance of all attractions museum area and lots of restaurants and bars
497557,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room was old and shabby looking the carpet was stained and worn looking Some stray hairs in bathroom on arrival so not cleaned properly over priced as could have booked five star at dam square for 300 less than we paid through same company like our friends who travelled with us, The location
497558,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Room was dirty and over priced Not as described in pics Tub was Dirty hair from others on bed an bath Lack of pillows asked for addition pillows they could not proved any , Location
497559,NH Carlton Amsterdam, No ice bucket The room service is not 24 hours The kitchen timings is different from the bar timings They do not offer complimentary water The rooms AC was not working , They do change your towels and bed sheets
497560,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Room was straight from 80 s totally out of date Also small bathroom was worn out Sound insulation poor Fortynately we had reserved only one night No reason to never come back We are willing to pay for this price level if we get value for the money this was totally overpriced We suggest a full renovation of the whole hotel , Staff was friendly 
497561,NH Carlton Amsterdam, bed with sprinters in your back tiny bathroom low light semi plugged sink can t close the curtains all the way so there s always light in the morning the crew didn t fully understand us and we didn t understand them , great location nothing more 
497562,NH Carlton Amsterdam, My credit card was pre charged and there was some confusion about the tariff applied which is still being worked on Staff friendly but hard to get in contact with them phone system sends you around between different people and I d prefer an email contact being remote , Good location in the centre and convenient for my business trip 
497563,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Our room was on the first floor which was a bit noisy as the door opened on to a mezzanine above the reception , The breakfast was pretty good a wide choice of things and the scrambled eggs were good The tram stop is right outside the hotel so no dragging bags half way across the city 
497564,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Very compact room with limited space to move You have to climb up a chair to go to other part of the room Such a room with 250 chf is not worth in Value for Money ,No Positive
497565,NH Carlton Amsterdam, A lot of thing the staff was not helpful at all when we wanted to stay more in the hotel they looked like they want us to leave and one of the mangers kept increasing the price on us and the most descanting thing was the cleaning they say that they finish their shift at 3 so for the hall stay we did get our room cleaned only on the first 2 days that was so bad so bad so bad, The balcony was amazing and the size of the room was good and theirs a girl in the office was really amazing with us and helped us alot she was one of the best in the staff I forgot her name shes an African European i think shes an intern
497566,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Checkin took too long Though checkin time is 3 pm we only got the room at 4 pm Front desk is understaffed and there is no concierge so the front desk have to keep running to help guests store luggage take it out etc , Location Breakfast is good 
497567,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The rooms facing the front street are too noisy due to the Amsterdam nightlife The trams can also make some noise If you enjoy your sleep and are disturbed easily request a room in the back The internet service is far from being optimal One would say that the hotel provides it for free but on the other hand we do pay for the rooms more than in other hotels , The hotel is well situated next to a tram stop in front of a movie theater There are lots of restaurants cafes and bars The flower market is right in the corner literally The main shopping street is adjacent too The bathroom is mall but has all amenities and even a bathtub so no floods in the floor There s a free wifi it is slow but can handle even lite youtube session 
497568,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Bathroom was a bit small but not enough to negatively impact this property , The staff were incredibly accommodating The breakfast was phenomenal with very attentive and polite staffing The surrounding area was very conveniently located to nearby attractions The terrace view was breath taking 
497569,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room was in serious need of new carpet a new chair and curtains All were disgustingly stained dirty The door jams entries from the room to the terrace and the room to the bathroom didn t look like they had been cleaned in quite a while We were not comfortable walking around the room without shoes socks only were debatable but certainly not our bare feet We did not use the chair at all and covered it with a towel The bathroom overall was so so the towel drying rack was a bit rusty and creepy but that was mostly a visual issue We are not really very particular about these things normally but have never experienced a room such as this and it really was unexceptable for the price We have paid much less for much better at hotels in the past in premium locations so it was a bit disappointing , The bed was comfortable the location was excellent view from the terrace in our room was amazing and breakfast was wonderful having a fantastic variety 
497570,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Heating in the room did not work Staff were too few and kept us waiting Missing a concierge to take care of missing bulbs in lamp Lights in bathroom is insufficient Staff at reception appeared untrained and effective, The breakfast was excellent plenty to choose from in particular fruit The croissants were among the bests we had this year 
497571,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The price I paid for the room was grossly expensive The mattresses are uncomfortable The queues to check in out were ridiculous with just two staff on the desk when their is clearly room for four staff It took me 48 minutes to check in That is not good enough , The location 
497572,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The a c does not work properly sometimes it s cold other times it s hot they don t clean the rooms the cleaner comes every other day and tidy the bed only no vacuum cleaning or changing the bed sheets nor cleaning the toilet , Location is nice near the blomenmarkt and in the middle between all of the attractions 
497573,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Bath room is smelling bad smell The hoousekeeping is not good The reception staff are not friendly The hospitality of the hotel in general is not good for a 4 star hotel Not worth the money , Location was ok 
497574,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Hotel really requires renovation Carpets have lost the color already closet door did not work Restaurant the same Had a cleaning lady in my room when returned from breakfast still wanted to do stuff like brushing teeth but had to wait until she s done , Great location Clean
497575,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The only off putting factor was the carpet in the room It was old and faded green orange and yellow yuck and the window of the room backed onto offices which isn t a nice sight for anyone Very over priced for what it is but I did book quite late The aircon didn t work so we are lucky it wasn t mid summer during our trip , The bed was really comfortable and the room was fine for what we needed for our stay Clean bathroom and bedroom although small You hardly spend anytime in the room anyway so I can t complain Location was spot on easily walk to any location 
497576,NH Carlton Amsterdam, it was 4 star hotel and they didn t have bell boy so we had to carry our stuff our friends checked in the same day before 3 p m but they didn t let us check in until 3 p m as we arrived at 11 a m the cleaning wasn t very good and it s over prized for the services and doesn t include breakfast i won t recommend it to any one, the location
497577,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hotel is a bit oudated the cleanliness of the room could be more upgraded the first 2 nights the room maid was not doing her job well the glasses and cups was not washed but the days after until checked out the room maid was doing very well , This is my third times staying at the NH Carlton Hotel location and ease of publc transportation is my priority why I like NH Carlton Hotel Amsterdam Besides the reception staff was helpfull most of the hotel staff also kind and responsive I checked in on April 27 morning and right away I got my room doesn t need to wait until 14 00 noon stayed for 6 nights and enjoyed very much 
497578,NH Carlton Amsterdam, No aircon rooms were boiling We asked 3 times for them to turn main aircon on Said couldn t as they don t switch it on in winter Curtains were dirty and torn terribly If u opened your windows it was so noisy you couldn t sleep because of noise, Location was fantastic
497579,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Very long lines at reception always Noisy rooms even on the 7th floor AC doesn t work in both of our rooms Heater won t turn off took staff one hour to figure that out still didnt fix it I had to sleep into a steamroom tempreture Staff is not helpful at all , Location
497580,NH Carlton Amsterdam, When checking out receptionist tried to charge us an extra 90 euros on top of 615 euros already paid through booking com for 3 nights room only Told it was tax but spoke to manager eventually and owed 29 euro tax I was under the impression that the tax had already been added on by booking com Not happy , Good location comfortable room property easy to get to using public transport from the airport
497581,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Room 529 that I stayed The sink was broken the hose of the shower was broken and water was leaking the room was very cold and eventually one of the employees brought an electrical radiator to warm it up , Employees were doing their best The condition of room 529 that I stayed was awful the sink was broken the hose of the shower was broken and water was leaking the room was cold I am a world traveler and I have never seen any Carlton Hotel in the world in a condition of maintenance as bad as the one in Amsterdam 
497582,NH Carlton Amsterdam, All the rest This hotel is far from luxury standards I definitely recommend not to stay in this hotel Staff is nice but not really competent Cleaning equipments rate price vs quality is very low Don t be silly and for the same price get something much better , Nice staff Great breakfast
497583,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Our room was tiny Twin beds pushed together and no room on one side to get in to the bed Carpet was completely worn This place needs a complete refurb Paid 654 euros which was extortion for the room state , Location was great
497584,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Room wasn t very clean stains on wall and side of bed Wanted to pay in cash but hotel had already charged my credit card , Ter marsche burger bar downstairs Really handy location but roadworks outside made getting in and out of hotel very tricky 
497585,NH Carlton Amsterdam, NH Carlton is part of the NH group Upon our arrival they said that the hotel had been overbooked and that we had to move to another hotel which was further away from the centre of the city so we declined We ended up having to spend one night in the NH Barbizon Palace and then transfer back to our original hotel for the last three nights This was an inconvience and wasted time on our first night in Amsterdam This happens a lot from what we witnessed just walking through reception This really put us off returning to Amsterdam because even though we had a confirmed booking email in the NH Carlton they gave our room to someone else Very unreliable ,No Positive
497586,NH Carlton Amsterdam, 1 unprofessional and rude stuff at the reception 2 very old hotel with a very old furniture never renewed 3 smiley toilets and uncleared 4 the room price is very high in comparison with the hotel services quality facilities In my opinion as regular traveler I think this hotel deserves 2 starts not even 3 and I don t recommend it to anyone very bad experience , The hotel location only
497587,NH Carlton Amsterdam, First of all during check in my credit card was overcharged for one extra room After my direct objection on he same day though I was told by the receptionist that the receptionist corrected it by herself I learnt during the checkout that it was a lie She did not make the necessary corrections at all This was confirmed by a much more experienced kind gentleman working in the reception Secondly the room I was staying was not clean at all There were red fingerprints in the restroom door There was even no dress hanger at my room In the second day though it was clear that my shirts were drying in the chair there was no correction by putting something They even did not put clean plastics glasses for the second day After paying a fortune for two days these examples convinced me that I will never ever stay in this hotel again , I liked the service provided during the check out 
497588,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The whole sorry experience, We couldnt get anywheree near the hotel by car all access roads closed staff finally admitted this and stopped guiding us in Car park Non existent Farcical 
497589,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Better tea coffee facilities in room No milk provided , Breakfast great Fresh fruit pancakes and good choice of pastries Staff friendly Good central location Walking distance to bars restaurants and shops 
497590,NH Carlton Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful they provided a city map and directions to the most popular landmarks in the city The breakfast at the property was amazing offering meats cheeses eggs bacon sausage and a large assortment of breads fruits coffees and juices The property is located in the heart of the city with easy access to all of the landmarks 
497591,NH Carlton Amsterdam, We arrived a bit early and had our bags in locker till room was ready at 300 sharp it was ready but would have appreciated it more if it could have been ready a little bit earlier since we were tired of travelling but they took our luggage to the locker and we were free to roam about till room was ready , the location was perfect in every way near to the train station to all major shops to nighltife The bed to our standards was huge and comfy 
497592,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room was dusty Once I lay down to rest my whole body felt itchy I got few bug bites from it The bathroom smelled like sewage for the first day Towels smelled like vinegar and it was very tough Staffs are trying to be polite and patient but you can tell that they are getting irritated while we were checking in The most disturbing thing among all is that on the 1st day one of the staff came into the room after knocking the door for few seconds without permission Which was a big surprise but he did not even apologize for this action He just asked whether the fridge was fine or not and left the room , Location and Breakfast 
497593,NH Carlton Amsterdam, In general the reception and some of the open spaces could do with brightening up The reception in general looked very dated , Hotel was bright and clean Bed was extremely comfortable Bathroom was clean with a good size bath and a powerful shower Wonderful large breakfast room with lots of Windows and very high ornate ceiling Breakfast was very nice but if not included in my opinion pricey 
497594,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hotel could do a refurbish new carpets paint , Its in the center you can walk around and find variety of restaurants and shops Just beside the flower market 
497595,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The wifi could have been better plus our room didn t get cleaned for 2 days which was annoying but not the end of the world We did have a problem with the heater in our room but they did fix it , The location was absolutely amazing you can walk everywhere It was nice and clean and we got a balcony which was perfect 
497596,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Lighting in the room no very bright for putting on make up or reading, We were Upgraded room 609 6th floor Growns were nice touch good shower plenty of room in the bathroom and room
497597,NH Carlton Amsterdam, There was nothing about our stay we didn t enjoy , Staff very welcoming pleasant and helpful Had a small issue with our room and no problem to change Lovely hotel great location would definitely stay again 
497598,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The bath was a little bit small, Great location close to the tram that will take you everywhere Room was just fine on the 6th floor with view to the city Breakfast everything you need to start your day The crew were great realy helpful with every question we had You have everthing around you market for groceries restaurants but hey Amsterdam made for bicycles and legs that will take you where ever you want The hotel is a little bit old and you can see it intje lobby and in the rooms 
497599,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room was appalling filthy linen curtains and just overall dirty Carpets were threadbare The view from the room just re iterated what the room was like ,No Positive
497600,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Absolutely filthy could smell urine in the bathroom only to find on the morning we left someone had passed urine up the bathroom door and it had been left Bare wires on lamp dirty stains everywhere Was promised a nice room , The bed
497601,NH Carlton Amsterdam, I requested for the room to be modified before going as it was a special occasion yet they didn t do anything for this I have previously stayed in an NH hotel before for an occasion and they upgraded my room and brought gifts When I got there I tried explaining but the language barrier meant nothing was done to the room They didn t give me a menu to add balloons or other gifts at an additional price like they had done before which was a little disappointing as a little extra detail in the room would have made the holiday , Breakfast was excellent
497602,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Coming in to the hotel desk at 22 30 after a 700km day drive and find out that our rooms were not reserved for us due to the fact that booking com website was publishing free rooms and confirming my reservation in the hotel after the hotel was already fully booked that s what the reception representative at the hotel told us We had to take the offer that they made to us and walk with our luggage to a nearby hotel run by the same net and stay there , The location and the upgrade we received from nh Carlton to nh Collection 
497603,NH Carlton Amsterdam, You should book if you want to stay in the heart of Amsterdam in decent but not extraordinary conditions and you don t care that much about the money you pay The room we stayed was relatively small but clean enough to not get angry One thing that bothered us was that the person checking the bar was knocking and entering without waiting for an answer while I was taking a shower Also if you use room service the price for delivering the order is very high Overall bad value for money paid , The location is great The view from the balcony was also enjoyable

497634,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The heat was not working in my room They brought in a space heater which did not have the capacity of heating the room , The hotel was located in the center of the city 
497635,NH Carlton Amsterdam, It can be quite noisy at night especially on the weekends even though we were on the fifth floor , I like the staff at the front desk especially Mike who was very friendly and helpful The location is excellent It is within walking distance to many interesting places and shopping areas Next to the famous flower market and close to many quaint cozy cafes and affordable restaurants too 
497636,NH Carlton Amsterdam, When I arrived at the nh carlton we checked in and was given our room As soon as we got inside the room we could see the place had not been cleaned correctly and there was hairs on pilliow case and inside my bed I did make a complaint to reception as I could not sleep in that room as I felt very dirty after seeing hairs and items uncleaned I also took photos of the room as I couldn t believe this is standard we got at the nh carlton I felt my money was robbed as all we had was our room changed and that wasn t even clean either but by then we had spend long enough trying to sort out our room We accepted the hotel didn t care and tried to make the most of our holiday but never would I recommend any one to stay there ,No Positive

497638,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Mainly the only thing we didn t like was the bathroom it just needs a bit of updating as there was quite a bit of rust Also toilet lid was badly discoloured I cut the underneath of my toe whilst in shower as the plug waste was badly eroded and had a sharp piece of metal sticking up Though my toe bled it wasn t for long so didn t cause a fuss I managed to bend and take the sharp piece and threw it away save the next person having a sore toe But in saying all this seriously the shower was in good working order The bathroom served it s purpose and you go to Amsterdam to get out and see the sites not to spend most of your time admiring the room bathroom lol , Room was clean and tidy Very comfy bed Had an amazing view from 3rd floor Balcony overlooking the amazing awesome Amsterdam sites tea and coffee in room too good value for money hotel in good location Just 20 mins walk from train station and everything was close by Red light district is an eye opener Warm waffles topped with so much toppings are a must They are to die for Look around though if you pop into any supermarkets as some don t put any prices and you end up paying 7 euros for a small bottle water and bag of crisps ridiculous Watch out for the bikes lol not much traffic which is nice but the bikes are everywhere and just come out of nowhere Think they have 1st priority over everything lol oh and if you re trying to find the IAMSTERDAM block as we were it s next to the van gogh museum which is worth a visit too take an hour canal ride too Didn t cost much and was very pleasant We only stayed for 3 nights and couldn t fit in all we wanted to do would love to go back but in warmer months as it was cold and had sleet on last day brrrr

497640,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Although several front desk personnel were quite helpful there were a couple in particular who were not pleasant We had small children who were irritated and not perfectly behaved at all times and Americans who didn t speak any Dutch so maybe that did play apart , The location
497641,NH Carlton Amsterdam, That they don t have staff 2 carry out bags and sometimes they just entre the room without even asking even if I kept Do not distrib I see they come in the room 2 clean it, I liked the location of he hotel and the size of the rooms and ofcourse balconi
497642,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Nothing, The location of the hotel was perfect Very central It was comfortable spotlessly clean and the staff were pleasant and helpful As with all hotels they bumped up their prices as it was New Year but overall comparatively good value for money Would certainly stay again

497658,NH Carlton Amsterdam, A suprise add on to my final bill on check out of the City Tax after I had paid in advance for the special offer This was not made obvious at the time of boooking the trip monthe before , The mattresses were very comfortable however for a large double they gave us two single duvets 
497659,NH Carlton Amsterdam, I have stayed in this hotel 9 years ago and was happy with it so I was skeptical towards the reviews of other travelers boy was I wrong The hotel is in such a bad condition hard to believe this is possible in the middle of Amsterdam carpets were soooo old and fitlhy dirty and by this I do not mean a spot here and there Our bathroom stank of urine yellow spots behind the toilet the bathtub was just discusting The hotel corridors were smelly as well The only thing why we havent left immediately were the clean though old and washed towels and bedsheets This is not a four star hotel two stars maximum and absolutely not worth the money , The location is very central the bed was comfortable the view was nice had a sixth floor standard room with a terrace 
497660,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Bad pillows The rooms was freezing no blankets more i was very cold Warm air doesn t work, Great location and the view from the balcony of my room on 7 th floor

497664,NH Carlton Amsterdam, I had to pay for an upgrade and never even got the balcony Room 116 The sink must have a blockage as it wasn t clearing as it should it took a lot longer than it should The room was very noisy for the Main Street I expected that in the main square but not where we were With our room being on the first floor at the end of the corridor we heard every single other customer come and go For this being my brithday I was willing to spend more money for the occasion but felt let down having stayed in cheaper places to a better quality I d go back to Amsterdam but not this Hotel , The bed was spacious but hard For me it was okay but not my girlfriend 
497665,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hotel was not properly cleaned and maintained Housekeeping was poor although the staff was very nice and friendly The trash on the floor of the hallway has been there for perhaps over two days since we arrived Walls and carpets are obviously old and dirty One light of our room kept flickering The toiletries in the bathroom were not complete For example there was a shampoo bottle but no shower gel bottle Perhaps they were understaffed during our stay because housekeeping only got to clean our room at 4pm I know because we got back to the hotel by 4pm Bed linens were not ironed Wifi was very slow , The location was perfect and our upgraded room was very spacious and had a beautiful view The hotel was nice enough to upgrade us to the biggest room available for free when they made a mistake on our booking They charged a cancellable booking in advance when they should not have 
497666,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The rooms were absolutely filthy We had requested double beds and ended up with 2 single camp beds in each room There was some sort of party going on until late into the night and it was an appalling experience all round , Good breakfast
497667,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The bedroom carpet in our room really needed replacing due to staining but I believe the management have a programme of reburshment well underway Small bar in the foyer didn t seem to be manned even though it stated it was open from 1030 to 10pm didn t actually see anybody use it during our 3 day stay which was a shame as it would have been nice to use it at the end of a days sightseeing rather than rely totally on outside bars , The central location is the hotels main asset close to and within walking distance of most of the city s main attractions and is a great place to base yourself for sightseeing It is a clean comfortable hotel situated next to the excellent flower market and is also surrounded by all types of restaurants to suit all tastes Would I book this hotel again most definitely

497671,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hotel charged me an extra 60 00 and have still not replied to any of my emails and I am still waiting for response Absolutely disgusting that they can just take money out of my account and not respond regarding this , Location was good 
497672,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Called housekeeping reg the heating as my room were freezing they said all the heaters was with other guests but they would look into it and get back to me Never heard anything and the room stayed freezing Also called roomservice to order a meal They said it would take 20 min After 15 they called me back and said they had run out of that dish I ordered something else and the bred was old and soggy and it tasted like a microwave heated frozen dinner , Loved the receptionist who checked me in and out Amazing service and can do attitude Good bed too 
497673,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Very overpriced Needs a good decorate Carpets are dirty Curtain pole hanging off wall Very poor shower Drips out , The hotel is in a perfect location 
497674,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hotel needs modernising to be 4star its a 3 at a push Front desk staff could be friendlier Also would be nice if you could get an iron sent to your room rather then using one that hardly worked in a room on the 7th floor, Location and late check out
497675,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The bed was 1m80 But so were the sheets so the sheets were NOT big enough for two people There were a lot of hairs and remains of soap in the drain of the shower and the lavabo , The staf were very friendly The location of the hotel was great 
497676,NH Carlton Amsterdam, We were asked if we wanted to upgrade our room for an extra 20 euro a night which we jumped at So was very shocked when we saw our superior room was tiny and had not been decorated in a long time The price we paid was rediculous for the room we were given Dread to think the size of a standard room I phoned reception to check we had been given an upgrade I was told yes and their standard rooms are even smaller The bathroom was tiny and the shower was terrible We spent almost 500 for 2 nights and the room was a massive let down We paid half that for 2 nights in Rotterdam at NHow and the room was out of this world , Bed was comfortable and room clean Staff lovely and helpful

497679,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Old shabby renovated decades ago Staff unfriendly indifferent to your problems They advertise parking possibility when in reality there aren t enough spaces to cover the need Will not stay there again , Only the location 
497680,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Unfortunately for us there were road works directly outside our window for the whole night we stayed so we didn t sleep When said to man on reception at 4a m he gave me ear plugs They didn t block out the drills or whatever were making the noise outside , Great location within easy access of all landmarks and tram only 2 minute walk in Rembrandt Square Good bar and restaurant in hotel and breakfast was large and varied 
497681,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Rooms dated and balcony door repeatedly opened during night due to breeze We were unable to lock it on our 1st night and felt unsafe The next day at 12noon we reported the problem to reception When we returned that evening at 8 no action had been taken to resolve problem When we complained the 2nd time we moved rooms, Manager who helped us with our complaint was helpful
497682,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Rooms are a little small but a huge bed and huge tv , We were given a bottle of prosecco strawberries and chocolate for my husbands birthday brought to the room compliments of the Hotel 
497683,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Air quality was poor in our area of the hotel stuffy we were in a room with windows that did not open so no air circulation However trade off was a nice large room , Perfect location central to everything Great staff very accommodating and welcoming Lovely clean facility 
497684,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Overpriced Smelly dirty dusty toilet was nasty room was disgusting pics not match at all with the room rating it as four stars hotel is a bad joke stay away from this hostel we travel quite often and don t know if we use that brand anymore not recommend at all for this price u can find much better options, Location was good

497687,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The central location was noisy with bar goers until 4am Thursday night sleeping impossible This is not the hotel s fault but if you don t want to be out until 4am yourself ask for a quiet room What the hotel can improve is cleanliness carpets filthy and room smelly ,No Positive
497688,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The other guests were shouting some 10 15 mins along the corridor and no staff was there to quieten the guests Some staff at the front desk were unfriendly , I requested to change room and it was done immediately

497691,NH Carlton Amsterdam, This is an old hotel that has only been minimally updated The bathtub didn t drain properly The rug was worn The decor was tired Worst of all the room was noisy One night a combination of construction and music from a club went on until 2am Hard to sleep , The breakfast buffet was quite nice 
497692,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Very dark and dated hotel Bedroom was small and in bad need of decorating Carpet on floor was disgusting would not walk barefoot on it We both got some kind of bug bites in room Way overpriced I was very disappointed as this was a suprise trip for my husbands birthday and this was supposed to be a treat we have stayed in much cheaper better accommodation in Amsterdam before, Location was good
497693,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The first night we were in a room on the 3rd floor It was shocking I couldn t get to the toilet because it was behind the door and there was no room as I had to go on crutches I had rung up from Ireland before we went and was told that we would be given a large room The specially adapted room was occupied on the first night At least we had it the second night , The breakfast was excellent The second night we were moved to room 108 as I use a wheelchair and needed a proper bathroom That was very good but the matress was very lumpy 
497694,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hour wait to check in Being given someone else s room then having to sort that out The cracked sink in our bathroom and a cigar smell when entering our room, Very comfy bed and overall good location but was noisy because of where it was
497695,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The original service was not great but the second person was really nice to deal with , They upgraded us to a deluxe room because the original room they put us in smelled of smoke The upgraded room was really nice

497698,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hotel is 3 max There was even cockroach in the bathroom No robes or sleepers Bathroom size is tiny Furniture from 80th we came two people but everything in the room was only for one Sink was broken Awful ,No Positive
497699,NH Carlton Amsterdam, As most hotels in central Amsterdam they are overpriced This hotel is no exception To pay an extra EUR29 per day for the breakfast buffet on top of the already high room rate is just ridiculous The buffet did not look that great to suggest such exorbitant rate would be justified I only had breakfast in the hotel one morning and instead just had breakfast for less than half the price in one of the cafes nearby Or simply grab some nice food and a coffee from one of the nearby bakeries The room was overlooking one of the streets with restaurants and bars so Thu Sun night usually means drunk people yelling off the top of their voices until 5am in the morning The room s windows weren t sealed that well to cancel out the noise In fact the first night I got up twice to check that all the windows were closed completely which they were but it was just that noisy , This hotel is located in the heart of Amsterdam so basically all attractions are within walking distance The flower market at Singel and several restaurants and bars are just around the corner The room was clean and the bed comfortable The staff were friendly There is free WiFi The burger bar on the ground floor offers nice food 
497700,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Waiting around to check in as our room wasn t ready after 3pm check in and at the price we paid we shouldn t have to wait for our room So very annoying and not a complimentary drink to make it feel better, Lovely room and great view looking out onto flower market and canal Very big room 
497701,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Staff completely clueless Hotel is old and rooms are run down Problems with checking in and checking out Not able to provide simple invoice and simultaneously rude about it all In fact I have never had combination like this but this was probably one of the worst organised hotels I stayed in since a long time I DO NOT recommend considering choice of hotels in that area , Location
497702,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The furniture is slightly dated Bad smell emanating from the drains bathroom the solution to which could not be found , The location was excellent Most of the staff were very friendly and helpful New staff being trained on the front desk were more pleasant and helpful than those doing the training as the latter thought they were above the new ones Not a good attitude Breakfast was of a high standard 
497703,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Staff was very slow and rude check out took forever Smell in the hallways the best days of this hotel were gone long ago , Location was very good 
497704,NH Carlton Amsterdam, I requested a double bed and got two singles pushed together Pillows were very poor Room was grubby Bedroom carpet and chairs were dirty Wallpaper coming off the walls Very noisy at night time as our room was st the front of building , Location was good
497705,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Reception slow and male staff grumpy Failed to clean room one day but someone had been in room to put clean towels in and removed pl clean my room notice Rang reception and was told only clean every other day So had to make own bed and only 1 tea bag Complained when checked out and was told only changed sheets every other day so was given wrong info Was offered a voucher for better room if we came again But don t intend to visit Amsterdam again , Spacious quiet room comfy bed
497706,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room wasn t very clean Dirty ceilings old food in the mini fridge , The location and staff were both fantastic The breakfast was also really good 
497707,NH Carlton Amsterdam, It is totally a big disappointment Pictures in booking com don t reflect the actual condition of the Hotel It was the dirtiest hotel we stayed , Only the location 
497708,NH Carlton Amsterdam, It was really dirty I have photos Carpets curtains elevators The AC didn t work room number 442 at worst of all internet was extremely slow I had to pay an upgrade which didnt work properly due I have accessed the system previously under the free scheme Sincerely one of the worst experiences or the most ever I have to travel quite a lot and this is a new low ,No Positive
497709,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Bedroom was filthy smelly and tiny for a twin room I had to complain and eventually was upgraded but asked to pay more Totally disappointed with staff attitude ,No Positive
497710,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room size was a bit small but everything in the Netherlands is small so I wouldn t really say it was a negative just something you need to expect , This place was just south of the city center I loved its location was walkable right next to many shops and restaurants What was even better was at night the neighborhood was relatively quiet but it was a short walk to all the nightlife Amsterdam has to offer Also they lock the doors after hours and you have to be buzzed in so it was nice knowing they have extra security 
497711,NH Carlton Amsterdam, This hotel is in desperate need of refurbishment however this is reflected in the price when you compare to other hotels in the neighbourhood The bathrooms were unclean Staff were slow to check in and unhelpful rude at times One staff member actually muttered to herself in Dutch whilst trying to deal with my query that was very rude , The location is perfect 
497712,NH Carlton Amsterdam, On the second floor to the front of the hotel was nota good idea you can hear al lot of the street noise including the yelling drunks at 4 AM Hundreds of bicycles parked some badly on the sidewalk in front of the hotel hard to walk around them , It had AC as the weather was very hot the breakfast was excellent It is centrally located next to the Amsterdam Flower Market can walk to just about anywhere in central Amsterdam Lots of restaurants all around 
497713,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Room was old fashioned bath was stained carpet was dirty cigarette ends swept in the corner of balcony no chairs to sit on the balcony Don t be fooled when you walk into the reception Not worth the money that it cost , It was central to everything 
497714,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Was disappointed in the standard of the room which was dated Hospitality tray was never refreshed throughout our stay and cups were stained , Central location
497715,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The internet is terrible , Once I complained about all the issue I had with my room Then steps were taken to solve the issues which I appreciated Because of this I decided to come back to the Hotel On my return from London the asst Manager gave me a special room at a great price and that made me feel special 
497716,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room was described to me as a suite upon check in so I accepted it sight unseen However it turned out that it was just a badly laid out over sized space with a filthy and threadbare carpet and scruffy furniture Plus despite repeated requests the teabags in my room were not replenished Certainly not worth the 160 euros per night I paid for it ,No Positive
497717,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Carpet in room very dirty in places smell of urine in bathroom when we arrived We left some plastic containers on desk and they had gone when we returned , Found the bed comfortable Continental breakfast suitable for all nationalities Lifts to all floors Clean towels everyday
497718,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Room Mold in the bathroom paint peeling old musty hallways old paint peeling carpet torn just aweful Not worth the money , Location in the heart of things
497719,NH Carlton Amsterdam,No Negative, Staff were extremely friendly and helpful big shout out to Juiliette and made us feel welcome and at home The room was wonderful and a great Breakfast 
497720,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The air conditioning goes on an energy saving setting at night which made it hard to sleep and uncomfortable room temperature , The location was perfect 
497721,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hotel itself as well as the room were disappointing for the price The facilities room size and starchy towels do not reflect the rating Also what was considered a terrace is far from what you d expect Some of the rooms face onto busy bar streets which can cause disturbance during the night , The location was good Very central to many good restaurants bars and shopping streets Public transport was easily accessible Several sites in the city are easily reachable from the area 
497722,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Bedroom bathroom in a bit of disrepair wallpaper coming away ballroom grout black in places redecorating a must Cigarette ends left on terrace balcony chair covered in crumbs from previous occupancy Definately not worth the money , Breakfast was great
497723,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room was very small two singles pushed together to make a double bed then two single duvets Very close to the window so no room to walk around the bed to get into it The sink was cracked and a dirty brown stain in it The maid changed the towels and emptied the bin but didn t even make the bed , The reception staff were very friendly and helpful 
497724,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Our request for an extra child bed via Booking Com had not been noted We arrived after 11pm and they suggested that we should sleep three in a bed for the first night It took over an hour for them to agree to find a room where an extra sofa bed could be made up for us two very tired children and one grandparent , 1 Excellent breakfast 2 At check out when I complained to management about their inept reception on our arrival they dealt with the situation professionally 
497725,NH Carlton Amsterdam, One of the staff members here was very rude because I asked him for water He told me to shut up in front of other guests and was so intimidating and rude The director is investigating and offered us a free ride to the airport for compensation but that kind of behaviour by reception staff was absolutely disgusting and have never experienced that anywhere before All other staff were amazing but this shouldn t have happened at all just because I asked for a jug of water ,No Positive
497726,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Hotel was dismal shabby and dirty Although staff were friendly the systems were poor eg check in procedure took almost an hour We requested 3 times that the flashing light on our phone be switched off nobody came Ended up putting a pillow on it Our room was advertised with a terrace Huh This was 2 feet wide and you would have had to climb out of the window to stand on it It was filthy with cigarette ends and used condoms , The location was good Staff were friendly 
497727,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Check in and out is log tedious process Room was dirty bought the advanced wifi with no wifi signal in room Rooms are extremely out dated and old Airconditioning barely works , Location
497728,NH Carlton Amsterdam, If anything it was a little too small and could ve been cleaner The stay was a bit pricey and the room service breakfast is way too expensive but you can order outside takeaways to deliver too your room Overall the hotel was lovely though can t really complain , Room was a little smaller than expected but was still comfortable we loved it Especially the view from the terrace and how comfortable he bed was Couldn t fault the location Staff on the front desk were very polite and helpful Would stay again 
497729,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The rooms need serious renovations and did not meet our expectations and wrongly advertise pictures are nice but not in reality Curtains with holes and furnitures and carpet dirty For me the hotel is only worth 3 star, Location is central
497730,NH Carlton Amsterdam, the fact that 2 English breakfasts cost me 44 and didn t taste nice at all also the time it takes to check in and out , Room was really nice and was central to most of the attractions 
497731,NH Carlton Amsterdam, I send a request 2 weeks before my trip then again a week before and never get any response When we arrive I mention this to the receptionist she apologise but never even ask what request was about In our room we have 2 twin beds but we are requesting double We are not a kind of people to complain so we leaved like that but after all that we decide to never comeback to this hotel On top of that we have to pay 50 euro deposit for mini bar no information on a web about it , Location is absolutely great Very close to the central
497732,NH Carlton Amsterdam, 4 Common areas very dated a bit institutional Looks a bit like a 70 s throw back Triangular mirror in the room with a flat screen TV stuck to one side Bar is also a bit of an excuse totally incomparable to others in the immediate vicinity but I presume it helps keep a star and prices up , Clean and comfortable rooms Good location with good options for breakfast just around the corner next to the flower market 
497733,NH Carlton Amsterdam, We were required to give the staff without having a receipt 50 euros for having our bags kept after check out They mixed our receipt with another person 3 floors below us and we ended up with their private bank numbers Luckily the numbers were not complete and the person is safe with me ,No Positive
497734,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Although the bathroom was clean there was a very bad smell of urine in it this smell was there from the beginning of our stay until we left 5 days later, The staff were extremely polite and very friendly
497735,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Entrance area of hotel a bit miserable, Updated to a bigger room with a good view Quiet room as no road noise Spacious bathroom with 2 wash basins Hotel next to the Flower Market and easy to walk around canals 
497736,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Had to move from first room allocated as it stunk of cigarettes supposed to be non smoking Very tired decor bathroom was rather grubby and had broken bin replaced Also the tissue box was not hanging on the wall was rusty re hung Paintwork old and desperately in need of renewing in the room especially the bathroom Bed was uncomfortable for us Room was incredibly hot and Aircon unit ineffective noisy When windows opened also very noisy even through most of the night A very expensive stay especially considering the condition of the bathroom aircon etc , Location good and staff were very helpful pleasant Breakfast was decent Wifi worked well in the room although not a secure connection we reckon 
497737,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room itself wasn t up to the standard of a four star hotel Features on the wall were coming off crack tiles on the floor Also the door for the balcony had broke so you couldn t close it properly Value of money was extremely poor and given that i would defiantly look else where to stay next time in Amsterdam , The location of the hotel was very good situated perfectly in and around the shops and restaurants easily within walking distance Also nice added feature was the balcony which overlooked a street with bars and restaurants 
497738,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Room and bathroom were dated We paid for a balcony room and was quite disappointed how small the balcony was no room for table and chairs so couldn t sit outside Reception staff were quite slow , Location was good with tram stops nearby Room was a good size

497741,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room was tired and the bathroom smelt of urine not clean It was also very noisy at night Housekeeping was poor as toiletries were taken and not replaced for 2 days , The breakfast buffet was fantastic and very varied with plenty for everyone and brilliant for gluten free 
497742,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The entire interior is overdue for a make over The carpet should have been changed 5 years ago There was mold in our room And no matter what we tried Dutch versions of Lysol and Clorox we could NOT get our bathroom to smell nice Yuck , The hotel has great architecture and if you are gay it could not be located any better for going out to Regulierdswars Straat The hotel also graciously upgraded our room since no more balcony rooms were available and we had a gorgeous view of the Mint 
497743,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Smelly bedsheets there were bugs in room and we couldnt sleep because of itching in bed sheets Ac was not working we asked for it and they couldnt fix it Avoid please, Maybe just location
497744,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hotel needs to be renowed as many of the hotels in central Amsterdam , Full breakfast Many items to choose and good quality We stayed in an XL room and we felt very comfortable We stayed in the same room two adults and two children aged 10
497745,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Definitely not 4 stars No business center full time restaurant and the luge small bar in the open lobby was poor Toilets do not cleanse the bowl properly and the stairwells were filthy I would not stay there again , Room was fine but dated

497749,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The bathroom was very small You have to close the door just to use the toilet There were broken bath tiles on the wall And the maid never gave us fresh towels even though we left them on floor as instructed to But most of all my very expensive bottle of chanel perfume was stolen from the room My guess is it was the maid I d never stay there again , The bed was comfy 
497750,NH Carlton Amsterdam, 19 euros for breakfast Did not eat breakfast in hotel plenty of great cafes near for half the price, Excellent location Good size clean rooms Would stay again when back in Amsterdam
497751,NH Carlton Amsterdam, There were two occasions when the room wasn t cleaned all day and pieces of a glass that broke had not been cleaned up despite us telling them, The location was great but the cleanliness was very poor
497752,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Mini Bar had already been used and almost completley cleared out with some items half used when we got into the room and then we had to explain that it was not us that used this This is just a small complaint but not something to be expected at this class of hotel, Lovely location and room was excellent The staff were very nice and the breakfast was very good We had a great time for my wifes 50th Birthday and the hotel even gave us complimentary bubbly in our room So to sum it up an all round good hotel with lovely view and right in the middle of everything 
497753,NH Carlton Amsterdam, I booked two rooms one for my mom dad and one for me I informed hotel that pls my mom dad is coming early so give them 1 room as they r old it will be easy for them I booked one room from my dad name also and called and talked to hotel staff also then also they didnt give room to my parents THey reached there 9 30am and waited till 3pm in reception they were damm tired The staff gave room after my arrival that was the worst thing , Location was excellent Hotel was nice

497755,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room decor was very tired it looked like it was last decorated in the early 90 s there was no mirror in the room other than the bathroom Staff could do with some customer service training everytime I went to reception I had to stand and wait for several minutes before the staff bothered to even notice I was there, The location of the hotel was excellent it provides a central hub for walking to all locations in Amsterdam Centrum
497756,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Too long to checkin Front office staff not friendly Rooms smelt of cigarettes despite clearly being marked as a no smoking room Curtains didn t close Bathrooms and sink weren t draining properly Lack of a business center where one could check and print stuff on a computer, Bed and pillows were fantastic However on day two we were moved to another room and we had two single bed duvets on a double bed Seriously Who does that Breakfast was really nice too One young man though was very helpful with getting us thalys tickets to Paris Thanks Shaquille 
497757,NH Carlton Amsterdam, I will definitely stay here again but never with booking com i had to pay another 103 for my breakfast on top of the original 507 and then the city tax so 635 for 3 night s Really way too expensive indeed, The breakfast was really good

497763,NH Carlton Amsterdam, I would have liked to see the washroom a little more cleaner Like moping the floor , The front desk staff was incredible specially Juliette She went over and beyond with welcoming us to the hotel specialty after moving from one hotel to another with in Amsterdam 
497764,NH Carlton Amsterdam, No leisure facilities room was small and didnt include an iron Sink was dirty and blocked Couldnt find fridge in bedroom and generally inadequate for the extortionate price , Breakfast was good

497771,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The 1st room smelled so stale Reception very dark not at all inviting The outside of the hotel is awful I was so disappointed when we got to it The common area carpets are very sad dull dirty The decor in the room is so out if date Nothing redeeming about the place really except it s location, The bay window in our room
497772,NH Carlton Amsterdam, the room was a bit tired especially the bathroom and the carpets furniture and moldings a bit scuffed, friendly and helpful staff good choice of breakfast great location comfortable bed

497778,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Even thought staff was very friendly there was a lack of them Everything was slow and tardy because 2 3 staff had to do everything roles were not segregated , Location and it s next to the famous ter marsch burger place 
497779,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Reception area lift foyer area a bit sterile quite dark styling Lid came off the jug on first use could have caused scalding injury Cost was quite high in our view , Great location right on the tram line Large room with all the necessary in room facilities coffee making facilities mini bar etc Nice view of the nearby area from the windows which actually were able to be opened we were on the 5th floor Staff very helpful with transport options maps etc 
497780,NH Carlton Amsterdam, We had an issue when checking in when I tried to pay for the room with my Visa travel money card The hotel computer system reported the card as being denied when there were adequate funds on the card to pay for my reservation Apparently the desk staff were unfamiliar with this type of card and how it works We had to pay in cash to keep our reservation I have been in touch with hotel management since the charges were still applied to my card and they are trying to resolve the issue right now It was still a stressful way to begin our vacation , The room was a good size although we did get an upgrade from our original room so I am not sure of the size of a standard room Housekeeping service was done daily We requested some extra toiletries and received them The beds were comfortable The location of the hotel was excellent easy to find from the central train station and we were able to walk everywhere

497783,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Some loose tiles on the larger balcony made for a slightly wobbly first walk out to enjoy the views not a big deal at all , With the exception of a very slight hiccup at registration our stay NH Carlton was excellent the staff were friendly and helpful helped with printing tickets and highlighting popular attractions and the room was a good size with 2 balconies ask for room 719 best balconies by far It was my birthday whilst we were away and the hotel picked up on this and left a card and gift in the room for me

497786,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Room wasn t ready at 3pm then was told that if we wanted a room we would have to pay an extra 50 per night as there were no standard rooms left In the end we did get the upgrade for free due to our room not ready, Bed comfy clean throughout
497787,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Hotel badly in need of a refurb Staff that I encountered were lacking at best The breakfast they change 17 50 for was an insult , Awesoem location 
497788,NH Carlton Amsterdam, For the money we paid the room was rather small , We arrived from a long flight from Australia and the lovely girl Desiree let us check in at 7 00 am I have read the horror reviews about this place but we found it to be quite comfortable in a great location Breakfast was excellent with a great view from the balcony 
497789,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Room quality was really poor old dirty carpet outdated quality of furniture just not comfortable and not nice at all Renovation of all areas in the hotel needed, Good quality of the breakfast
497790,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Quite a small room The keycards worked very very poorly , Good location but on a busy street The bed was good Helpful staff if you had some questions 
497791,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Food quality poor cleanliness of first room overpriced rooms that need upgrading reception area needs upgrading plus the aroma of air freshener overwhelming border line sickening as though trying to cover up dampness or cigarette smell , Duty manager Deliah very professional and helpful Location of hotel perfect View of second room of canal picturesque Reception staff polite etc 
497792,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Time to replace the carpeting in the rooms and public areas Nothing else wonderful experience and wonderful stay, The little extras example one morning it was raining the staff provided us large nhCarlton umbrellas for use The breakfast is delicious and amazing and the staff so friendly and attentive 
497793,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Staff at the reception Obviously rude especially the lady who ckecked us in named Larissa She seemed so unhappy with her job frowning all the way We had to say hi before she even acknowledged us at check in when in fact there was no other guest at the time She sounded robotic and when I asked for wifi password and did not hear it at first she answered obviously irritated well almost angry We travelled all around the world and this kind of staff ruin your impression We stayed at NH Berlin prior to our visit in Amsterdam and had a great experience and hence decided to book this hotel Same thing happened at check out you have to literally say hello to them before they acknowledge you Not that we need attention We just need to check in and out One guy said to the other staff pointed at us they are checking out The service is so poor that even Mcdonalds staff are far better On the other hand facilities and location are perfect Flower market is literally outside the hotel Hope the management do something about it at the end of the day it s your business Just you ve got the wrong people for some key functioing role at Front Office They lack of motivation , The property is the middle of the city very accessible 
497794,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room needs a bit of decorating but I know that it s going to happen at the end of the year , Reception looks beautiful Adding a room with a balcony was not a problem 
497795,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Old rooms need a refurb and looked very dingy Down stairs was afrosty reception, Large room and location is only a ten minute walk from many attractions
497796,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Covered in bed bug bites head to toe Will be making a formal complaint Have had to take a day off work and go to the doctors Just awful , Staff were very polite and friendly 
497797,NH Carlton Amsterdam, This room was the worst room that I have stayed in during my adult life It was so tiny that my husband and I had to turn sideways to go around the room and we are both thin The size would have been okay if the room had been clean and well maintained Neither could be said in this case The shower drain was almost completely blocked the faucet leaked there was a bad odor etc I could go on and on I would NEVER stay here again , The staff were all courteous I also ordered room service and my food a simple sandwich was hot and good The service was also good nice and prompt The common areas were fine 
497798,NH Carlton Amsterdam,No Negative, Staff location parking and room were all good Hotel didn t however have a wow factor when we walked in the lobby or our room but was pretty ok in general 
497799,NH Carlton Amsterdam, For the money s light breakfast included would have been better value , Amazing location in the centre of Amsterdam close to the tulip market great for walking everywhere Spacious room with very comfortable bed

497881,NH Carlton Amsterdam, I felt the facilities inside the hotel were not the same as advertised on your site The ironing room for instance was a disgrace 1 terribly small travel iron that didn t work properly was all that was offered even though it stated we could get an iron and ironing board in our room Half the channels were missing on the TV Also no mention of jacuzzi or massage facilities which were also mentioned on your site, I thought the rooms were very clean and staff were friendly and helpful The breakfast voice was also very good and decent food The shower and bath in the room were excellent and the TV was massive

497897,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The hotel is worn down The halls give a small town Holiday Inn type of feeling like there just isn t enough business to maintain and renovate The bathroom is small and old so that you never really can get it clean anymore Security is lax Anyone who gets into the lobby can go up the elevator to whatever floor they want The price performance of this hotel is quite poor I paid 200 for a hotel that should never cost more than 100 , Strangely in this rather dilapidated worn down hotel they get some of the most important things right like the bed the linens the TV Even the room service is quite OK if somewhat limited The staff is also competent The location cannot be beat if you are interested in touristing in A dam

497970,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The breakfast should be included at the price 20 euros a day by person was really expensive I think the carpets had an old aspect also , I really enjoyed the location it has a lot of public transportation options and is also close to a lot of museums and nice places to go The staff are really friendly

497976,NH Carlton Amsterdam, I was quite surprised with how the room looked liked Knowing other hotels in this chain I expected more for the amounts paid Rooms were quite shabby and maintenance was so so Not pleased at all , I like the location as it is really central and makes it easy to get just about anywhere in the city The staff was also very friendly

497983,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Check out slow Bag reclaim poor you had a smart tall chap looking good in the lobby doing nothing When I asked for help reclaiming bag he said queue at reception this was very slow The reception were polite but short staffed Felt that improvements in this section need attention also your lobby guard could do with going to charm school I felt he was intimidating Certainly he could be doing what ever his role was and give access to kept luggage , Location
497984,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Definitely not a 4 star hotel more like upper 2 star or lower 3 star Our initial room was the worst we have ever seen with a beautiful view of a bunch of pipes and cigarette butts Our upgraded room which we had to pay for was still run down old dirty and simply depressing Very poor value for money, Good location decent breakfast

497986,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Hotel was old tatty and a bit worn out Room did not look anything like the rooms on the website Bathroom not nice The reception was extremely undermanned and took more than 30 minutes to check in , Location
497987,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Our room was not ready when we checked in and there were not enough towels in the room Our room was not properly up and we have to get reception to deal with it again The hotel is marketed as 4 but there were no bell boys to help Reception staff deals with most of the requests but you need to wait for them to be free The appearance of the hotel is good but inside the decor desperately need a make over There are dead orchid plants in the reception area which were just left there I am not sure how it is a 4 hotel as I remembered staying there before There was a broken radiator along the corridor on 1st floor that was broken for many many years still there Somehow the agreed price that we booked was changed to a higher amount Not sure why but intend to find out , The location is very good as it is near to a lot of facilities and transport Easy to get to places The staff are friendly and helpful 
497988,NH Carlton Amsterdam, We slept in three different rooms where all rooms smelled of tobacco even though we had booked a non smoking room , The staff was very polite and helpful The location is very central for museum visits 
497989,NH Carlton Amsterdam, Nothing really serious but I found the Wifi connection to be poor and unreliable It was slightly noisy but only to be expected from a city centre location, Location and proximity to restaurants and places of interest
497990,NH Carlton Amsterdam, the carpet in the hallway was dirty and old the guests would leave their food plates across the hallway and no one remove them till next day the bed and pillows were hard the light in the toilet was weak 4 star hotels should not have these mistakes , good to be near the flower market Kalver straat Rembrant close to tram stop

497992,NH Carlton Amsterdam, The room was very tired with damaged and dirty furniture floor and bathroom which did not look as if it was cleaned when we arrived There was blood stain on my wife s pillow and yellow crusty stuff on mine so I turned the slips inside out also the bed was so hard it cut off circulation down my legs and I did not sleep well at all any night On check in we waited in line for others to finish then when it was out turn someone just pushed in from the side and instead of asking them to wait they got served in front of us while we were at the counter no apologies were given The main door was not working for two days and the only in and out was through the small side emergency entrance and people would just stand around the door making it hard to go in or out I can t comment on the rest of the hotel as I only used the room and it was not by any level a 4 star We stay in 4 or 5 star when traveling and this would be pushing it to get a 3 star The overall experience was not good and I would not stay there again when we go back , The location was very handy
