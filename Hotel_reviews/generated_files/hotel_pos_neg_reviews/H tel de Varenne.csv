191620,H tel de Varenne,No Negative, This place is a little jewel of Paris I wanted something particularly French for my visit and Hotel Varenne was everything I had hoped for I chose one of the larger suites which was worth every cent The room was large the bed so comfy and the room was beautiful They even have an elevator albeit tiny but many Parisian and French hotels don t have that luxury The staff are all so friendly and helpful and catered to my needs beautifully and gracefully There is a grocery store across the street an organic store also and a patisserie bakery right next door with delicious croissants to go There are also many places to eat within walking distance The heavenly Rodin museum in the next street Les Invalides a short stroll metro very close 6 minutes walk only a 10 minute walk to the Musee D Orsay and yet this part of town is not as chaotic as other parts I visited I would definitely recommend this place and would stay here again anytime I come to Paris Do be aware that you need to hand in your key each time you leave even if it s just next door to grab a croissant however given the number of pickpockets around and the level of hotel and room details on your key this is for your own safety as much as theirs There is a safe in the room which was big enough to store all my precious items and seriously I forgot to lock it one day and none of my stuff was touched Overall my experience was that it s a great place to stay 
191621,H tel de Varenne, There was not much choice for breakfast but still totally OK , The room was pleasant and very quiet no noise at all from outside or from other rooms 
191622,H tel de Varenne, The internet strength and bandwidth could have been better , The beds were comfortable the suite was nicely appointed and well furnished We especially appreciated the strawberries and chocolate biscuits as our Anniversary welcome 
191623,H tel de Varenne, The room I got was a little old and could do with some redecorating The bathroom door joints could also do with a bit of freshening up , The coffee machine in the room was a real plus Thank you very much for that Very quiet location right in the middle of Paris a little gem hidden from the hustle and bustle Bathroom slippers are a great addition too Would definitely return there 
191624,H tel de Varenne,No Negative, Very accessible and within a 20 minute walk to the Louvre Close to the metro as well so it s very easy to see the major sights in Paris The staff were very friendly and accommodating both check in and check out were hassle free and the pre arrival survey was also really helpful The breakfast which came with our room was very traditionally French a variety of breads jams butter and yogurt it was the perfect way to start the day The room was very comfortable and clean with a spacious bathroom and all amenities We had a great stay 
191625,H tel de Varenne, The rooms are a little bit dated Saw silverfish insects at the bathroom , Good location but a quiet neighborhood Very close to the excellent Rodin museum Helpful hotel staff 
191626,H tel de Varenne, the only issue I had was the location which they obviously can t change with all the government buildings around the area feels isolated at night there were two of us and we never felt unsafe on the street but I would be uncomfortable staying there alone I think and having to walk by myself back to the hotel after dinner , loved the side courtyard liked our room great bathroom and mostly were very impressed with the staff who were uniformly warm and helpful 
191627,H tel de Varenne, My only complaint the very stylish toilette seat was the most uncomfortable ever in both our rooms Recommendation replace them all with a new design They pinch , The rooms were tastefully decorated immaculate and in very good repair A beautiful haven The staff spoke English and were very helpful Jerome Stephan and Beatrix all made excellent recommendations and reservations on our behalf They also helped plan our 1 week excursion into the Loire Valley Will definitely return a third time So many wonderful restaurants within easy walking distance A perfect hub for most of Paris main tourist attractions 
191628,H tel de Varenne, The breakfast area is tiny Too bad they don t offer eggs but the bread and jams are pretty good , The staff was very friendly especially the night watchman who let us in late Comfortable beds complimentary coffee and tea good wi fi The neighborhood is very safe and the hotel is on the same block as the Varenne subway station 
191629,H tel de Varenne, The walls were a little thin , The night time manager was amazing He went out of his way to get me ice one evening after I limped back with what later turned out to be a broken foot
191630,H tel de Varenne,No Negative, What a lovely hotel From the moment we walked in we received great service The rooms were well appointed they were large rooms with a lovely view of the court yard The staff were incredibly helpful calling cabs suggesting great restaurants offering to post our shopping Great location close to all the main attractions Incredibly comfy bed The rooms are decorated in a french provincial style which I loved Even my husband loved his stay here 
191631,H tel de Varenne, Not clear about breakfast options that had been pre paid Some guests had eggs for example No menu was provided to us Quality very excellent French pastries was good though No plug in sink Very annoying if for contact lens wearers , Small hotel with personal attention Courtous desk staff Well maintained 
191632,H tel de Varenne, Communicate could of been better with staff It was all to hard for the staff to arrange a breakfast box in the morning as we were leaving early We also had paid for this breakfast so I feel some yogurt and cereal would be easy enough to organize , There was a confusion with which breakfast was in our room deal 
191633,H tel de Varenne, Breakfast service was a bit haphazard Only one staff member to serve and prepare BUT the food and coffee were good , Great location Supermarket opposite Helpful and friendly staff 
191634,H tel de Varenne, Breakfast was expensive and the quality was mediocre , Location is a short walk from the Rodin Museum The Eiffel Tower can be reached on foot in 30 min Staff were very friendly and helpful Room was large by Paris standards Very pretty courtyard 
191635,H tel de Varenne, Typical French breakfast but taking on the sunny terrace made up for it, Superb little hotel in the country house style First class service Old world charm Great location 
191636,H tel de Varenne, Service at breakfast was a bit hit and miss I was ignored when I sat outside and guests who arrived later than me were looked after Perhaps because I was by myself , Friendly and helpful staff Followed up on enquiries for me 
191637,H tel de Varenne, Would have preferred the mini bar fridge to be empty so we could use it with our own drinks from the grocery store across the street rather then the very expensive prices for items stocked in the fridge, Staff were very helpful and able to speak English the room was very clean and comfortable We were able to walk to some of the major monuments and the metro station is relatively close 
191638,H tel de Varenne, There weren t many restaurants close to the hotel The wifi was on and off every 10 minutes , The beds were comfortable and the Air conditioning worked well 
191639,H tel de Varenne, Wifi was in and off mostly off on our last day , Room was small but adequate for tourists who wouldn t spend too much time in the room anyway But room furnishings and complimentary stuff HDTV fridge coffee maker etc were all great 
191640,H tel de Varenne, Paper cups in the room didn t quite match the tone of the establishment , Super comfy bed and extremely pleasant and helpful staff Perfect location accessible to the sites of interest close to the 69 bus route the best in paris and as featured in woody allen but quiet neighbourhood
191641,H tel de Varenne, Since checkout is at noon hard to get early check in Answer when calling was lets see when you get here Showed up at 12 30 after long flight form Canada and they were able to setup the room by 1 30pm Would have been nice though to have room ready when we got there to freshen up and nap a bit , Weekend in Paris for surprise proposal Perfect hotel were able to bring flowers in room and bottle or Moet to celebrate Location is really central 15min walk to St Germain and Louvres 1 2h to the towers and close to many small charming Cafes and Bistros Really helpful staff printed out google maps of where we wanted to go and greeted us by name Good size room considering price 
191642,H tel de Varenne, As a senior I found the bathtub too narrow to feel stable standing in same and would have appreciated a bar to help with getting in and out , Loved the friendly and helpful staff the french flair to the decor and the location for meals and the metro 
191643,H tel de Varenne, Leaving , This is a charming hotel with friendly staff located in best portion of VII Rue de Bourgogne is filled with boulangeries and greengrocers yet quiet at night Rodin Museum Rue Cler and Musee d Orsay are very close with Place de la Concorde and the Louvre only a short distance It was a pleasure to stroll home at night from the nearby Varenne metro with the illuminated Eiffel Tower and Invalides as a backdrop 
191644,H tel de Varenne, Not much although I never like paying extra for breakfast , The hotel was excellent all round from the comfort and cleanliness of the room to the friendliness of the staff The location was great too 
191645,H tel de Varenne,No Negative, Good location Despite being very close to a number of major attractions the room was very quiet The hotel is small and the staff professional and efficient 
191646,H tel de Varenne, Slow internet connection , Clean comfortable hotel with nice staff I appreciate that from hygienic reasons no pets are allowed Close to Metro stations 
191647,H tel de Varenne, Nothing it was perfect for us, Excellent location very comfortable room staff very welcoming helpful courteous walking distance to Eiffel Tower Museums shops restaurants lovely Pattisierie and supermarket close to hotel very easy to find our way round loved it 
191648,H tel de Varenne, There is nothing I can fault about this hotel , A quiet extremely comfortable charming hotel perfectly located for all the popular sights of Paris The staff could not have been more welcoming and friendly Not only did they recommend restaurants and allow my daughter to practice her high school french they also managed to track down a mobile phone one of our party had left in a taxi to the airport and have it back to us prior to boarding Truly amazing service I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough Our spacious suite with immaculate bathroom was the perfect accommodation for me and my 2 teenage girls Close to key metro stations so travel very easy and a neighbourhood with great boulangeries fresh fruit convenience stores and restaurants Can t wait to return 
191649,H tel de Varenne, Bit noisy when other guests left very early in morning, Staff always friendly and willing to assist and gave great suggestions on local restaurants to eat good and reasonably priced French food within walking distance of hotel
191650,H tel de Varenne, Our family had a total of 3 rooms one of which was a comfortable suite My particular room which I shared with my husband was quite small so not that comfortable for 2 people , The staff was very helpful and went above and beyond to help us make restaurant reservations arrange a van to the train station make train reservations 
191651,H tel de Varenne, It s not even nearly a 4 as the property announces itself to be No amenities not even a running restaurant For what they charged me I am quite disappointed Oh and their preview photographs give a very wrong sense of how the rooms really are they aren t nearly as large as the pics show them to be , It s a clean and ok property but that s all there is to it 
191652,H tel de Varenne, If there is anything to not like it was that the room was a bit tight and the lift was very small , Location was very very good Staff were very helpful except for one minor stuff up and the recommended restaurant nearby was excellent and memorable 
191653,H tel de Varenne, In the description the distance between the hotel and the closed metro station Varenne was 290 meters but the real walking distance is actually around 500 meters because of the route King size double bed was made of two single beds you can feel the gap in the middle although it didn t bother us that much , Spacious and nicely decorated room with comfy bed Very friendly staff Nice neighbourhood central and resonably close to metro station 
191654,H tel de Varenne, No bad experience just that our street view room was very noisy at night with trash pick up stores getting deliveries Also wished there was a larger more comfortable common area , The location was wonderful The staff was helpful 
191655,H tel de Varenne, The lift was very small for several suitcases Service could be slow especially for breakfast perhaps need more staff , Comfortable bed great facilities seperate toilet friendly staff Gorgeous outdoor table settings 
191656,H tel de Varenne,No Negative, Excellent location in central Paris within walking distance of several major tourist attractions Neighborhood is reasonably quiet considering that it s downtown and seemingly rather safe Numerous shops and cafes are within a block of the hotel Room was clean quiet and nicely furnished Everything worked which is unusual in a hotel All the managers were knowledgeable helpful and fluent in English Good continental breakfast at reasonable prices 
191657,H tel de Varenne, Shower head was at a slightly odd position but managed to work with it Certainly not enough of a reason to not return , Location was great fairly central but peaceful at night time Loved the outside courtyard area wished we were staying longer to make use of it 
191658,H tel de Varenne,No Negative, We all had a really great stay my sister and my daughter thought the Hotel was very nice very large bathroom and large bedroom located close to metro and restaurants Will recommend to my friends in San Diego 
191659,H tel de Varenne, Our suite abutted the sidewalk on two sides therefore we had to keep our windows closed all of the time for privacy Being a tourist in France we would have liked to look out to the bustling city , Location was perfect The bathroom was largeand spacious 
191660,H tel de Varenne, Breakfast was bit expensive and you could only get toast croissants if you ordered the continental breakfast which was 15 But on the plus side they served breakfast from 7 12 which allowed for the odd lie in , A lovely cosy hotel in a quiet but central area of Paris The staff were friendly and welcoming and the accommodation was excellent A suite worked well for a family of 4 2 adults and 2 children aged 7 and 9
