479747,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, Unfortunately although bathroom was big and nice it wasn t very comfortable , I was very surprised when I saw hotel and our room It was modern and quite big I really love the window view on the street 
479748,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, Some of the staff weren t as friendly as I would expect but some were absolutely lovely It wasn t a bargain , The room was very comfortable and the shower was divine It is a hotel that feels grand and lives up to its 4 stars It is in a great location 
479749,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, A kettle would be lovely so we don t have to go down the lift to have a drink in the morning , The beds were comfy The views of the buildings were fantastic The staff were lovely The hotel was so clean and sound proof and we felt incredibly safe as two young women I would recommend this to anyone and would definitely stay again 
479750,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, Poor breakfast and really slow WIFI , Really confortable and nice hotel excellently positioned Extremely close to the Barcelona aold town the port pier and lots of restaurants and venues Really easy to reach and find extremely helpful and friendly staff 
479751,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, The mini bar was empty and instead of duvets they have sheets blankets The massive price hike during WMC was annoying I paid a 5 price for a hotel that claims 4 s but is nearer 3 , Very nice rooms good bathrooms immaculately clean check out isn t until 12 and Breakfast runs until 10 30 Location is superb right on the edge of Gothica but facing the other way so no noise 
479752,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, The showers were a challenge to deal with at first and the large shower head in my daughter s room didn t work There was no kettle or coffee pot in the room That would have been a wonderful addition to the room and would have brought up the score , The hotel is right in the G tic quarter and was prefect for sightseeing Five minute walk to the metro and right next to the post office Five minutes the other direction and there s the water Just beautiful The bed was very comfortable and surprisingly quiet considering we were right above the lobby The staff was amazingly friendly and helpful 
479753,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, Its is the warst 4 star hotel i have ever seen Dirty old there was no light in the morning for 3 hours No mini bar No bathrobes no sleepers grey blankets are warst blankets i have ever seen Everything is old and looks dirty , Location is good 
479754,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, Room was discussing old dusty and basically the worst hotel room I have ever stayed in Got stuck in the lift twice even after reporting it to the front desk , Unfortunately nothing
479755,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, Breakfast in the basement is very poor Choice of food was limited and the presentation and quality was very low Not good value at 12 euro, Good central location
479756,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, The bar tender was some miserable awful Asian woman who couldn t understand our Spanish or even our English The breakfast staff were also like prison guards they just didn t trust you They must have some vile clientele as there were signs on every breakfast table warning you not to steal the crockery as you would be charged for it It is a really noisy hotel from the street outside and there must be trains passing underneath because you can feel the rumbling when they pass The room safe required an external key rented for 2 Euros per day, Bed was comfy central location receptionists really helpful 
479757,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, Recepition forgot to call a taxi for my departure but resolve problem in few minits , Hotel is situated like 10min to beach and 5min to centre Perfect Room was clean confortable With airconditioning 
479758,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, Property was overbooked We were initially asked to stay at a sister property after refusing were accomodated in a double room with an additional bed instead of the three person room we had initially booked Hotel compensated us with free breakfast buffet,No Positive
479759,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, Attention to detail with cleaning black mould on the silicone around the bath , Great hotel right near the Barceloneta beach marina area and the Gothic district Great location you can walk everywhere An old hotel that s been given a great renovation to bring it back to life 
479760,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, Our room was a nightmare Very small no natural light and very very expensive for the size of room Definitely wouldn t stay there again Breakfast very basic and staff very surly , The location was perfect and right where we wanted to be The staff apart from the catering staff were very pleasant
479761,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, No kettle in room, Bed was super comfy Near the Marina and not far from La Ramblas Plenty to eat around the area Room was a good size and we had a cot put into it Loved the walk in rain shower Couldn t hear any other guests in surrounding rooms Would def stay here again
479762,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, Did not provide a bath plug when asked several times Room small dark and pokey Walk sideways past bed to get to the bathroom , Bed good location great 
479763,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, The hotel lacks character and is a bit austere however if not planning to stay in hotel much perfect , Location was fantastic right in the gothic quarter Walking distance to beach marina bars and shopping Rooms basic but comfortable Slightly noisy in the morning 
479764,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, The room was uncomfortably warm even though we turned off the heating no air con available in April Opening he window helped but was then very noisy The decor is a bit tired and tatty in places , Great location Close to harbour and gothic quarter Very close to lots of coffee houses bars and shops 
479765,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, the parking place So far away from the hotel and with some strange rule You must take the garage key from the reception and after you will take your car you should return the key back to the hotel there is only one key for all the customers Everyone can imagine how easy it is and you need min 20 min for this ,No Positive
479766,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, Unfortunately the hotel was renovating and there was a terrible solvent smell for the two days that I was here I had to block the vent in the room to help , The location was very good 
479767,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, Room was an inside courtyard View and too much noise especially from housekeeping chatting in the morning Room was also a bit small and climate control not effective, Great location with friendly front desk staff
479768,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, The wifi never worked you get the password on arrival but its not worth having From the 3rd floor you can make out the trains that run under ground but only just and it did not bother me if you were on the ground floor it might be different though, Good location just a 5 minute walk to the shops and cathedral good value for money and i would stay here again
479769,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, Room was very small for 4 hotel it is very strange although it has terrace which was great Never used breakfast as there were nothing appealing not expected from 4 hotel , Location is great in between old town gothic part and beach staff very helpful and friendly 
479770,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, We were disappointed about quality of room remains of smoke bad lighting failing key cards and the general areas a but shabby In addition we found a cleaning lady s glove inside our suitcase They admitted it was lost but could not explain why it was in our suitcase , Location of the hotel is great next to Born Ribera Gotic center on other side and harbor as well

479776,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, I find the bathroom toiletries and towel to be cheap small soaps shampoo sachet and ugly towels , They accommodated an early c i for me I like the hotel decor and cleanliness 
479777,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, Small rooms , Great location to explore the harbour beach area as well as the old town We enjoyed a quiet room on the backside on the upper floor 
479778,Barcelona Hotel Colonial, Honestly not a 4 star hotel im not even sure if its a 3 star hotel The room you get is small they dont offer you anything complementary not even water or coffee or the safe They dont have room service i was surprised they had someone to clean the rooms if you are someone who likes to feel just a little bit pampered when traveling or like to feel youre staying at a nice hotel this isnt for you If you care more about location and need the hotel just for sleeping might work for you but You can still probably find a better hotel around the same area , Location was really good Walking distance to most key attractions including the beach Staff are nice and always smiling and greeting you
