475184,Nu Hotel, The room was very small and the bathroom needs some renovation , Breakfast was very good especially sushi rolls The design of the public areas was modern and stylish The reception staff were very friendly
475185,Nu Hotel, Receptionist not helpful The temperature of the air conditioning in the room cannot be controlled in the room the staff has to do it over the system They refused to lower the temperature below 20 degree Celsius It is summer and it s hot Can t even get proper sleep No plastic laundry bags provided Only provide a line bag with the words NOT COMPLIMENTARY sewn on it ,No Positive
475186,Nu Hotel, You can t control the room temperature yourself It is monitored the same for everyone and it is a locked control We were hot in our room and would have liked it cooler , The bed and the linens are comfy Great location next to metro stop 
475187,Nu Hotel, It s not that close to downtown Milan but still managable , The staff at the front desk Very friendly and very accommodating The design of the hotel is very hip Breakfast comes with a view as it s served on the top floor 
475188,Nu Hotel, Breakfast can be quite limited if you turn up later than 9 15am, Excellent value for money friendly relaxed environment Fantastic location for transport metro only short walk away and 15 minutes from the city centre Interesting rooms especially the giant lampshade Comfy beds and a good shower Breakfast had a good variety of choices and decent size glasses for your morning juice Staff are always at hand and very polite 
475189,Nu Hotel, Rooms are a little too small , A Modern hotel Five min walk to Metro station Udine green line Restaurants supermarket and shops all very close It s in a residential area close to park Very good breakfast as well and staff were professional and polite 
475190,Nu Hotel, Rooms are really nice but fairly small the complete absence of a closet just a rack with few hangers is provided makes it uncomfortable for any stay over few days, The restaurant where breakfast is served has a great view and outdoor
475191,Nu Hotel, Very expensive transfer from the airport for such a small distance There were no windows in the room The air conditioning is off upon arrival by default you need to ask reception to turn it on But even after that it was working very badly , Clean rooms good breakfast good room accessories bathroom items slippers robes teapot 
475192,Nu Hotel, We couldn t open the window blackout but didn t matter for one night stay The juice in the breakfast was artificial , The hotel room decoration is very nice definitely a design hotel The facilities in the room are good so are the amenities It s quite close to the metro station and the breakfast is very good served in this amazing restaurant space in the rooftop 
475193,Nu Hotel, Although the overall design of the hotel is quite stylish the rooms are a bit shabby and need renovation Also a huge lamp hanging from the ceiling just above the bed gives you some kind of a creepy feeling , The location is quite convenient the hotel is located very close to the Metro station and it takes about 20 minutes to get the the center Free parking subject to availability though is another big plus at many hotels in Milan you have to pay 15 30 euros a day for parking Breakfast was very tasty and fresh Beds are very comfortable Staff is professional efficient and friendly When we arrived there was some unpleasant smell coming from the ventilation system which we reported to the Reception and left for a city walk The problem was totally fixed by the time we came back Would recommend this hotel 
475194,Nu Hotel, I asked for two single beds found instead a double bed with a wooden plank to separate the two matresses it looked so weird I think it should be said in advance maybe its normal for the owners they are chinese I never saw this anywhere else Anyway the beds were absoultely comfortable , Comfortable and quiet room 
475195,Nu Hotel, Nothing , This hotel is honestly amazing It s designed in a fresh modern and clear style Really awesome I warmly recommend it It is located about 100 m from subway metro station 
475196,Nu Hotel,No Negative, everything was perfect the hotel is situated in a safe area close to the metro green line the breakfast is absolutely delicious it is very rich in options the standard double room is not big but it is smartly designed the room has all the amenities for a 4 star hotel 
475197,Nu Hotel, The bed was small short I m not so tall 180cm and my feet were outside the bed I requested to have a comfortable bed but it was not possible without a room upgrade , Nice style design and location
475198,Nu Hotel, room far too hot we asked how to lower the temperature and we have ben told that it was not possible the rooms do not have a control , bed comfy clean room
475199,Nu Hotel,No Negative, Everything was just great The rooms are tastefully decorated and extremely clean the breakfast in a beautiful restaurant on the top floor with a wide choice of tasty dishes fresh pastry and nice coffee Staff is friendly and helpfull We were with a car and an option of a free parking was very convinient for us location of the hotel in a few steps from the metro station allows you not to use your own transport in Milan Highly recommended 
475200,Nu Hotel, just minor things just as there is no place to hang towels in the bathroom , Nice modern rooms comfortable bed friendly staff good breakfast clean 
475201,Nu Hotel, Trying to find a place to park my car near the hotel wasn t that easy to be honest, The staff was extra nice I also liked the large and warm bed and the cheesecake I had for breakfast 
475202,Nu Hotel, Instructions on how to use the remote for the blinds , The overall d cor of the hotel and the double shower Breakfast was good with ample variety of food Free parking
475203,Nu Hotel, The window in my room was totally sealed and that was allegedly because of some Milanese regulations about winter time room temperature Anyway the staff kindly opened it to me but it was sealed once again the next day Felt a bit claustrophobic in the room without a proper window , Really nice design hotel Good breakfast and overall clean and nice surroundings Single room was ok size and the bed was comfy Was a bit worried with the location at first as the hotel is in the suburbs but it only takes about 10mins to city centre And there s a supermarket and restaurants nearby Good stuff 
475204,Nu Hotel, The place was a little hard to find but that was my fault , Clean and modern rooms great internet The entire staff was friendly and very helpful The breakfast alone was worth the trip Did I mention the free parking
475205,Nu Hotel, The wallpaper was very dark The cleaners made Kiss outside my room at an early hour which woke me up, The vast range of condiments comfey beds Restaurant and breakfast facilities
475206,Nu Hotel, There were ceratin things where style seemed to override practical considerations like nice bathroom but nowhere to hang the larrger towels up to dry we had a small balcony but it was surrounded by a high wall hanging rails for clothes that were so high up I had to stretch and my wife couldn t reach Nice restaurant on the top floor but again outside balcony surrounded by a concrete wall so no view , Looked really stylsih and our room had many good features spacious large bed clean and tidy bathroom with a large shower cubicle with two shower heads Staff were very friendly and helpful V handy for metro and thus easy to get into the city centre 20mins 
475207,Nu Hotel, Not a lot of dining choices nearby No tourist sites within walking distance always needed transportation Neighborhood safe but unattractive , Nice buffet breakfast Suite was large bathroom lovely Close to Undine Metro stop
475208,Nu Hotel,No Negative, It just takes 5 minutes walk from the subway station Udine Restaurant is nearby and supermarket is opposite The breakfast in hotel tastes very good 
475209,Nu Hotel, design over utility no drawers to keep your clothes and no handy hooks to hang your towels in the bathroom Also having to change lifts to reach your floor These can get annoying if you re staying longer , Great Breakfast selection For me AC worked great and I slept really well all nights Very well located away from tourist areas some really local pizzerias and supermarket close by Metro station also very close and convenient to go anywhere staff were great 
475210,Nu Hotel, Room is very small smaller than your average room in Paris , Modern hotel comfy bed polite staff Good breakfast in the hotels restaurant on the top floor Nice toiletries and room decor Wouldn t hesitate to return
475211,Nu Hotel, I found it a bit impersonal and cool although it was stylish A bummer I ordered a salad and a water for lunch to my room They charged me 10 USD for bringing it down one store and they didn t even collect the plate anymore , Clean trendy nice the breakfast was great
475212,Nu Hotel,No Negative, Although it was a bit out of town the walk to the metro took less than 2 minutes with trains from that station every 6 minutes It took us about 20 minutes to get into the centre of Milan the Duomo and seeing as metro tickets are so cheap it was really hassle free It was a really safe area and the free parking is definitely a major plus in Milan 
475213,Nu Hotel, Snooty snooty snooty The discrepancy between the surrounding neighborhood and the hotel atmosphere is a harsh jolt If the level of snobbery could come down a bit and the sketchiness of the hood could come up a bit it would work Now it really doesn t , Architecturally it is a very appealing place 
475214,Nu Hotel, A kind of impractical and impersonal place with some cold and not functional rooms Overall a very ordinary hotel with oversold and costly rooms , good location nearby motorways and Metro line n 2
475215,Nu Hotel, Towels rather used but not all of it , Modern Design starting at the entrance door Very good restaurant not only for breakfast Close to public transport Delicious breakfast great quality of the food 
475216,Nu Hotel,No Negative, Lovely spacious rooms Friendly staff and good food Not too expensive because the hotel is not in the centre but you have the Subway at the end of the street 
475217,Nu Hotel, AC system is terrible You cannot control it from the switch in your room and even if you are freezing during the night you cannot do anything The receptionists kept on lying to us about what they can do or cannot do with the air conditioner One day they tell you that they are turning the AC in your room off but it is obvious that they do nothing cause you cannot sleep due to freezing air and noise in your room Next day they tell you that they are not able to turn it off at all , Hotel and rooms were nicely decorated very clean and comfortable Breakfast was very good Although the hotel is not right in the city center it is just 3 4 minutes walk from the Udine metro station and you can reach the center within 20 minutes by metro 
475218,Nu Hotel, could have been a little closer to the center but not a deal breaker, Room was lovely and the food in their restaurant was excellent The staff were very helpful

475221,Nu Hotel, Bed pillows really uncomfortable , Really nice breakfast and dinner restaurant on the roof top Good location only 5 minutes walk from the metro station If you rent a car there is parking available in the neighborhood Try the restaurant beside the hotel really nice Supermarket right opposite the hotel Staff indifferent
475222,Nu Hotel, very limited parking otherwise nothing, very nice hotel excellent value for the money highly recommend if you don t mind being outside the center 
475223,Nu Hotel, The room was not very large and there was a constant aeration which was a little noisy in the night and which couldn t be stopped , The hotel is modern and comfortable The staff was very friendly and helpful The breakfast was very good a lot of variety including sushi in very good quality The hotel is located a little outside the city center however very easily reachable with the metro 
475224,Nu Hotel, Customer service was the worst we ve ever experienced Bed was horrible Pillows were horrible No A C, The food and service at the restaurant only was great Room was decorated beautifully
475225,Nu Hotel, i slept very bad there was no noise may be it was all the small lamps from tv air conditioning door key system etc , very new very clean very nice staff very good restaurant of the hotel and in the area 
475226,Nu Hotel, Rooms are little even though well organized Quite confusing the two elevators , Great position Just 5 taxi for the centre The hotel is really well cared in every detail even if it s not so rich in fixtures Crazy high quality of breakfast Warmly suggested 
475227,Nu Hotel,No Negative, My second time stay here finally a true 4 star hotel in Milan Kind staff premium breakfast parking space free functioning wifi super clean and lovely design what else 
475228,Nu Hotel, It has poor parking and low quality of breakfast although good decorative, Hotel is modern style in a normal street view not about 7 km from the center of Milan 
475229,Nu Hotel, I was assured that the windows were completely soundproof while I could hear during the stay traffic noise and also at late night screams and laughter from the external restaurant just below my room, Recently renewed
475230,Nu Hotel, A plumber should regularly review all sinks and make sure that the water doesn t become stagnant The remote control for the curtains blinds didn t work properly Breakfast buffet was Ok but less rich than in the past , Extremely friendly and professional staff Nice atmosphere and contemporary design

475235,Nu Hotel, Far from Milan central We had to catch another metro and walk with our luggage to hotel Nothing much to see around hotel Looks like a residential area You need to tak a metro to do shopping night clubs etc , Excellent hotel High technology rooms Staff are very helpful 
475236,Nu Hotel, Parking is not really parking it s good luck on the street in a busy neighbourhood and a handfull of spots if you can get one We were there three days and two nights and the AC was non existent , Location and proximity to the metro
475237,Nu Hotel, The parking spaces of the hotel are limited but since there is free parking in the street this ended up not being a major issue , Very nice design hotel While the room was not huge the space was used to its best advantage We really appreciated the blinds that allowed to shut out all day light The breakfast in the penthouse restaurant is very pleasant 
475238,Nu Hotel,No Negative, One of the best hotel i have seen until now and the best breakfast i have eat in a hotel a lot of sort of food to chouse from and good quality Very helpful staff helped us a lot especially because I had a problem with luggage at the airport 
475239,Nu Hotel, All restaurants close by were closed , Everything from the time I entered the hotel to the time I left the hotel The staff at the reception were very welcoming and polite They showed us the way to the rooms The place was so clean and modern It has a different twist Felt like a 5 star hotel The rooms were very clean and comfortable Everyone was smiling and welling to help We had no adapters and they provided them Breakfast was excellent Even during checkout they were asking about our stay I would give this hotel 10 out of 10 and would recommend anyone visiting Milan to stay here especially if they r staying for more than one night I also wish for them the best and hope they stay the same
