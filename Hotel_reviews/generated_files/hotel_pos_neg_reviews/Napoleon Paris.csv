178724,Napoleon Paris, Nothing to dislike about the Napoleon , The hotel is amazing the staff super helpful and accommodating the rooms are luxurious well thought out and comfortable The food is fantastic The location is excellent very easy to get around Paris from especially to walk 
178725,Napoleon Paris,No Negative, The location is great The hotel is very clean the personal is amiable friendly and very helpful We had welcome champagne and fruits in our room when we checked in which was very kind Everything was perfect I highly recommend 
178726,Napoleon Paris,No Negative, We re coming from SE Asia having a spray bidet in the toilet room inside the bathroom is a major plus lol Love our suite room our room was upgraded to a bigger one w o having to ask and the room is so pretty Location was awesome only 3 minutes walking distance from Arc De Triomphe probably around 10minutes walking to Champs Elyssee Oh and the guy from the lobby who helped us w luggage and attended us was very helpful friendly 
178727,Napoleon Paris, Aged the decor is old fashion room is not bright enough, Have nth to say about the location so perfect Staff of the restaurant are really nice to us 
178728,Napoleon Paris, First of all the entire floor i was in smelled like weed the entire time of the stay i dont know if someone was smoking and if that is an ok thing there Sencond they supposedly are a pet friendly hotel and i took my dog with me there he usually does his business outside but unfortunately during our stay he wasnt feeling well and the first day he peed in the bathrom which i cleaned and also called a cleaning lady to disinfect the small are in the bathroom floor and tiped her 10 Two days later i drank an orange juice from their minibar and i started to get nausea and chills so i went to the hispital for 2 hours therefore i couldn t take the dog with me so i left him in the room with toys and food and water The dog had pooped in the bathroom on a towel for which they did not only charged me 150 euros but also took the liberty to take photos of the room which is a tootal violation of privacy not only the room but also the dog and my things Needles to mention they are theifs and dont give change back they value the city tax as they please not as the law has it Basically avoid going there becouse they will for sure find smth to take the warranty money away from you and also dont go if you do not want to be overcharged for weed smelling small cubicles And according to the cleaning staff they change the sheets every 2 days which is really unprofessional They still owe me the change from the first payment of the hotel which the recepsion lady refused to give , The only thing worth was the location
178729,Napoleon Paris, Only issue was room was too warm hard to control temperature , For Paris junior suite was good size Beautiful view from balcony comfortable bed and sofa bed Bathroom with tub and separate rain shower Lovely hotel Staff very helpful Will stay here again 
178730,Napoleon Paris, Came to check our minibar at 0930 on a Sunday morning when check out wasn t until 12pm An interruption during a rare leisurely morning wasn t appreciated , Location is excellent Value for money was good 
178731,Napoleon Paris, Some staff a bit arrogant or less helpful as expected Low choice for breakfast as for 30 price , Excellent location Big and comfortable room as for Paris hotel 
178732,Napoleon Paris, Service is ok can improve I have to ask for new glass of tea coffe they didn t change everyday No new cleaned glass of water as well They didn t change, Location
178733,Napoleon Paris, The personal touch is missing here Two week before our stay I called to the reception desk to ask if they offer some kind of surprise for birthday celebration cause that was our main reason for staying in Paris The receptionist said they will bring us a bottle of champagne and sweets as a compliment and as a surprise for the birthday I asked if it s necessary to remind when we check in cause it was meant to be a surprise for the other person and they said that it was already noted Guess what Nothing of this had happened which for our stay was disappointing , Location Clean room Cody beds and pillows Nice fragrances
178734,Napoleon Paris,No Negative, The staff members were very helpful and accommodating to all of our requests The location was perfect and the rooms were comfortable and clean We loved our terrace 
178735,Napoleon Paris, WiFi service was disappointing Finally had to pay to get any service We had booked a triple yet only had 2 towels so had to call for another set , Nice to have coffee available in the room as well as a nice breakfast available downstairs 
178736,Napoleon Paris, Being picky I felt that the bathroom lacked tooth brush and tooth paste because I forgot my own It also lacked hair hair conditioner I d also like more selection of teas in the room , Very helpful staff they ve been very accommodating and understanding Really polite and friendly Hotel room was spotless and incredibly comfortable The view of the Arc de Triumph from the room 501 was just incredible The location couldn t have been better We were able to walk to the Eiffel Tower and obviously Arc de Triumph and Champs Elysee were at your door step Metro just at the corner 
178737,Napoleon Paris, Nothing to complain about it was a fantastic experience, The location was next to the Arc de Triomphe in the centre of Paris The staff at this hotel were excellent The room was stylish and spotlessly clean A wonderful place to stay
178738,Napoleon Paris, only thing was that after discussing and agrreeing with the reception to leave the room by 1 30 on the day they called and said must vacate the room by 1which meant we had to come running and pack up sooner than expected, The stay was lovely nothing to complain they upgraded us to an amazing room on the first leg of our stay
178739,Napoleon Paris, If you are in avenue room then it s very noisy It would have been much better if they have installed sound proof windows , Location is great SPA
178740,Napoleon Paris, Very small rooms uncomfortable bed and not good conceriage services they only offer tickets for louver museum otherwise not very helpful , Great location friendly proffesional front disck and room service staff with extremely fast service really fast wifi 
178741,Napoleon Paris, They don t have insides the room no coffee and tea No Iron and another normal accessories those you should seen in 5 star s hotel , Staff was very helpful location is good atmosphere of hotel and rooms is very nice
178742,Napoleon Paris, Complimentary Tea sachets were not always put we had to ask for it daily Hair conditioner was given once during our stay Some stuff were unprofessional , The location our room our suit was nice and big we had an art Deco design as we stayed in one of the renovated Junior Avenue suits we had 2 they were different Deco inside A lot of mirrors and a washing pipe in the washrooms Laura in the reception was very helpful and nice in addition to the bell boys Jeffrey at the breakfast was also nice smiling and asking if we needed anything 
178743,Napoleon Paris, Don t knock at my door too many times a day Although it s for giving cookies and check my needs it is still disturbing me , Staffs are so good 
178744,Napoleon Paris, Paid and expensive Wi Fi even if we were staying in a junior suite Breakfast not included despite a very expensive room and rate No complimentary bottled water in the room , Amazing location close to the Arc de Triomphe
178745,Napoleon Paris,No Negative, The location the level of service and the friendliness of the hotel staff and the quality of the room we stayed in were all exceptional I would highly recommend this property and I would happily stay there again 
178746,Napoleon Paris, The size of the room is really small Also the restaurant at night can t do room service although it is mentioned in the menu that there is service from 11 pm until the morning , Amazing location and I liked the decoration inside the hotel
178747,Napoleon Paris, Free tea coffee water muffins in the lobby on the way in out of hotel, The staff was very helpful especially concierge Carlos Rooms very clean nice and quiet Great location to metro shopping restaurants
178748,Napoleon Paris, No parking Had to park in the underground payment car park over night which cost 39 on top of price of venue , Would stay here again as it was the perfect location and the staff were great The bed was that comfy I looked to see what make it was We had an excellent nights sleep and the room was top quality Really lovely and a view of the tower 
178749,Napoleon Paris, No on site parking no valet service If you drive you re on your own They direct you to a nearby city parking When I was checking the doorman was at the reception and did not even offer to help with my bags Had to take them to the car by myself Maybe he was not paying attention not sure Never happened to me at a 5 star hotel Usually the rush to me when I show up with bags and I decline their help sometimes but at least it shows that they care and are paying attention I reserved an Executive room and all I had was a regular small hotel room with a bed and a chair Nothing executive about it and I even double checked with the reception if my room was what the same type that I reserved and they confirmed that it was an executive room Their standard room must be shocking if what I got was an Executive room Will never go back there Can get better in Paris 8e for what I paid over 300euro night Done with Napoleon, Location
178750,Napoleon Paris, Reception staff extremely rude and discourteous Not very helpful Wifi internet went down for 2 days also meant could not watch tv Staff rude again would not have stayed if the customer relations manager was not there , The hotel relations manager was superb He sorted out our room issue with exceptional customer service 
178751,Napoleon Paris, I was disappointed they credited my card when on the reservation it said they wouldn t charge anything I wanted to pay with a different card Secondly I was shocked they took 150 cash as another deposit And breakfast wasn t even included ,No Positive
178752,Napoleon Paris, The staff treat my as nothing when I ask for something I have to wait for two day to get respond All gust when they have problems with the room they change it for them but for me I have hot water in Toilet I couldn t use it and I waited for three days just for someone to came to fix it They never change the room for me and the kept me waiting until they fixed the problem I think they didn t like me because the color type of my skin black or for the nationality Arabic I was so disappointed because it was the first time for me to be in Paris I have been in France other places but Paris was the new place for me ,No Positive
178753,Napoleon Paris, Mattress in rm 112 needs replacement OK for solo traveler but huge slump on one side of bed , Very good pre paid rate First class staff very respectful and polite Excellent breakfast buffet Exceedingly beautiful room Great location 
178754,Napoleon Paris,No Negative, I really felt like the staff at Napoleonn Paris particularly your front desk staff member Suzy went above and beyond to make my Paris dream come true I was upgraded to room 704 and given the amazing view that I had wanted so desperately It was magical The weather wasn t ideal so after walking around in the rain all day to be able to come back to a beautiful room and look out my window at the Eiffel Tower made me so happy The food service staff room service and the restaurant were friendly and the food was spectacular I am traveling solo and this was my first time in Paris but won t be my last and I won t be staying anywhere else except Napoleon Paris I am also keeping a blog about my travels and made sure the hotel name was mentioned in both video and print the video it was mentioned in has been viewed over 300 hundred times and I ve had people email me to ask for the details I know you will get more happy customers from this 
178755,Napoleon Paris, Bed en pillow are not comfrotable and the baby bed is horrible which made our night rest difficult as the baby was so uncomfortable , we had a suite which was with a good bathroom nice little dressing and nice products from l octicane Very friendly staff to 
178756,Napoleon Paris, Hugely over priced bar Nice but not what you would expect of a four star hotel Poor drainage The wet room flooded and shower cubicle didn t work properly , The cleaners Very good efficient twice a day 
178757,Napoleon Paris, Not a single thing to complain about , We loved this absolutely beautiful hotel Starting with the very classic Napoleon era decorated lobby and rooms Super comfortable bedding nice bathrooms and extremely friendly and helpful staff The best part about this hotel was walking out and looking to your left to see the Arc de Triomphe right there and Eiffel Tower just poking out behind it The Champs elysees is one street away with lots of shops and restaurants Very handy when travelling with kids We had a fantastic 4 days in Paris we ll be back here again for sure 
178758,Napoleon Paris, The room that I reserved from booking it s not the same when I arrived the hotel and I make upgrade paid more to be the room suitable with me and my wif No Wifi appear to my room and I called them more times but without any action,No Positive
178759,Napoleon Paris, the room 15 meter and not 20 as was mentioned in my reservation the matres on the bed is no good and not comfortable at all i can t move in the room i can t see the main street no swimming bool ss, very clean nice location nice bath room
178760,Napoleon Paris, No tea and coffee in the room, The location of the hotel was perfect very close to the metro and bus stations The champs Eleyse is round the corner with lots of lovely places to eat and shop the area felt so safe and the staff at the hotel so friendly always smiling with whatever we required 
178761,Napoleon Paris, Although our reservation was confirmed 10 days before our arrival we didn t find a room when we arrived We had to wait for 3 hours until they managed to give us another room upgrade and we had to pay more of course , We LOVED everything The decorations are so elegant artistic fancy for a really reasonable price And all the staff members were welcoming friendly and very helpful I would highly recommend this hotel for couples but I do not think it s suitable for people with children although it welcomes children Great staff Keep it up 
178762,Napoleon Paris, Pricey but then again most rooms in Europe are small but then again did not spend much time sitting around in the room, Clean rooms of an older Parisian decor Slept 3 comfortably Access to Metro was very convenient Rooms and location of hotel in a quiet area Staff was courteous 
178763,Napoleon Paris, our stay was too short , Quite simply a lovely hotel stylish with old fashioned charm The staff were the best we have ever encountered in Paris in over 30 years of trips to Paris
178764,Napoleon Paris, 90 of the staff had attitude problems replying only in french but the remaining 10 were more than helpful, The location of the hotel and some of the staff were very helpfull

178766,Napoleon Paris,No Negative, The hotel is beautiful and extremely well located I was a little surprised to find peeling cracks in the paint and generally a feeling that things are about to fall at the seams Great service and very comfortable bed I was kindly upgraded which was a bonus
178767,Napoleon Paris, There wasn t anything special about the hotel It fulfils every requirement of a good hotel but I can t say there was anything hugely memorable , We liked the general layout and aesthetic of the hotel the location is very convenient and the staff are lovely 
178768,Napoleon Paris,No Negative, Friendly staff looking for solutions They could not provide me with an upper floor room whereas I had asked it in my booking and they therefore significantly upgraded me so I could be at an upper floor 
178769,Napoleon Paris,No Negative, A great hotel in a superb location The staff were very helpful and ensured we had a great stay in Paris and made my wife s birthday celebration special 
178770,Napoleon Paris, Need some extra plug points for charging and also the iPod dock was suitable for old iPhones, The location is excellent and the staff was very courteous and welcoming and helpful 
178771,Napoleon Paris, The staff smiled only when hotel guests were leaving That should tell you everything you need to know about them No other complaints We strongly suggest they fire all front end staff and hire a friendly crew A lot of money to spend to have to deal with staff who have no idea that their guests are human We might as well have been a piece of furniture We stayed at another place in Paris and several throughout France only Hotel Napolean had non friendly customer service staff Yes they did everything hotel service should not do they were inattentive not accommodating robotic , The lamb shank was great The hotel is quaint and in a fun area Could see the effiel tower from the room Maid was great her and one other service personnel were the exception to the rest of the staff 
178772,Napoleon Paris,No Negative, The ambiance of the hotel is superb The Small details that are important to fully enjoy like having a fully stocked minibar 2 TV s a Docking station Separate shower a second door to access the toilet Pets allowed free of charge

178774,Napoleon Paris,No Negative, The staff was particularly attentive to the guests and extremely pleasant Not always something you find in 5 stars hotel so I really appreciated the welcome and how they dealt with a couple of questions 
178775,Napoleon Paris, The A C was malfunction for more than 3 days and I asked them 3 times to send some to fix it then they send me the bill boy to adjust the temp Of the A C then I told them the compressor is not working then they the promise to fix but nothing happen , The renovation inside and out side
178776,Napoleon Paris, There is nothing not to like , We didn t just like everything we LOVED everything The hotel is beautiful the staff are absolutely amazing the location is stunning I will definitely return I booked this hotel for my Mums 81st Birthday and we could not have asked for any more 
178777,Napoleon Paris, I didn t like that they gave me room no 102 and what I ve asked was a high floor room and the balcony has no privacy because it overlook to the next suit terrace which is uncomfortable it s like u r sharing the same balcony and it s not safe coz any one can jump to your room from the next suit if they were chilling in the terrace u can see them while u r on ur bed, Location cleanliness
178778,Napoleon Paris, Paris near rhe arc is ridiculously expensive and restaurants are poorly managed and service was abysmal, Staff was very atrentive And efficient Hotel location eas fantastic Property is very quiet
178779,Napoleon Paris, Although hotel is extremely expensive the wifi was not free of charge Wifi charges itself is also high in hotel it is cheaper to buy a local sim with data bundle than using hotel wifi The breakfast had a very poor selection compared to the price per person for breakfast The rooms were not so spacious again based on the value paid per room The room walls and widows were absolutly not noise isolated I could clearly hear what my neighbor rooms are talking if they just speak a bit louder The price paid for rooms are really very high compared to value of money , Location is great close to sightseeing and market 
178780,Napoleon Paris, It s difficult to be in a quad room with only one toilet and bath especially if you are not a family , It was our third year to go to Paris last July and by far this is the best hotel we ve stay on in terms of comfort cleanliness and service They are as expensive as the last two hotels but at least at Napoleon we got value for our money 
178781,Napoleon Paris, No hot water and no apology or alternative arrangements when we complained Also they messed up out taxi arrangements TWICE, Location decor some staff very helpfuk
