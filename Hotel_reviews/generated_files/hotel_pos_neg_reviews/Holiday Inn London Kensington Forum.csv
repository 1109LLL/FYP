262452,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Bathroom was too small and only one hook to hang anything up which was very close to the toilet Water drained out too slowly down the plug hole when having a shower , The beds were comfy and the view from the window was an unexpected bonus 
262453,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, No minibar no refrgerator in the room Ventillation in the bathroom was out of order , Excellent location excellent breakfast fast elevators in sufficent number comfortable room good bed and bed linen big screen TV free internet 
262454,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, I booked a twin room and also rang day before to ensure got twin beds which I was told I would When checked in there were none and I said I was happy to have roll away bed was given room that could accommodate but there were no roll away beds I could have booked another place a lot cheaper with twin beds and specifically checked with hotel so I could cancel if not available they said I would get so I feel ripped off , The staff were nice good choice at breakfast
262455,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, There was a massive queue when we went for breakfast at 10am We had to wait about 10 minutes just to be seated in the dining room It would ve been helpful if we could ve been warned about the queues at this time it s obviously a popular time to go for breakfast Then we might ve chosen a quieter time and avoided the queues , Location was excellent a 3 minute walk from Gloucester Road tube The tubes also run through the night which made it handy getting back to the hotel after a night out at 3am There s also a Tesco across the road which was also open at 3am if you fancy a little late night snack Breakfast was very tasty and the food fresh and hot There s a little box at reception where you can throw your room keys into when you re checking out if you re already paid up and you don t want to queue to check out 
262456,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Bathroom was mouldy Room looked tired with unsafe fixings on windows Requests to staff weren t honoured I E we called for shower gel and none was ever brought We also asked at reception for soya milk which was never brought to our room as we were told it would be The bar was hugely overpriced and understaffed I queued for 20 minutes for 2 beers , Close to the tube
262457,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum,No Negative, On my reservation i clearly stated we had 1 wheelchair guest however upon arrival at your Kensington hotel your staff insisted i did not inform them of this request i then asked about parking and again stating we had one person in a wheelchair i was directed to park in the underground car park we then parked my car and got my son and his wheelchair out of the car only to find that there was no exit from the car park except up some steep and narrow stairs after walking around for around ten minutes to try to find a way out i ended up having to press a button on the car park ticket machine for assistance 20 minutes later a member of staff from the hotel came down and tried to say that it was our fault for parking in the car park the same lady when we reached to lobby of the hotel was very abrupt in insisting that i point out the member of staff that booked us in to the point the concierge had to come over and tell her to leave it and if this was not bad enough we then get to our room only to find that the wheelchair could not get through the door he also was not able to use the bathroom as it was impossible to turn the wheelchair to get in i went to reception and was told there was a disabled toilet on the mesanine floor and there was only one lift that could access it i tried for ten minutes to get access to this lift but had no success in the end the concierge had to go up and bring the lift down to us each time he wanted to use the toilet i have travelled to most parts of this world both with my son and on my own for my work and this was the worst and most embarrassing experience i have ever had the misfortune of being involved in especially for my 23 year old son
262458,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The hotel was looking tired and bit shabby by modern day standards and its star rating , I hadn t realised the accommodation cost included breakfast 
262459,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, First room they gave me was smelly then they changed me to a better one There was a huge queue to take breakfast never saw this before I had to wait 15 20 Mn to be seated at a table but still there were lots of empty tables inside So definitely they are not very efficient on managing this , Great location nice and friendly staff
262460,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Rooms are old and too small and lack some equipment comparing to the price and star rating Also money was taken from my card two times and refunded five days later after some international calls and emails when my trip almost end ,No Positive
262461,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, the room is smaller than i imagined there s no space can open one 29 luggage also can t believe a famous chain of hotel has no the safe in the room , location is quite quite quite convenient 
262462,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Lunch in bar very poor service, Location is excellent for sightseeing Staff very professional and friendly Breakfast plentiful and room managed well despite crowds Will be back 
262463,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The concierge was very sarcastic when we asked for help on restaurant booking and wimbledon tickets He did not have to adopt such a condescending tone when speaking to hotel guests Perhaps it is because we are asians We have given feedback to the reception about the concierge but we doubt they will do anything about it We approached the concierge on 3rd july 2017 morning to prove this is a real incident The toilet door in the hotel room is very old and makes alot of noise opening closing it The whole property looks aged and worn down a reno is much needed to spruce up the whole hotel , Breakfast was good with lots of options available Gym facilities was good too 
262464,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Bathroom room far to small for an executive room Had to ask for bathrobes and slippers which should have been in the room anyway then only one set arrived Had meal in pub attached to the hotel poor Hotel restaurant didn t appear to be open in the evening Why not No bedside table to one side of the bed , Comfortable bed and functioning air con Lounge for executive room guests very good Ideal location for the major museums 
262465,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Room cleaning service quality was inconsistent Stayed for seven nights but only once did we get wash cloths to go with the towel sets No hair conditioner ever A couple of times we weren t left with any toilet paper reserve just whatever was left of the roll on the dispenser The gym equipment was old and rusty Very tiny room and the equipment that doubled as a lat pull and rower wasn t working and never fixed during the seven nights that we were there The location was the best thing about this hotel A few steps from an underground station that was served by two lines Right next door is a grocery store and a dozen eateries within a few steps A half mile walk is a self service laundromat which we needed since we were traveling for a total of 25 days ,No Positive
262466,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, I stayed in July and it was very hot in London the only gripe I have is with the air conditioning in the room it is pre set so you cannot change it would have been so nice to have been able to set it cooler for a while , The location of the hotel is great and the staff very helpful friendly and professional Like most traveller s you do not spend a lot of time in the hotel as you are always out and about but it is so nice to have somewhere clean comfortable and welcoming to come back to The bed s are really comfortable all facilities working perfectly and it was nice to have a fridge in the room to keep your water and maybe a little fizz cool 
262467,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Bed not as comfortable as other hotels i ve stayed at Sofa bed in room did not fit properly and left no space to move or even get to the bathroom as it was blocking the entrance Safety hazard , Gluten free bread and cereals available for breakfast Nice snacks available in the snack bar Great location in you want to visit Westfields as a direct bus just by the station no 49 
262468,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Entered in a superior room and find a toilet super small just 1slipper and no robes for us after they delivered to the room Ordered dinner in the room terrific burger breakfast in the room very bad presentation on the tray sausages dry , Very warm welcome from receptionist Monika plus her her collegue lovely Spanish girl but I don t remember the name help me with trouble on my second key Good the business lounge where you can have some drink and snack all day long Asked for a very firm pillow and I have received to my room as soon I went in well done
262469,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Poor behaviour of children in restaurant at breakfast some were allowed to run around and treat it like a playground Parents at fault but felt staff could have had a quiet word with them and asked them to have consideration for other guests , Location convenient for V A 
262470,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The standard room is really small interrior needs some renovation But price quality ration is good compared to other hotels in the area , Location is perfect for business trip direct tube line from Heathrow and easy to get from the hotel to any place in central London Nice pub downstairs 
262471,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, THE ROOM WAS SO TIGHT AND SMALL LIKE IT WAS IN AN IBIS HOTEL VALUE FOR THE MONEY PAID IS VERY POOR I WOULD HAVE MADE A BETTER CHOICE AND THE ROOM PHOTO ON THE WEB SITE DOES NOT SHOW HOW MUCH THE ROOM IS SMALL THE BATH IS VERY VERY VERY TIGHT THAT ONLY ONE CAN BARELY FIT INSIDE I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THE CHOICE I MADE AND WILL NEVER REPEAT IT ANYMORE IT IS A RIP OFF COMPARED TO ANOTHER , THE LOCATION
262472,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Although the location is very convenient the hotel is very much focused on catering for a never ending stream of airline crews , Fitness centre was good early check in was allowed check in out was easy 
262473,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The rooms are very small There was no exhaust fan in the bathroom but this seems to be standard in London hotels The ceiling fan was actually hanging out of the roof The shower was in the bath and it didn t drain properly so we had to continually turn the shower off and let it drain or we had to stand in dirty water Advised reception after first day and nothing was done The place is old and not well maintained Again that seems to be a London thing We are paying 450 a night around the corner and there is only one power socket that works and everything is run off a power board That is the next review Overall the Holiday Inn was below par There was no response from any management about any issues We were going to stay another 2 nights but we ended up going elsewhere We paid about 300 AUD a night here and definitely not to standard Beds are old as are the pillows Very disappointing and the last time I will stay in the Holiday Inn anywhere Three strikes in 3 countries , The location is the best thing about this hotel 
262474,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Bathrooms are very tiny with poor quality toiletries Neither complimentary water nor slippers are provided in standard rooms Adding to the breakfast variety would be a plus too , Hotel is very neat with clean and spacious rooms Location is very good close to many restaurants and supermarkets You can walk to museums Harrods s and the fancy knightsbridge area Breakfast is very convenient with attentive and pleasant staff especially Pavlos and Michael The gym is tiny but still has the most essential equipment I would like to also thank Peter from the Concierge for his tireless assistance is booking our van to the airport 
262475,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum,No Negative, Staff were really friendly and welcoming We had a meal at the restaurant on site and the food was excellent The location is just a 5 miniute walk to shops and restaurants and the tube station 
262476,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Room was the size of a cupboard and when I asked one of the receptionists to allow me to choose another room she said they were all same size i asked to upgrade and she said I couldn t, Close to tube station and a nice breakfast in room which was still hot when it arrived
262477,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Shabby room unclean toilet hard bed with broken leg The whole room needed updating , Friendly helpful staff the availability of gluten free toast unsweetened soya milk location 
262478,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Didn t get any sleep door shakes everytime wind caught it making a banging noise I explained to the front desk in the morning and she made me feel awkward saying if I wasn t happy I should have moved rooms But I was trying to sleep through it Very disappointed from the judgment and I didn t know what was possible this was the first time I had organised my own hotel stay Otherwise definitely a very good hotel and clean check in service by Gil was very informative and welcoming, The check in service very warm and welcoming
262479,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Checking in procedure was terrible I booked 4 rooms for 2 nights for a hell of a lot of money It took us almost 20 minutes to get our keys although it was all prepaid The respective lady who helped us never made eye contact For the amount i paid i did not even feel welcome at all That lady should not do that type of work because she doesn t understand hospitality at all Another thing are the elevators They are living their own lives Many guests complained Me too , The service at breakfast was excellent Great staff And okayish breakfast not special but complete 
262480,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Plenty of foods available but no variation Everyday the same foods were available for the free breakfast during our 8 days of stay in the hotel The hotel building was big but the room we stayed was very small as compare to other hotels , I like the hotel location it s very close to train station restaurants buses taxis 
262481,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Sliding door and no lock on the very small bathroom in our room No fan in the bathroom either Would have expected an executive room to have a better bathroom , Only had breakfast but it was v good and lots of choice 
262482,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The bed was uncomfortable It was hard to get the room temperature right and the air conditioning was noisy We did not sleep well and had aching backs , The staff are helpful at this hotel The bath was lovely and the breakfast good quality 
262483,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Poor plumbing in bathroom Toilet didn t clear properly and looked as if someone had urinated in it prior to our arrival , The location is excellent for the Royal Albert Hall 
262484,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, It would be great if the hotel could provide the street map to show the restaurants bars shops nearby the hotel The hotel staffs are willing to provide their advice though , I arrived in the hotel around 11 am and the staffs are very friendly and thoughtful for providing early check in for me The location is really close to Gloucester Road station on the Piccadilly line which is very to many scenic spots in London 
262485,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Not all staff are friendly and efficient We left our bags in storage and the bellboy was not around Took a bit of harsher tones to get the lady at the front desk to act in this , Good location
262486,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The hotel room was extremely run down and grubby Carpet and chairs stained windows were dirty walls were filthy and bits of skirting board missing It needed a total revamp Very disappointed considering how much we paid Will not be returning , It was close to tube station great location
262487,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, the tavern bar was left with a lot of finished plates on tables pilled up still with food on Draught beer flat and not served in correct glasses i e Stella in Stella glass not a cider glass always tastes better and stays fizzy longer , ease of access from tube standard room however all that s needed when away for a few nights good breakfast choices and tasty food

262489,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The drinking water bottles are too expensive I bought 4 half liter water bottles for GBP 8 which was ridiculous , Location is too good for tourists Gloucester Road tube station is just 2 3 min walking distance Can reach central London within 10 mins Restaurants and shopping places are plenty Wide choice in restaurants nearby There is a restaurant on site also Very clean hotel quiet neighborhood friendly staff very good speed free wi fi Good size room with a huge bathroom Ours was a disability access room Another surprise for us was all the tours which go to west of London i e Stonehenge Bath Oxford Windsor Castle etc make a stop at Gloucester Road Tube Station on the way back That turned out to be very convenient for us There is super market near the tube station where you can buy drinking water bottles at a reasonable price 
262490,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Check in and reception gets quite crowded and somewhat slow Rooms are small smaller than some budget hotels You are really paying for location for what you get , Nice pub with outside seating area and popular restaurant area inside Car parking underneath hotel very handy View from upper floors is good Location is very good 
262491,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The service I asked concierge if anything special was happening in London and he said nothing much at the moment except maybe for the Kensington food fair He didn t even mention the Trooping of the Colour This is a major unique in the world once a year event Also each time I tried to call reception or concierge there was never any answer , Location

262495,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The room was quite small and it s location in the building meant it was close to the main road which made it very noisy to sleep in making it not great value for money given it was a treat to myself for a bit of peace and quiet and hopefully a little luxury , The reception staff was friendly and helpful and The room was clean 
262496,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Everything maintaince service was poor AC was not working rooms were very small as they described there rooms in reality big disappointment Breakfast was average booked exectuive room because of lounge access and executive lounge was big disappointment Except location wifi signals were poor as well, Except the location nothing was good
262497,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Our first room was horrible especially the bathroom as our toilet was backing up after we flushed it but next day got sorted Also think the price for drinks in the bar bit on the expensive side , Everything was great the second room they gave us was brilliant loved the breakfast and the bar was cosy 
262498,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, the terrible level of service air conditioning not working poor service and unfriendly staff Blocked toilets etc had o chase staff to get basics done like cleaning room plumbing etc Management is by a Singaporean company now who obvoioulsy are not paying attention to customer service, location

262502,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Oblivious attitude of an IHG male staff which when I enquired about missing days on my IHG card he asked me to contact hotline myself When asked 2nd question what is IHG membership email address he said don t know and asked me to contact telephone hotline MYSELF This happened on 30th May 4 pm thereabout when I checked out of Holiday Inn Kensington Hotel This is the most disgusting experience from a membership services staff of any hotel loyalty program I have additional hotel loyalty membership too so won t have to rely on IHG , Breakfast was above average Some hotel staffs were helpful some couldn t be bothered type of attitude so 50 50 on staffs quality 
262503,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Everything The room was very small The window was broken and dirty The room was generally grubby The bathroom door was broken The manager was incredibly rude I would never visit again What a waste of money , Nothing

262507,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Rooms are really tired due to the throngs of people who stay there Carpet stained almost everywhere Woodwork dinged from luggage Paid for executive room but same size as others Executive level gives privileges to the lounge which we did not need but rooms are same We don t use exercise facilities etc Would not have been as disappointed if we paid less Paid for a lot we didn t use , Location great Breakfast good Bar was great

262509,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, i think the shower in our room need to be change It s a bit old and broken making it quite difficult for us to shower , I particularly liked the location Easy access to all of the tourists sites There are a lot of restaurants too around the area Free wifi and starbucks inside the hotel is a big 
262510,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, N A, Great location proximate to underground and links to other places in the city Very friendly helpful staff particularly in the restaurant and house keeping Excellent breakfast and well equipped bedroom

262512,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Room was twin beds and not a double as requested The shower did not work Beds were not comfortable Room was noisy road traffic and underground railway Whilst we did not request a disabled room we informed the hotel my wife is disabled despite that we got a 12th floor room at the very end of the corridor Thankfully there were no emergencies and she was able to use the lift, Fridge in the room
262513,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Room was very small bathroom even more so There was a missing safety stay on window whilst we were both adults this didn t affect us but would not be very safe for children staying in the room on the 22nd floor , All the staff were very friendly and helpful 
262514,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The property really needs to upgrade the rooms here and get rid of the carpet The room had a smell to it For the cost it could be a better , The location is wonderful Close to the rail and In a beautiful neighborhood Easy to get a cab 
262515,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, pillows were uncomfortable but I guess I could have asked for different ones Breakfast pastries a bit stale, central location walking distance to the South Kensington museums Harrods Soane street etc 2 minute walk to Gloucester underground station nice area with supermarkets cafes restaurants Comfortable room clean nice bathroom with good water pressure air conditioning nice view Breakfast buffet with good selection of hot and cold choices Staff was fantastic welcoming and polite 
262516,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Had problems from the beginning mix up with the booking had us down for a twin wanted a double they refused to change it Following day wokem up at 7 30am by the housekeeping staff walking straight in to our room then repeatedly phoning the room Weren t on the list for the prepaid breakfast had to wait whilst they sorted that out Got locked out of our room on day of departure as they wiped us from the system before we had checked out Explained all of this to reception and got offered a free drink Won t nw using this holiday inn agin , The location was perfect 
262517,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum,No Negative, The bathroom was tired Sink had large crack and tiles round bath were discoloured and looked quite grotty Beds were soft Uncomfortable for us but some may like this Breakfast was excellent with hot and cold choice Great staff who were in attendance for all your needs extra tea coffee etc We asked for a room with a nice view over London and our request was granted Rooms are small Concierge was helpful as were the reception staff Left luggage facility Location is the best thing about this hotel Minutes walk from Gloucester Rd tube Plenty shops nearby and the Hereford Arms is a great pub for dinner drinks twice 
262518,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Horribly dated room Very uncomfortable bed and pillows No shower gel just bars of soap , Friendly and helpful staff Ease of check in Close to tube station 
262519,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The room was very small particularly since this was a short stay on a long trip It was difficult to manage our large luggage in the small space Also we requested one bed and a walk in shower We learned after we had checked in that there were no rooms available with only one bed and that there were no walk in showers in the hotel at all hard to believe My husband was recovering from surgery making it rather difficult for him to bathe properly and safely , The staff were friendly and knowledgeable The location is excellent The eating facilities are diverse and accommodating 
262520,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Check in rushed so as a result check in information given too fast Room and d cor dated and tired Bed creaky and noisy very low water pressure in shower Parking was extra 36 for overnight parking Not clear on web site Premium charge 147 for what was a budget room Considering cancelling upcoming booking at another Premier Inn in London based on experience of this one , Excellent choice and range of breakfast items 
262521,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The shower curtain didn t smell very fresh , The room was modern and quite spacious for one person and there was an excellent view of London from the fifteenth floor For a popular area the hotel is also quiet and relaxed I really enjoy the breakfast buffet it s well worth paying the higher rate to have it included with your room 
262522,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Totally inefficient air conditioning making it extremely uncomfortable The setting said 16c but the room temperature was probably in the upper 20s Totally unacceptable I complained during the evening but there was no improvement making it difficult to sleep On checking out I made further complaints and was offered points on my IHG account to use elsewhere Still waiting for the points Pity as the hotel room was very clean and well appointed Would not go back unless there was confirmation that the ac was working perfectly Th room we had was 1111, Location within minutes of Gloucester Road tube station Great breakfast with plenty of choice Choice of pillows 
262523,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Breakfast was only just ok having to ask several times for decaffeinated tea or vegetarian sausages is a bit tedious I was told that the reason there was no segmented oranges in the breakfast fruit salad was that we haven t had a delivery There were piles of unpeeled oranges on the counter but he meant they haven t come from a supplyers already segmented and in a big plastic bag , Location room comfortable and had everything we needed
262524,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Booked a double room upon check in none were available had to settle for a twin room Did get two free coffees from Starbucks as a courtesy however I would have preferred a double bed ,No Positive
262525,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Rooms were small but location made up for this but they could do with a up grade , Hotel is in a great location easy to catch trains or buses and there is plenty pubs and cafes close buy easy walk to Kensington Gardens and museums very safe and clean area
262526,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, I was treated very badly on reception upon arrival I was told because my name seemed to be slightly different to the booked name that I did not have a booking My pronounceation of my name as an English man differed from the receptionists so he assumed there was no booking for me Stephen if my first name and he assumed that it was pronounced Steffan so assumed I did not have a booking once I pointed this out at 11 00 pm after telling him I had had a very difficult journey and was very tired and had an important day the next day he tried to fob me off with a single bed room when I had specifically requested and paid extra to ensure booking a double room I was then told there were no more double rooms available and I insisted that that was what I ordered and that was what he would have to supply he took another 20 mins to then give me a room 1812 which when I got to it I discovered it stank of cigarettes had a broken shower head and was quite unclean I was too tired to try and do anything about it at that stage and decided I would never use that hotel again Terrible service Treated me with disrespect and fob me off , Food in the business centre and restaurant was good 
262527,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Nothing really no complaints at all , Great hotel in a great location that suited my business trip They have good quality rooms access to the business centre was a bonus and book a room with a free breakfast it s worth it The bar is comfortable and the restaurant excellent Overall a great impression and all the staff are excellent 
262528,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The bed was really uncomfortable these could do with an upgrade or the use of a topper and decent pillows , Breakfast was really good with lots of choice Good access to the tube 
262529,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Nothing it was lovely , Very central location 2 minutes walk from Gloucester Rd tube station and 10 15 minutes walk from the museums Lots of restaurants and bars on the doorstep 
262530,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, No saif in the room Too loud street rumor on the down placed floors , Very nice pub Temple bar and friendly barmans very good bed nice room very good location 
262531,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, 1 The size of the room its like a grave 2 The bathroom door doesn t close completely so imagine the smell of the room 3 The size of the wardrobes is not enough for even 1 person 4 The wifi is very weak 5 Nobody check the room before the Customer comes , The location and the view
262532,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Elevator at times with the airline crews could be filled and you must have to wait , The convenience to the London tube and airport was excellent We will stay there again The breakfast and the choices were numerous Also the concierge Peter was extremely helpful and courteous 
262533,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Reception staff seemed stressed Nobody explained how to use the key card Had to go downstairs several times after breakfast as key fob did not work , Very clean Restaurant was nice 
262534,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Perhaps the smallest room we have ever stayed in at a Holiday Inn room 1209 Could barely squeeze between the bed and dresser No place for our luggage Bathroom was also very small , Breakfast was very good nice selection and tasty Serving staff was pleasant Porters and concierge were excellent and helpful 
262535,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, We had a room on the third floor 314 For what we paid it was small it needed updating it was very noisy with traffic on the Cromwell Road and the District Line must pass directly below the hotel The bed was extremely hard and we had little sleep with the uncomfortable bed and the noise We were disappointed with breakfast we had to ask four times before they brought us tea the only eggs were very greasy fried or insipid scrambled No choice of bread just a stale breadstick unless you wanted toast Definately poor value for money don t make the mistake of booking a non refundable room through Booking com as cheaper rooms were available nearer the time on Booking com and probably even cheaper direct with the hotel , Nothing
262536,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Bathroom is very old the bathtub and the toilet is rust The door of the bathroom is pulldoor which is too noisy especially at night I can hear the train from the underground station passing although I was in the 14th floor, Location it in a quiet area and near to underground station
262537,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, mattress is so hard i didnt sleep well for the three nights spent there as if you are sleeping in hard floor i called reception and they told me to come down to change room when i went down they told me all rooms are the same ,No Positive
262538,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Unfortunately the coffee in this hotel was quite terrible The coffee included with the breakfast was awful so we purchased a coffee from the lobby Starbucks cafe and it was also undrinkable , Holiday Inn Kensington Forum was a super location very convenient to many tube stations the Natural History and the V A museum as well as Parks and Gardens As a bonus it is on the Picadilly tube line so made it easy as our last stop in the UK before heading to Heathrow and home The breakfast was an awesome selection and great if you can get a good deal as an inclusion Still not sure I would pay the full price 17 95 GBP See note on the coffee We enjoyed our meal in the Tavern Bar the menu had a good and balanced selection of meals we had the Buddha Bowl and the Spaghetti Bolognese they also had a good selection of beers on tap There was a variety of other restaurants within easy walking distance available The room was sufficiently spacious very clean and well fit out Our bath was blocked and didn t drain but the housekeeping ladies did a great job of unblocking it for us with no hassles 
262539,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Decor was extremely tired shower barely dribbled water room and bars were not very clean over priced booked a double fir 3 nights was put in a twin and when I queried this I was pretty much told hard luck by the duty manager and that it was because I had booked via Booking com and not directly , Location was great
262540,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Everything was terrible Room was very uncomfortable bed was very old it hurts your spine pillows were ancient even the toilet papers are the cheapest terrible ones we paid a fortune to holidayinn I don t care about the location it was not a fact for me I needed to rest because of my health and everything was just so very bad and uncomfortable you ask for mozerrela avacado sandwich they bring cheddar and avocado tasteless sandwich room and windows were very dusty heating never worked you have to call the reception they turn it on for you but mine never worked house keeping never changed the sheets I stayed for 7 nights and they changed it on the last day when I finally had an argument it was a robbery I will never go back i know what hotel managment is very well my family background comes from this Bussines I grew up in hotels I am sad to see HolidayInn like this cheating on people terrible , Location is good
262541,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The facility is a bit old Sink in bathroom is cracked Shower head is a bit loose Flashing water was broken down once during our 3 nights stay , Staff are passionate and helpful Breakfast is also good Excellent location 
262542,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, I had few comments honestly I requested a room with a view and I booked in advanced they told me they couldn t find one at the time of my booking which was a shame I got in the room and the bathroom was dirty found few strands of hair on the sink the bathroom itself wasn t good at all it doesn t have a door but rather a sliding door which isn t nice last thing is I didn t like the fact that I don t have a safe in my room and that I have to go downstairs to get my valuable things every time I need them or I need to put them in a safe place, The hotel is in a great spot about 5 minutes walk from the underground there is a 24 hours Tesco and a Waitrose about 5 minutes walk too Lots of cafes and restaurants and a bank The location is just great About the hotel it has a Starbucks which is a bounce to me friendly staff the room was nice with a good TV a kettle and tea and coffee 
262543,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The staff from the luggage servants the arrogant snotty stiff upper lips in the breakfast restaurant to the people in the reception was not nice and helpful What s wrong with a smile Why not treat customers who acctually use their money so that the staff can have a job I don t understand why there is so hard to be frendly bad work culture at that place , Nice breakfast Clean hotel 
262544,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Nothing enjoyed the entire stay all staff very helpful special mention for staff member Yohan in the business centre who helped this technologically challenged person to organise my on line check in, All the breakfast items were very good
262545,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, As it was so close to the tube it was noisy The rooms were small cheap furnishing bathrooms not the nicest I would have expected more for 194 per night , The hotel is in a good position for The Natural History Museaum The Victoria Albert Myseam The Royal Albert Hall 
262546,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, We could only get the basic twin room at the Holiday Inn and it said on my booking information that I had a non smoking room In actual fact it was definitely a smoking room Even the clean towels stank of smoke The duvets were narrow and did not cover you I did however ask for another duvet and was given a large very fluffy duvet which was wonderful Unfortunately and despite asking for our room not to be serviced my husband s swiss army knife appears to have disappeared during our visit We enquired about it as we used it in the room but it has not shown up It was an object of sentimental value to my husband who was given it by our son now in the US We could only have lost it during our stay I thought that the room was expensive for what it was I would definitely prefer a better room in future , The breakfast was wonderful The scrambled eggs were fresh and fluffy Hot foods were hot and everything was well presented It left the previous hotel for dead and we had club level accomodation there The dining area was very clean and attractive Food was continually being replenished The night housekeeping staff were very good and gave me a large duvet when I complained about being cold I am a senior and I really feel the cold We did ask for a quiet room and although we were on a lower floor we had been put in a room which overlooked a small garden which screened us from the traffic quite a lot 
262547,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, I booked a double bed room and was given a twin bed Reason was that there was none available and they are fully booked Not using booking com again,No Positive
262548,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, A poorly functioning bath and shower water trickled when trying to fill the bath shower did not stay on poor water pressure in the sink The key card to room malfunctioned sorted then one key we left for the power in the room was removed by staff on our return had to sort a replacement asked for id having been there for two nights Felt there was a language barrier in our own country we were not understood when speaking to staff , Very disappointed this time have stayed twice before won t be returning liked the view and the location 
262549,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, could do with refurbishment small rooms the windows need cleaning the bathroom door needs a redesign but overall for 1 or 2 nights its ok no real issues, the location near the tube station and near the sites of south Kensington
262550,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The room was super small I had to jump over my luggage The room of the bathroom had no proper door just had to slide it so it couldn t be closed 100 ,No Positive
262551,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The breakfast buffet is a little less appealing compared to my previous stays The croissants were dry no pancakes available The decor looks a bit tired and worn time for an update perhaps , It turned out we need two rooms instead of just one The staff were very accommodating and found us an extra adjacent room 
262552,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, First time we had been to London or staying in a holiday inn and the staff took that for granted so weren t very informative when we asked questions to help us with our stay , Location facilities and cleanliness
262553,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Didn t find anything to complain about , the view was fantastic being on the twelth floor Bed very comfy and the hotel quiet will stay there again 
262554,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Horribly dated room decor not changed since the 90s The photos on the website are not representative Bed was hard as a rock and the double duvet was far too small After talking to reception staff were really helpful they sent up another one which was even smaller Spent the night wrestling for covers with my wife she always wins The lobby looks good the rest of the hotel is very shabby and not worth the price even for London , Great staff
262555,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Our bed was really uncomfortable for a longer stay we spent a week there The mattress was old and needs replacing Pillows and blankets were nice enough but the mattress just sucked , Great location clean room nice enough staff good value for the money 
262556,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The room was quite small and no minibar fridge in the room The slide door of bathroom made hard noise Quite basic room compared to the prize of the room Some mornings queue to the breakfast , Great view from the 10th floor and excellent breakfast Good location near Gloucester Road tube station and only three stations from Victoria coach railway station 
262557,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Executive room was more expensive but it s the same size as a standard double and that is fairly small Shower not powerful and bathroom is also very small , Good location Clean room with comfortable bed Breakfast was good 
262558,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Room very poor in terms of cleanliness Dont expect a soiled shower curtain in hotel rated 4 star Problem with the sink plug very still and handle missing Toilet chipped cracked Windows also very dirty Feel let down by the basic requirements being very unsatisfactory First stay at a holiday Inn Would prefer Premier Inn as at least the bathroom facilities would be in a better condition Wish I took digital evidence of the issues Would like an explanation please as to why the hotel management would allocate would allow room 1129 I m such condition Definately not 4 star , Breakfast good
262559,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Room wasn t ready when we got there and not the room we wanted because Booking com don t specify double or twin We also had housekeeping ringing the bell and knocking twice in the morning after a very late night as there was no do not disturb sign in the room They also wanted to charge us 5 for room service for delivering 2 bottles of water what a rip off , Location is handy 
262560,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, There was no Hot water from tap in the bath Maintenance man had to be called water in hand sink kept emptying when I fill the sink up when shaving due to plug We was not told about Business Lounge drinks were only available in a happy hour Apart from all this staff were very nice and polite and helpful , The bed was fine plus TV ok
262561,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Small room bad relation quality price Bad check in with total confusion with the rooms booking , Good localization near the underground Good breakfast
262562,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The breakfast was not what we expected defi etely not a 4star hotel breakfast the eggs were undercooked and we found hair in the mushroom plates the quality and the variety of the food wasn t good , The staff was very friendly the room excellent just what we needed the location perfect 
262563,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Although the Tavern Pub on site is listed by CAMRA the beer was not good The quilt on the bed was not big enough I think they d used a single quilt on a double king size bed , The breakfast was good lots of choice and good quality The bed was comfortable and the room was clean The shower was good plenty of hot water 
262564,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Beds desperately need either replacing or some memory foam mattress toppers as had to get extra quilts to sleep on top of during the night Coffee shop wasn t very friendly felt like an inconvenience asking for a coffee, Staff were friendly most were always happy to help Room was clean and view was great asked for a high floor and was granted request
262565,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The noise of the tubes all night from outside my window This was my only gripe , The staff were lovely and the rooms were nice too Food was good and drinks varied Business Centre was very good and staff throughout the hotel were very welcoming I would definitely return The location is excellent for Gloucester Road Undergrounf as it i a short two minutes walk from the hotel 
262566,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Evening meal Fish and chips supposedly Haddock Cardboard had more flavour when complained no one came from the kitchen to speak to me Only got the price of the fish back n feeble apology Ripping people off as the fish was not Haddock , Good selection friendly staff 
262567,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum,No Negative, This is a comfortable hotel very close to Gloucester Road tube station and consequently well connected to the Piccadilly and circle lines We went to different theatres concert halls and museums with no hassle at all There are good restaurants locally and in central London if you choose not to eat at the hotel The hotel is also an easy walk to the river and in the opposite direction to Holland Park Museums are either close by walking or by tube The breakfast room is large but the buffet works well There is a small shop restaurant and Starbucks on the ground floor There is a business lounge that we had access to and this made a nice place for a break and a snack supplied by the hotel The atmosphere at the hotel is very good and the staff are very helpful One can leave bags in a secure area on the day of departure 
262568,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, 4 for a portion of fries for my daughter was a bit much 7 for a small G T was also steep The room as you would expect with IHG was spotless however the one we stayed in was in need of an update especially the bathroom , The location of the hotel is very good 2 minutes walk from Gloucester Road underground and 5 minutes to Natural History Museum and Science Museum There s a Waitrose and a few restaurants next door to hotel in Gloucester Road Arcade Loads of restaurants within 5 minutes walk Breakfast had a good choice and fresh when we ate Staff were friendly enough 
262569,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, We booked this hotel for 11 nights for entire trip but the last check in this time was not satisfied I booked for double bed and ask again for high level but staff has not given a notice that with high level floor we would not get double bed We had to contact reception again to get double bed , Location is good 
262570,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The bathroom The sliding door was hard to open only by force There was a bick crack in the sink room 712 The drain off from the bath tub was to slow almost blocked , To have 3 Underground lines at your door step is a big plus Saves you time and money Included breakfast was super My wish to get another room was fulfilled instantly without discussion initial room 207 was leading to the quiet side of the hotel but on to a rooftop of a utility area which was repellent 
262571,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The room was too cold and didn t appear to respond when I altered the thermostat I mentioned it on check out and was told that the room unit was probably set to Cooling air conditioning rather than Heating and that this could only be changed externally by household services which seems a bit odd , The free drink on arrival and an excellent breakfast 
262572,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, I have checked the option of arriving early for checkin and they didnt bother to keep that as a priority instead they told me to wait five more hours to get a room after 12 hour flight they need to make sure that they do not have requests of early check in if thats the case i got surprised lyer on that i can jump the que of early check in by buying breakfast for 20 which i refused to do i hve then asked them to gove me a call when my room was ready but they hve refused when i spoke to the duty manager he then told me hell do so abd he was kind enough to give me a room after three hour wait instead of five the hotel needs to work on their hospitatlity management abd customer service as i am an ihg reward member they always forget to add my points , The only reason that brings me back to the hotel is its location 
262573,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Only complaint was that l had a torn sheet on my bed that my foot kept getting stuck in Left a note for the cleaner also told desk staff , Breakfast was excellent 
262574,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, I contacted the Hotel when booking apron 6 weeks before travelling to say that we required a high room as wanted a brill view which we got I also explained that it was to celebrate our 30th Wedding Anniversary Nothing was acknowledged about this not even a couple of chocolates on the pillows I know everyone is budget cutting but for goodness sake a couple of chocs on the pillows would have made us realise that you actually took interest in us and our special weekend But no That was a disappointment The drawers in the room didn t shut once clothes were put in them so dread going to the loo in the night The bathroom really does need a shuttable door not the sliding door that doesn t even meet the edge and has no lock whatsoever I know we ve been married 30 years but I have never pooped within earshot of my hubby without a proper closeable door being there Basics really Get the drawers sorted get the bathroom door sorted and I would consider returning , The location is fantastic The room itself was in a great position overlooking London We were on the 16th floor Room was clean and tidy Breakfast was absolutely fantastic You could fill your boots The choice was superb and excellently carried out The staff in the dining room were rushed off their feet but so sweet and kind and helpful Kudos to them 
262575,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The air conditioner wasn t working well on the 3rd night of my stay I had to open my room windows to get the cold air to come in , The location was very convenient near Gloucester Station But if you wanted your windows opened you d have to tolerate the noise coming from the trains outside 
262576,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Was allocated a twin room after specifying a double room Rotting apple core was still in waste bin from previous occupant Heating noise was obtrusive Two cups provided for coffee tea but only one spoon Chipped drawer didn t close fully Can t see why the over priced breakfast is so highly rated most was undercooked including the eggs bacon tomatoes Elevators invariably required more than one attempt before recognising keycard and observed others having the same experience ,No Positive
262577,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Room service was poor Furniture was broken in the room When we arrived all the facilities were closed , One or two member of staff were very nice Atmosphere in the Bar was excellent along with the staff

262579,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The only shock was the price of parking 58 for 32 hours You d think hotel guests would at least get a discount , Great location and very comfortable beds Also the pub in the hotel was a welcome treat at the end of the night 
262580,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Half the lamps in the bedroom had bulbs that didn t work or had no bulbs, Staff The older woman who checked me in was top Maybe Chinese or Japanese But she was really good Thanks for making my check in enjoyable

262584,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Ammenities are quite limited We asked to get some toiletries but they don t have a lot of them , Great location very close to the Gloucester Road Station and there are lots of stores nearby tesco waitrose starbucks Paul Also easily accessible by bus The staff are very polite and friendly we were given an early check in on the day which is really nice given we had a 20 hours flight Room is quite spacious and eventhough its old its very clean 
262585,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, On check in our room toilet was found to have been used and left un flushed for many days The clues were the lower water level in the bowl the stains left on the side of the bowl as the water level had dropped the unmentionables floating in it and also really bad smell We reported it to a lady a reception and she wasn t too concerned only offering to get it cleaned Hardly the point No safe in our room Empty mini bar And why were we given a disabled room surely that should have been kept for well the disabled It didn t bother us only that it felt a bit like parking in a disabled bay , The luggage facility and the very helpful staff in there Access to cabs 
262586,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Room air conditioning was not comfortable , Convenient and easily accesible hotel as it was very close to Gloucester station and other stores and restaurants Reception and business care were quite helpful Indian restaurant was located very nearby 
262587,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The bed wasn t the best very hard mattress , The Underground Tube was very close by and made traveling around town very easy There was also several very good restaurants within walking distance

262596,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Offer more options for those not wanting a full breakfast every morning Maybe that option was available on the 1st floor but we never went there as we were under the impression it was only for those who wanted a full breakfast , We did not want a full breakfast just coffee and croissant which we bought from the coffee shop in the foyer However the quality of the croissants was not great and there were no plain croissants on our third day there The waitress in the shop was fantastic and she went to find us croissants elsewhere and always gave excellent service 
262597,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, They withdraw 89 gbp from my card without any reason I complained orally two times and they could not justify They said they will get in touch with me to transfer the money back It s been one week and I have not heard from them,No Positive

262599,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum,No Negative, Standard check in time was already good at 14 00 On arrival around 12 30 our room was ready so we could settle in and then make the most of our short stay in London When I realised it was a very large hotel I wondered if there would be delays and possibly poor service at breakfast When we went down 9 30 on Saturday that was definitely not the case We were shown to a table immediately the buffets were well stocked the hot food was fresh and hot no complaints at all We did notice a plate of pastries and muffins where the queue would have been if there was one so they were prepared 
262600,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, bathroom sliding door was unnecessarily noisy and tv programmes very odd and not comprehensive for the freeview stations, Close enough to all the amenities that were required for our visit
262601,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Nothing, Breakfast buffet is marvelous rooms are very comfortable and clean Location is the plus point as it is very close to museums and Hyde park and westfield shopping complex

262606,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The room was sound proofed but we were able to hear the rumble of the underground trains A room on the other side of the hotel would have been better , The buffet style breakfast was lovely and varied and the staff were always on hand with extra tea or coffee if required We were on the 15th floor and there were fantastic views all over the city 
262607,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The maid coming into our room at 8 45am when we didn t have to check out till 11am we were still in bed, Great location lovely comfortable beds endless choice at breakfast
262608,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, They didn t have a double room available for me at 14 00 and they said through booking com they don t receive these information So I waited about 1hr for the room to be ready The facilities in the bedroom is probably the oldest I have every seen Bath I didn t even want to try Toilet didn t have a proper door to close and you know the consequences In the room you don t even have some water to drink now alcohol or anything not even a tooth paste The breakfast is a simple english breakfast and they wait until something is finished completely and then after at least 10 minutes somebody will realise and refill Overal it should be a 1 start hotel in my opinion will never go anywhere close it again , The location is great 
262609,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum,No Negative, Everybody was very helpful and friendly We had to print out theatre tickets and this was very easy and I received a package which was also very smooth I like the area were the hotel is we had twice dinner in the area of Earls court

262612,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, There isn t anything that I could really complain about , The room was clean and comfortable and as expected from a holiday inn The ironing facilities in our room rather than having to go to ask for one or visit an ironing room as is the case at some other chain hotels was a bonus too I was also impressed with the amount of lifts and lack of waiting time for them We visited for an event at the Albert Hall and the proximity to this and the tube station were great Should I need to stay in this part of London again I would definitely use the hotel again 
262613,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, I thought the food at the restaurant was not very good The wait staff was not very friendly Never once did they check in with me after my food was served , I thought the hotel was nice and tidy inside The staff was helpful and the hotel is In a nice location 
262614,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The furniture was old door of the very small bathroom was broken and the variety of dishes in breakfast was limited hope to make some oriental dishes like grand mellennium hotel which is beside your hotel and I was their last time , I really like the location which is great the holy Quran channel in the TV hotel was clean and safe 
262615,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, After a couple of days had trouble accessing my room and the lifts with my key cards On occasions it took up to 10 attempts alternating both cards They just didn t seem to respond initially , Large comfy bed Had a chicken and coleslaw baguette which was very tasty Ate out with family so had no meals in the hotel Staff helpful and friendly

262621,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The size of the bathroom was a great let down to our stay I d booked an executive room No 531 so it came as a surprise that the bathroom was so small The tap on the sink was broken and was a real hazard if children were to use it As part of an executive room deal bathrobes and slippers along with mini bar should have been provided but none were I requested at reception twice for them to be provided but none were When we came to check out and I brought this issue to the duty manages attention he kindly adjusted my final bill to reflect my disappointment If these items aren t available then please remove it from your room description on your Webb pages , The location of the Hotel is excellent especially if you are visiting the nearby Museums and shops in Knightsbridge the staff are friendly and attentive and the adjacent Car Park is a great asset Although we didn t eat in the hotel the menu looked good with plenty of choice because we booked executive rooms we were able to use the Executive Suite This is a great asset to your stay and needs to be used through out the day to get its benifit 
262622,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Option of cheaper smaller breakfast would be good floor mats in gymnasium not cleaned regularly corridor carpets not vacuumed daily need ironing boards iron in room old ill fitting basin plugs both rooms I stayed in uncomfortable pillows check Premier Inn pillows no bible in the drawer, Very efficient check in good concierge good response to maintenance issues quiet close to tube station good availability of taxis spotless bedrooms kind and helpful staff
262623,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The room we had was the usual Holiday Inn standard ie clean tidy and functional However there was a lot of traffic and train noise throughout the night because the windows were single glazed with 2ndary glazing and this did not provide adequate sound proofing The primary windows were also not a good fit in the hole allowing noise and drafts through , The reception and staff were welcoming and efficient The location was superb with easy access to tube and bus services We didn t partake of the bar or restaurant on this occasion but from what we could see they were clean and tidy just a little expensive for what we needed this time around 
262624,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, I had asked in advance for a high level room but got level 3 do there was some traffic noise Also the bed wasn t very comfortable being very hard Due to these 2 factors I didn t sleep very well The decor of the room was dated but was very clean , Very good variety for breakfast Something for everyone I had a freshly cooked omelette and also enjoyed the warm croissants

262644,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The shower was very small also we found a pair of dirty pants in one of the draws which meant that they don t check everything once someone has left the room or clean it properly , The politeness of the staff they made you feel very welcome Also the comfort of the beds I also liked the fact that you get a fridge so we could keep our own stuff inside

262655,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, What I didn t like was arriving at the check in time to be told that our room would be 2 hours there was no reason for this My parent who had booked the room as a present had to ring the booking line and was told that it was not acceptable and the room should be ready after a little long wait we got in our room at 3 30 The receptionist who dealt with us was rude and we felt that as 19 year olds we were being taken advantage of especially as other people were checking in around us , Breakfast was good and our room with a nice view 
262656,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The rooms are tiny and relative to the price of the hotel not really worth it Granted location is everything , The location is great It is very close to the Piccadilly Line and the immediate area is also worth exploring The National History Museum is a short walk a way as well The hotel employees were all very friendly and helpful The gym is nice by hotel standards You can certainly do some decent work outs 
262657,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, I ve stayed in this hotel several times but this time I was a bit disappointed The room I stayed in was cold because the air condition was broken I reported it to the reception but never came to fix it The sink in the bathroom was blocked and the water temperature of the shower fluctuated either really cold or really hot, The location of this hotel is perfect just a couple of minutes from Gloucester Road tube station Lovely hotel with friendly staff Clean room with coffee facilities Beds are comfortable enough and they offer a choice of pillows
262658,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Bathroom very small OK for a solo traveller but would be awkward for a couple or family Full breakfast was 18 extortionate price Lifts were fast but required your room key to work A real pain with an elevator full of people fumbling about to get their cards int he slot to select their room , Good location friendly staff Very comfy bed There is a little shop selling papers drink etc Amazing views from the higher floors 
262659,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The rooms were quite tired looking the duvet was as thin as a piece of paper and the bath was chipped A bottle of water and a can of diet coke cost over 7 although to be fair it is in Kensington Overall if you want a cheap ish one night stay for convenience for a conference or an exam you could do worse than a stay here Although if you d prefer not to worry about what you re picking up from the very dusty dirty carpet in the room then perhaps pay more and stay somewhere else , The location was perfect for my stay

262663,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Bed could have been a bit softer , Liked the fact the windows open for fresh air rather than just aircon only Staff were very helpful and location for a function close by made it a perfect choice for me It was also around the corner from the tube station and lots of restaurants all around and fast food coffee like McDonalds KFC Tesco etc so you can eat on any budget

262667,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The taking my money without consent or knowledge The deceit and being messed around I Stayed here Dec 20th Specifically said no prepayment necessary So when I rang to say we d be late checking in I was happy when no mention of prepayment was made All would be well and they would have our key ready on arrival We arrived to check in and paid 95 in cash and the remaining 10 on my card The accommodation was basic and small and the bathroom door had no lock Also for such an international hotel chain the tv channels were very limiting unless you wanted to pay more money We checked out the following morning again with no mention of prepayment However the following day having arrived home I realised my bank account had less money than it should After checking with the bank and the hotel the hotel had without my consent or knowledge preauthorised my card I was told it would be released but with it being so close to Christmas it wasn t in time By 28th I d still not had my money back I rang the bank and was told the hotel had preauthorised my card again 7days after we had left and again without my consent or knowledge I rang hotel was told I had all my facts wrong even though they d been confirmed by the bank and I was given different details by the clerk which didn t add up Basically they took my payment 3 times in all and I m still waiting to receive any money back Huge con Be very careful They lied to cover at best their gross negligence at worst their fraud , The beds were comfy

262675,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, I was lied to upon arrival The receptionist asked for the card I booked the hotel with online I advised I didn t have enough on the card to pay full bill she said it was ok as I didn t have to pay until i checked out I asked why she needed card as was told just to confirm booking Got to hotel room and had a message from my credit card company telling me I had gone over my agreed limit and I would be fined I checked my online banking to find I had been charged for the room at 155 I went down to the reception and spoke to another receptionist she said I hadn t been charged I explained I had and showed her my account and showed her I d been charged it was only then she explained to me that they block that amount of money on the card just in case we don t pay in check out I said I wasn t advised this and now I will be charged for going over my limit and all she did was say sorry If they had advised me of this at first I would of used another card which would of covered this When going to the room we found out our phone wasnt Workin and also the msg light kept flashing spoke to reception about this and was told they were having an issue at the moment with the phones and apologised once again why was this now mentioned when we booked in We were also given the code for the wifi which surprise surprise wasn t working u could go so far and then when u needed to connect it just froze Once again spoke to reception and was advised there was an issue they were looking into Yet again why were not advised of this before hand For what I paid for the hotel and now the extra charges I will got it was not worth it I will not be staying in this hotel again , Nothing had a bad experience

262714,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Unfortunately there were numerous let downs at this hotel We had stayed there a year previously which was brilliant which is why we chose to go back however this time was a very different story I had called in advance to see if something could be arranged for my parents anniversary as a surprise for them however on arrival this hadn t been done and only one room I ll get to that next was ready we were there before the 2pm check in but as we had to be some place at that time I had called in advance to arrange an early check in The lady I spoke on the reception desk wasn t the friendliest or very helpful when I asked her about the rooms or mentioned my mum and dads anniversary surprise It seems that my phone calls in preparation for what should have been a special trip had fallen on deaf ears until I asked to speak to the manager at the time who then brought up much later on a small fruit plate bottle of wine and card The rooms were very dated and small I understand they have packed in as many as possible but the doors in and out of the room didn t fully open and only one person could walk around the bed or the room at a time as it was so small as well as being small the room was very dated and old fashioned We ordered food in the hotel bar as were in a rush at lunchtime and my dad couldn t go out and walk far to find a restaurant but once again since our trip in 2015 the food quality had slipped and wasn t half as tasty as what we had the previous year and their choice of juices as we weren t drinking at lunchtime were very limited Unfortunately after a very happy trip to this hotel in 2015 the standards have very much slipped and we were left disappointed , The facilities at the hotel were great and breakfast was absolutely brilliant 
262715,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, We requested a double room when booking but were given a twin Reception staff were quite argumentative regarding swapping said there were no doubles left in the whole hotel 25 floors of rooms ok then if you say so They eventually relented and gave us an accessible room with a double bed which was ok but had a very low bath and sink due to the nature of the room They did bring us toothpaste up though as we d forgotten ours , Very good location literally 1 minute walk from tube station Breakfast very varied massive choice of cooked and continental to choose from and the self service pancake machine was good fun Hotel very clean with lots of lifts

262719,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, I booked the room under my name and my card details but possibly due to a booking com error it was listed under my son s name and we struggled to get the booking found on initial arrival This seemed to be a gap in communication between the web site and the hotel which resulted in a 17 year old being named as the main guest A very stressful 10 minutes If I had not had my husband at home to end on e mails it would not have been so rapidly resolved , A hotel in exactly the right location Lovely staff who were really helpful The ability to extend check out to 2 pm on request for a small payment was very much appreciated

262726,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, There seemed to be no proper communication I booked breakfast on booking com at a discount rate When I got to the hotel there was nothing on record I was told it was ok because as I m hosting a big charity event that night my breakfast might be complimentary The next morning there was still nothing on my booking at the hotel and I had to pay full price for my breakfast even though I had the confirmation email and showed it as well as I have IHG membership ,No Positive

262730,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, the bed If you like hard beds then you wont find this a problem but we found it was super hard and uncomfy although the pillows were great , we upgraded to an executive room for 20 per night We used the executive lounge which had complimentary food and beverages throughout the day and night at certain times This was great it had continental breakfast morning coffee and cakes canapes and drinks you could not beat it for value and it was a lovely quiet retreat The view from our room was exeptional The breakfast had all you could ask for The staff were pleasant and accommodating We have stayed here several times and love the great location A great base and lovely neighbourhood feel to its surroundings 
262731,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The hotel was so hot air conditioning not effective Hot stuffy rooms hotel bit dated many broken things in room Rooms small Slow check in and check out Not enough staff on reception for size of hotel Very big hotel , Location was great and good selection at breakfast
262732,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Though we had booked a family room because of its unavailability we were upgraded to an executive room The room was too small and bathroom even tinier Wonder how much smaller the family room would have been Very different from the description on Booking com based on which we booked , The best thing about this property is its Location And the buffet breakfast was also good Thats it 
262733,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, initial room I was given was unacceptable The bathroom smelled of feces The front desk apologized and gave me a upgraded room since it was the only room available without a considerate wait for another room at the rate I paid , location

262737,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, We requested a room with a view of the city and after a few minutes of discussions between the staff they gave us a room they believed would have the view we wanted It didn t but was still a nice enough view On the 11th floor we could hear the rumble of the trains every once in a while but it wasn t too bothersome , The location is perfect close to tube station and large grocery store The twin room was large by comparison to other hotels in the same area still a little cramped for two peo0le but manageable The staff was warm and courteous and room service supplied us with top sheets for the beds many English hotels only have duvets on the beds uncomfortable in the summer 
262738,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Card keys demagnatized twice Had to call Plummer for service Had to call maintanenence to reset power and air conditioner Had to call housekeeping in middle of night to ask for basic room items, Nice breakfast choices

262740,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, We stayed for 3 nights On the 3rd day my son found 2 bottles of water under the bed certainly left by previous guests This means the room had not been properly vacuumed before we checked in if at all Hadn t it been for this incident and I would have rated the cleanliness of the room higher Apart from this and unreliable wifi in the room our stay was very enjoyable and we will be going back ,No Positive
262741,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Despite number of staff behind reception the desk wasn t manned efficiently There didn t seem to be any effort to reduce the amount of people queuing The staff behind reception were not friendly looking no ready smiles We were instructed to be dealt with by a trainee He proceeded to begin booking us in without any apology for long wait or indeed any acknowledgement at all I understand he is still learning but customer service is the most important aspect of all Tea coffee facilities were basic no biscuits No lock on bathroom door Price of breakfast extortionate , Close to tube station Great views from room Despite size of hotel it was quiet at night
262742,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum,No Negative, The location is perfect and it has an elegant neighborhood This holiday inn is well surrounded by abundant restaurants and good cafes Supermarkets and underground station are within five minutes walk distance Definitely worth a second visit 
262743,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The noise from the trains clattering on the tracks across the road was very intrusive particularly in the early hours Perhaps something to do with the position of my room on 20th floor being in direct line of the sound waves I was surprised as the room had double secondary glazing installed , Ideal location for my visit with a secure car park The usual high levels of comfort with professional courteous staff found at Holiday Inn hotels 
262744,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The fact that the 2 free wi fi bands for devices can t be reasigned betwin diferent devices once is asigned to a device say an Iphone is going to remain locked to that device until check out the hotel But the wi fi quality and speed was very good and stable 24hs , The consistancy in the service and the staff allways ready to help Very good tv service A very good hotel for the price very clean and everything works very well I ll return in the future

262750,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The lifts are a cause of quirkey hilarity amongst the guests they go to the floor in the order of number pressed rather than the next floor in the numerical sequence So two guests one asks for floor 22 second one asks for 4 from gound floor Lift travels first to 22 then to 4 On the way from 22 to floor stops many times for other guests quicker to walk to 4 Some corridors to rooms could do with a lick of paint , Staff on the ball and attentive bed excellent food good

262754,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum,No Negative, This is a decent hotel and good value at the rate we paid We liked the area which is far less crowded than where we had been in Covent Garden Very close to a tube station on the Piccadilly line and walking distance to several lovely museums and direct airport access to Terminal 2 Needed more front desk staff as there was a very long line up at check in but at least allowed us to leave the luggage and check in later as we had a matinee to attend 
262755,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum,No Negative, The building is not the most attractive from the outside but once inside it s light and airy The staff were a total joy and the view from the 26th floor was amazing

262768,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Twin beds for a married couple not the best but fun When checking in I was told that I had fully paid for the two day stay I was rather taken aback when I was told to pay 170 at check out because apparently I still had this amount outstanding I can only conclude that the member of staff who checked us in was not cut out for the job description , location was excellent for our business needs Super markets close by helped with food choices
262769,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The duvet barely covered me and was just about the width of the bed The room was very small the beds were longer than the wall beside them and they were awkward to walk by I stubbed my toe on the chair more than once , It was clean accessible and in a good location for transport There was a good choice of chain and independent restaurants in the area The area was very safe and clean also
262770,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, I have using this hotel for 40 odd years and it looks like very little has been updated Owners must be squirreling away the money Some rooms are very noisy stay away from Gloucester Road if you can No tissues in room and a quarter roll of toilet paper on Sunday checkin Sink drain clogged on arrival and had to call maintenance He arrived quickly and fixed the problem Window would only open slightly and banged gave up and locked the window , This hotel is a good location for getting around London Front desk eager to assist Housecleaning floor managers very proactive Breakfast remains well managed

262775,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, At check in bathroom still had rubbish left by previous guest lots of disgusting hairs shower hose had leakage so water was splashing all over the place when taking a shower Rubbish bin had to be opened shut with hands because the springboard was not working this was not fixed throughout our stay Door latch was also broken We booked 2 rooms for 5 consecutive nights via 2 separate booking com bookings At check in we were told both rooms had been reserved for 5 nights we only had to extend our key cards on day 4 It turned out only 1 room was reserved for 5 nights on day 4 we had to re produce our booking voucher go through the check out check in process for the other room even after we told the reception staff we had a train to catch in 30 minutes Majority of staff were unhelpful to say the least rude , Location

262819,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, I was given an upgrade from a standard twin room to a double which wasn t ideal As we were two women sharing We had waited until 7pm to check in to get this upgrade after arriving earlier but we weren t told until 7pm that the room would be a double When we got into the room there was only one robe and one pair of slippers We phoned to ask for another set and they never arrived On our last morning we could check out at 12pm but the housekeeping rang our doorbell and came in the room at 9am and then again at 10am when we were trying to sleep in , The breakfast was fabulous had a huge choice and served until 11am at the weekend

262823,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, breakfast was very average why could we not have had access to tea and coffee rather than it being SERVED very slowly and surely a decent cup of coffee is a basic requirement in a capital city hotel charging this much, nice reception area staff helpful about us leaving our luggage
262824,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The hotel itself is a vast monstrosity with hundreds of rooms The outside is a real eyesore and although the inside is clean and tidy my room s decor looked like it was about 20 years out of date Considering the price I paid I felt an upgrade was in order for the entire hotel The staff were relatively helpful but seemed overworked and stressed The computer system was out on the day I checked out and the woman behind the checkout was swearing at it constantly and audibly very unprofessional I wouldn t stay there again It was too huge too impersonal and too full of airline staff Strictly a stay there once and forget about it kind of place Didn t sample any of the food so can t comment on that aspect If all you want is a bed for the night then it s fine albeit expensive for what you get , Good location
262825,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum,No Negative, Staff were very helpful Clean rooms executive room Literally 2mins walk from underground station Breakfast was excellent definitely recommend to friends to stay here 
262826,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, We were not provided with complimentary bottled water but that s really a minor issue relative to the overall positive experience , The hotel is in a great location close to the Gloucester Road tube station We had a decent sized double room as staff at reception was considerate enough to take into account that we had our son with us The bed was comfortable and I like that the pillows come in a combination of a soft firm pillows to suit your preference The staff were very helpful and friendly throughout The room came with breakfast which provided quite a good spread 
262827,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The room was poor A C was hot at first but then they fix it Dirty Windows Broken bed weels Smelly pillows matrass Pillar right close to the loo seat was uncomfortable No Milk for the complimentary tea until i bought myself then they realized and kept some the next day I think the hotel policy to give lowest room slandered to Booking com Customers I have noticed this when I talked to the receptionist last time as she suggested to book directly through their official website for a better room Which I didn t like at all , Location was good for the underground station
262828,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The beds were uncomfortable unfortunately we were not warned about the noise from the traffic on the street and the busy train line that was outside our hotel room window,No Positive
262829,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, It was extremely noisy outside with tube trains and traffic that I could hear on the 19th floor , A very convenient location Very clean room 
262830,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, House keeping stuff attitude and their inefficiency of cleaning work limited choices breakfast, Everything except attitude of the housekeeping stuff and limited breakfast
262831,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, We stayed there for a few days and I was woke up by the bang sound that obviously came from the guest room doors nearby my room , Clean bed and nice complimentary tea and coffee
262832,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Pillows not comfortable No air conditioning only able to open a window to cool the room and therefore noise from outside , Convenient to the tube at Gloucester Road

262837,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Decoration a bit tired old building first stayed there in 1978 A Penta Hotel then and have stayed there at least once a year sence, The high rise and the views over london above the maddening crowd This hotel has a great location rooms are small however more than adequate and function well this is also a good business hotel and excellent facilities
262838,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Our hotel room windows could do with a bit of cleaning but the hotel is huge I m sure it would be impossible to keep the windows squeaky clean at all times Also we were on the 2nd floor and could hear traffic noise quite clearly I don t personally mind this is just a tip for those sensitive to noise an upper floor might be a good choice , The location is absolute perfection the direct route from Gloucester Road station to Heathrow via the Picadilly line makes for a very easy commute even during rush hour The neighborhood is very pleasant and nice offering multiple options for dining The Umami restaurant on Cromwell Road serves quite good pan asian fare We warmly recommend the tempura lychee 
262839,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum,No Negative, The staff was very friendly and helpful with our questions since this was our first London visit The location is excellent close to restaurants stores tube buses banks The breakfast buffet was plentiful and good Small charge for breakfast but worth it The bed was comfortable and the room was very clean Received an upgraded room to the 27th floor wonderful view Complimentary 2 bottles of water and a candy bar was left in our room everyday Would stay here again on a return visit 
262840,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Nothing, Staff is very attentive and helpful concierge reserved tour package with Golden Tours quickly which was fabulous go to Windsor Bath and Stonehenge Breakfast is delicious especially the omelettes Rooms are clean and comfortable And one of the best convenience is that the hotel is a block from the Tube and it s near a wonderful Pub called Hereford Arms located 2 blocks south at 127 Gloucester road Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ate there The Pub has great beer and delicious food Order the Sticky Toffee Pudding 
262841,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, I ve stayed at this hotel a number of times this time I wasn t happy The check in process is very slow Staff assigned me a room with someone already in it I woke up some poor guy at midnight Just careless handling by the staff The beds offer no support and need to be replaced Pillows are old and tired Shower drains slow so after 3 mins you re standing in water Just basic stuff that they are missing the mark on , Direct tube ride from airport 
262842,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, They only had twin bed room for us not so cool for our romantic getaway weekend They said booking com was to blame We got new room the morning after a double bed , Breakfast was grate Only few minutes from tube Room was expected normal and comfortable 
262843,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, At breakfast I was siting next to my dad s table I Left my pot of tea and half finished cup and a glass of juice at the table to get something to eat when I returned I found a waitress had showed a new couple to my table and cleared away my infused things I had to find a new table away from my dad Apparently you have to leave a bag or something on the table I didn t like having to move half way through my breakfast especially as there were many unused tables around that the waitress could have showed the new couple to Also my room was for a disabled person the bath had a chair in it I had a very squashed shower And the bed was way too low and not wide enough for two I woke up feeling very uncomfortable , Friendly staff at evening dimmer service 
262844,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, While the location was good you could hear the nearby train as the South Kensington underground station is above ground We were on the 21st floor so it wasn t a huge issue but might be if staying on a lower floor The beds in the room are very firm and quite uncomfortable if you are used to a softer cushioned bed They have the rooms temperature controlled for the season so you aren t able to put the air conditioning on if you like it cooler when you sleep so we had to sleep with the window open , The location was good less than a five minute walk to Gloucester Road underground station and the staff were very nice The rooms were clean spacious and had a nice view 
262845,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Some bathroom tiles not very clean Tap working but fitment broken Room too hot at night despite themostat being set low , Good value for money Great location Good view from 15th floor 
262846,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Nothing , This is the fifth time I have stayed at Kensington Forum Holiday Inn and everytime I have received a professional service both at reception and at breakfast The rooms have always been cleaned to a high standard with a fantastic breakfast choice that would appeal to everyone 
262847,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Bed was far too hard think it is better if hotels stick to medium bed otherwise going from soft to hard mattress is quite a difference our backs ached a bit because of mattress Food at breakfast was lovely but a bit slow filling up empty containers on the hot food But none of this would stop me going again or recommending, Great location and a really nice spacious hotel with good sized room Plenty of facilities if needed and friendly staff Would recommend and stay again as really close to tube station and places to eat and drink in walking distance Kensington gardens are lovely and easy to walk to from hotel 
262848,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Room small Didn t like sliding door on bathroom as it never closed fully Drinks expensive in bar , Nice view Good B B rate Lovely breakfast

262855,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, As our flight leaving London was at 10pm for practical reasons we kindly requested for a later check out at 6pm which was another 3hrs above the benefit of a late check out at 3pm Sadly it was not possible instead we were informed that we could extend our check out but with a fee of 10 hr Since we stayed 8 nights with them we thought it was not that much to ask for the extra 3hrs without a fee But overall still satisfied with our stay , As we stayed for 8 nights I was given a letter with some perks my friend and I would be able to enjoy We were given 2 free drinks at the hotel s pub eligibility to enjoy 15 off their restaurant and a late check out of 3pm subjected to availability Location wise it was perfect Just a short minute walk to the Gloucester Station which connects 3 different Tube lines There are a lot of food options within walking distance and there is a decent sized Waitrose supermarket just beside the Tube station as well 
262856,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, First room there was a problem with the toilet flushing Staff came quickly and fixed it I went out and when returned it did not Called again but after about 2nhrs went down to reception to get a new room After getting permission I was given a new room Lucky I had not unpacked The rooms are old and have not been upgraded for years I could hear the underground in my room on the 14th floor it seemed to be worse the higher you went It sounded like mild thunder Fridge did not work and nothing in it , Location very close to Gloucester Rd tube station Breakfast can be purchased ahead with a discount Great selection and quality
262857,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Would have liked some bottled water in the room and herbal tea as well as regular tea Also I did not need maid service every day but there did not seem to be an option for that , A stress free stay with everything as expected Every member of staff was happy to help and friendly The room was immaculate 
262858,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The room was looking a little tired could do with a refurb No safe or iron We had a problem when we went to eat I have a hearing disorder and as most of the staff are foreign we had a communication problem they couldn t understand me and I simply couldn t hear or understand them The staff were all universally friendly this was not their fault but a hotel management fault , Comfortable room on 10th floor so very quiet small room but ok bathroom was small but ok Breakfast was excellent The hotel is very well placed for Earl s Court the National history museum and the V A Overall would stay here again good value for money

262866,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, European hotel rooms are on the small side We had a Twin Deluxe and it was small though clean and comfortable beds This was fine and didn t bother us While some early reviews seemed to imply that this hotel was dated and old the interior was not true at all Although the hotel is a traditional high rise the hotel interior rooms and furnishings inside looked modern clean and were perfectly fine , The rooms were clean and quiet and the hotel was a well maintained traditional Holiday Inn The front desk staff was friendly and helpful The breakfast buffet is big popular and busy and a good value Location is right next to a tube stop and close to a few museums For extra quiet ask to stay on the upper floors

262869,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, We found the bed to be very hard but not impossible , Because we arrived early the room was not ready but we were able to leave our luggage securely and visit some sights before accessing our room A nice high floor room with a south view towards chelsea fc was very welcome Staff were very helpfull 
262870,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The stay was too short for a thorough assessment also considering that I did not have breakfast there I just thought that room was comfrotable and the whole deal was very reasonable and so I would recommend it There was only a sort of longish wait at the reception too few employees ,No Positive
262871,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The room is not clean bad smell from the carpet airconditioner was not working Toilet not clean enough , The location is great close to different types of restaurant subway Service was good stuff were friendly 
262872,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Was given a twin room specifically asked for double bed and no effort made to accommodate Facilities were just generally scruffy Worn carpets stained and chipped bathroom ware chipped paint and doorways windows dirty breezy and wouldn t shut properly lifts temperamental with mind of their own most of the time and often out of order Bar never had a proper beer on tap either stale or end of barrel dregs Went through 3 beers before got one that was in order Becks Boddingtons Guiness before it was found that only Stella was passable Was promised that the taps barrels and pipes were cleaned and being sorted This was Tuesday afternoon but went the above process each night and nothing seemed to be done about it , Breakfast was very good well prepared and all looked and was really fresh Staff pleasant helpful and all the things you would expect its this lot that carry this hotel because if it wasn t for them it would be a debacle The place was clean can t fault that

262879,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, The shower was frustrating to use as it would not remain in a high enough position to enable hands free operation , The location was the prime driver and the staff on reception were excellent the hotel was a base as we were meeting friends at a nearby hotel Baileys 
262880,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Booked a double bed for our room was given 2 small uncomtable single beds Pillows were tiny duvets didn t completely cover you We both didn t sleep well at all Disappointed ,No Positive
262881,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, the hotel needs a lot of maintainace especially to the room bathroom the water pressure was low in the water bathroom and hotel system was under the heating system during our stay and this causes a discomfort sleeping nights during Ecuador we were sweating the external fan which they provided to our room still was not enough the rooms in general need to b maintained and upgraded in then near future , location 
262882,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Water pressure in the shower was poor maybe because we were 16 floors up , The view over London was amazing from 16th floor Good sleep excellent leisurely breakfast with attentive staff Only 15mins walk from Royal Albert Hall where we were going and 10 min tube ride form central London 
262883,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Don t get excited by the picture of the pancakes for breakfast you have to cook them yourself and it takes ages to produce one tiny one Hopeless Why can t the hotel make them for you Coffee bit insipid and served by the cup rather than help yourself This is the second time I ve stayed and the room was much noisier this time round all night trains and traffic , Food generally good Staff nice Good location

262886,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, I did not like the restaurant The food was mediocre at best and the service was very slow even when I wanted to pay and leave I couldn t change the temperature in the room It was very cold I also didn t like the fact that you couldn t opt out of room cleaning for a day even though someone was in there everyday and the bottom sheet was never changed The same spot was on the sheet in the same place every day The only sign I had on the door said Please clean my room which seemed a little ridiculous since they did anyway I didn t even have a Do No Disturb sign even though I said something to the front desk about it , The breakfast buffet was good and consistent I don t know if it s part of the hotel but the pub was very good I liked the view from the room 
262887,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, Bed was too firm but this is just personal It was perfect for my partner , staff very friendly and professional Room spotless Glad the room had an iron as I needed to use it

262890,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, It would have been nice to have an extra pillow and blanket provided in room Also I had to ask to get my breakfast vouchers they forgot to give them to me on checking in Restaurant manager was a little too dogged about getting me to provide them as he said people present twice sometimes for breakfast Sadly his manner left a lasting impression on me , Location perfect and front desk staff very pleasant
262891,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, We discovered that we overbooked the hotel by 1 day we were to fly out on 26th mar but prepaid until 27th We discovered on25th When we realized this the frontline escalated to an officer who coldly told us to go to booking com Considering that we oohed 2 rooms any gesture of goodwill would be appreciated Referring us to booking com is a red herring and giving a run around,No Positive
262892,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, We asked for a change of room as the first one had a horrible smell impossible to stay in we had a few drinks in the pub at the hotel and the pricing was very expensive, A very busy hotel but it was surprisingly quiet during the night time

262896,Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum, First impressions are fundamental in the hotel industry and way our check in was handled was well below what we expec from Holiday Inn The person that checked us in clearly had no knowledge about a Booking com reservation and could not find our booking despite we giving her all elevant info Eventually excuse was that Booking com had not given our name correctly We indicated we use booking com often and never had any similar problem only to then be confronted by another staff person at reception that was rude and lacked any professional attitude Only when I threatened to report situation to both Booking com as well as to TripAdvisor to whom I write on a regular basis did then a Manager at my reqest did intervene and in a proper professional manner and offering an apology for the way the check in was handled but the damage of first impressions was done And this Manager whilst corteous professional still hinted that the confusion with the name was Booking com fault and I thus suggest that you do check with Holiday Inn this situation ,No Positive
