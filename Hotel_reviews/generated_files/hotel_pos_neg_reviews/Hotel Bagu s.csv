359910,Hotel Bagu s, We could hear some sound from the subway but it was not annoying or disruptive And my wife is a light sleeper , This is a small boutique hotel with about 31 rooms The location cannot be better La Rambla is the area to stay in and this hotel is ideally situated very clean quiet and comfortable That said what really sets it apart is the quality of the staff The front desk personnel are very personable and were incredibly helpful in recommending tours recommending restaurants and making reservations for us This was our first trip to Barcelona and we were neophytes Those on the staff who stood out for going above and beyond the call were Richard superb recommendations and assistance Edgar Anna and Michael Miguel the bartender on the rooftop bar not to be missed was equally friendly and helpful This is where we will stay on our next trip 
359911,Hotel Bagu s, The area was very much like Time Square in New York Too touristy A hotel with this staff would be better appreciated in another area However with that said its a great central location , The staff was unbelievable Extremely helpful with recommendations for dining Great directions Truly some of the best and professional service in the hospitality business 
359912,Hotel Bagu s, Nothing comes to mind , Approximately 2 short blocks from Catalunya Plaza the start of La Rambla and 1 block from the Meredian Hotel Rooms are fully soundproofed My balcony looked out over La Rambla yet it was completely quiet inside the room Curtains are good at completely blocking out the sun so easy to sleep in Although the rooms are small the finishes are exquisite and the bath fully modern Very comfortable beds Comforters and linens are high quality 30 seconds to La Boquiera and 1 minute to Plaza Real two atmospheric must see parts of old Barcelona 
359913,Hotel Bagu s,No Negative, Extremely nice staff very smart design of the room and the hotel Spacious shower big fluffy towels and comfy slippers excellent pillows with an additional choice of pillows a la carte finally perfect night sleep conditions Fantastic location Our room window was facing a kind of church so no neighbors to peek into the room Don t count much on the pool though It s very tiny but still the roof top terrace was a nice place to look at the city read a book and enjoy the sun Overall we had a wonderful stay 
359914,Hotel Bagu s, swimming pool was being repaired not the end of the world rest of trip more than made up for this small detail, room was in great location with balcony out with views staff were amazing nothing was ever to much trouble would go back to this hotel
359915,Hotel Bagu s, I am a very light sleeper and whilst the noise cancellation in the bedroom was great to the outside world the main door let in a fair bit of noise to the hallway from other people staying in the hotel This would not stop me staying here in the future though , The service was fantastic Very helpful friendly and knowledgeable The location of the hotel is perfect for a long weekend right in the heart of Barcelona 
359916,Hotel Bagu s, No complaints really , Very friendly staff and willing to go the extra mile for the guests special thanks to Federica Nice breakfast excellent coffee cortado Good location very good sound proof windows 
359917,Hotel Bagu s, We were happy with everything , Location could not be bettered Staff were unfailingly friendly polite and helpful The complimentary bottled water and chocs on arrival were greatly appreciated the water was replenished daily The room was well sized with a wide bed white linens and lots of pillows The well equipped bathroom was roomy with an opaque glass door and the White Company toiletries were gorgeous and replenished daily Everything was spotlessly clean An espresso machine and pods were complimentary and the hotel will supply a kettle and teabags on request Would certainly stay there again should we revisit Barcelona 
359918,Hotel Bagu s,No Negative, Th hotel reception staff were very friendly and helpful They gave us tips on the best card to purchase for the metro and explained the area that we were in on the map The room it self was perfect and the location is perfect 
359919,Hotel Bagu s,No Negative, The housekeeping service was excellent and staff were incredibly helpful and friendly Rooms were beautiful and had a lovely view of the church next door Location was perfect and just up the road from the metro stop 
359920,Hotel Bagu s, The only thing we didn t like was There wasn t a dressing table so nowhere to do hair or makeup , The staff were really friendly couldn t do enough for us it was my birthday while we were there and I got a bottle of champagne On day of arrival we got a bottle of wine and chocs we didn t have breakfast or a meal but it all looked lovely The beds and pillows were just divine 
359921,Hotel Bagu s, Rooms are bit small , I have been to 30 Countries which means I have stayed in more than 100 Hotels I have never seen any hospitality like what I experienced in this hotel The staff are Amazing Highly recommended Hotel The location is Amazing What ever you need is close to the hotel The staff are super helpful This Hotel DEFINITELY my first pick for my next trip to Barcelona 
359922,Hotel Bagu s, Rooms are very clean and comfortable My only remark is that rooms are a bit dark with dominant black and gold motives but I guess that was the decorateur s gloomy motive , Exeptional front desk service excelent location
359923,Hotel Bagu s, Not much , Staff were extremely friendly and helpful This is a boutique hotel with only about 30 rooms so we got lots of attention The dinner menu was excellent and the whole atmosphere of the hotel was modern but comfortable A great place to come home to after a day s walking And a plunge pool on the roof terrace 
359924,Hotel Bagu s, A little thing but a kettle in the room and decent English Breakfast Tea , A wonderful boutique hotel in a great location and just 200 metres to the metro Great service and lovely design 
359925,Hotel Bagu s,No Negative, Beautiful hotel in a fantastic location and the friendliest most helpful staff The beds were very comfortable with immaculate bedding The concierge was always smiling and ready to help We didn t eat in the hotel as there were so many restaurants we wanted to visit We were very pleased with our choice and would definitely stay again when back in Barcelona

359928,Hotel Bagu s, We expected the room quality to be at least as good as our hotels in Dubrovnik Croatia which was not the case The rooftop pool is quite small It looks bigger in photos , We own hotels in Dubrovnik Croatia and as hoteliers were very impressed by the staff who were very helpful and caring and they make this hotel great The location is obviously great as well 
359929,Hotel Bagu s, The bedroom Whilst we had a great roof terrace with Jacuzzi the room itself weas a bit cramped with not enough space to hang wet towels etc , The staff were outstanding the best and most genuine of anywhere I ve stayed The location is great on the Ramblas the it s a beautifully designed hotel 
359930,Hotel Bagu s, No dressing table for the wife in the Jewel suite Could also hear the music from the roof top bar with the windows and doors closed Also no late check out considering of the amount paid to stop in the Jewel suite , Good faculties very good staff would stay again
359931,Hotel Bagu s, Slow and confused reception sometimes , Design design design it s very beautiful hats off bravo Very efficient and convenient room planning Excellent noise protection of windows we did not hear the street at all 
359932,Hotel Bagu s, Got a pitch dark room with window facing the inside of the hotel black space between the elevator and the stairs covered by a dark curtain Depressing room and depressing stay and not what i would expect for the price , The service was the best thing about the hotel
359933,Hotel Bagu s, Rooms was very small I had a suite the bathroom was even smaller the shower less the 1 meter sq had a pillar going through the middle of my room obstructing the view of the tv, I didn t like nothing can t understand how this hotel has a five star rating

359935,Hotel Bagu s,No Negative, Everything in the hotel was amazing cant fault it one bit The staff where friendly and couldn t do enough for us the food in the hotel restaurant was 2nd to none We enjoyed the roof top bar for a swim and a few drinks in the late afternoon 
359936,Hotel Bagu s,No Negative, fantastic staff very helpful great location and very welcoming people the owners of this hotel should be very proud of there people who run this hotel
359937,Hotel Bagu s, The terrace is small and the swimming pool is too small to easily swim in, The location the staff who always remembered my name My room was beautiful clean and tastefully decorated 
359938,Hotel Bagu s, problems with grumpy taxis outside, staff are amazing So friendly Rooms are designer cool yet comfy and friendly Really great quality boutique hotel 
359939,Hotel Bagu s, Room was to small and poorly configured Literally no place to set up a laptop Also allows pets Barking dog s a real problem , Very good location and the staff is excellent Very helpful with tickets and reservations 
359940,Hotel Bagu s, Everything was perfect , Staff was fantastic room was beautiful nicest hotel we have stayed in Europe I would go back to Barcelona just to stay in this hotel For the price right on La Rambla it was also reasonable 
359941,Hotel Bagu s, The contents of the open buffet at the breakfast room were just ok but below the standards of a 5 star hotel The so called terrace bar is not open after 8 pm which was a shame The pool at the terrace is not made for swimming as it s extremely small , The location is perfect for quick access to many sightseeing highlights metro and the hop on hop off tours The staff at the reception and the breakfast room were very friendly and helpful The hotel management was very kind to give a bottle of wine as a gift at our room 
359942,Hotel Bagu s, The bed wasn t very comfortable room smaller than it looked in images and most importantly there was no water hose in the bathroom which I believe is not hygienic, Location was perfect at Las ramblas the building was very nice and I was impressed by the fact it was an old gold workshop
359943,Hotel Bagu s, Rooms small Dark and no dressing table no mirror that could be used in the bedroom Was charged for Water This was not a 5 , The Staff and location
359944,Hotel Bagu s,No Negative, I enjoyed how warm and helpful the staff was The building is perfect and the beds were the most comfortable beds I stayed in my entire trip The rooms are definitely soundproofed which helps when you are on las Rambla I ve stayed at several other hotels over the years off las rambla and they have always been noisy I m Hotel baques was so quiet and the blackening curtains helped us sleep in We even had a small balcony that we could look out on 
359945,Hotel Bagu s, Room 601 needs redecorating rather scruffy walls and decoration in general not up to standard expected all it needs is a coat of paint , Location service
359946,Hotel Bagu s,No Negative, Superb boutique hotel in an excellent location Staff were professional helpful and friendly The hotel s restaurant was a revelation We enjoyed interesting cocktails and sumptuous dining We ll done 
359947,Hotel Bagu s, The only thing is the price for some dinner its to much money for little food But the taste was perfect So little more after your need and you have it , I like the rooms And the peaple on the hotel tok care of me so I felt good Spesial one girl because of her big smile and taste of humor 
359948,Hotel Bagu s, The sauna is a bit small and strangely located and the cleaning ladies didn t replace the soap and coffee cream when empty But these are really very small details We had a lovely stay , Very nice hotel well located and friendly staff 
359949,Hotel Bagu s, Because of the shape of the hotel some parts of the rooms can be slightly compromised in terms of space, Stayed here before and really liked it so went for an upgraded suite this time Was defo worth coming back for
359950,Hotel Bagu s, The in room dining menu was very poor they need to consider the little details instead of waiting us calling them Every couple of hours to provide our needs Things like the dental shaving kits a bigger trash can a bigger table , The location and the staff were excellent Which caused me to extend my stay for 3 more nights 
359951,Hotel Bagu s, The gym and pool were good for nothing really Barcelona is laced with one way streets so try to walk or subeay ecerywhere as taxis are poor choicrd to travel, Staff was helpful and attentive location was fantastic The bar on the room was beautiful at night The dinner experience at the restaurant was fantastic
359952,Hotel Bagu s, Strange room built in between ground floor and first floor Low ceiling and a round window going from the floor ans 0 8 meters up so you would have to go down on your knees to look out the window avoid room numbers 101 and 102 , Really nice staff
359953,Hotel Bagu s, 1 Horrible sound proof a lot of street noise and noise from corridor You will hear every move of cleaning stuff which starts exactly 9 am to clean neighboring units 2 They don t provide or allow to use iron in the room and kindly offer you paid service 3 Everything is mini here reception which is also a restaurant lifts hallways rooms gym terrace at the top the pool is extremely narrow you won t be able to stretch your arms Rooms are much smaller than they seem on the advertised pictures not 20 but more like 15 m2 4 No complimentary water in Spanish hotels , Centrally located kind and helpful reception staff clean
