323545,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, The hotel is old and although some modern features have being instaled like inteligent lights and AC the walls are thin so you can hear everything from around When checking in the clerk on duty did not tell about the city tax we had to pay at the end of our stay and had an arrogant superior attitude , The location is excellent near to public transportation and with stunning views over Amsterdam Also some of the reception staff members are really friendly and helpfull like Yulia and Max 
323546,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Room cleaning was sloppy they forgot a dirty cloth in the room the towels were not always replaced , The room was nice the view was amazing 12th floor at the corner however airconditioning was always on a bit cold 
323547,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, See above Breakfast way too expensive when time was limited , The breakfast might have been lovely but at 29 95 euro p p extra I did not try it out The nearby Portuguese cafe did a nice breakfast and it was on the route to the congress The pool was great 
323548,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, The hallway light would turn on with movement so tossing and turning in sleep would turn on the light and wake me up , The bed was comfy the sushi was amazing at Yamazota
323549,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, low water pressure the gel dispensers in the shower are not fit for purpose the areas behind and below furniture were very dusty fluff the coffee machine dispenser area was dirty dusty whilst sitting in the foyer the restaurant staff DO NOT MAKE ANY EFFORT to come and ask if a guest requires any drinks etc ,No Positive
323550,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,No Negative, Most amazing hotel with friendly and professional service as well as comfortable sized rooms There are three different michelin starred restaurants within the hotel and they are all amazing 
323551,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Room temperature on hot days only goes to 18 degrees Only one truly affordable restaurant , I liked the quiet luxury after a long day of sightseeing If you want to spend the day in the hotel then all your needs are met with restaurants and a spa 
323552,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, We had to contact Housekeeping a couple of times to come and clean our room and provide towels however when they did come their services cleaning the room towels etc were very good , The hotel was very modern clean and the staff were very friendly and accommodating 
323553,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Tea and coffee in room were with an espresso machine so not hot enough A good old kettle was all that was needed We asked for one and we re given it , The room and the bed and the bathrooms are to die for After an overnight drive from England because of delays at the tunnel the really lovely reception staff allowed us to check in at 8am instead of 3pm 
323554,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Paid more to have the executive room and access to executive lounge but the lounge wasn t well kept Very messy and no snacks both times we went up Great views though , Lovely clean rooms great view Excellent coffee facilities Location was convenient in inner city suburb Friendly and helpful staff kindly helped us with an adaptor Comfy beds Staff kindly left us a small cake as it was our honeymoon Convenient check out time Very spacious rooms 
323555,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Nothing not to like , Attention to detail toward making you welcome and your stay comfortable Having 3 Michelin star restaurant at hotel Great American European Japanese breakfasts available each morning Never have to leave 
323556,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,No Negative, Upon arrival the staff were very accommodating We got to the hotel 2 hours before check in 1pm and were very pleased to hear that they had our room ready I was initially skeptical about the panoramic views of Amsterdam but it is safe to say when we walked into our room on the 22nd floor we were blown away the view was spectacular The bedroom was spacious with everything in perfect working order I couldn t fault this hotel in any way In addition to this the bar on the top floor make fantastic cocktails Unfortunately with our speedy 1 night trip we didn t have time to make use of the spa next time I would recommend renting the bicycles you can do this from the reception and cycling up the road to Bakers and Roasters for the best brunch in Amsterdam enjoy everyone 
323557,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, upon arrival the receptionist thought that the person who arrived after me and was standing behind me was more important to attend to Insects in my bed and i got bitten by bedbugs Room only got cleaned a little bit after the 3rd day once i had complained about the status of the cleanliness I actually asked them if they don t include housekeeping in the booking com rate Poor service , close to RAI
323558,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Faultless, Faultless service and friendliness Rooms excellently appointed with many extras eg coffee machine clothes brush and an ironing board and iron Easy access to trams and cheaper food down the road Concierge able to post a big parcel home for us No bother 
323559,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Although the hotel obviously meets certain standards the room was significantly smaller and not as comfortable as for example the Conservatorium Even though the prices are within the same ballgame Service is good but not flawless The staff gave me the wrong key Also the doors close at 1 00 So no smoking after 1 00 Not being able to smoke was not a problem for me before at other hotels in this class , Excellent facilities Breakfast was very nice 
323560,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, The cot is too small for a 20 month old toddler The cleaness is not as good as other five star hotels that I have stayed The natural bar in the mini fridge went missing when we were out But once I informed the front desk they sent replaced one straight away , The bed is very comfortable 
323561,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,No Negative, Excellent hotel staff very welcoming and helpful Location fantastic for getting around the city Recommend using the Telsa Taxi service very good 
323562,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Not perfectly in centre of town but an easy taxi ride away Expensive like all hotels in Amsterdam , Beautiful stone marble bathroom great restaurant and bar Has a swimming pool which is nearly unheard of in Amsterdam 
323563,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Hotel was 40min walk from Dam Square The breakfast was cold The room was overpriced We paid our accommodation on arrival but where only informed of the city tax charge when checking out Also had to pay 400 deposit for the room in case of damage or charges to the room which I paid using my Debit card and have still not received it back , The view from our room was beautiful
323564,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Nothing, My husband and I enjoyed loved e erything about this hotel Great location Quiet at night very clean very friendly staff and great buffet breakfast 
323565,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Its not I did not like it its more the distance was quite far I would not of wanted to walk into the city center from the hotel however that was possible to do I think it would of taken about an hour to walk to the city center Public transport links are really close by and really frequent so this really helped , The hotel was fantastic great value room amazing view from our room on the 16th floor The staff were really friendly always giving us recommendations of where to go and see and places near the hotel to eat and drink Also they gave us excellent recommendations of what trams to get to and from the hotel The hotel was about 20 mins on public transport from the main attractions however it was only 15 min walk to the Heineken experience It was in a nice area and we came back late most nights and always felt safe on the surrounding streets Room was really big and very well appointed 
323566,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,No Negative, Close to many bars and restaurants but still quiet enough at night Easy to get to the town centre on the trams Didn t have breakfast as it was very expensive 35 euros each Lots of cafes in the surrounding area 
323567,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, The pillow menu sounded a good idea but after ordering 2 different types I still couldn t find a comfy one The room was very warm so we had to have aircon on 24hrs a day , The hotel is in a quiet suburban area so nice and peaceful away from the noise and bustle of the centre but is still a large hotel with all the amenities you would expect 
323568,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Leaving, Trip was to celebrate my Mums 8oth birthday A lovely cake and birthday card were left in her room We had two lovely adjoining rooms with wonderful city views Staff were amazing True 5 star service 
323569,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Its on the outskirts of the city center and a little far for some people to walk, The Motel has a real Japanese feel to it we were extremely impressed The concierge was absolutely the best and at the same time nothing was a problem 
323570,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, The deposit taken from your debit credit card for insurance on the room should go straight back into your account on leaving , Great hotel for those appreciate quality set in a quieter and more relaxing location 
323571,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, The waiting area at the Spa should not be used for customers post treatment They should have a separate relaxation room , The Spa service was excellent therapists were friendly professional and attentive 
323572,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, On arrival very Long wait for rooms plus if you don t check they do not allocate the correct room as per your booking Not flexible for late checkout But they at least allowed us to sit in the lounge upstairs till our car pickup arrived for the airport Over rated EXECUTIVE lounge facilities Requires to be upgraded and does not suit the standards nor the image of the hotel nor all the awards that are hanging on the wall Better drink and food faculties need to be implemented and improved Poor service but after lodging in a complaint it was corrected but need to provide for vegetarians and offer better drink facilities , Hotel overall was very good and staff extremely helpful and excellent Concierge services Our reservation was very professionally handled Really Excellent and great breakfast and very good service The Pool and health club were of a great standard with good facilities
323573,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, When booking for my 10 year old son to come with us it wasn t clear that he would not automatically be provided with his own bed He was initially expected to share a single bed with one of us until Management agreed to put up a roll away bed Was a very disappointing start to a surprise weekend for my husband S birthday and this was not clear when booking through booking com This would make me wary using you again , Roomy bathroom
323574,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Location is a bit far from downtown isn t in a safe neighborhood At night it was a bit frightening to walk back to the hotel , Very comfy room friendly helpful staff 
323575,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, We had two rooms and both rooms had difficulty charging electronic devices Even after all day on charges devices were below 50 charged , The hotel was very clean and modern 
323576,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Location is not very close to the center, The breakfast was very nice Japanese breakfast also available definitely a bonus Spa with steam bath and excellent staff 
323577,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, From our room you could hear the sound of the lifts which was a bit annoying at night , We had an executive room with access to the executive lounge which was a great bonus free drinks and snacks 
323578,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, I find that the Executive room even bigger is not as cosy as the less expensive ones The hotel is a bit in the middle of nowhere so each time you hang out you need a taxi , Excellent service and a panel of too good restaurants make sure you have a reservation The breakfast with fresh smoothies and a touch from Japan are a must The Japanese deco is splendid 
323579,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, The restaurants are great But the ambience is very much business which might be cool if you re a business person but for me it reminded me too much of work I think maybe removing the dress code from the restaurants could help to create a more relaxed feeling ,No Positive
323580,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, The price quoted in English via Booking com and the price I actually paid differ somewhat to the tune of 40 88 This I need to take up with Booking com direct as the hotels advised they have nothing to do with the deal they offered , Our executive room windows were slightly smeared merky which gave an obscured view We did have an issue with the aircon on arrival which took a while to resolve but once it was the room felt much more comfortable the bed was nice and big the pillows lovely and soft The room was spacious the bathroom was very nice Big bath the temperature of the water for the bath never felt hot enough for me personally as I like an extra hot bath The toilet seat was to die for with the heated seat and the built in wash dry functions 
323581,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, The only thing that was a miss was there was no milk provided with the coffee machine, The room was fantastic very big and the bed was very comfortable The bathroom had a lovely bath with tv So was great to relax after all the walking around the lovely city Our suite was on the 20th floor so we had spectacular views over the city All mod cons remote control for lights curtains and room temperature The toilet had a heated seat Toiletries were complimentary Th
323582,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, The reservation system for their restaurants Guests STAYING AT THE HOTEL should have some sort of priority for booking As most of the people eating at the restaurants were NON RESIDENT, The whole hotel was exceptional the staff were helpful food was exceptional no complaints However we could not get a reservation at any of their Michelin star restaurants which was disappointing so if you need to eat there BOOK early before you go
323583,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, but the room itself was not as good as it could of been great views of the city but the bathroom had i sewage smell to it and the plug in the sink did not fit correctly and so had to keep the water running to keep water in the sink, Staff very friendly and extremely helpful
323584,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Absolutely nothing to dislike, One of my favourite hotels but has to be for a special occasion due to the cost The Japanese restaurant is wonderful and the staff are among the friendliest we have encountered anywhere Not far from town on the tram Purchased 48 hour ticket from very helpful concierge 
323585,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, We had initial hiccups during the checkin process into the room as the room was quite smaller than what was shown during the booking in the website This was conveyed to the supervisor ERIC who ensured that we were given the right room size Thanks to the staff for making it good with least of inconvenience , The breakfast spread was quite good and fulfilling The location is quite apt for our need And the view from the room was refreshing as the weather was sunny during our stay 
323586,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, The breakfast was wildly overpriced 29 50 for a rather mediocre breakfast buffet the lobby bar unfortunately closed every night at 9 which is a bit early for a city hotel , The staff were very helpful and friendly and the leisure centre was excellent
323587,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, A bit out of the city centre but within 15mins with the tram or 30mins on foot , Excellent professional and very friendly staff The same applies to the room service Great selection of pillow and super comfortable bed The facilities pool jacuzzi are great too There are a couple of interesting Michelin star restaurants at the hotel that are worth trying Overall great experience 
323588,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Furniture bathroom worn down shabby we were not able to have Dinner at any of the Hotel Restaurants even as Hotel Guests because all tables booked up Wondering there are no table contigents for hotel guests Also no equipment for the pets , Comftorable Bed but daun pillows only by demand Very kind Staff
323589,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Nothing it was just great The hotel decor is maybe 10 years old but it s still so classy , Love the access to the executive lounge and health club and tv in the bathroom is a nice surprise Japanese breakfast and the abundant choices are just so great 
323590,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, The pool was over chlorinated and smelt a bit too much of it , The bed was large soft and great to cuddle in The pool was beautiful with the open skylight above felt like swimming in the sky So happy the staff were super friendly and helpful Also their allowance of furry friends in the hotel was a huge plus since not many hotels allow it 
323591,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, The breakfast was abit expensive and the City or room taxes being added on at check out that was unexpected , The staff were so nice and helpful making us feel so welcome 
323592,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, The Queen King bed in our room had two mattresses that s not something you expect in a top hotel It was explained to me this is not true of all rooms But occurred because of an upgrade due to travel with a minor In addition the room furniture is starting to feel dated The maintenance on the rental bikes is also poor I was asked to select a newspaper but none was delivered to the room I forgot to ask about this Breakfast felt overpriced , The staff was helpful and informed The views from the room are fantastic And the food in the restaurants astounding 
323593,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, enjoyed our stay very much would return The only thing was the bar on the 23rd floor It is very small so our nightcap was a bit of a disappointment as we had to stand up and not really see the view due to the large number of guests in the bar , The bed was so comfortable The view from the room was lovely Attentive staff Enjoyed the breakfast and even when busy you felt comfortable Great atmosphere Went to the teppanyaki restaurant in the Hotel and we had a 3 and half hour experience A wonderful idea for a special event or a group of friends The meal was fantastic I was so impressed with all the staff at the hotel They would take the time to assist and ensure that you were happy For example we are tea drinkers and there was a coffee machine in the room but no kettle Within minutes a kettle appeared with a friendly staff member 
323594,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, not a thing, This place is a gem far from the centre of Amsterdam But given how easily you can move around the city it s easily worth it The Michelin star restaurants yes plural should be reserved in advance 
323595,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, The window was dirty spoiling the view , Great bar at the 23th floor and nice pool sauna area Friendly staff Not far from the Albert Cuyp market 
323596,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,No Negative, The breakfast is amazing The staff are super friendly helpful and always willing to go the extra mile The hotel is grand elegant and so comfortable definitely worth its price Spa access is free 
323597,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,No Negative, We liked everything in the hotel the kindness of the staff birthday cake for my hushband birthday upgrade in an executive room because we had temperature trouble in the original one advice for visiting the city help with booking restaurant or spa in the hotel the breakfast the comfort of the bed 
323598,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Terrible Location so far away from City Center The room for 2 people was very small so I don t want to imagine what the single bedroom looks like , It was clean 
323599,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,No Negative, Friendly staff and very helpful concierge Enjoyed the health club facilities which were spotless the breakfast and the cocktail bar on the 23rd floor as well as getting out and about on the hire bikes available from reception 
323600,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Minor complaint not a great selection of channels and not many English speaking shows , The hotel was amazing the surrounding area had lovely restaurants and was a nice break from the centre Staff were wonderful and would recommend to anyone visiting Amsterdam The spa treatments were fantastic and reasonably priced Definitely 5 stars
323601,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, The bar wasnt very lively and could of done with better music and atmosphere Little bit out of the way but uber is a great option , Lovely hotel and would recommend 
323602,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, On arrival I was very upset and confused When booking this hotel it specified that I can book now pay later However when I arrived with my boyfriend reception told me I had to pay a deposit of 200 euros per night that was 400 euros which left us with no spending money what so ever ,No Positive
323603,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Breakfast was v expensive 30 my advice to others would be to walk to Central from the hotel 30 min walk and find a nice cafe for breakfast e g mook pancakes though omlegg is in the area of de pijp which is also an amazing breakfast place You save 20 euros , Everything was v good 
323604,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Deposit requested was a little on the higher side for an overnight stay However it was promptly returned on checkout , Very nice family room package with good personal touches like a chocolate teddy for the kids World class restaurants to satisfy the pickiest foodie good amenities tasteful d cor throughout 
323605,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Our room was not available at check in time and we had to wait over an hour not a fun way to start our stay , Breakfast was delicious and the facilities are great Only downside is the location kinda far from downtown Amsterdam
323606,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Brakefast was a disaster we had to wait every morning over 3 days for coffee 20 25 min only because we our seleves went to the coffee machine In Jacuzzi was full of jumping kids who used the jacuzzi as a kinder garden and jumped directly in it and made boms in the water without any saying anything we can not reccomend this hotel for adult who want high class hotel, The qualaty of the food was very good very proffessional welcomst at the door men and in the recpetion and also the cleaning was one of the best we every have experienzed 
323607,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Fact that all the restaurants were closed so early on new years eve We reserved 2 executive rooms and checked in around 15 30 Lady said we only have 1 room ready Sir for the other the key will be taken to your room in about 10 minutes Around 17 00 I went back to reception to find the lady had forgotten , Parking onsite from 17 00 till next day 14 00 40 00 Breakfast is excellent 
323608,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, It was late in the evening and I was very hungry and all the surrounding businesses had closed so I had no choice but to order room service I ordered a cheeseburger with fries saw the price was 22 so I accepted that the food then gets to my room and there is a service fee of 6 euros so I asked the gentleman if this was his tip and he responded with no sir this all goes to the hotel so I tipped him 2 I paid 30 for a small overcooked burger and fries Paying for a service fee should go to the person giving you the service or at least half It s wrong to charge someone this much for a burger and fries no matter how much money a person may or may not have , Bed was very comfortable and the shower had great water pressure Two things that always make a stay great for me 
323609,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, There were some hidden charges such as pool utilization 15 p p and parking 35 per night Furthermore Hotel is pretty dated , Location and view from room 
323610,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,No Negative, Amazing restaurants Good rooms Very friendly staff In a calm area that is not too far from city center This is the second time I stay at Okura and wont be the last 
323611,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, The water pressure in the shower was adequate but no more than that The concierge should not say that the tram stops opposite the hotel on the main street If I had not looked carefully I would have missed the tram which stops 200 yards to the right , The room was in quiet good taste and very comfortable The bed and the bathroom were excellent I took the Japanese breakfast for the experience It provided many new flavours and would bear repeating although the salmon was dry The bar is friendly and well equipped The Japanese meal in Yamazato was first class The wine arrangement provided for alternation between wine and sake On balance I would have preferred sake through out 
323612,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, The heater in the room did not worked it made only cold air after the hotel offered us to change room we decided not to accept as were uncomfortable with that so they offered us a bottle of wine at the end it was the only bad thing of a wonderful hotel, Very good breakfast silent rooms beautiful spa
323613,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, To me the bed was too hard , Beautiful pool and health centre lovely bar on 23rd floor The overall ambiance of the hotel was calm and luxurious in a simple pared back way The staff were very well trained and delightful It was also nice not to be right in the centre We enjoyed walking around the de Pijp area 
323614,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, You have to pay extra for swimming pool and sauna And you have to do this conversation with your bathrobes in front of swimming pool Ladies sauna is very small just for 2 people Although I ordered breakfast while booking the room I had to make a conversation that I didn t pay for the breakfast I had to check my e mail to show my booking Then it is said that my choice is not important in booking com it wasn t charged during booking and I have to pay there This stay was a birthday surprise for my husband Having payment conversion 2 times in one night stay is not something that is making a surprise nice Then we didn t want to have breakfast and check out earlier than we planned ,No Positive
323615,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Somewhat remote location but trams nearby Front desk needs training Once the staff learns you are staying in house the attitude improves , Several fine restaurants Great staff Pricey To really be what they should be the general staff needs to rise a few levels and emulate the restaurants So this is several fine restaurants with a hotel not the reverse 
323616,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Very thin walls every night I was kept awake by neighbour noise Room service could have been a bit warmer , Room was lovely spacious and warm toned Massive mirror came in handy Shower was excellent Staff were absolutely lovely impeccable English and customer service skills Gentleman at concierge was very helpful Room service from Serre was delicious 
323617,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Having to pay 200 Euro per night as a deposit was a shock when we first arrived Was also a little while away from a lot of things , The room was absolutely amazing we stayed in the deluxe room and everything about it was great 
323618,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Very poor housekeeping Room and bathroom were never cleaned properly , Very attentive and helpful stuff during breakfast They went all out to ensure all our requests were fulfilled 
323619,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, We were recommended to try the restaurant on the top floor without any inquiry of budget A few of my colleagues didn t want to continue their meal experience there because they hadn t foreseen the cost and subsequently left , Super friendly and attentive staff An absolutely beautiful building Wonderful views from the top floor Cool rooms 
323620,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Dusty room too close to lift small room for executive room Broken hooks on bathroom door Noisy next to beeping lift at night , Spa sauna executive lounge bed were comfortable The staff were friendly 
323621,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Windows don t open enough for fresh air but everything else was awesome , We celebrated our 1 year anniversary and were treated so well I am so happy we picked this hotel for or celebration 
323622,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,No Negative, Excellent hotel Beautiful rooms staff were very helpful and there was a great bar up on one of the top floors Highly recommended place to stay in Amsterdam 
323623,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Nothing special about the hotel considering the price Nothing extra at all Crappy tv channels expensive movies spa was always to booked up to get a massage Bottom line all expense for nothing really Ended up buying breakfast because of convenience but not worth 32 dollars Didn t even have power adapters , Comfortable bed and room 
323624,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, No complaints at all Everything was perfect , Beautiful hotel with excellent facilities Very clean and high standard of service Food in the Serre restaurant was fabulous Spotlessly clean and well kept All staff very friendly and helpful 
323625,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, I didn t realise we had to leave a high security deposit for the mini bar services this should be made available before booking, Beautiful hotel staff very friendly but is a little distance to the city centre but walkable
323626,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, I felt like lived at 3 Hotel ask and we will try to fix but at 400 euros night Our room 1705 and 5 let me feel 5 Personal touch was lack at our stay at Hotel 1 Hair dry socket 220 did not work in the bathroom not fixed on our stay Had to wake up my roommate at 7 am while using it A hair dryer shuts down in 30 seconds overheating had to ask second dryer 2 Telephone I was not heard on the desk table not fixed on our stay 3 no hair conditioner in the shower 4 windows should be cleaned from outside 5 my Stay bill could not be printed some troubles 6 we took a ride by bycicle to have a Press Reader access to read newspapers to Europa Hotel why not in ccura As at executive lounge only 1 English newspaper 7 came back to had a lunch at Hotel and fully booked we got a table for 1 hour from 18 30 1930 question why reception did not advices to book it at check in While conference was in the Hotel 1 no toilet paper in the lobby while conference was in the Hotel we informed once but in two hours again was no paper imagine 500 men with no paper 2 at executive lounge had always to ask for wine napkins clean table bottle openers snacks attention have to dials 888 not 888 as written to room service 3 to get a taxi at Hotel impossible asked for considerar help and waited outside without help caught outside Hotel was plenty taxi waiting why to work 200 meters in cold in 5 Hotel , We had 3hours lovely Walk from the Shiphall airport use a bycicle road to Occura Hotel asked Hotel by telephone on possibility to walk answer was to take a taxi The view from executive lounge and possibility open the window in the room we rented bycicles thanks to Sofi from hotel reception we got them for free at check in we got upgraded for one night we booked for two nights at different rates with the same room and access lounge also we got an access to business lounge till 18h check out was at 12h Stuff helped and cooperated in everything Thanks to house keeper my jeans were dry in 30 min 
323627,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Jacuzzi should have salts foam for a more relaxing experience , Lovely canal view large room with spacious bathtub Impressive entrance and facilities overall
323628,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Nothing it was all great , The staff were lovely and helpful The room was amazing looked better than the pictures We would definitely like to stay again
323629,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,No Negative, Actually booking com did male a mistanke with our reservation but Okura handled this very professionally and did show exceptional high service Amazing restaurants at the hotel and a very serviceminded staff 
323630,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, There was building work outside on the second night that we were not warned of and it would have been nice to have been made aware that sleep was not possible after 5am Breakfast was average for this level of hotel It was a marathon that Sunday a taxi into town cost 60 as a result of it having to go all the way round the ring road maybe the hotel could warn guests as normally it is 15 , The pool and gym were excellent 
323631,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Not very close to the city center although the tram goes close by Somewhat expensive , Nice location if you want to be near the convention center Good quality room and friendly staff Convenient taxi to the airport 
323632,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, We requested a twin room and I was very disappointed that I had to send numerous emails to request this I cannot understand why there is the option to choose a twin when booking Only when payment was taken that a response was received back stating that a TWIN could not be guaranteed Surprised that car parking and use of the pool had to be paid for A small thing was that there was no free water in the hotel room The water from the tap is drinkable but if you wanted bottled you had to pay from the mini bar The location is a little further out from the city There are trams close by We actually got a train from the airport to RAI and walked to the hotel It took about 15 mins A local person showed us the way The local people are very friendly and helpful The hotel is more suitable to business than a holiday hotel Very corporate in design , The staff were wonderful and helpful They all spoke beautiful English 
323633,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Hotel located outside the city center , Very spacious and well designed room very convenient and comfortable bathroom very friendly and helpful personnel new and modern furniture good food 
323634,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, I called 5 different services from the room telephone and no one replied I had to get to the lobby and talk to reception , Waiter friendliness and service at the Serren and Sazanka restaurant 
323635,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, 1 Room service kept forgetting items from our order it took 3 attempts to get it right 2 Although it was relatively close to a tram stop it was too far from the main restaurants and attractions by walking This resulted in a lack of atmostphere 3 The hotel taxis were executive minimum 30 4 spa prices were quite expensive even for a hotel 30 for gel removal from hands alone , 1 24 hour room service available 2 michelin star restaurants located in the hotel 3 spa available 4 pleasant staff
323636,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, The stay was too short, The welcome and attention by all the staff They were helpful in all aspects even queries about how to use the tram without the OV card
323637,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Housekeeping was below average Didn t bother to clean carpets everyday and hair in mini bar Below expectations on this occasion , Good food and good breakfast Very polite friendly staff Rooms had a good view Concierge provided great service 
323638,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, It s expensive rate but when they have special deal it is worth it , I like its cleanness and hotel facilities including bike hire Amazing bathroom 
323639,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, It would have been great if there was one restaurant in the hotel that was more informal there are 2 Michelin starred restaurants but they are of course pricey and perhaps not so child friendly , Great acommodation for a family 2 spacious double rooms with connecting door lovely views over Amsterdam The staff were just amazing friendly helpful and personal The breakfast buffet was great and overall level of comfort very high The location is also good close to a canal where you can hire boats and well connected with public transport Plenty of restaurants also within walking distance 
323640,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, I was not impressed with the new Ciel Blu bar Too impersonal and stark , It has been awhile since I stayed at this hotel It still has the same good qualities I remember from the many previous visits with improvements It felt like coming home Staff is very helpful And the location is superb 
323641,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, I booked because it has a Spa I do not appreciate a prestigious hotel like the Okura charging paying clients for the use of the swimming pool I shall not return with this pool charging policy , Quality
323642,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Gym is a bit limited but not too bad Probably not worth the extra 15 a day to use it unless you re going to use the pool too Not cheap to eat or drink here but it is a genuine 5 star so what would you expect loads of places around to eat and drink anyway , Fantastic hotel in a great area unless you want to be on the doorstep of the city centre It s about 2 miles from Centraal Station in a cosmopolitan mainly residential area but with loads of restaurants cafes and quiet bars Team stops 2mins walk from hotel and gets you into leidersplein within 10 mins Four restaurants three of which have Michelin stars Not cheap but worth a visit Right on a canal which means pleasant walks Area feels very safe day and night Genuine 5 star hotel for not a lot more than some poor hotels in the city centre It wen has its own taxi rank so no excuses Wouldn t hesitate to stay here again unless I was on a stag do Also has a really nice bar on the top floor 23rd Oh aye and you can hire a boat on the canal outside 
323643,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,No Negative, Everything was just perfect beautiful room and amazing hotel Spa was really nice and great massage Breakfast was delicious We had dinner at Serre restaurant inside the hotel which I totally recommend for both the amazing service and the really tasty food Staff all over the hotel was really kind competent and happy We ll definitely go back one day 
323644,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, There was water clogging in one of the wash basins and the tea coffee creamer sachets needed replenishment which we had to remind room service about the same , lot of automation in the room plus the room is very well desgined meaning that there is space to actually move around in the room which is really very good 
323645,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, When we checked in the hotel the handling of the staff was not smooth It took lots of time for check in so we got the big stress The handling of the check out was also It was very stressful for us , Breakfast was very very nice Since our room was on the 12th floor the view was very good

323648,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff were excellent The staff at the reception desk and the staff at breakfast especially were superb They made our kids feel at home and were wonderful The rooms were always cleaned and our beds turned down every night We loved it so much we booked another three days stay on our return trip 
323649,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, My items from laundry had been lost ladies working on Reception were not very helpful responsive in situation when guests have unaxpected and non standard problems , Rooms on upper floors have a superb view of Amsterdam there is a nice swiming pool and saunas areas spa Breakfast is very good There are very nice restaurants in the hotel Some staff are very professional and friendly and even can deal w problems in a proper way to support image of Okura as a high level services hotel Jos Pallandt obviously have to be promoted Another helpful person Luca on reception 
323650,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Interior is a bit out dated although it does not look worn down Maybe its a matter of taste The toilets with more possibilties you can imagine are hilarious but not my cup of tea , Good hotel in nice part of amsterdam Easy to travel to centre by bike which you can rent at the okura and only 15 min from airport Breakfast is nice and the teppanyaki a must All restaurants in okura are fine 
323651,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, We did not like the dessert at the restaurant Crepes with sesame ice cream I think Just not that special , Staff were exceptional Spa was lovely and clean Tepannyaki restaurant was amazing and so was breakfast 
323652,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Unfortunately the bar on the top floor was closed for refurbishment so there was nowhere to enjoy a pre dinner cocktail , The accommodation was lovely nicely appointed and immaculately clean We are in the restaurant all 3 nights we stayed there and had two low it meals though one of the evenings the food was not up to the same standard The staff were acceptionally helpful and the parking was useful and secure 
323653,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, We booked a deluxe room but we got a room that was less than the description of a deluxe room , Nice hotel nice terace on the canal splendid lobby and restaurants 
323654,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Night time room service was very rude and the concierge was very unhelpful Further the bar was closed for a private event so guests couldn t use it , The location is excellent and the room was large 
323655,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Extra charges for leisure club Too far away from central Amsterdam, Too fair away From activities All restaurants close by 10 30 11pm Had to pay extra to use leisure club So We won t be going back

323657,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Breakfast was average cold , Very good located en comfortable hotel with a very friendly staff Downtown is within 15 minutes walk Panoramic view is probably one of the best in Amsterdam 
323658,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Expensive breakfast better options nearby Lounge restrooms not fit for luxury hotel , Unbeatable price quality relation Not in downtown but within walking distance or short tram and in quite neighborhood 
323659,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Shower drain malfunctioned resulting in a flooded bathroom TV screen is just too old and to small for a hotel of this signature , Friendly staff super comfortable bed very spacious room 
323660,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, There were food trays that were left in the hallway in all hours we were there The smell of the food would waft into our rooms and I hated it There was one pillow per bed unlike all the other hotels I ve been to where you had a choice between firm soft pillows The pillow was too big and uncomfortable to sleep on The tub in my room was dirty and I really enjoy my baths The internet is an absolute joke , The staff was very friendly and helpful The concierge really knew his stuff because he recommended us one of the best Chinese restaurants we have had in our 2 weeks stay in Europe It was by a river and a quiet street 
323661,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Price is to high being that hotel is located not in Center of Amsterdam Your rate is based on it being a luxury hotel but compared to some it s not exactly the highest of luxury hotels But still nice and stands out from the rest Amsterdam has loads of awful hotels , Lovely hotel Highly recommend Location a bit far from center but it s quiet which is a plus 
323662,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, The location was not as convenient as we thought It s a nice area but quite far from the city center and most areas that we wanted to visit Had to figure out the tram system since it s practically the only convenient means to get around , Room was very tidy bed comfortable with extra amenities that made the stay all the more pleasant I love the automated curtains and water closet The TV inside the bathroom is a big plus too 
323663,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, We found it quite absurd that we were required to pay and extra 15 for every visit to the spa pool jacuzzi and sauna as this is a spa hotel Also it was rather annoying to find out that the complimentary wifi connection was extremely slow and that a faster connection came with a fee of 12 a day , Great facilities excellent spa and a friendly staff The Pijp is a fantastic quiet neighborhood far enough from all the touristic noise It took us around 15 mins walk to get to the canals from the hotel A 
323664,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, A 5 stars hotel where you have to pay additional money to access the pool Unbelievable Tv not working well sound system in the room is not working , Clean
323665,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, First impression is extremely important to me We waited at least 15 min before getting to check in No lines just that there was no staff willing to help Everything cost extra in this hotel except for the low speed wifi off course Going to the hotel gym 15 euro Breakfast 30 euro per person per day although a very nice breakfast it is absolutely on a too high price point Strange and confusing explanations to why they don t see in the system that i already included breakfast when booking and they wanted to charged it again Luxury toiletries that is mentioned in the description was a bit of a disapointment Just too much hassle double checking and extra charges for a hotel on this level , Had a great cooking class Taste of Okura really recommended Room was nice and had a great view of Amsterdam 
323666,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, We checked in earlier when the room wasn t ready yet Service was very good than But when we arrived 18 00 we had to wait 35 minutes for our key because the person the counter was giving very good service to 2 gentleman but never noticed the line with customers who were waiting The porter apologized but couldn t help , Lovely hotel with many services We did get a voluntary upgrade to the 19th floor The amenities and view made me very happy

323670,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, The soap shampoo could be better for a hotel like this, The location was perfect Away from the busy tourist activities yet an easy walk Great local restaurants pubs and cafes 
323671,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Expensive not just the hotel but what you have to pay for when you are there 29euros each per night for breakfast 15 euros to just use the swimming pool all adds up by the end of the stay , Clean modern and decorated well Also in great area of De Pijp and really close to the airport 
323672,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,No Negative, The service especially the concierge team was excellent The concierge was so helpful and they managed to secure us reservations in different restaurants that we requested Their response time is amazing too Very attentive 
323673,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Bottle of water was already open and half empty in the mini bar before arrival The price of a small water bottle 33cl 6 7 is way overpriced would even consider the word theft No free one offered like in most 5 star hotels When I made clear that this was unacceptable they quickly changed the subject and had no interest in making an offer Coming from a wealthy 31 year old couple ,No Positive
323674,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, There is nothing specific I didn t like I had the slight impression that the rooms were not cleaned thoroughly but I may be wrong , I liked the breakfast The design of the hotel The place The natural light of the rooms Very nice and decent hotel
323675,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, 1 Location is a bit far tram service is excellent approx 4KM from the center Anyway we like to walk especially the weather was perfect 2 During our stay we tried many times to book their wellness center but they always full so try to book in advance if you are interested , Five Star Hotel everything you need it s there The staff at the reception was very professional she received us with warm smile and she even upgrade our room Thank you 
323676,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, They should definitely improve their free wifi because it was impossible to use it The strength of wifi internet was shown as it would be high however it wasn t loading anything so that s the only minus that I found in this hotel , Breakfast was great huge assortment of various dishes however if you like to eat porridge in the morning might take some time to explain what it is because not of the staff member knows what it is In total I loved the service from beginning the porter man was extremely polite and helpful at the reception lady gave all important information room was clean and supplied with all necessary things there is also an option of choosing comfortable pillow from a pillow menu restaurants were at the highest level especially I loved the Sazanka restaurant Hotel has a parking garage where cars are safe and they won t get dirty during the day if it is raining After check out the porter supplied our car with bottles of still water what was nice 
323677,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Wish gym and pool were included in the room rate, Really comfortable bed lovely bathroom great staff and top quality restaurant although only sampled late night cheese board dessert and port and lovely pool

323688,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, A lot of hidden charges here For pool newspaper breakfast parking gym tax admin etc The usual Also they insist on charging E200 A NIGHT to your card for expenses This is never explained to you when you book in breach of contract They will not refund this for a week or so afterwards In the meantime they keep your money and earn interest on it Your bank will charge you a flat fee for putting this charge through a percentage fee on top and will also rip you off on the exchange rate The result is that if you stay for 4 days around E880 will be taken out of your bank account You will then get about E800 back about a week after you stay there maybe longer I still do not have mine back from last trip and will have to chase You will be out of pocket for the E80 I have no idea why the Okura have started doing this It is unnecessary and slightly rude It indicates that they do not trust you to not cause E200 of damage a night The other 5 star hotels in Amsterdam do not do this If they persist with this practice I will stay at the Waldorf instead , Rooms nice Food Excellent Bar good views 
323689,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Check in was a hassle Too much bla bla and we were tired and late for our restaurant reservation Checkout was ok but too many people checking out at the same time and not enough employees so had to wait a bit , Great views and excellent restaurants

323695,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Our bathroom sink drained very slowly due to a poor adjustment on the height of the metal plug Simple enough I fixed it myself instead of calling the management but I wondered why wasn t this reported earlier to a supervisor by the cleaning staff , We liked the attention afforded us by the staff in addressing various questions we had about Amsterdam during our two day stay We found the accommodations very comfortable and the location of the hotel excellent to our needs

323703,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, When we checked in they had given our room to someone else which meant we didn t get into our room until after 3pm I was told that my husband had already checked into the room even though he was standing beside me Apparently they gave our room to someone with the same surname as us Once we were in our room which was lovely we received a phone call each day which was for other people one about a dinner reservation and one about a treatment in the spa We hadn t booked either of these appointments All in all the overall impression of the Okura was one of confusion , This is a fantastic hotel excellent facilities and beautiful rooms The bathroom was really special

323708,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Pricing for extras could have been clearer didn t know cost of mini bar or laundry service until we checked out We should have called to check however it would be good if there was a detailed price list on arrival , Hotel was beautiful and the service we received was excellent
323709,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, Having to pay to use a pool in a hotel that cost as much as it did, It was clean and tidy staff friendly location was good as it is a 2 minute walk to the tram which can then take you to the centre

323711,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, A rude other american geast I bumped into her a little bit by the chrismasbuffet and say sorry but she didn t accepted my apology and was yelling at me very hard and i was afraid she was going to hit me Some of the staff just speak english and i am a dutch geast and i do think the hotel need to have staff that speak dutch too, The staff is very kind and friendly
323712,Hotel Okura Amsterdam, You have to pay to use the pool which is a joke considering the price of the hotel You have to pay for proper WiFi The only hotels I have ever been to that have charged for this type of service is hostels You do not expect this from a supposedly quality hotel , Staff were friendly 
323713,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,No Negative, Visit Amsterdam regularly with work 10 or more times a year and this is the best so far A little bit more expensive and outside the city than others so would advise for couples or the older generation not boys on a lads holiday as the hotels location is a ten minute ride away by cab The staff service and facilities are amazing here with great restaraunts especially szanka 
323714,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,No Negative, An absolutely amazing stay first class staff and location unfortunately My wife couldn t make it because of incidents happening in Europe but the staff in the Hotel looked after me It was a shame they made her a beautiful birthday cake that I had to eat all to myself thankyou guys
