256341,The Zetter Hotel, The room was really hot the aircon turned off every 5 minutes and had a set minimum of 19 degrees which it definitely wasn t reaching We spoke to the staff but they weren t able to get it to stay on Luckily it wasn t too hot outside so we could open the window , Funky hotel in a great location walking distance from Farringdon close to St Paul s and Shoreditch Free tea and coffee machine on every floor Modern interior comfy beds nice and light with big windows 
256342,The Zetter Hotel, nothing not to like, Best hotel have used in London to date Will use again when working there superb value clean as a whistle and fantastic staff could not help enough 
256343,The Zetter Hotel, The location is a tricky one if you don t know London or are familiar with the tube The nearest tube is Farringdon Road but getting onto connecting services such as the Hammersmith city or circle lines can be awkward when carrying luggage Coffee tea making facilities are on the landing and did create an awkward moment in dressing gowns , The rooms are quite small by normal standards maybe not for London but they are very high spec and modern and perhaps the best shower we have ever had The adjacent area was pleasant in the sunshine but limited The decor is modern and includes some coloured lighting which may be a personal taste Bi folding shutters and internal glazing does help keep out the light and street noise 
256344,The Zetter Hotel, Training of night porter staff when serving at the bar , The hotel was gorgeous and its location for us was perfect However service was slow and there were a few mix ups with billing that had to be sorted out We would definitely return though Overall a very pleasant experience
256345,The Zetter Hotel, The service charge put on everything The night porter very nice person but needs to be trained more about serving drinks at the bar , Staff friendly at front of house Rooms great Plenty of water in rooms and tea and coffee Would use hotel again 
256346,The Zetter Hotel, Restaurant cold and expensive so went to Greasy spoon app for brekkie which was great Top notch restaurant behind the hotel and great bar burger place opposite , Best hotel in London that i have stayed in Facilities and staff are great Feels like home from home Coffee tea area on every floor is a great idea Nice location 
256347,The Zetter Hotel,No Negative, Fab hotel that comforting smell of freshly laundered sheets and towels as you entered the room Nice touches in the room giant bathroom scrumptious breakfast lovely friendly staff 
256348,The Zetter Hotel, An inconvenient and time consuming system for wifi logging , Very nice room with fantastic bathroom Cool interior and details in the room and whole building Very nice position in the city 
256349,The Zetter Hotel, Cannot respond I have no complaints, Lovely friendly staff very welcoming Very clean well positioned room Manageres gave us a special welcome Relaxing and very friendly hotel Would use it again and no hesitation in recommending this hotel Food excellent
256350,The Zetter Hotel, Nothing really the coffee at breakfast was a bit strong but that s personal taste I think nothing wrong with the quality , We have stayed at this hotel before in one of the more expensive rooms and so for the price we were paying we expected a much smaller room but it was a nice size light and airy and very comfortable The shower was one of the best hotel showers I have come across It is a great hotel in a very nice area and we had a good stay Will stay again when we can 
256351,The Zetter Hotel,No Negative, My favourite part of London having lived there previously and always enjoy my stays at the Zetter a peaceful oasis in the heart of town with the best cocktail lounge in the Townhouse and surrounded by great restaurants Worth paying for the slightly larger rooms and enjoying lounging in the morning over breakfast in bed 
256352,The Zetter Hotel, While there will always be a continuous need for staff training it felt like work in progress and as though when we approached the Reception Desk we didn t really want to interrupt the induction of new staff Breakfast was good but the service was a bit slow despite it being quiet when we ate and not very informative We chose the Full English which was 12 all in including toast and coffee but our bill for 2 people was 30 not sure why and were in a hurry when checking out and so didn t query it , The location is excellent especially if like us you booked it in conjunction with a show at the Barbican It s modern and smart and clean and the bedroom while cosy was very well designed and equipped The Housekeeping staff were very friendly and welcoming and obviously did an excellent job in the rooms 
256353,The Zetter Hotel,No Negative, Quirky room with little thoughtful extras Amazing shower Endless free tea and coffee from the little kitchen Lovely wine in the bar Good breakfast 
256354,The Zetter Hotel, Nothing thought it was excellent reception fantastic polite efficient quick check and out would definitely recommend, Superior room Amazing bed and shower room view almost exact except different chair to picture very quirky liked the array of drinks to make in public area when we arrived quite late at night have already booked to stay again this time with a freebie breakfast fantastic value for money great location to get around
256355,The Zetter Hotel, Food is somewhat pricey, Our welcome was polite and as if we were old friends returning Our room was spotless the bed comfortable and we wanted to take the shower home with us The hotel itself is a delight with highly original and charming decor and excellent food and service 
256356,The Zetter Hotel, No parking on site but this is London so this has to be taken into account , Lovely modern feel Staff were excellent and very friendly Great tea and coffee making facilities in the corridor with a fantastic choice of drinks 
256357,The Zetter Hotel, The shower was very trying as difficult to get the temperature right , Most comfortable hotel stay that I have had in modern and stylish surroundings The staff were charming and couldn t do enough for us 
256358,The Zetter Hotel, There was a fault with the lock on my door which meant I couldn t lock it reception explained that the locks had just been upgraded so perhaps this one was just an anomaly The biggest disappointment was the shower which didn t drain properly and flooded part of the bathroom floor Also the Bose speaker had an unpredictable connection mechanism I mentioned all these points in my feedback when I checked out and the staff did apologise , Comfortable bed and lots of room it was nice to be able to open the windows too Breakfast was excellent really good quality food It was great to have bottled water and hot drinks freely available The Bose speaker was a nice touch but the connection was not very constant Staff were friendly and helpful and the location was just right for going to Fabric one of the main reasons I chose this hotel Genius perk of late check out was a real bonus 
256359,The Zetter Hotel, I would have been happier if the WiFi access was unlimited , All the staff were friendly welcoming and provided excellent service Loved that I was upgraded on arrival too an unexpected bonus 
256360,The Zetter Hotel, Double beds in our standard guest rooms were a little bit narrow, Great location beautiful and well designed rooms Lovely staff who were very considerate with my elderly parents and noticed it was my mother s birthday and gave us some coupons for cocktails to celebrate 
256361,The Zetter Hotel, The hotel was fine but very basic the carpet was shag pile and I don t think that could be kept very clean It felt functional rather than comfortable We enjoyed the Zetter townhouse bar opposite , Good location and very friendly staff
256362,The Zetter Hotel,No Negative, Loved the room was very comfortable and it was a shame we were only there for one night We got an upgrade and the staff were all super accommodating 
256363,The Zetter Hotel, The bed was very soft too soft and not supportive enough this impacted on our quality of sleep , The additional facilities e g water and tea making on our floor
256364,The Zetter Hotel, The bed was too soft and the heating was very noisy even when set on lowest option it ran all night Breakfast staff were friendly but not very efficient delivering some items twice and missing other things off the order , Size of room cool decor lifts and bathroom 
256365,The Zetter Hotel, The mattresses were obviously good quality but we found them firmer than we prefer , The staff the location the decor the vibe Although right on busy Clerkenwell Road the double glazing meant there was no problem with noise We had a corner room which made excellent use of space and had enough room for a couple of chairs for guests to sit in Clerkenwell is a 10 minute walk from St Paul s Cathedral and there are various transport options with Farringdon Station nearby and buses on Clerkenwell Road but we wanted to get to know the area so did a lot of walking There were many places to eat nearby but it was good to know we could come back to the Zetter and have a pleasant meal in the restaurant or in our rooms Staff were all so pleasant and helpful and really made the stay for us 
256366,The Zetter Hotel, The room was quite small and the road noise was a little bothersome as the room was very warm when we arrived and we had to open a window I also didn t like so many snacks being placed in the rooms, The staff were pleasant welcoming and helpful The bathroom was small but well kitted out It was a good idea to make hot drinks available on the landing near the room
256367,The Zetter Hotel, A loud sort of humming noise on and off during the night but not sure whether it came from inside or outside so potentially not a lot that the hotel could do about that , Really friendly staff super helpful Lovely spot and great little touches throughout the hotel 
256368,The Zetter Hotel, The staff were advised it was our wedding night but still did not allow us a late check out as requested Breakfast was not included and we had a very small dark and poky room , The location was convenient
256369,The Zetter Hotel, Room was cold and a bit small Slow check in Hot chocolate was too sweet and not milky enough , Friendly clean good vibe Liked the spot by the window to work on computer with plugs etc 
256370,The Zetter Hotel, Free wi fi worked well but had to log on daily , Really great hotel all around Stylish comfortable great staff Flew in early in the morning and staff did everything they could to get me into a room before my first meeting Very nice options for breakfast Cocktail bar at their sister property Zetter Townhouse was fantastic Appreciated the free drink coupon too I thought the price was great for London as well 
256371,The Zetter Hotel, The dim and coloured lighting does hide some rough joinery work They preauthorised 25 from my card at checkin presumably in case I was tempted to steal from the minibar which was insulting We arrived on a cold day to a cold room We were heading out for the evening so we left a card in the slot and the heating on maximum We returned just after 10 to a cold room and obviously non functioning heating By 11pm the maintenance guy had got it working and delivered a heater This wasn t how we wanted to spend our time though Obviously the room wasn t checked properly beforehand We were offered complimentary breakfast in compensation which was fair although nobody communicated this to the front desk who tried to charge for it on check out The full English breakfast for 12 is fine but is more an assembly of ingredients than a well prepared meal There is an atrium above a bar lounge and the rooms are arranged in a circles around the atrium This means that you hear people laughing and shouting in the bar when your room door is shut although this is only annoying when you eventually get to bed and can hear it quite plainly The bathroom is ok but the shower controls are hard to get right The free newspaper is the evening standard which is a free paper anyhow The trend for hotels to withdraw services to save make money e g communal coffee making facilities no porter bellboy makes for disappointment because the lack of staff shows I don t think the Zetter was good value at 200 a night , The Zetter staff were very friendly and the hotel looks good if showing its age in places Check in was efficient It s in a good location The bed was soft but comfortable Nice view from the corner room over St John s Square 
256372,The Zetter Hotel, No handheld shower Room felt cramped Snacks were crammed onto the corner of already tiny desk Apart from ground floor decor felt dated and aggressive especially the neon multi coloured lighting Hot water bottle on bed is a nice idea in theory but how many people s sweaty feet has it been on , Comfortable bed Good price for nice location Very friendly staff
256373,The Zetter Hotel, See above, Lovely bathroom It was a little inconvenient to have to go into the corridor for tea and coffee though the machine delivered high quality drinks
256374,The Zetter Hotel, I don t like rain showers as I had to keep my hair dry we were there to go to a special event and I d had my hair done and so I couldn t use the shower easily Would have preferred a detachable shower head , We had everything we could possibly need It was all very comfortable clean and luxurious Very unobtrusive friendly staff but there if we needed them Loved the decor the style and the ambience Had a busy but personal feel Definitely coming back 
256375,The Zetter Hotel, Double bed was a little small but that s being super picky , Very nice hotel Well decorated Friendly and helpful staff Cool bar and awesome breakfast Rooms are quite small but really well planned out finished to a high standard and quirky Nice views out of London and the Shard from 4th and 5th floors
256376,The Zetter Hotel, Not much The Better has been good to me , I have stayed at The Zetter three times this year and each time has been a pleasure The staff from the front desk to the restaurant to housekeeping has been great 
256377,The Zetter Hotel, Bigger mug for a cup of tea but I am splitting hairs, The room was fabulous even had its own deck The hotel had organised walking maps these were terrific The wine bar does great tapas and the breakfast is excellent 
256378,The Zetter Hotel,No Negative, Thoughtful details everywhere Best minibar in town great room and warm informed staff So close to great restaurants coffee pubs galleries shopping Room service was excellent 
256379,The Zetter Hotel, Double bed way too small for Superior room Restaurant and bar area was far better before revamp Fruit salad little stale Disappointed compared with our last stay 3 4 years ago Had much more pizazz then , Location design of room
256380,The Zetter Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was perfect distance from the train station the staff we re really friendly and really helpful the room was perfect size and very clean the bed was comfy and the shower was amazing 
256381,The Zetter Hotel, Room was much smaller than it looked on the pictures bit too cosy for two people travelling on elsewhere for 10 days with luggage , Comfy bed and nice bathroom
256382,The Zetter Hotel, As much as I love The Zetter I do believe it is over priced for he value No breakfast included in the rates and the night rate is very high for a basic room Nice for a snazzy hide away in London but prepare to pay a large sum of money which in honesty should really buy you a lot more , Amazing boutique hotel a big fan of The Zetter My husband and I were celebrating our 10 year wedding anniversary as this is where we had our wedding reception all those years ago The rooms and hotel are full of character and delightful The staff are friendly and helpful and bought us up a bottle of champagne to celebrate our anniversary Very sweet thought They also offered us a guided tour of the changes made to the hotel I love the place stylish sleek and romantic 
256383,The Zetter Hotel, For the price of the room coffee making facilities in the room should be the norm especially as breakfast was not included Also an advance payment of 25 on my credit card was requested for extras as soon as we signed in We did not have any extras so I m hoping that as promised the money will be credited to us , Very comfortable bed with good quality bedding Extremely clean Loved the d cor Liked the location interesting historic buildings just across the road 
256384,The Zetter Hotel, The food was expensive , Upgraded to a delightful studio with balcony We loved the design and the view Very friendly surprisingly quiet location yet central The wine and beers were excellent 
256385,The Zetter Hotel, Breakfast seemed rather expensive 20 for full English cup of tea though was good, Room was well furnished and extremely clean Coffee machine on landing a great idea better than kettle in the room Great location for St Pauls Museum of London Tower and Tate Modern
256386,The Zetter Hotel, A bit far away from city center but it is not a big deal if you plan to explore city by foot Approximately 30 minutes walking and you are on Trafalgar Square or near Tower of London , Very friendly and supportive staff comfortable bed quiet location nice surroundings
256387,The Zetter Hotel, Nothing much If I m being really picky it would have been nice if some of the snacks in the room on the loyalty tray had been appropriate for breakfast time ie a biscuit or flapjack rather than just salty or chocolate based As I say a very small thing as we really liked everything else , The standard room was compact but still managed to feel luxurious with bathrobes and all the usual mod cons Great shower comfy bed with nice bedding The free coffee machine in the hall was a nice addition We would definitely stay again 
256388,The Zetter Hotel,No Negative, I stayed here with a friend in early July We chose the hotel because of the building the design and good reviews The hotel is the right side of funky By that I mean the design is funky without being impractical Although the hotel is on Clerkenwell Road the area is quiet and I had a good night s sleep Within easy reach of Oxford Street on the 55 bus All the staff were very friendly from reception to the housekeeper cleaning my room Special mention should go to Fabian on reception who sorted out a problem with the reservation via booking com and Olga who served breakfast with a smile The hotel has a map of Clerkenwell with recommendations for bars and restaurants We tried Sosharu a Japanese restaurant that was expensive but excellent and St John which does traditional British food also very good Clerkenwell itself is an interesting area with many old industrial buildings Worth exploring is the nearby Museum of the Order of St John St John s Ambulance housed in the former entrance to the Priory of St John We also walked to Islington and looked around the Regent s Canal A very enjoyable stay and nice to discover a new part of London Highly recommended 
256389,The Zetter Hotel, Breakfast was limited for the cost I would not take this inclusion in the future , We stayed in the most beautiful studio suite and the service was outstanding I look forward to returning to the UK and visiting again in the future 
256390,The Zetter Hotel, The armchairs did not really fit in with the decor the coffee machine in the corridor was a total waste Coffee making facilities need to be in the room The reception area was very much budget hotel style , Quality bed good lighting quiet room with wooden shutters lovely bathroom
256391,The Zetter Hotel, It was all excellent, Loved the style The staff were excellent and very friendly and knowledgeable Great pantry on each floor outside rooms with free bean to cup coffee tea and ice machine Very comfy bed Dressing gowns Bose sound link Great toiletries Free bikes to use breakfast looked lovely although we didn t eat here Location excellent Lovely neighbourhood 
256392,The Zetter Hotel, Bed was comfy but small standard double , Service was superb from all staff Great bathroom and shower We ate in the restaurant which is a great space to spend some time and food was delicious with a good wine selection 
256393,The Zetter Hotel, We had a room on the 4th floor and it was okay but with the bar downstairs and an open landing area I suspect it would of been a bit noisy on the 1st or 2nd floors, Staff were very friendly and helpful and the food in the bar downstairs in an evening was excellent
256394,The Zetter Hotel, restaurant and bar a bit old hat more hip atmosphere with small plates food would be good Loved being able to walk to Workshop Coffee or Modern Pantry for breakfast but would have liked same vibe in hotel eating area , bed was very comfortable Room very clean and staff very friendly 
256395,The Zetter Hotel, One very minor gripe was that they charged us an extra for a chocolate bar that showed up as taken from the food items left in the room We didn t take anything from the food tray and I sent an email to the hotel after to note this I also told them it was fine that we did not want a refund of the 1 60 That s how much we enjoyed our stay and appreciated their hospitality I was just surprised not to receive an email back But it s minor , We have stayed in many hotels all over and this has to be one of the nicest and friendliest The hotel is cool hip modern and comfortable The staff were engaging friendly and always wore a smile We ate in the restaurant on the second night of our stay and the food was delicious It is maybe a 10 minute walk from the hotel to St Pauls Cathedral where we began our bus tour of the city which I highly recommend Overall we really enjoyed our stay and I would say the hotel is excellent 
256396,The Zetter Hotel, Room was very small for the money Bed was squeaky Service charged on drinks that I ordered from the bar , Nice view from the room and the staff were pleasant I was offered a free glass of wine 
256397,The Zetter Hotel, Room and bed very small Maybe it s a London thing , Quirky Love the refit of the building and location Bathroom well appointed Nice touch with drink voucher 
256398,The Zetter Hotel, The restaurant now that it is more of a bar in my view is far too louche for eating partly because you can barely see what you are eating I preferred it when Loubet place was in the same space , All good except 
256399,The Zetter Hotel, Staff attitude on arrival was poor but on checking out was great Very dark small room just not worth the cost Noisy person in room above stomped about all night making a good night s sleep impossible , Lovely bed great shower good location 
256400,The Zetter Hotel, They cordon off the bar area during the day for something called Club Zetter rendering hotel guests second class citizens who are not allowed in the area Wifi is annoying The speed is good but requires constantly re entering password etc , Great staff from reception desk to housekeeping to bar 
256401,The Zetter Hotel,No Negative, Great hotel No complaints Even the standard rooms are great and feel luxurious with robes and a rain shower Coffee machine in hall is a nice touch Would recommend Great location on bus route but still quiet 
256402,The Zetter Hotel, The immediate vicinity is quiet at weekends although there are some hidden gems of cafes and restaurants very near, Cosy small rooms nicely decorated with plenty of innovative touches that make you feel looked after water from the hotel s own artesian well details of local walks and a complimentary bottle of Prosecco as it was my wife s birthday
256403,The Zetter Hotel, Nothing much really NCP parking is a couple of streets away and not particularly easy to find due to one way roads , The room was to a good standard with very comfortable bed and good bathroom 
256404,The Zetter Hotel, We had to upgrade to have enough space for a travel cot Even so the room wasn t spacious although the bathroom was huge that s where we parked the buggy , Coffee machine on each floor and REN toiletries in the bathroom 
256405,The Zetter Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location in a nice London neighbourhood with easy access to a few bus lines to travel across town Very comfortable rooms in this recently renovated hotel Staff was very friendly 
256406,The Zetter Hotel, There was no bar as under referburishment They didn t accept Apple Pay which meant I couldn t use my credit card and had to use my debit card which left me out of pocket , The hotel was very clean
256407,The Zetter Hotel, The shower was difficult to get working Won der weggaat restaurant would be without the popup LeBun Less eclectic than Zetter Townhouse , Cli nt service Great view over the square 
256408,The Zetter Hotel, Nothing , We stayed at The Zetter for our wedding weekend and were met with such warmth from the staff The team even welcomed us with a bottle of champagne Decor is quirky and fun and our room was lovely Bar was also a great place to enjoy a drink at the end of the day Walking distance to amazing Clerkenwell bars and restaurants 
256409,The Zetter Hotel,No Negative, I love this quirky hotel Very central quiet lovely rooms comfortable bed staff are uber friendly I usually stay in a different hotel every trip to London but i have now found my favourite place to stay Will definitely be my preferred accommodation in London 
256410,The Zetter Hotel,No Negative, Outstanding Has restored my faith in London Hotels and The Zetter is top of the list The staff were absolutely perfect and the room was superb Keep it a secret though so availability remains for my next visit

256415,The Zetter Hotel, Bed was tiny but then again the room was small but it s a London town centre hotel so I get it just seemed a bit pricey for the size , Staff were exceptional Location was ideal It s very cool The bar area was nice 
256416,The Zetter Hotel, Wish our room had a bath and that the extra towel requested upon checkin was replaced each night , Fantastic staff were helpful friendly and knowledgable The proximity of the hotel to the Tube Overground is very convenient The room service was also a highlight 
256417,The Zetter Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic decor food was great and healthy Very comfortable room with shag carpet and great value for money in a great part of town Highly recommended 
256418,The Zetter Hotel, The staff let the Zetter down Their first contact with you is not great my girlfriend arrived after me and the staff were quite unhelpful in getting her to the room The service in the restaurant was slow , The room was very good nice view and a very comfortable bed
