476776,Four Seasons Hotel Milano, As soon as I arrived my room I saw a welcome letter My title on the welcome letter was written to me by the manager was MR But I am a woman My title was already given during reservation as MISS It was annoying for me There was second envelope on the table in my room that was kind of invitation letter by spa It was sent to another client another name was written on I it was a bit ackward I haven t received the invoice after I checked out I am still waiting for it The night before I checked out the concierge confirmed that I will have a mercedes with a driver like at 200 cost to take me to Malpensa airport The morning that I was flying the concierge called my room saying I am sorry the car is not available what about Mercedes S class cost like 300 I said no thank you I asked for a taxi They arranged a Mercedes taxi The driver asked me to pay 110 at the airport I said to him I know you can charge only 90 He said his car is a Mercedes Vito taxi and price is 110 We ended up 100 It was also a bit strange It is not interesting to see a metal roof down when you open the windows in your room That s all Thank you , Location is excellent The hotel is located in the heart of Milan 
476777,Four Seasons Hotel Milano, I can t think of a negative thing to say about this lovely well situated hotel , It s wonderful The staff is professional and friendly the rooms lovely and quiet the food is terrific I was traveling alone which can be hard if the hotel is not a comfort zone such as this I would stay here again in a heartbeat 
476778,Four Seasons Hotel Milano,No Negative, The location is great walking distance to Duomo Staff are so professional and friendly we were upgraded to executive suite which was huge everything was beyond great 
476779,Four Seasons Hotel Milano, Inside the lobby is ok it s nice but not as nice as other hotels the gardens or little courtyard is amazing but in Milan unless it s summer weather doesn t really allow for outdoor sitting Also a cup of tea is 19eur soooo unless you have free breakfast don t plan on eating there Also scoop of gelato is 20eur Just way overpriced I feel like I would have perfected a cooler interior hotel while I enjoyed my 20eur gelato and 19eur tea , Four seasons is amazing as always great staff location and service
476780,Four Seasons Hotel Milano, Although it is an excellent hotel you do pay a premium for the Four Seasons brand , The staff and location is unrivaled in Milan in my opinion 
476781,Four Seasons Hotel Milano, The main staff at restuarent at breakfast were not friendly and almost rude and unplesant But some other staff members were nice , Main bed was very comfy Spare bed was less comfy The property was lovely especially the middle garden The toilet amenities were lovely
476782,Four Seasons Hotel Milano, The lobby is so ugly uninspiring and hodgepodge of ideas , Love the garden the fruit basket with colorful fruits Concierge Gabriel got 4 wonderful seats at la Scala for Swan lake easily Exceptional concierge Garden is divine
476783,Four Seasons Hotel Milano, There was a mosquito situation in the garden and rooms The mosquito kept us awake the first night Housekeeping try to spray our room for the second night But I still got 2 mosquito bits the second night while my husband has a couple mosquito bits the third night We were disappointed at the lobby restaurant The service was poor and with attitude When I informed the waiter that both the shrimp and pasta were under cook and I would like my shrimp and pasta to be well cooked The waiter said that these are home made pasta which should be serve hard in the middle This is not the Four Seasons standard , The location is very good for shopping 
476784,Four Seasons Hotel Milano,No Negative, All round excellent perfect location everyone was extremely polite food breakfast was excellent the room was really good and all of our stay went smoothly They treat you extremely well it really must be the best hotel in Milan

476786,Four Seasons Hotel Milano, Dear sirs I several times staid in your hotel Also it was always happy with professionalism of staff of hotel The last time I stopped on February 7th this year Also I faced a number of problems First incompetence of employees of a parking led to problems in electronics of absolutely new car It despite that giving car keys I paid attention of your employee to existence of a car key and the electronic chip You can check it on cameras of external supervision Secondly your employees at a parking in garage scratched a front bumper of the car on the right side I got into the car at the left and not at once noticed it Check records of cameras of external supervision and look as it occurred Thus the part of my holiday was spoiled I wait for your explanations Yours faithfully Oleg Stadukhin,No Positive
