338919,Hotel Park Villa, Nothing, Beautiful hotel with a georgeus garden They upgraded us to larger room with a garden view Room 2 Breakfast was very nice with good selection The tables were set with linens and fresh roses 15 minutes by bus to city center Bus stop right across the street Would definitely recommend this hotel Personnel very helpful 
338920,Hotel Park Villa, Bathroom too small with moderate humid smell The nearest metro station it was on the worst metro line U6 Difficult to park your car due to district rules , Quiet neighborhood 20 minutes from city center Excellent staff and really helpful Great garden view to enjoy a decent breakfast Beautiful park nearby 
338921,Hotel Park Villa, AC wasn t working The room was loud though I asked for quiet one Employees could be more friendly , Breakfast was ok but I would like to try more home made products 
338922,Hotel Park Villa, With temperatures of 30 degrees it was quite hot and moist in the hotel room However there was some air conditioning around but we didn t turn it on , Breakfast was really good really tasty and the weather allowed it to enjoy it outside in the beautiful garden Also the building and neighborhood are really pretty It s easy to get to the metro station only a 5 minute walk which makes it easy to get into the city center fast A recommendation if you like to sleep and wake up in a quiet area before going on a long day trip into the city center 
338923,Hotel Park Villa, Can t think of a thing , The Park Villa is located in a lovely quiet area We enjoyed the overall atmosphere the garden setting for breakfast was extremely inviting and the entire staff was ever so helpful in helping us enjoy our visit to Vienna 
338924,Hotel Park Villa, Terrasse Umbrellas and chair coatings could be renewed Whole inventory of the hotel is quite old, Stuff is very friendly Stuff at the breakfast could be more attentive
338925,Hotel Park Villa, Stayed 5 nights Towels changed bed made but room never dusted or vacuumed and glasses never changed Ant problem in the bathroom , Peaceful location in residential area Good bus transport to town 15 mins to centre Breakfast good Lovely garden at back of hotel 
338926,Hotel Park Villa, No tea and coffee making facilities in room we were told this not happen in Vienna hotels but of course it would in the larger hotels This would make hotel even better , The location is just beautiful many embassies in locale and very green a number of parks nearby Easy to get into city by bus opposite Breakfasts just wonderful in a traditional Austrian room overlooking superb garden 
338927,Hotel Park Villa, It would have been good to know how to open the window as room was hot discovered how to do this later Elevator was very small but adequate for the facilities , The breakfast overlooked a beautiful garden setting 
338928,Hotel Park Villa, The bus service was so so and a bit of a ride to get to the Ringstrasse You had to transfer to a subway tram or another bus to get into the center of Vienna that most Vienna visitors want to visit , The staff were wonderful very friendly and helpful The property was lovely and comfortable with a beautiful garden backyard suitable for dining in The residential neighborhood was lovely and safe Public bus transportation to Vienna was close by We liked the quiet nearby location and would use the Hotel Park Villa if we visited Vienna again 
338929,Hotel Park Villa, No parking available for guests at the hotel Parking is free of charge in the entire 19 district but may be very difficult to find as the streets around the hotel are tightly packed with cars Also it would be useful to have an electric kettle in the room , A beautiful Art Nouveau building located in the calm and green neighbourhood full of posh villas and embassies Across the street a stop for 40A bus going directly to the city centre Boerse Directly across the park lies the metro station 
338930,Hotel Park Villa, The parking is far and expensive 16Euro It was an awfull windy and snowy day the coldest april in more than 20 years and I had to walk a few streets from the parking lot to a hotel that appears in the search for hotels with free parking , nice and helpful staff 
338931,Hotel Park Villa,No Negative, Breakfast was very good Bread was very delicious The room was clean and comfortable The staff were kind and friendly Although it is not in the center of the city the location was OK because the hotel was within 10 minutes walk to the nearest metro station Try Fischerbrau a traditional and a lively Austrian restaurant which is again in 10 minutes walk distance from the hotel 
338932,Hotel Park Villa,No Negative, Lovely quiet location with very helpful staff There is a bus stop a 2 minute walk from the hotel which takes you to the centre of Vienna The breakfast was varied and the large bedroom lovely and warm in a rather chilly snowy December Would not hesitate to stay here again 
338933,Hotel Park Villa, The breakfast was not as good as expected The essentials were there but for example the fruit salad didn t seem to be fresh nor was some of the cakes , Lovely hotel in a peaceful suburb of Vienna The bus from the centre stops not far from the front door In fact the whole public transport system in Vienna is amazing It was jokingly said to us that people who live in Vienna don t like walking more than 200 metres Bedroom was very nice overlooking the garden The reception was a little dated and needs a little bit of an upgrade 
338934,Hotel Park Villa, the small extra mirror in the bathroom is mounted too high , beds and pillows are extremely comfortable we had a wonderful sleep breakfast is delicious and rich in viarity beautiful location and not far from subway 
338935,Hotel Park Villa, A few things do not work need a touch of paint so it needs manager walking into each room and spending there 15 30 minutes once a week and checking all little details to make it perfect , Breakfast very good and served the way to feel upper class for a while while sitting by the terrace too cold to be outside and drinking coffee served in little porcelain jug and then on Friday smoked salmon swam over tot he breakfast nice addition
