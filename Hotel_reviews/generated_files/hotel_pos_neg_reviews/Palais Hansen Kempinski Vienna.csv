446395,Palais Hansen Kempinski Vienna, This is a gripe that applies to all continental hotels I know regardless of luxury how can you get fresh milk for your in room coffee machine With an in room fridge is it to much to ask for fresh milk in there , Flawless five star service and facilities with a special mention for the sumptuous breakfast buffet everything imaginable on offer with eggs cooked however you like by the chef as you watch and breakfast is enjoyed in a modern beautiful dining room with natural light and two vertical garden walls Sunday Brunch is available up to 2 PM Adjoining the lobby is an extraordinary thing a large quiet library where smoking is allowed and the discreet air purification is so efficient that as a non smoker I did not feel I was in a smoking area just a quiet library The concierges all members of Les Clefs d Or helped direct us to what s good in Vienna away from what s not so good made bookings and enhanced our stay Our bedroom was a Deluxe Double and was superb with a super king comfy bed and the softest of pillows The marble floored bathroom with electronic controls for the walk in shower and bath was outstanding too We never used the enormous flat screen TV but it looked the business and the in room iPad for the hotel directory and ordering room service was a wow factor but perhaps being such a new technology needed a little work This is a hotel that we would love to return to the staff were impeccably efficient at the little details the evening turn down service keeping the mini bar and Nespresso machine supplied giving us a late 3PM check out when we asked

446402,Palais Hansen Kempinski Vienna, the location, the hotel is still new the hallways are spacious the staff are very quick to do everything you ask the porters are the fastest I ve seen in any hotel the junior suite was spacious and really comfortable but the only issue was that it had ants all over that got into my baby s stuff but when they were informed and when we asked to extend for a day last minute we were given a much bigger suite which made up for the packing and unpacking that we had to do and for the ant issue as well the room service was really good as well everything was really good I loved this hotel 
446403,Palais Hansen Kempinski Vienna, The service was very unsatisfactory We had to go to bed one night without dinner because the room service simply forgot our order Also when we ordered an iron with housekeeping it was forgotten and we had to call twice to remind them , Nice big breakfast beautiful room and good gym facilities

446409,Palais Hansen Kempinski Vienna, This time the room was not really well cleaned dust on the glass rack dirty glasses were not exchanged the room was not cleaned in time the washcloths were missing all the time Strange The iPad did not work I had dinner in the K che and the service was a bit poor I came back for another dinner and this time the service was excellent I complained upon my check out and I got a small discount on my bill thanks for that , I really like the hotel the environment and especially the spa Nice ladies there and marvelous treatments 
446410,Palais Hansen Kempinski Vienna, Swimming pool whirlpool too small for swimming relax zone is very noisy because of the whirlpool, Breakfast comfort service location lobby with live music and games 
446411,Palais Hansen Kempinski Vienna, The hostess of the breakfast was extremely rude in what respects the meal plan included in the reservation of the two rooms booked one had breakfast included and the other not but the main hotel conditions said both had Anyway rather than leaving us having a nice breakfast and sorting the issue after the staff kept disturbing everybody during the meal including announcing the cost of the breakfasts , Very comfortable rooms excellent concierge thanks for your suggestions tips and reservations and great breakfast
