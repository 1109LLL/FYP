135039,Novotel London Paddington, Nothing, Staff friendly and helpful Clean with good facilities and ideal quiet location Room perfect and really enjoyed tasty breakfast We really enjoyed our stay 
135040,Novotel London Paddington, Food could be a bit more polished but was good, Great option for a hotel near Heathrow airport as its next to the station where the Heathrow express stops at Good size room for London
135041,Novotel London Paddington, Nothing applicable , The staff hospitality and room preparation faultless Bed was very comfortable whilst Television was huge Excellent breakfast and hospitality throughout Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Novotel 
135042,Novotel London Paddington, Photos are deceptive If you are travelling with younger children and need interconnecting rooms you will have a twin room and a double room on the 1st or 2nd floor They were dark small and Super impractical One of the rooms will automatically have a wheelchair friendly bathroom which is not practical as water goes everywhere and shower in twin room is small Nonetheless you can get an upgrade and staff were very helpful But unfortunately would not go back , Breakfast was nice and healthy and children ate for free Nice clean breakfast 
135043,Novotel London Paddington, We was told we would have a larger room for ease of access with a adapted pushchair for a disabled child the room was incredibly tight and couldn t turn , Friendly staff lovely location The cot provided had a mattress topper and was very comfortable for the baby Something I ve never seen provided in other hotels m
135044,Novotel London Paddington, Very odd design of rooms In this Novotel have stayed in a few you have a small separate toilet just behind the door no wash hand basin In addition energy saving bulbs take 2 minutes to warm up so don t expect to see anything initially The actual bathroom is accessed from the main room just beside the bed around the corner as you enter in a superior twin Very small bathroom shower I m not a big chap and to more easily access toiletries I had to place them in the bath Also there really is insufficient storage space for your clothes i e drawers We lived out of our respective suitcases during the stay of 3 nights, Modern hotel within very easy reach of Paddington Station once you have sussed the route Bright airy breakfast lounge but the bar area is rather too clinical However very close to a lot of bars and restaurants where you would chose to go Breakfast is the usual fare Cannot fault the staff who are all very helpful 
135045,Novotel London Paddington, a better selection of fruit for breakfast More shower gel in rooms as one does not go far for two people, a good position for Paddington Station and district 
135046,Novotel London Paddington,No Negative, Lovely location very close to Paddington but quiet and safe bars and restaurants very close by lovely outdoor pub next door close to Little Venice nice room and facilities 
135047,Novotel London Paddington, The absolute ignorance of the pool by the staff The appalling and irresponsible behaviour of some guests and their children breaking all the rules what could lead to a trauma and severe hurt is absolutely not controlled by the staff No one NEVER stopped it There is NO STAFF near the pool Some people jumping and taking all the SMALL pool for themselves simply do not let other guests of the hotel to swim quietly Tired customers have to argue with impolite people instead of relax after a hard business day The presence of staff fulfilling their duties correctly could help resolving this problem The hotel also could control and aloud the parents with kids under 14 be in the pool only before at least 8 p m I am generous there is some hotels with severe restrictions like 2 p m to let the others relax after this time and it will be fair because lots of parents absolutely do not control their children s noisy and dangerous behaviour and even show the bad example themselves Another thing my husband was absolutely furious leaving the shower he discovered a mum of 2 teenagers inside MENS changing room The manager who saw it it was minutes before closing did tell NOTHING Yes we got that the pool is without surveillance and everything is our personal risk but I do not think the customers are ok with that Is the pool a part of the hotel It works like not but it is surely included in the customers bill Make it for additional price but control it or do something because the ignorance like this could not lead to anything right This is absolutely shameful for the overpriced hotel do not respect the customers I really think to find another hotel to stay next time and stop being a returning and loyal client , This time nothing except the location 
135048,Novotel London Paddington,No Negative, The Hotel was one of the few in London that did not add 1000 to the cost of a room when thousands of BA passengers were stranded at Heathrow on 27th May They went out of their way to accommodate the two of us and a very nervous young woman from Cambodia who did not have a credit card and could not book a room online Award a Gold Star to Novotel 
135049,Novotel London Paddington, If you open the window you can here the train and road traffic noise which is normal for London but you can here the noise from the open air bar below The swimming pool was freezing and the shower in ladies didn t work , Easy walk from Paddington station and to the tube and great breakfast
135050,Novotel London Paddington, We have stayed many times at this hotel On this occasion we were put in a room that needed matainance This even flashed up on the computer but was still given to us Door handle broken and the air condition did not work in hot May Told our room would have a view when we got in to have a view of the next door office block looking into workers office This is classed as excecutive room Staff in restaurant not friendly or welcoming A change in atmosphere from previous stays but overall disappointed this time with the hotel , location
135051,Novotel London Paddington, There were no plug sockets near the bed, The size of the room was great for 2 adults and a 2 year old There was still lots of room for her to play with toys on the floor and space to store the pushchair
135052,Novotel London Paddington, The key to my room had stopped functioning on the last two days wouldn t open with master key too for which the staff changed the lock Despite this we faced same issues on the next day Had to wait outside the room with children for long as the door wouldn t open They could have offered to shift us in another room Because of this issue no room cleaning no house keeping was done for those two days until we informed them that the door doesn t open Our room was on the 9th floor It was a task for us after returning tired from our long full day trip ,No Positive
135053,Novotel London Paddington, the reception staff were nice but the cleaning staff were disrespectful and talk to you like they are paying for the room not you they dont want to work or clean and if you tell them I need something changed or cleaned they are rude also they say they have free wifi this is a lie the wifi is free sure but it keeps on disconnecting every 5 min and it is very slow like a snail so I ended up using my phones internet date,No Positive
135054,Novotel London Paddington, The location you have to park the car off site and hotel is amongst other similar buildings which restrict car access Rooms are average to be fair very basic Toilets and bathroom separate and again VERY basic need an update to be honest Definitely not worth the nightly room rate , The reception area is modern and up to date otherwise an average hotel 
135055,Novotel London Paddington, In a room of three and my bed had a blanket and sheet no duvet Cheap mattress Small room and dated Also one pillow and red cushion on bed as opposed to two,No Positive
135056,Novotel London Paddington, There was nothing I didn t like , The staff were very helpful and friendly The facilities and the location could not have been better The food was very good and checkin out were excellent 
135057,Novotel London Paddington, I had a problem with swipe card for the room I had to contact reception 4 times in my 3 nights booked because the swipe cards weren t working and that was a headache Otherwise nothing bad , Staff are nice Location nearby picadilly station and supermarket restaurants and coffee shops Swimming pool is clean and warm
135058,Novotel London Paddington, Room was stifling at night west facing and unable to turn thermostat down or fan up Quilt didn t come with separate sheet so at night you either had no bed covers to cool off or the quilt which made you overheat , Great location very good all round
135059,Novotel London Paddington, Room temperature control Lack of storage space in the room , Efficient and pleasant staff at reception Good breakfast included Nice location We ll thought out and convenient room facilities 
135060,Novotel London Paddington, Bed uncomfortable too hard Breakfast buffet area far too small for size of hotel Ran out of bowls first morning 25 00 For a burger and extra portion of chips , Great Location Clean 
135061,Novotel London Paddington, For some reason i left the please clean my room sign at the door and they never cleaned or gave me clean towels , The location Is very convenient just outside paddington station the bed was very comfortable and very quiet room The staff was very nice and the food the restaurant provides it s good and affordable There are plenty of cafes restaurants and stores outside de hotel also 
135062,Novotel London Paddington, Breakfast service was a little disorganised Despite significant advertising of cocktails available in bar on the two nights we were there none available as they had been very busy and sold out during day for 2 days running unexpectedly , Proximity to Paddington station and several very nice restaurants in close walking distance Lovely comfortable clean quiet bedroom well furnished and good TV Very pleasant and efficient reception staff Very good quality breakfast 
135063,Novotel London Paddington, The rooms have last seen any renewal action probably around 2003 2005 The carpet seemed slightly dirty and look quite old fashioned The shower pan had strong signs of aging plastic uneven and dirty looking off white same for the bathroom sink The huge TV was great the bad was not good but not bad either and the pillows were not that good they did smell great though The off white sheets and linen made me a bit suspicious of it not being clean enough though I got to the hotel early and asked if an early check in was possible They offered me an accessible room which I wouldn t have any problems with but the bathroom was smelling pretty bad Once I contacted the reception about it though they offered me a new room very quickly and the room change was very smooth , Although I ve given a bad rating for the location on this review the hotel is quite removed from central London it s still very easy to access from the Paddington tube train station The environment around it is great too with many bars and restaurants and even a supermarket nearby in a super neat businessy surrounding The staff took care of my issues fast enough and had a friendly smile at all times Breakfast was pretty good first time I ve ever seen fried rice served on a breakfast buffet 
135064,Novotel London Paddington, What s not to like , Good strong coffee Lots of choice for breakfast that covered even the most fussy eater Dining room was very clean and staff attentive We were shown to our tables Staff were in no hurry to push us through and clear tables in a hurry and we were asked if there was anything else that could help with I also noticed the nice way they helped with the more elderly people who were on the table next to us and went so far as to get the hot drinks for them which was a nice touch The bedrooms were very clean and so quiet as to make us think there was no one else staying there and the reception staff spoke very good English 
135065,Novotel London Paddington, Petty moan the water wasn t free we have stayed in other hotels where you don t have to pay for it, Position was perfect and staff very friendly Being in business district it was away from the crowds but easy to get to and close links to tourist areas Also shop and restaurants very close by Just what we wanted 
135066,Novotel London Paddington, Bathroom layout was difficult to use not much room once out of rhe shower Sometimes a shower over the bath rather than a separate one frees up ore space to get ready The door on the seperate toilet cupboard also didn t close very well so not much privacy , Comfortable room and very comfy bed Also loved the coffee machine and we had breakfast in the room which I thought for an extra 3 was very reasonable 
135067,Novotel London Paddington, The decor could use a referrer but to be honest it s a minor consideration in respect to a good night s sleep , Very convenient for Paddington yet quiet and comfortable Breakfast buffet generous and service efficient 
135068,Novotel London Paddington, The chairs by the pool were wet , The pool was perfect the music in the pool area was relaxing Me and my son absolutely loved it Was luxurious and comfortable 
135069,Novotel London Paddington, We didn t have any hot water in the morning other then that everything was brilliant , The room was amazing with an amazing view It s tucked always from the crazy life of London but only 10 min walk from the middle of Paddington 
135070,Novotel London Paddington, This is our second stay but found the bed uncomfortable and the room not as clean as the last time for example the bin rusty with no bag in it , Staff very helpful and friendly
135071,Novotel London Paddington, Breakfast on Sunday wasn t very good we got down there near the end of service and food was poor and waiting staff unhelpful, upgraded room as we were in a wedding party lovely reception staff
135072,Novotel London Paddington, The breakfast could have been a little better I would prefer small pots of jam spreads for toast instead of one big jar that everyone uses Also the milk was a little warm for the cereal , Everything about the rooms were great Beds super comfy and much bigger than anticipated Toilet and bathroom separate which was great Huge bath 
135073,Novotel London Paddington, Separate WC and Bath Combined is certainly more desirable , The staff especially Ms Monica She was the one who gave us extraordinary front desk services outstanding guidance for touring London during our last stay in November 2016 Indeed Monica was the determining factor for our second stay now despite the availability of other comparable Hotels with better pricing 
135074,Novotel London Paddington, The kettle in our room over boiled causing a power cut but it was sorted swiftly , Staff were very helpful We had a nice meal in the bar and the Breakfasts kept us going all day 
135075,Novotel London Paddington, Would have liked to have been able to open window in room for a little fresh air Maybe it did open but I did t work it out , Comfortable beds Really helpful friendly staff especially Thomas at reception he really went the extra mile to assist Breakfast was very good 
135076,Novotel London Paddington, We had consistent difficulty with the water temperature in the bathroom and on the second day of our stay we received a very obviously dirty towel when they were changed, Breakfast is excellent and well worth including in the room rate Staff were consistently friendly and helpful
135077,Novotel London Paddington, We stayed previously and like it But room stuffy and hot aircon not effective Window opened but usual problem noise In contrast pool too cool , Breakfast fresh
135078,Novotel London Paddington, Although showing as next to Paddington station it is really quite an awkward walk with luggage especially in cold weather Rather far out for accessing the main shopping areas of London View of the railway lines and Westway , Pleasant new hotel in keeping with the usual Novotel standards Good beds 
135079,Novotel London Paddington, Breakfast was average at best like most hotels in the UK there are plenty of places nearby that are probably a better alternative , Great location Modern clean hotel with a comfortable bed We had a very good and peaceful night s sleep Very friendly and accommodating staff on check in Decent enough gym and pool although a little small 
135080,Novotel London Paddington,No Negative, Super location very close to Paddington station and Heathrow Express Quiet on the weekends because it is mostly a business area Room very quiet bed very comfortable Bathroom is quite petite but all in all it is excellent value for money 
135081,Novotel London Paddington, Room was cold aircon not working and small bed uncomfortable pool was cold loud awful music playing in restaurant foyer and mezzanine area, Friendly helpful staff
135082,Novotel London Paddington, A bit of a treck if your walking from station, Staff were great And for a London hotel the price was brilliant Very stylish and the cocktails were yummy 
135083,Novotel London Paddington, Heating in room the thermostat didn t seem to work so the room was a little too hot and the windows didn t open but that was a minor detail , Hotel is in walking distance of Paddington station 5 minutes through a well lit built up area of bars restaurants and there s even a Sainsbury s local nearby Reception staff were friendly and helpful even offering to send someone to our room at 10 pm to show us how to get the x box working through the t v for my niece and nephew We declined as it was so late but that was a nice touch Breakfast was amazing lots of choice and my nephew was thrilled with the pancake machine going back for seconds and probably more if we d let him We all agreed we would definitely go back again to this hotel without a doubt
135084,Novotel London Paddington, there was classes with kids in the pool while I was using it and I was ask to use just half side of the pool nobody put more toilet paper during my stay, comfortable room nice breakfast friendly staff amazing localization
135085,Novotel London Paddington,No Negative, Great experience overall staying at Novotel London paddington Stayed there for 8 nights Staff was very friendly rooms were clean and fresh Had a parcel waiting for me a week before my arrival safely in my hands when I check in Would definitely stay here again 
135086,Novotel London Paddington, They don t have staff at conceirage to carry your luggeges you have to carry your luggage by yourself to your room which is consider ubnormal for 4 star hotel and Novotel chain , Friends are friendly and helpfull
135087,Novotel London Paddington, Didn t like the bathroom and toilet were separated also didn t like the location too far, The pool facility was fantastic staff were friendly
135088,Novotel London Paddington, The shower in the room is half covered where the floor will be full of water after any bath No personal shower within the toilet , The staff was very friendly they accepted early check in and late check out Was very pleasant of them
135089,Novotel London Paddington, Unable to check in early Toilet and shower are not connected Late check out could be later than 1pm Carpet in room is quite dirty, Friendly staff good location new facilities
135090,Novotel London Paddington, Water 2 50 in the room fridge a rip off No sign of price we thought complimentary , Clean and well organised Taxis called when we asked and no queues
135091,Novotel London Paddington, Surcharge for two person occupancy have stayed in hotels all around the world and have never been charged for two people in one double room this alone will stop us from using this group of hotels again, Location breakfast cleanliness
135092,Novotel London Paddington, Breakfast was chaotic very little service Staff nice but felt they were under pressure as not enough staff for Umber of guestd, Location and clean roons
135093,Novotel London Paddington, Bed was too hard, Nice food friendly staff very hot so unable to sleep but better than being cold overall a lovely stay and would definitely go back again
135094,Novotel London Paddington, Can t think of anything Thanks , Great friendly staff and fantastic breakfast spread Central access to trains and central London We were upgraded 
135095,Novotel London Paddington, 10 min wait at check in as only one receptionist working at 3pm Hard bed impossible to open window in room tiny pool Room decor feels like student halls , Handy location if travelling from Paddington staff were all friendly and helpful Good view Breakfast good value 
135096,Novotel London Paddington, Firstly it s a little tricky to get to we ended up going into Paddington station down to the last platform and take the escalator to the next level Then go past the taxi rank straight ahead and you will see some steps on your right leading to Kingdom street The pool was lovely and warm for 2 days unfortunately on our last morning it was freezing The people working in the bar and at breakfast are anything but friendly or helpful also in the morning it s very annoying when you are trying to eat and the plate is snapped from under you when you are not finished , Overall great hotel breakfast was excellent they had absolutely everything Rooms nice and clean they even left a little cake for my son s 18 The girls on reception are very friendly and helpful 
135097,Novotel London Paddington, Rooms are not that clean that you would expect in Novotel Lot of construction work on going in the neighborhood Breakfast is British and perfectly ok if you like that one , Location rather good only few minutes walking distance from Paddington station Good service 
135098,Novotel London Paddington, That we had to walk such a distance with our luggage because an officious man would not let the taxi driver through to drive to the hotel through the barrier down by the canal even though this had not been a problem the day before when we had been dropped off at the hotel The guy was not an employer of the hotel but the hotel need to get this sorted out before he does their business a lot of damage I don t like this idea of not having a proper reception area and having to check myself in with a machine This is supposed to be a hospitality industry having to do everything yourself when you are travel tired and stressed is not conducive to the feeling of hospitality it gives the same impression of welcome as a cheap airline The staff were generally helpful but it was clear that they were trained in the happy smiley over the top enthusiastic American way that involves repeating exactly the same phrases to you as each other to you You are left with the feeling that they are more focussed on remembering the words than concerned with what you need However I suppose it is a way of making all your guests feel as though they are being dealt with efficiently even if they don t feel that there is a genuine interest in you This is a new hotel after all and they are probably just bedding in all new staff I would go back and stay again in a few months to see if things have settled down then as these might all be just teething problems , Smart and new When the surrounding area is finished it is going to be a lovely place to stay The are creating a small inner city woodland next to the hotel at the moment which looks as though it will greatly enhance the whole experience of staying there It is next Paddington Station but you wouldn t really know this when in the hotel The surrounding area through to the canal is being renovated to a high standard creating a pleasant surrounding area with shops waterside restaurants and an amphitheatre I can see this hotel being in being a really pleasant place to stay in the summer 
135099,Novotel London Paddington, Nothing at all , Great location minutes easy walk from Peddington station with connections to all sites The staff very helpful Breakfast with a huge healthy selection worth every penny The rooms were comfy and clean Well would definitely come again and recommend to friends and family 
135100,Novotel London Paddington, The location is was very bad and so many construction around the area and you can find the gate easier, about the breakfast Is not bad about the room it was very very small and the bathroom it s like very old
135101,Novotel London Paddington,No Negative, Stayed with family for a weekend sightseeing room was clean and comfortable breakfast was very nice if a little busy staff are excellent but always choose this hotel for its location and great access to underground 
135102,Novotel London Paddington, The beds were a bit hard and stiff but manageable , The breakfast was good provided healthy options and allergy alternatives The location was good for the tube 
135103,Novotel London Paddington, It wasn t a problem but there was some building work in the area However the hotel was very nice and quiet inside , Very comfortable well equipped room Very handy location for London and the Heathrow Express Near the river Good value for money for a London hotel All staff were polite helpful and friendly at all times 
135104,Novotel London Paddington, After arriving back one evening we attempted to pre book the discounted breakfast only to be told we couldn t as it was too late and would need to pay full amount Pre booking makes no difference to the amount of breakfast prepared in the kitchen so it was disappointing to be told we had missed the opportunity after returning just after midnight So we ate elsewhere And found a great place with a hot full English breakfast for half the cost anyway Something to consider , Room was clean and comfortable The bar was good and service reasonably fast 
135105,Novotel London Paddington, After a serious problem with the preparation quality freshness of every dish provided for room service meal ordered I was rudely told I should have phoned at each mouthful rather than waiting until the end Truth is I had phoned twice I requested a full refund which was agreed eventually On checking out I asked for the refund voucher to confirm it had gone through No one knew anything about it and I was told no one knew how to apply a refund to an account so they would do that and then send an email confirmation of refund and new final invoice that morning Two calls later I eventually got confirmation at 4 30pm Customer service and personal impact training desperately needed here , The hotel itself was amazing and loved its location 
135106,Novotel London Paddington, Dining was made a miserable experience by the high volume pop muzak that was inescapable throughout the dining and bar areas This ensured that this time we never dined at the hotel but it certainly compromised the breakfast experience I m not sure of the purpose of the music as it was loud enough an impediment to conversation even across a table Perhaps it is to entertain bored staff ,No Positive
135107,Novotel London Paddington, There was noisy renovation going on and the road was blocked I arrived at 10 pm and had to walk in the rain half a block with no assistance with 3 bags I had no idea of this inconvenience room comfortable but stuffy had to ask for a fan and keep the windows open as they could not resolve the room temperature though it was 10 degrees outside but 26 inside Staff ok not rude but not friendly Two in our party me included had a mistake in the bill added on a breakfast we did not eat Location in a business area so not much choice to eat lunch on the weekend , breakfast decent basic english so ok
135108,Novotel London Paddington, There was nothing really stand out about it The bed was comfortable but not gorgeous and the pillows were all right but I d have liked some options I do like my down filled pillow The towels were also fine but not thick and soft Perhaps I am asking too much but a little bit of posh would make this a better choice in the future , Great to have a fridge as we were there for several days Variety of places to eat room service menu was fine the simple breakfast option in the bar was terrific and I ve enjoyed the buffet in the past Staff are lovely and welcoming the check in was efficient Terrific to have a separate bathroom and toilet Shower worked well Love the location as it is near the bus train restaurants and a lovely walk along the canal 
135109,Novotel London Paddington, Unfortunatly we came out the main entrance of Paddington and we were sent down a cobble lock street not suitable for a wheelchair if we had been better informed about exiting the station at a different exit the hotel was only 3 mins away, We traveled by train and its closeness to Paddington was excellent My son is a wheelchair user so accessable bathroom was great
135110,Novotel London Paddington, I couldn t find anything that I didn t like except for one thing which was the bathroom and that is totally a personal choice and not something that I expect others to find fault with The Bidet was in a separate space to the basins and the shower box That would not have been a problem except that inside the bidet space there was no way to wash your hands except leave that space and go into the other space which meant opening a door with unclean hands everything is in one room so that space was literally two steps away from the basin so like I said personal preference , I liked that it was near Paddington station and underground Also if you leave the hotel there is an area called Paddington central with Cafes restaurants an out doors sitting area and a Sainsbury The rooms were sound proof so I couldn t hear anything going on outside or the rooms next to me 
135111,Novotel London Paddington, The outside of hotel is a building site the noise and trying to get into the hotel is awful and trying to find where exactly the hotel is is really hard it is hidden out the way this is a little of putting and a shame as hotel is lovely, The hotel was overall lovely comfortable beds clean room and spacious great sauna pool was great value
135112,Novotel London Paddington,No Negative, Great value price as there was some work going on outside related to CrossRail which restricted access to the entrance but only marginally Good location easy access to Tube the redevelopment work around Paddington has been brilliant Good restaurants and other facilities nearby including Little Venice and the canals Hotel was roomy comfy with friendly and helpful staff 
135113,Novotel London Paddington, It would have been nice if there was a floor mat in the toilet cubicle Looking forward to new surroundings outside once construction is over , Lovely Staff specially Daniel Comfortable bed never missed my home bed and love the room ambience 
135114,Novotel London Paddington, 1 Separated toilet from shower 2 shower area so dirty and have musty 3 no have hot water just bit warm 4 tap water smelly as it have similar to Sewerage smell 5 toilet are no have trash, bed good
135115,Novotel London Paddington, a lot of construction that blocked the way to the hotel hilly street leading to it not very close to the underground toilet set in a separate partition from the rest of the bathroom poor breakfast , helpful staff size of the room is reasonable
135116,Novotel London Paddington,No Negative, Staff arranged a birthday treat for my Mum cake and card we booked in April so was well planned remembered They even organised connecting rooms which we didn t know was available Hotel was fabulous Easy to get to 10 mins from Euston quiet from traffic and best beds ever Thank you so much everyone Especially Cedric Alves and Celine Will definitely be back and recommend to anyone 
135117,Novotel London Paddington, It is confusing the first time to find it from Paddington station , Very friendly staff Got free upgrade of room on arrival with welcome cakes in room a free drink in the bar and late checkout The location is perfect in a modern quiet housing estate with new high office buildings surrounding Hope to stay again 
135118,Novotel London Paddington, wifi is definitely stronger in the executive rooms than the other rooms our group had one executive room and another which wasn t , great location to catch the Heathrow Express and to get to anywhere in London It is a good location for business travelers or people in transit like us Staff is friendly and helpful rooms are clean and functional Bed is comfy rooms are quiet even if it is so close to Paddington station Much appreciated 
135119,Novotel London Paddington, The price generally of London hotels , Very clean Efficient staff Good breakfast and comfortable well equipped rooms Very convenient for Paddington Station
135120,Novotel London Paddington, washroom door not so good When close the door also clear to see inside what happen and the door after close still have space can clear to see inside And toilet in another room is so close and didn t ventilation, bed is ok clear and well
135121,Novotel London Paddington, Breakfast over priced Building works in area hope it s finished when we return next year , Room very clean Beds very comfortable Bar service good
135122,Novotel London Paddington, Poor service and poor management of restaurant Insufficient staff Delays being shown to table Slow clearing dirty dishes from table Great difficulty contacting hotel lost property dept after checking out Chaotic Accor telephone system , Reception staff friendly and helpful 
135123,Novotel London Paddington, On the first night I got a room fitted for invalids without an oppe shower so after you take shower all the bathroom is flooded The toilets were in same room as the shower Because of the equipment for invalids there was not much place to take shower The room was changed on my rewuest on the next day ,No Positive
135124,Novotel London Paddington, Pool sauna and steam room were very small Changing facilities with only two showers cubicles but we just went to our rooms with the towels Wanted to order food for room before the closing time of the kitchen but Bar manager surprised me with excuse that kitchen was already closed and everything would be switched off automatically at 11pm Odd Advertised as having a carpark but had to leave our car in a warehouse carpark a few roads away , Across the road to Paddington station Breakfast was very good Extra towels at swimming pool Nice sauna and steam room Nice rooms with big TV especially loved the shower in the bathroom Helpful and friendly staff 
135125,Novotel London Paddington, There was a separate toilet which was a brilliant idea but no wash basin to wash your hands You had to use the bathroom afterwards which defeats the purpose of the separate toilet , Use of the swimming pool The staff were very helpful You could store your luggage to allow you to explore There is extra glazing on the windows so there is no noise from outside 
135126,Novotel London Paddington, Breakfast lay out off food was not good every one on top off each other and not replenish very quickly or plates coffee and teas brought to you very quickly but slow brining the milk , Rooms and location reception staff were very helpful 
135127,Novotel London Paddington, The bathroom was very small the smell of the kitchen is everywhere in the hotel the swimming pool is too small and shallow , The quietness the staff the location
135128,Novotel London Paddington, It would be really useful to have clear instructions as to which exit to take out of Paddington Station , So convenient for Heathrow Express Staff excellent Customer service at breakfast outstanding 
135129,Novotel London Paddington, The bed was very uncountable and there was three of us in the room and there was only enough tea bags and milk for two of us But location you could not fault and a quite hotel Would deffo return if we where ever to visit London again , The location was fab
135130,Novotel London Paddington, Room could have been a bit cleaner hairs on the sheets and one of my pillows was from the sofa which I am sure wasn t fresh and clean , Hotel was in a good location close to Paddington Good facilities fair sized rooms
135131,Novotel London Paddington, The hotel is looking a little tired The air conditioning was not up to the temperatures that we had in July The breakfast service and food is functional and feels rushed and institutional , The location is central and easy to access Heathrow and the underground The reception staff were generally helpful and pleasant 
135132,Novotel London Paddington, 100 stolen from my pouch kept in my hand trolley in the room by some of room cleaning staff It indicates that room cleaning staff opens the luggage left in room in search of valuables It occurred first time in my 40 years travel history , Every thing was excellent
135133,Novotel London Paddington, Very bizarre layout of rooms where the toilet is seperate to the rest of the bathroom in essentially an unventilated cupboard The bathroom door is not solid do not great if you want privacy Bar staff weren t great Reception staff forgot to include breakfast on our room but easy to resolve on checkout , Great location near Paddington station Very clean and good selection for the breakfast 
135134,Novotel London Paddington, Nothing in particular , The location it s perfect 5 min wok to Hide Park Near by Paddington Station but in a very cosi location surrounded by new buildings Starbucks Zizzi and Sainsbury s
