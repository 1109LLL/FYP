300960,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Unfortunately there were a few things that need improvements 1 Upon arriving the receptionists could not locate our invitation although we presented our booking confirmation 2 Maybe that s why the room included only 2 towels when we just arrived and no floor mat for the bathroom 3 The bed was really really uncomfortable and both of us suffered back pains 4 No refrigerator in the room 5 No hair dryer and minimal toiletries soap bar and shampoo no conditioner body lotion and so on 6 Food is reasonable not enough vegetables and bad coffee 7 We selected the holiday Inn thinking we can add this stay to our holiday inn card unfortunately we found out that it cannot be added when ordering through booking com , 1 The staff was very polite and helpful Everything we asked for missing towels extra pillows help with the TV was answered very quickly 2 The location is very convenient not in the center but 2 minutes the Russell Sq station 3 There s a nice shopping center 2 minutes from the hotel with stores supermarket post office and restaurants

300963,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury,No Negative, We have stayed here earlier and the staff and services are excellent as is the morning breakfast The location is less than a 5 minute walk down fro the Russell Square tube station making it super easy to go for theatre shows and come back safely even if it is late It is next to Brunswick Square which has everything you could want including a gorgeous second hand bookshop and a sort of food fair every Saturday morning

300969,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, On a sweltering day it was good to find the room very cool but it was VERY cool and even following the guidance on the controls it did not seem possible to make any noticeable adjustment to temperature other than turning the air con off , I was warmly greeted at reception and despite being early I d have been happy to drop my bag with the concierge I was able to check in This was helpful and much appreciated Housekeeping staff on the third floor corridor greeted me with a cheery good morning the following morning and concierge staff were very helpful and efficient when I left my bag when checking out for later collection 
300970,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Conditioner There wasn t any Also shampoo was not very good I understand why they have hangers without hooks in the closets but it would have been nice if I could have transferred one to the bathroom each morning Instead I had to take my clothes off the hanger and place them on the counter while I showered Worse the night before our flight we went to arrange a cab to the airport The guy at the counter said they had a fixed rate and would arrange it The next morning it was not a cab but a car service It was not clean The car smelled like the driver had been smoking in it with the windows rolled up and the ashtray was never cleaned Also he didn t take credit cards and we didn t know this until we were at the airport We didn t have any cash because all the London cabs take credit cards , Concierges were excellent They got our tickets online gave us directions made reservations and were very knowledgeable Also check in was very good

300977,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Breakfast food is very satisfactory but the hotel should add some variation say special dish of the day You get tired if you eat the same breakfast in a one week stay Add excitement in the menu There should be a refrigerator , The location is excellent since it s near the underground and bus stations 
300978,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, We dined a few times in the hotel restaurant in the early evening The quality of the food was excellent However the wait staff in the evening was completely off They charged the wrong price didn t come to take our order until we got up and asked brought the wrong food never apologized and were generally resentful and disorganized This is in stark contrast to the staff at breakfast which is friendly and competent , This is the hotel you want to stay in when you go to London The rooms are perfectly set up quiet updated clean The location is perfect just a block from a tube station with shops just around the corner and close to the British Museum Breakfast is fabulous The Wifi is great The staff are professional friendly and responsive We were there during a heat wave and the air condition was fabulous Also kids under 13 eat free including breakfast

301117,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Since my last visit the quality of the food has deteriorated The bread was very poor as was the cheap butter and preserves Breakfast was poor really very little choice and nasty pastries from a cheap supermarket it seemed With Waitrose just round the corner a better quality of cereals fruit yogurts and bread and pastries should have been available We also had dinner and although edible again it was not as good and we were not given our hot main courses at the same time Not professional at all It was disappointing ,No Positive
301118,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, We found the front counter staff to be very neutral not friendly bit like drones The concierge guys were great however Rooms were very basic no fridge for milk etc Overall even for London bad value There are similar hotels with breakfast for less better Hotels in the area for the same price The so called free wifi has many restrictions watch out You pay for decent speed you pay for multiple devices even if you switch off one etc , Not much really very basic hotel even by London standards not up to the standard of other Holiday Inns I have stayed in around the world

301131,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, I think the cost against the standard was ridiculous Terribly expensive for a pretty standard room , The location was very close to Euston and where we wanted to visit Covent Garden and Leicester Square
301132,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, The hotel was overpriced for what it was I remember staying many times at this hotel on business in the 1990s The room I had for this stay was much smaller than the ones I remembered and a member of staff confirmed my suspicion that the hotel had created more rooms by subdividing existing rooms This did not make me happy Fortunately I was travelling alone had there been 2 of us in the room it would have been very cramped , Comfortable bed 
301133,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, I have booked a standard room in a 4 star chain hotel The room was extremely tiny and dark I asked to give normal room For what they provided very basic standard room saying it is an executive room for additional charge Then when afterall I moved from tiny room to very basic standard room i found that flush in the toilet does not work properly Bathroom was very dirty Extremely poor breakfast The personnel never smile which is depressing This is definitely not a 4 star hotel Value for money is below zero , NOTHING

301139,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury,No Negative, We paid 135 for bed breakfast for two people which is the price this review is based on That price for this location is exceptionally good given the levels of comfort and service on offer Nothing overly flash but does all the basics you want very well with spacious rooms and the usual Holiday Inn comfort and service

301143,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Details such as no conditioner and no spare toothbrush in bathrooms not good Also the coffee at the breakfast room is awful for the price I would recommend the hotel invest in coffee which does not taste and smell like rancid Nescaf , Location and bed comfort were commendable atmosphere is also very relaxed which is good of course 
301144,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Very poor internet service Only to devices can be connected at the time Most of the hotel has no phone signal reception either , Nice locations and very helpful staff Good breakfast service Very good place for conferenced and courses 
301145,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Facilities in the room were great the downside was that it was above the bar which is linked to the hotel There was some noise from this location but I must admit it was not excessive Breakfast although very nice was not hot enough for me but then perhaps it would be adequate for others , I enjoyed my stay there it was central near to the main station and tube Staff were very friendly and helpful I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others 
301146,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, The building is in need for overall maintenance The walls and the doors must be re plastered to a smooth finish Initially the fridge was not included in the room though I appreciate their supply of one following upon my request free of charge Other 4 star hotels offer the fridge in ALL rooms Lack of security box A security box is essential and I had it in all other 4 star hotels I visited There was no concierge for luggage loading when we checked in at 2 AM I had to pull the carriage and load it myself After check in someone showed and helped unload it in the room The security keys malfunctioned daily My wife and I had our keys re programmed daily for 10 days The receptionists would tell us that our pocket mobiles messes them up I carry a phablet 9 7 so it does not fit in any pocket In fact the card that would let us operate the elevator would malfunction at the door a minute later , Security system is very good Breakfast buffet is also great The receptionists were all very understanding cheerful and courteous The room was big and the bed was comfortable

301150,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury,No Negative, the hotel s convenient location to Kings Cross lots of buses to catch Hotel situated away from the main thoroughfare means it is quiet for London 
301151,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Poor internet service would only allow 2 devices to have complimentary wifi per room even when we were there as a couple Internet was also very slow And it is a pity they had taken out the mini fridge in the rooms because tourists staying there for 2 weeks would like to use a mini fridge for small food items purchased, Great location Hard working staff who kept the rooms very clean

301155,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, The free internet is really slow and since reception isn t good there is hardly any reason to pay for fast internet There are no electrical sockets near the beds In this day and age you return to your hotel room and immediately want to charge your dwindling phone battery while getting into bed Alas there are no sockets nearby only at the desk some 3 meters away , The location is good Not in the center of London but very close to a Piccadilly line station It takes just 15 minutes to get from your hotel room to Covent Garden at 7 00 PM in August The Brunswick shopping center is just across the road and provides every facility needed The rooms are spacious and comfortable Breakfast is excellent 
301156,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, The reception and whole feel of the place is clinical and rushed The reception staff surly abrupt and took a deposit in additon to the nightly rate which I was not informed of when booking The price also was not value for money My first time in a Holiday Inn not for me , The bed and room are extremely comfortable and quiet 
301157,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Having the 60 deposit a surprise on the day i don t remember seeing this in the booking confirmation, It was walking distance from everything we needed and comfy especially with the star bucks downstairs

301226,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, The WIFI connection was appalling I had intended to watch a movie in the room but it was so poor that I had to abandon that idea Also I found the room very basic with the tiniest of bathrooms so I did not feel that I got good value for money I felt that I could have got the same quality by staying at a Travel Lodge however I had slightly higher expectations from a Holiday Inn , Great location Very clean 
301227,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, When I checked in the staff said he can not find my booking even required my ID and booking reference He needed to call back to booking com and finally he said my booking name is massive It is not my first time to use booking com but the first time I had been told there was no such booking for me At the end he even typed wrong on my name but still wants me to sign on the agreement unbelievably ,No Positive

301273,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, It was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in and as such the stay was really overpriced The bathroom was also very small but clean and adequate If you stayed more than a couple of nights there would be no where to put your things The bed was right next to the window and considering there was double glazing the windows might as well have been open for all the noise and the cold draught coming through right onto me whilst trying to sleep Also the curtains bearly came to the bottom of the window so all the light and draught came in from underneath I need dark to sleep so all in all not a good night A shame as the bed was quite comfy The general facilities of the hotel maybe 4 but our room was bearly a 3 , The staff were very friendly and helpful The bed and bedding was comfortable The location was good as very near a tube but it s not in the nice bit of Bloomsbury The breakfast choice was not overly extensive but plentiful and tea and coffee was offered frequently by smiling staff Breakfast was also calm and not a horrible canteen like bustle which was a nice change to many hotels

301289,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Rooms were small We had requested a room with two beds but got a small room with a double bed instead which was too small for two adults and two children The hotel requested that we had to pay for an upgrade to an executive room although we had clearly indicated preference for a standard room with two beds when booking the room and that room would have been perfectly ok for us Unfortunately they did not have any such room available when we arrived at check in ,No Positive
301290,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, The bathroom was tiny and they didn t provide face cloths or shower caps , I arrived at 11 30pm and had to leave by 9am the next day but what I saw of the hotel in particular the way the staff interacted with customers I was very impressed 
301291,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Room was bland dull wouldn t be too nice to stay for long periods also only a few TV channels unless you pay for a package and couldn t get free wifi to work on my phone , The Breakfast was good in a good location for what I needed clean
301292,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, The windows could not be opened so it didn t really smell fresh On the day of our departure the cleaning lady was not so happy with the fact that we didn t leave our room until the check out time giving her little time to clean Breakfast is too expensive so we didn t take it , That it was located close to the important train stations It was quite 
301293,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury,No Negative, The room was tiny compared to what the pictures say there wasn t enough room for my girlfriend to dry her hair and there were bin noises in the morning which were very load

301298,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Given a very small room After expressing disappointment moved to a much larger and more pleasant room , Near tube and bus stops Also shopping centre including Waitrose Plenty of cafes restaurants so good situation 
301299,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, The size and cleaness of standard double room Seriously I would say 2 stars max Why in the world is the tea facility placed inside the closet A hanger that has sharp end fell by accident to break a liquid coffee cream and the split coffee cream on my cloth that I had put in below It was not pleasant Bed uncomfortable and tiny for 2 ppl , Location 1 min from the tube 3 min from bus 11 min from rail Great Friendly staff and excellent breakfast we added when offered at 11 95 GBP 
301300,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Rooms very small window doesnt open and air con limited also can t turn down heating Light from corridor shines under room door so difficult to sleep , Loads of choice for breakfast Staff happy to help with any request 
301301,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, No daily complimentary water in the room no locker in the room I stayed in Holiday inn express in Vauxhall and their room facilities were better than Bloomsbury and their room rent was also less , I really liked the breakfast menu The location of the restaurant was very prime and was the only reason why I choose Bloomsbury
301302,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury,No Negative, Everything From the warmth and professionalism of all the staff to the very comfortable spacious room great breakfast selection ideal location just a step away from Russell Square tube all in all an extremely well run hotel highly recommended 
301303,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Small room and toilet Old hotel finishing Poor furniture Uncomfortable cheep looking bouncing bed No safe in the room , Nice location close to Russell underground station Close to some shopping outlets Free Wifi Cooperative staff

301306,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Felt a little like we were in the ghetto Paper thin walls heard EVERY conversation from rooms around us and every conversation and footstep from the hallway was heard very clearly from within the room Severely overpriced room Looked as though a murder had been committed on our carpet , The proximity to Russel Square station was convenient Proximity to Brunswick was also convenient The staff were lovely Free wifi The room was pretty clean 
301307,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Could not falt the food staff or Hotel, The breakfast that I had booked Was hopefully better than the one that I had at the hilton in Southampton What a wonderful surprise I can not remember a better breakfast than the one we received Fantastic choice and all the food superb Highley recommend it to anyone
301308,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, booked an executive room only one dressing gown which had makeup all over one shampoo one shower gel in all was set up as a single room a bit disappointing we didn t complain not our style but did leave a comment as we left, the staff couldn t do enough for you very pleasant on arrival and departure staff in restaurant fantastic as was the food
301309,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Nothing , Breakfast was excellent with lots of choice We were on the 5th floor which was nice and quiet with comfy twin beds We thought it was very good and will certainly stay there again 
301310,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, nothing really only put good rather than excellent for facilities as didn t use anything but room and luggage storage found the room a little too hot even though staff had kindly turned heating off when asked couldn t really see if the window opened but no real dislikes at all , Good location friendly staff felt welcome storing luggage on last day a big plus 
301311,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, All went well room was a little small but that s normal in London it was very well furnished and clean Hotel breakfast was expensive and its far cheaper to go across the road to the pub , The location is excellent only a 10 minute walk from Euston and Russell Sq tube line behind it meant getting into Piccadilly etc was easy Easy walk to the Museum etc and some very cosy pubs around in the area too Hotel is clean and comfortable we didn t eat or drink in the hotel 
301312,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, could have had two chairs in the room instead of just one and maybe enough milk for two hot drinks each instead of one , bed was comfortable great nights sleep
301313,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Not a very good view only other hotel windows , The first impression was wow we then went to the desk to register and had a few problems with the booking the staff on duty were very helpful and quickly sorted our problem We had our evening meal in he restaurant and was attended to by an absolutely brilliant lady she was so helpful nothing was too much trouble and after a very long tiring day we felt thoroughly spoiled Our whole experience was excellent will definitely recommend to others 
301314,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Provide a family room, The hotel is conveniently located right opposite Russell Square tube station and next to Brunswick Square There is a large Waitrose and lots of restaurants and coffee shops in the nearby area The room was very clean but only has 2 single beds not ideal for 2 adults and a young kid There is no room for adding an additional bed Probably the hotel is more for business travel or for 2 adults only 
301315,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Could have phoned me to say room wasn t ready at the agreed time We were on a very tight schedule for a friends birthday party and we could have eaten before coming to the hotel to save time My friend traveled from Vienna to the hotel , Staff were very friendly and welcoming Arrival time checked the day before although room wasn t ready at agreed time It as quiet and food was excellent Every thing in room worked Always handy to have an iron in the room A very central location Thanks 
301316,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Well I booked a single room with two separate beds but was given one double bed Not what I wanted and when I contacted reception they told me that is what I booked for yet it was clearly not because it stated so on my confirmation email Not happy at all ,No Positive
301317,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Free wifi is advertised and should these days be as freely available as the water in the taps Here free wifi is in fact limited to 2 devices per room not enough for two people each with a smart phone and laptop and a professional need for constant internet connectivity Beyond 2 devices you pay The ever helpful staff found an ad hoc solution to cover the extra 2 devices Dinner in the hotel restaurant was disappointing , Perfect location next to Brunswick Square near Russell Square gardens and Lamb s Conduit St Good range of cafes restaurants and shops and bus and tube links within a few minutes walk Well run comfortable hotel very amiable and helpful staff 
301318,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, The rooms were slightly tired looking There was no fridge in our room , The staff were amazing They were soo helpful The breakfast was lovely and set us up for the day The location was a stones throw from Russell square tube It was very good value for money I can t rave enough about the staff they definitely made our stay more pleasurable 
301319,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, I have stayed at this hotel on numerous occasions Stayed in the basic and executive rooms these are comfortable The only problem experiences are the room cleaning staff are very noisy and wake the customers very early, This is a very good hotel in a central location easy to go to any London main places it also has a local shopping centre just opposite 
301320,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, the bins were the view outside our window would have been nice to have some hot chocolate pkts with the tea and coffee for people who don t drink tea or coffee , the beds were comfortable the bathroom was clean there was plenty of lights in the room so no part was dark 
301321,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Bed rather hard A C blew air straight onto bed so had to turn it off at night which made room hot room rather small, Very helpful staff Taxi rank outside useful Very good choice at breakfast

301323,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Double bed small and we rolled in to middle poor night s sleep Stuffy room took ages to work out thermostat Waiter at breakfast hadn t noticed we were waiting for coffee , Friendly reception Quiet room
301324,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, The room we had was very nice unfortunately it was above the service area which made it very noisy bins bottles waste disposal I would not be taken a room on this side of the hotel again , Very close to everything we planned to visit tube and bus links less than 5minutes walk away We even walked back to the hotel from the centre of the city 
301325,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, The beds were too small and uncomfortable Holiday Inn used to be the last word in good quality hotels but I have to admit that Premier Inn now has it It all looks a bit tired now , Breakfast was good and the staff were friendly 
301326,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Breakfast a little old fashioned for me personally for 16 quid it was full english bacon eggs etc white sliced bread or greasy croissants no artisan bread nuts seeds avacodo there were berries but in a sticky sugary juice But there are so many alternatives for breakfast that if this offer isn t for you and breakfast was busy so plenty of people really like it within 5 minutes walk there are plenty of alternative options , Staff very welcoming and friendly helpful and efficient and rooms small but this is very central London so to be expected of course clean and well equipped 
301327,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, I was not happy with the first room the bathroom was dirty with stains in the bath They changed it over, The first room was not good enough for the money the transfer room was excellent that s all I have to say and I wasn t charged anymore so that was brilliant
301328,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Three person room and only two got to enjoy free WiFi and the third device need to pay in order to get free excess which I think it s unfair when each individual paid equally for the room , Great location and very quite Breakfast choices are also good 
301329,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Overcrowded breakfast on week ends Standard rooms are really small Because we complained laswt time we were freely upgraded this time , Professional care and sympathy of the employees Free room upgrade to executive

301332,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Size of room and bed Only 1 chair in a double room Very cramped and not as indicated in the advertising photos No reference to food allergies on literature in the room had to ring room service who were helpful but couldn t give definitive advice Scrambled egg was disappointing as it was like an egg mayonnaise warmed up couldn t eat it , Location and downstairs bar
301333,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Restaurant menu not good enough for London menu poor need to improve Price lower, The way the treated us On Arrival the staff very kind to us We use the holiday Inn quite often the menu 
301334,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, The facilities are so poor The hotel is old when we checked in the room we noticed that there s no refrigerator mini bar we called the reception and was informed that we have to upgrade our room which means add another 25 pounds per night then we will have the refrigerator This is the first time I get the holiday inn s room without refrigerator And one more thing is the water coming from the wash sink is either hot or cold you can t make it warm , The location is good close to the underground
301335,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, more than 200 pounds per night during new year pretty expensive , Great location next to Russell Square tube station less than 10 mins walk to British Museum 
301336,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Small room and not up to usual standards Far too hot and air con too noisy to leave on during the night Wall mountable hairdryer in drawer Mo mirror at desk Bath stained and fixings falling off wall , Location
301337,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, The breakfast this was like hell People queing for 20 minutes to even get seated then fighting to get their hot food quicker The breakfast room is far too small for that big a hotel What sense makes a pancake makes when it takes 5 minutes for one and there are 50 people queing to have their food The coffee one was good the next cup was horrible We paid while at breakfast the recceptionist did cancel our door key so waiting for the full lift to get down and up again no apology from her The welcome also wasn t very welcoming , One bed was great the other bed we ordered a Twin room was a very uncomfortable sofabed though 
301338,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, We found the bed too small and it was noisy outside at night, We liked the location of the hotel and thought it was good value especially as we had breakfast included
301339,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Paintwork in room was a little tired but nothing major , Good location very close to Russell Square tube Only a couple of stops to lots of attractions We were able to check in early as room was ready which was great Staff all very pleasant and helpful Small double room was comfortable for a 1 night stay Excellent breakfast

301348,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, The fire alarms being set off tested at 6am Noisy air con units for those rooms that faced inwards , Very efficient and friendly staff Excellent breakfast 
301349,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Night duty manager When I arrived breakfast hadn t been included the receptionist included it adding 1650 to my bill I said I had booking which said total would b 151 I said I was tired and would sort it later the night duty manager was very cheeky after refunding me as I walked away he said to two of his colleagues in a very loud voice oh my god it was not the responce that a manager should set for his employees never mind the paying customer 16 50 might not be a great some to him but it is to me and I would assume most other people As for the breakfast itself it was the worse tasting fry up I have ever tasted and I said to the check out staff as I left who did offer me a breakfast refund which I declined I just wanted out of there, Location
301350,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury,No Negative, All staff I met were very helpful and considerate in their approach in recognising customer needs Especially on checkin with a Dutch gentleman 3 letter name I come from a hotel management background and he was excellent in his service approach 
301351,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Dated bathroom and towel rail didn t work We reported it but it couldn t be fixed We were offered another room but got in too late to do anything However clean towels were provided so apart from a cool bathroom it made no real difference to our stay, Very comfy bed and pillows had the best night sleep in ages And decent decaff coffee was on offer which is better than some more expensive hotels 
301352,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Duvet too thin room was small almost pokey I have stayed here before in a much better room so I suppose it is luck of the draw , Location is excellent close to Euston it also backs on to Russell Square Tube Station 
301353,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, The gap under the door to the room was fairly substantial so let in a fair amount of hall noise Could ve done with a door snake to block out some of the noise , Breakfast staff and room were good 
301354,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Our welcome at the reception left a lot to be desired not sure if the woman had a bad day but it wasn t the friendly reception that I was normally used to from your group There was also a misunderstanding with our pre booked late check out as the floor manager walked straight into our room after knocking once only which could have been very embarrassing , This booking was all about location as it is in the heart of London so almost easy access to everything 
301355,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Wildly overpriced I felt like Alan Partridge at a cliched conference venue Imagine paying those outrageous prices for a room and having to pay an additional 16 per day for Wi if Wow hi it s 2015 You re a conference hotel Get with the programme And no water in the room The small cold uncomfortable depressing room I took longer to check in than I ve ever experienced How can that be The queue wasn t that long and everyone was getting a bit annoyed Not a great start Your modus operandi is completely geared towards extracting the maximum out of your guests such balance sheet rather than customer centric ways of working are as outdated as your decor , Nothing 
301356,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury,No Negative, They gave us a bigger room because we stayed for 7 nights which was great Very friendly and helpful staff Lots of choice for breakfast and restaurant meals were yummy Hotel close to tube Would recommend it and will definitely stay there again

301358,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Very small room for an executive room at over 200 per night No better than travel lodge at less than 100 per night Very limited menu in restaurant, Location close to theatre land short cab 15 or bus ride 6
301359,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, We understand rooms can be tiny but we must have had the worst room in the place Our cruise ship bedroom was bigger booked a king and got a double It was like a dorm room don t believe pictures Not a good deal for exorbitant price paid , Breakfast 
301360,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Was absolutely perfect for the price we paid, Brilliant location tube station less than a 2 minute walk away and kings cross only a 5 minute walk Also right next to a shopping centre which we didn t expect has all the usual shops which was very handy as we forgot a lot of stuff 
301361,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, The cooling heating is strange no control over heating as it is remotely switched on with radiator behind the bed and the control by the door is only for cooling ac Asafety box for valuables would be very useful and it is a bit suprising that one is not supplied in a hotel of this general standard , very clean comfortable though small double room lots of power sockets powerful shower
301362,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Chargeable internet No hairdryer in bathroom Missing bedside table Somewhat noisy, Fresh orange juice at breakfast Nice large luxury bathroom towels Helpful staff

301365,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, No bad experiences really Would have preferred a walk in shower rather than over the bath one but there was anti slip bath mat Also struggled a bit with shower on off tap but then I do have arthritis So other people would not have a problem , Within easy walking distance from St Pancreas Station tired after a return from Germany and again in morning to walk to Kings Cross and return home to Leeds Room was spacious with all amenities A good nights sleep had followed by a full English cooked breakfast fresh fruit yoghurt VG

301370,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, It is being a bit finicky but could not help noticing some cleaning issues in the bathroom , Location for central london tube and reasonably priced parking available seemed good value as we had 50 of normal price would not pay the full price to stay here
301371,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, I stayed in a lot of mom and pop hotels on my trip All these places offered free Wifi the one hotel I stay in that is a corporate company and they charge you for the WiFi unless you use their downstairs cafe or join their members club Ripoff travelers need wifi to connect with their families back home plus paying for what you pay for this hotel you should be able to do it it in the comfort of your over priced room The Wifi isn t even cheap ,No Positive

301373,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Room staff are noisy Toilet paper is rough Executive rooms fridge is empty No Free WiFi, Location is good staff generally helpful good fercilities
301374,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, The pork sausage provided for breakfast is one of the worst pork sausages we have ever eaten It entirely make of flour and not succulent Even waitross sausages are much better Hashbrown is not even crispy Overall breakfast should be improved tremendously to give visitors a proper English breakfast experience , It is close to Russell Sq tube station Convenient 
301375,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, There is no hair conditioner which normally is a standard in U S hotels, The staff are very friendly and helpful They are courteous Love the breakfast buffet Will stay again if given the chance to come back 
301376,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Poor condition of room Steel bracket of corner of wardrobe dropped off suddenly in the early hours of the morning Can you imagine if it fell on you On reporting the incident the tone of one staff was condescending For this price point I recommend Millennium Hotel Knightsbridge instead where I stayed 2 months ago and gave good feedback for Kamal at Tangerine Cafe, near Brunswick Center staff who helped check me in was friendly
301377,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, The room was INCREDIBLY hot and stuffy there is no escape from this as the windows do not open and air conditioning made no discernible difference I had barely any sleep Wifi connection was poor in the morning although fine the previous evening Very disappointing in comparison to previous enjoyable stay 3 weeks ago ,No Positive
301378,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury,No Negative, We were a family group and had been given rooms in close proximity on the same floor as requested The staff were all very friendly and helpful throughout our weekend stay We followed up a restaurant recommendation made by the Hotel and although not officially bookable the restaurant had reserved us a table 
301379,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, The cost of WiFi in the room Spent 5 and couldn t get connected It is free in so many places Even free WiFi in the Lounge area would have been OK , The quietness at night Didn t expect that given the closeness to the Euston Road 
301380,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury,No Negative, They were very helpful giving us appropriate rooms for our family reunion and extending our room bookings without moving even though they were very full

301387,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Initially couldn t find my booking on the system but when they did they upgraded me for the inconvenience , All staff were excellent Front desk staff were friendly and sincere and extremely helpful 
301388,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Standard rooms are really small less than 10m square Don t take too much luggages Pics on booking are rewards club rooms not standard seems to be false advertising understaffing for breakfast on week end face to the crowd Cards were blocked because of a monstruous debt of 3 pounds rules are applied without thinking , Very great professionalism efficiency and friendliness of staff Thank you to reception manager who is really professionnal 
301389,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, Had to leave a day early so I lost out on 160 for 1 night charge as my 1st night I did not sleep due to the club underneath my room was booming until the early hours Deprived of my sleep and very unhappy No refund given to me as it was booked through booking com, The pen show that the hotel was hosting 
301390,Holiday Inn London Bloomsbury, The only thing I didn t like was the toilet roll , Location perfect for me 5 minutes walk from St Pancras excellent breakfast comfortable bed and friendly staff Not the cheapest but normal for a hotel of this standard in London
