85269,Grange White Hall Hotel, The check in process was very slow and made us run late for a booking we had made after The rooms didn t have air conditioning and was very hot we had one fan for 3 of us which didn t do a lot , The location was good and we could walk easily to Covent Garden 
85270,Grange White Hall Hotel, The bar area was shabby and disorganised The glass lift while being the centre piece of the hotel the glass and shiny bits could do with a clean 17 99 for a continental Breakfast And no air conditioning boiling hot , Reception on arrival and departure were very helpful Room was clean 
85271,Grange White Hall Hotel, Breakfast was too expensive I try to stay in this hotel every time I visit London I found that the room was in need of maintenance in the bathroom large wet patch on the ceiling and the shower recess needed re grouting or cleaning properly Mould The bed needed to be change very old and worn plus the mattress protected was for a single bed and not a double No ironing board and iron as standard 70 for breakfast well out of the ball park for this Hotel Was not as expensive as this the previous times I stayed in this Hotel I will not be returning , convenience of the Hotel to transport theatre and other venues 
85272,Grange White Hall Hotel, In the peak Summer months I imagine the rooms would be quite hot , The location was excellent for the purposes of our trip which was to visit the American Embassy and meet up with a family member The hotel was good value for money and the staff friendly helpful and efficient 
85273,Grange White Hall Hotel, Everything The room was full of flies when I got inside There was no air conditioning and since the place was hot they left the window open All very well then buy a flies screen My room was close to the elevator and the wall made a lot of noise when the elevator was functioning waking me up constantly during the night the carpet was dusty and the bathroom was in desperate need of redoing They should not call it hotel and not charge more than 50 pounds per night I believe even hostels would be more glamorous than this , The position is the only reason of being of this place Stuff quite nice at the reception 
85274,Grange White Hall Hotel, Pricey a bit Breakfast was 20 pound So we didn t bother with that No other complaints Beware of the noisy bottle disposal across the road once a morning though , Bed and pillows were comfy room was super clean perfect for our 3 night stay would stay longer So quiet near a beautiful little Park Near central and picadilly line walking distance
85275,Grange White Hall Hotel, Nothing, Nice helpful friendly staff we were able to store our suitcases whilst out shopping We were upgraded to a better larger room the facilities were very good nice products in the bathroom and tea coffee facilities 
85276,Grange White Hall Hotel, The Bathroom floors are really slippy , The Beds are comfortable We asked to stay the Main Hotel and we were put in the main hotel which was good Staff were happy to help get a Taxi for us when leaving the Hotel The street is quiet and its easy to get to sleep Ask for a room overlooking the gardens for a great view We didn t book a Breakfast but the service is Buffet style to suit everyone every year when we stay in London we book this Hotel and will continue to its location if brilliant and the area is quiet But within easy walking distance of bars restaurants and Russell Square Tube 
85277,Grange White Hall Hotel, Sound insulation between floors wasn t so good we could hear movements of the occupants of the room above us Otherwise the room was quiet overlooking the back of the British Museum to rear , Friendly and helpful staff and excellent location in leafy area just off Russell Square 15 mins walk from Euston and again 15 mins to theatre purpose of our visit 5 mins walk to Russell Square tube to connect to further parts of city Lots of places around this area for breakfast a lot cheaper than the hotel breakfast which wasn t included in the room rate 
85278,Grange White Hall Hotel, The location ease to get there and the park across the road the bed and pillows were to die for , The room was extremely small little space in the wardrobe and the television was inadequate 
85279,Grange White Hall Hotel,No Negative, Great little hotel in a fabulous location 5 minutes walk from Russell Square tube and easy access to central London attractions Area is beautiful and quiet the hotel reception areas are clean and classic and the staff are friendly and helpful The room was a decent size with very comfortable beds only down side was that it was very warm but the windows opened so not a real problem The bar prices were also surprisingly reasonable for central London 
85280,Grange White Hall Hotel, We arrived at 22 30 on a Sunday evening I had specifically booked this hotel because I had stayed in other Grange Hotels and had great experiences and I wanted a 3 bed room not a pull out sofa bed The description of the room and photos showed 3 proper beds but when we arrived I found a double bed and a pull out sofa bed with an awful metal frame and no mattress When I enquirers about the discrepancy I was told I ll just finish cashing up and sort it out We also wanted something to eat and when I asked at reception I was shown a website of fast food places that will deliver to the hotel I asked if there were any restaurants nearby that would still be serving food I was told I don t really know Seeing as how we couldn t go to sleep because of the lack of the 3rd bed we decided to take a short stroll to see what we could find Within 2 blocks of the hotel we found a lot of restaurants with last orders at 1am How can front desk at a hotel not know the surrounding area Customer service by the night staff was completely unacceptable Overall the hotel is fairly run down and tired and it was not at all what I expected from a Grange Hotel , Not very much 
85281,Grange White Hall Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic location quiet side street right next to British Museum Comfy large room fresh air nd large windows looking out onto the back garden I rate this an excellent 10 a great bargain for the money Terrific walkable neighborhood with many restaurants boutique shops and pubs to visit Nice bar and restaurant downstairs In hotel super helpful staff easy access to anywhere in the city Tube stops nearby Russell Square 1 2 block away I will be staying here again Loved it 
85282,Grange White Hall Hotel, Found a hair on my bed and a couple in the bath Also TV guide on tv didn t work which made it tricky to find what is on being picky though , Comfy bed very friendly staff great location
85283,Grange White Hall Hotel,No Negative, The staff were really helpful The bar was open 24 7 and the rooms were well kept with all the extras you would want from a hotel The offer that I got from Booking com was exceptionally good value for money given the location so close to Covent Garden and there was a beautiful park a minute walk down the road Compared with the other prices of other hotels in the same area this four star hotel was amazing for the price I got 
85284,Grange White Hall Hotel, Didn t like the price of the breakfast and also when the person upstairs was having a shower the noise was horrendous thankfully it wasn t too early in the morning , The room was small but nice 
85285,Grange White Hall Hotel, Nothing, Stayed for one night Big room with bath and shower Good selection of tea and coffee in the room Comfortable beds and clean Trouser press in room which I used Staff were so helpfull Very quiet rd for London Only thing is we couldn t figure out how to keep the window open as it kept sliding down and couldn t see a catch But room was a nicer temperature anyway Highly recommend
85286,Grange White Hall Hotel, Basement room would have felt very small for more than a single guest , Ideally situated for the British Museum and an easy walk to the West End 24hr reception useful Bar adequate but loads of alternatives near by 
85287,Grange White Hall Hotel, thought breakfast would be included given the price not enough power plugs in room for kettle and charger , good location nice interior professional staff
85288,Grange White Hall Hotel, As only stopping for one night could find no dislikes a very pleasant, Well located very clean beds very comfortable Well presented toiletries Excellent range of complimentary tea and coffee Would definitely recommend 
85289,Grange White Hall Hotel, Nothing, We were allocated a fabulous room G1 on the ground floor looking out at the garden Lovely and quiet We think it doubles as a meeting room hence the large size Bed dropped down from the wall 2 wardrobes 3 comfy chairs coffee table and plenty of floor space A bursting hospitality tray nice Toiletries Hotel close to all the amenities Our go to hotel in London for location price Staff friendly and helpful too Looked after our bags both before after our stay to save us carrying them around 
85290,Grange White Hall Hotel, The bedroom had no proper bed It was one of those that are on a hinge on the wall and pulls down when required Like a bedsit Very uncomfortable At this price and lower I would have expected a proper bed ,No Positive
85291,Grange White Hall Hotel, For me it had everything I was looking for, Everything was great we were treated as I d expect to be and the Facilities service and food was fantastic
85292,Grange White Hall Hotel, Not sure if they had parking We didn t need to park but maybe will in the future as we come back and forth to London quite a bit so will need to check this if we come back , Very clean and staff were friendly Bed was comfortable and the room was nice and dark and warm and quiet We got a deal and so very pleased with what we got for the price Didn t eat at the hotel as we only needed a bed for the night but very happy with our stay 
85293,Grange White Hall Hotel, Staff didn t have great English asked about bus tour and they couldn t help me they directed me to 3 different staff members even though a sign said about booking a bus tour with them , Very convenient location
85294,Grange White Hall Hotel, I did not like that i know for a fact i left my phone charger on the bed by accident as i took it out of my case just before leaving the room so i emailed them asking to locate it and they said there was no phone charger there , Bed was comfy
85295,Grange White Hall Hotel, Staff weren t friendly and approachable Our room was not cleaned once during our stay We asked for shampoo as there was none in our room when we checked in and still hadn t arrived by the time we left We didn t get clean cups for tea or clean towels and even ran out of toilet paper The bathroom was not cleaned upto standard and we will not be staying with a Grange Hotel again In my opinion this hotel is over priced and over rated , The layout of the room and the size of the bathroom 
85296,Grange White Hall Hotel, The staff were not always as helpful as they could have been however they were always friendly Also the breakfast was extremely expensive for what they were offering so we went elsewehere , Excellent location for what we required Clean comforting and with all the necessary facilities Pretty building thoroughly enjoyed the stay 
85297,Grange White Hall Hotel, We arrived 10 30am after traveling for 24hrs so extremely jet lagged tired We were able to check in and store luggage and returned at 2pm when we were told our room would be ready only to be told it would be another hour This was not acceptable so after 3 4hr they found us a room very small with a sloping floor you could roll marbles down They should have known from our booking details we were traveling 1 2 way around the world and been more helpful While we were waiting for a room 4 other groups with small overnight bags checked in rooms ready , We stayed before and after a tour of Europe The second visit was excellent Lovely roomy room clean comfortable Helpful staff Great location so central 
85298,Grange White Hall Hotel, All was good, Bed and bedding were extra comfy and soft good blinds and curtains to keep room dark for sleeping Location great for walking around central London
85299,Grange White Hall Hotel, The room didn t even have mini fridge There were stains on the carpet and the bathroom tiles were broken and filled with dirt I didn t dare to walk around without wearing my slippers The rooms were dated and needed major refurbishment , Great location right next to British Museum and there was a bus stop at the front door that goes to Euston Station if you need to make some side trips Friendly and helpful staff 
85300,Grange White Hall Hotel, The hotel floor carpet was very dirty and also the room 302 floor has slopes Very strange, One of the best locations Away form major traffic yet close to shopping and dinning 
85301,Grange White Hall Hotel, Very soft and small beds 140 cm No mini bar so actually you can t store things Floor in our room was very old and not straight and all the room was crooked, Staff was very kind and helpful Location is great Free and quick wifi
85302,Grange White Hall Hotel, To say its a 4 star hotel things were very dated Old carpets old tv chipped paint and wobbly windows could all do with replacing and the bed was very small Comfortable but small , The location is brilliant only 10 mins to the theatre and very close to the tube but a lovely quiet area Staff were very nice and everything was very clean 
85303,Grange White Hall Hotel, The checking in process was drawn out and tricky and the location was brilliant but hard to find , The beds and the lobby lift were amazing The location as well was fantastic we were travelling by foot and were able to do so easily 
85304,Grange White Hall Hotel, I was told we would have two separate beds It was more like two beds pushed together to form a king sized bed and no room to separate them Also neon lights from the hotel across the street were incredibly bright all night , The staff was friendly and helpful Convenient location near Russel Square Underground station the British Museum and the theatre district 
85305,Grange White Hall Hotel, The room was very small There wasn t even enough room to fit a chair in the bedroom The blind was broken preventing full exclusion of light Most importantly there was a large crack in the bathroom sink we were worried this could cause a problem using the sink , The hotel was centrally located on a fairly quiet street We had to leave a day early unexpectedly and the hotel made a part refunded for our second night which we hadn t expected 
85306,Grange White Hall Hotel, Rooms very warm and could not open the window I did also tell when booking the hotel it was for a special occasion my friends 50th but nothing mentioned which was a shame Also didn t have the breakfast as it was very expensive , Great location friendly and helpful staff comfy beds and a great variety of teas in the rooms 
85307,Grange White Hall Hotel, All very comfortable thanks No complaints with my last visit , Wonderfully comfy room at the back of the hotel overlooking the garden sleapt very well Great service and courtesy in the Restaurant and from Jacek at Reception I really appreciated my upgrade which made all the difference to my sleep Thank you 
85308,Grange White Hall Hotel, Triple comfort room was not what we expected The third bed was not a proper bed and there weren t enough room to move around because of this bed that was put in the room after we arrived at the hotel Could hear also lifts moving up and down from my room as it was right next to it , Clean room Efficient staff 
85309,Grange White Hall Hotel, Fold down bed no English tea in room worn decoration no bathroom extraction exorbitant breakfast prices so went around to a local cafe instead Just generally disappointed Would have preferred to pay more for better , Perfectly located for the West End Nice road behind the British Museum
85310,Grange White Hall Hotel, The staff in the restaurant weren t good at all Couldn t explain easily the breakfast menu and their manners were very poor , Everything was as expected location was good the rooms are comfortable and we had a good night sleep 
85311,Grange White Hall Hotel, The staff said they can book us a taxi if told in advance thennwhen we chose to utilise this service I was told no they don t book taxis The hotel is horribly overpriced for the state it was in We got a broken chipped glass with our breakfast and they forgot our toast we waited30 mins for toast and then it came and was the wrong type we asked for white but got brown Very old fashioned hotel worn out furniture and dusty toilet seat in the bathroom We will never stay there again,No Positive
85312,Grange White Hall Hotel,No Negative, Great location and comfortable rooms Not the largest rooms but we were hardly in it Could be uncomfortable in hot weather as no air con and we needed to leave the windows open in Sept 
85313,Grange White Hall Hotel, We were not appreciative of the high cost of the breakfasts that the room was so small that while it could not take a full sized double bed you still had difficulty walking round it that the lift seemed to be in the wardrobe and so was noisy that the windows were floor to ceiling so the only way to get privacy was to draw the curtains so the room was then in darkness and that there was a bus stop immediately outside ,No Positive
85314,Grange White Hall Hotel,No Negative, Got there around 3am after a wedding party and the reception where very kind and helpful even at this early hours Room was clean and enjoyed my sleep
85315,Grange White Hall Hotel, The room was hot all the time even though it wasn t hot outside They need better ventilation And it was noisy People were walking around singing and shouting at 3 or 4 am outside and construction next door meant noise early in the morning too , The room was clean and comfortable with a superb location We walked almost everywhere we wanted to go It s an attractive property as well with beautiful flowers in front and a nice lobby 
85316,Grange White Hall Hotel,No Negative, The location is fantastic right next to the British Museum easy access to the Russell Square tube The hotel is clean and tidy and pretty the rooms are very comfortable The staff were without exception on my three stays with this hotel excellent efficient and friendly 
85317,Grange White Hall Hotel, There was one thing but I can t remember so it must have been insignificant , Great location lovely service from staff beds were so comfortable We had a room over looking the Garden and the British museum which was lovely 
85318,Grange White Hall Hotel, The window was broken which made it very difficult to open and close It was a very hot night so this was an issue , Very convenient for the British Museum our reason for choosing it 
85319,Grange White Hall Hotel, Bed could have been better Staff could have been most considerate initially they initially assigned my a single room for the charge of double room But sorted that out after complaint Otherwise it s was ok nothing special about the stay Felt more like guest house rather than Hotel ,No Positive
85320,Grange White Hall Hotel, Room a bit too small and hot at night The hotel was OK but a little disappointed however at the right price would stay again , Great location and friendly staff nice sweets 
85321,Grange White Hall Hotel,No Negative, Great location quiet yet so close to centre London Soho Lovely room well kept and comfortable small but practical Nice gesture to include current newspaper and magazines in the room Didn t try the breakfast so can t talk about that 
85322,Grange White Hall Hotel, Would have loved to have more info on the history of the hotel and the area available in the guest info in the bedroom , Bed very comfy and our room 101 was very quiet Hotel position is excellent for theatres and is right behind the British Museum lovely traditional older hotel loved the character 
85323,Grange White Hall Hotel, Check out service was a little abrupt didn t ask if we had a nice stay but another member asked someone else checking out if they had Didn t say goodbye either, Very comfy bed and quiet room in a great location nice little hotel
85324,Grange White Hall Hotel, Reasonable sized room unfortunately fitted with chunky furniture that got in the way making it tricky for two people to move around in The bathroom was the smallest I have ever experienced , Good location v close to British Museum
85325,Grange White Hall Hotel, The hotel and room were less than that expected of a 4 star property Most of the room was old falling apart Sloping floor blinds not attached to the fixings Windows didn t close fully bed didn t reach the wall no headboard so had to put cushions in space Upon arrival the hotel seemed to be undergoing work and this made the reception feel unwelcoming and unprofessional , Great location close enough to the centre but far enough away to prevent noise and too much hustle and bustle 
85326,Grange White Hall Hotel, The hotel was very warm and apart from a small fan or opening the window there was no way of changing this There was very little breeze outside We were upgraded but there was no hairdryer iron or extraction fan in the bathroom , The hotel was lovely and the staff where very helpful It was a great location for the west end and getting around The rooms were well presented a good size and clean Bar prices were very reasonable
85327,Grange White Hall Hotel, The welcome at reception the receptionist was on the telephone most of the time she was booking us in I felt as if I was a nuicance There seemed to be some problem with finding us a room even though we had booked in advance The facilities promised on the booking form differed from those actually in the room , The room overlooked the garden and was very clean and quiet There were ample toiletries The staff were friendly and helpful 
85328,Grange White Hall Hotel, We had a room on the 2nd flr to the front of the hotel which was quite small and the floor sloped a lot from the window into the bathroom which proved to be quite hazardous as the bathroom floor was very shiny the side of the bath was high and even though we are fit it was awkward getting into the shower Our biggest issue was however the noise even though the windows are double glazed and were shut the noise from the street was unbelievable and prevented us from sleeping people walking past at odd hours to the very early weekend bin lorries to the road being dug up at 6am on Saturday and Sunday morning we struggled to sleep first impressions the street appears to be very elegant and quiet but this does not the case after dark , The hotel is quite small but has a brilliant location the restaurant and gardens to the rear are lovely especially for an early evening drink and there is plenty of tea and coffee provided in the room I would suggest requesting for a room at the rear of the hotel if possible 
85329,Grange White Hall Hotel, The hotel breakfast was very expensive As a result we elected not to have breakfast there Fortunately there are a number of excellent places to eat breakfast within a five minute walk that are reasonably priced , The rooms were spacious and clean The hotel is within a 15 minute walk of Euston Station located in a quiet street close to Russell Square gardens and tube station 
85330,Grange White Hall Hotel, Room 006 Lower Ground level looks out on an outside wall Would be nice to have a plant or two and have the outside space be clean , Good location backing on British Museum Nice interiors Quiet Responsive staff 
85331,Grange White Hall Hotel, Room smelt of cigarette smoke strongly on arrival I appreciate though that this would have been the previous occupiers fault not the hotels , We were kindly upgraded on arrival Thank you very much the place was clean lovely room md location was perfect Fantastic price aswell
85332,Grange White Hall Hotel, Tired old room very different to the advertising Poor sound proofing from lift shaft hallways and road outside Knackered old furniture Won t be staying here again, Not much
85333,Grange White Hall Hotel, Bathroom was tiny for a double room and it was pretty scary trying to get in and out of bath for showering The age it took to check in , Bed was comfy and bedroom clean
85334,Grange White Hall Hotel, The single z bed was very uncomfortable and placed under the tea making shelf which I thought was very dangerous , Towels linen and toiletries were of a very good quality The room was a good size 
85335,Grange White Hall Hotel, Travel camp bed not a propper bed no headboard so couldn t sit and have a cuppa in bed Although it was comfy it was very low No bedside tables plugs No plug for the bath although this was brought but had to ring reception , Location fab Staff friendly and attentive Large room Was asked if I would like a complimentary breakfast free of charge 
85336,Grange White Hall Hotel, Although there are many good things about the hotel I found the check in process odd I had to confirm the rate which was written out and shown to me on a piece of paper and was then told very firmly that breakfast was not included as if I might try to claim it was It was not the most hospitable start I don t blame the receptionist it looked as if this was policy I was given a dark basement room where the grouting and sealant round the shower needed some maintenance although I was told this was an upgrade It felt as if the hotel did not know how to welcome gracefully guests who had a discount deal The hotel is swanky but the management needs to work harder to live up to the claim that this chain is for the most discerning travellers , The bed was super comfy and at check out the receptionist was really helpful asking if I needed my luggage stored The hotel is in a great location just behind the British Museum It was warm and comfortable 
85337,Grange White Hall Hotel, The breakfast was ridiculously priced but we went out and picked up breakfast nearby there are so many places to eat within a short walk There s a real lack of plug sockets so I d recommend taking a multi way plug , The hotel is perfectly placed in close proximity to Holborn and Russell Square underground stations The room itself was possibly the largest I ve stayed in in Central London and was really nicely furnished We had a balcony with huge sash windows another rarity in London The beds were glorious and I didn t want to leave in the morning The hot staff were lovely and could to help enough even to flagging down a taxi for us Shaftesbury avenue is only a 7 taxi away so really handy for the west end shows 
85338,Grange White Hall Hotel, Room was a little small , Great package with easy access to tube Staff were very good and extremely helpful Comfortable room but maybe a little small but had everything needed for a good stay 
85339,Grange White Hall Hotel, Better trained and more efficient bar staff would be a bonus , Room was clean and fairly roomy Good bathroom size with bath Great location walking distance to British museum and theatre land Easy to find close to Russell Square tube Food in restaurant nothing special but perfectly edible 
85340,Grange White Hall Hotel, Didn t like that I had only booked one night shall book more nights next time , Couldn t find fault at all with this hotel beds were especially comfortable location was amazing little extra touches like magazines bathrobes toiletries and wide selection of teas and coffees including fruit teas etc made a big difference 
85341,Grange White Hall Hotel, Space a bit tight especially getting in and out of the bathroom Prohibitively priced breakfast I went out to eat breakfast in cafes nearby of which there are many , Quiet comfortable room overlooking garden and backing on to British Museum Reasonably priced room service menu food when it came was well presented and tasty Helpful staff Extremely convenient central location 
85342,Grange White Hall Hotel, Reception staff unhelpful with poor language skills Sharp practice at checkout have all receipts ready Breakfast rather lacking in choice but of quite good quality Pots of coffee would be better than waiting for staff to come and pour a cup of lukewarm coffee , A very comfortable room but decor rather shabby hotel in a good position 
85343,Grange White Hall Hotel, The temperature in the room was so high it turned my shower gel into liquid We did wonder why the window was wide open when we entered the room for the first time A bad nights sleep as you sweat through the night on top of the bed or have the window open and listen to the city go about its buisiness all night long A shame as the bed was really comfortable The staff cannot make tea The breakfast is shocking first of all it cost 40 for two people for a bowl of serial and some fruit and the full English I had was made with the cheapest of ingredients in my opinion It was cheaper booked in advance but not much Weak tea and very strong coffee which we declined to have refilled when offered , The location and the staff are very good Except they haven t a clue on how to make tea
85344,Grange White Hall Hotel, The third bed in our room was a camp style bed it was not particularly comfortable apart from that it was excellent, I have stayed here before location excellent staff friendly room clean
85345,Grange White Hall Hotel, The rooms we were offered on the Montague St side are small noisy with the window open stuffy with the window closed The room we changed to Bloom s Town House was quiet but too dark and there was a strange smell cleaning products These days every hotel should have unlimited free wifi not requiring repeated logins guests should not have to pay for normal unlimited wifi here called Premium , Interesting historic Bloomsbury house good furniture and pictures good location near Russell Square
85346,Grange White Hall Hotel,No Negative, a very central spot and in Russsell square there is an excellent italian cafe where breakfast could be purchased at a very reasonable price with all fresh food used 
85347,Grange White Hall Hotel, The fixtures were slanted so we were unable to put a glass of water or cup of tea on them without them sliding off The bath plug did not fit the plug hole so we were not able to have a bath only showers TV has subtitles you are unable to switch off and the wifi was useless , Five minutes walk to Shaftsbury Avenue and very clean The staff are friendly and helpful they also upgraded my mother s room as it was her birthday 
85348,Grange White Hall Hotel, although it had a double bed the room was a little small the price for breakfast in bed would have been 28 pound for 1 room service so we didn t have breakfast, location great staff friendly
85349,Grange White Hall Hotel, Only personal preference but the mattress was very uncomfortable Perhaps just missing our own , We stayed in this area as it was close to the theatre we were going to visit It was perfect from that point of view and easily walkable Hotel staff were friendly and room was small but adequate for a one night stay 
85350,Grange White Hall Hotel, Did not like the lower ground Floor room I was allocated Spacious but dirty carpet no nightstand next to the bed Bed was of foldout type you would see in a student room Sheets looked clean but didn t smell fresh Everything looked tired with chipped paint and crappy sliding window panes which had to be opened because the room was heated to 33 degrees Celsius when I arrived No aircon , Good location nice lobby
85351,Grange White Hall Hotel, It was a fold down bed not very comfortable No bedside tables lamps and limited power points for charging phones unless you unplug TV ones under mini bar too close to cabinet so large plugs dont fit The bed was missing a base sheet so had to call night reception to bring one The room was very warm and the only way to keep a window open was to prop it open with a drawer from the cupboard One of the window blinds was broken so unable to open Maybe we were just unlucky with the room we were allocated room 5 lower G , Good location surprisingly large room Staff were courteous and apologetic for issues with room 
85352,Grange White Hall Hotel, There wasn t anything I didn t like We couldn t find the music channel on the TV no biggie but maybe it needs checked , We arrived late and the guy at reception was friendly and helpful The morning staff were just as friendly and nice The room was great Bathroom nice Good selection of teas Nice selection of bath things Bed was very comfortable I d stay again You are made to feel very welcome 
85353,Grange White Hall Hotel, Hotels lovely on arrival staff our friendly can t doubt first impressions On check in the receptionist asked for my card to secure the booking I asked her if this meant payment would be taken she said no I just need the card information to secure the booking I said okay cause I want to pay on another card at the end of my stay As the day went on I went to withdraw some cash from the cash point where my card got declined I went into the bank and they said a payment had been frozen of 206 10 from the grange white hall hotel which happend to be how much I had transfer d from another account for spending money in London I returned back to the hotel to discuss why they didn t make it clear to me that they would be holding a balance of 206 10 in my bank account as now I have no money for the weekend as they have held my money in which I got a muffled response by the receptionist who did it the only outcome I got was that they wouldn t be able to unfreeze it until the end of my stay in which then it will be taken as payment to the hotel so Instead of letting it ruin my stay considering I had only just arrived luckily I had money in another account that I could move over to use for the weekend annoying but what can you do I wasn t getting anywhere just stressed Anyway after a brilliant weekend in London exploring it s amazing sites it s check out day The same receptionist as check in is on the desk so I thought great atleast she knows what happend with my payments etc She asks how our stay was which I couldn t complain about anything it was great The rooms were lovely and comfortable beds the location was excellent she then asks for my card in which I questioned why she needed it again in which she said to authorise the held money in my account to make it as a payment I said so the money you ve held on check in will be released to you as payment now she said yes yes that s right , The comfort of the room and location 
85354,Grange White Hall Hotel, Breakfast not good at all Pre cooked for too long tasteless mushrooms and tomato cold Coffee cold too Bed on small side , Room was very comfy with view over garden Lobby festive with Christmas tree pleasant bar Very close to British museum Free on street parking on Sunday
85355,Grange White Hall Hotel, We were charged 40 50 for two breakfasts The full English breakfast was 20 50 and the continental breakfast was 17 The price is a rip off and there is no way to justify it , It s a great location in a wonderful part of London
85356,Grange White Hall Hotel, Temp of room Lack of interest from staff Staff smoking outside building , Staff appeared to be on automatic pilot Not a huge feeling of being welcome Like others before have said corridors and rooms are boiling We slept with windows open all night Room floor had 30 gradient which actually was funny I guess being such old property 
85357,Grange White Hall Hotel, Clearly indicaciones about the Triple Room in the Booking description , Perfect location Manager was very profesional to resolve the issue with our reservation we book for a Triple Room that Booking declares as one King bed and other bed for a single but when we arrived at hotel the room was a Double room with a sofa bed Aceptable change to a suplementary small bed plus Complimentary breakfast two days 
85358,Grange White Hall Hotel, We were given the wrong key to the wrong room on the wrong floor also had to wait to be served at the bar because there was nobody there so gave up , The hotel was ideally situated for what we wanted and within walking distance Hotel was very comfortable 
85359,Grange White Hall Hotel, bathroom a little on the jaded side not as nice as when we stayed last year It was too hot in the bedroom and the corridoors, Room was lovely staff friendly

85366,Grange White Hall Hotel, Breakfast was very chaotic We came down at 9 20 and it was busy We were asked to wait in reception I thought we would be asked in at next available table I then noticed not long after a couple entered and did not join us realising they must have been seated We asked again and was told another five minutes When eventually seated after about fifteen minutes we were shown to a table our coffee order taken and my husband ordered toast Nobody returned to take our English breakfast order my husband after a long wait started on his toast The Waiter who took our coffee order had not returned the waitress who saw my husband eating his toast told us she thought the waiter had taken our order We saw people eating their full breakfast who had been seated after us We finally an hour after coming down we were served our breakfast My husband who is alergic to black pepper asked for two slices of bacon as he would not be able to eat sausages he was only given one slice also one half of tomatoe is very poor portion We did take this up at the time with the waiting staff and they were apologetic Also we informed reception the evening before we checked out We were not charged for our breakfast we were offered a bottle of wine as compensation we did not think that was necessary We do think there should be some sort of extra training though for kitchen and waiting staff If you are charging 23 for a breakfast then it should be a good one , Our room overlooking the garden was perfect for us Quiet and a nice big window that was easy to open
