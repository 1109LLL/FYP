130080,Hidden Hotel by Elegancia,No Negative, The staff at the Hidden Hotel was very friendly the room very nice the cost for the room reasonable I have been at the hotel several times before it has always been a pleasant experience My favorite is the absolutely superb breakfast The selection of fresh food fruits juice is absolutely world class and needs to be mentioned 
130081,Hidden Hotel by Elegancia, There is a spiral staircase in case those who dislike lifts elevators can access the six floors The lighting needs to be improved as the stair treads have a black surface , Beautiful small Hotel excellent central location but the outstanding gem in the Hotel was the Management and Staff They were really excellent We will definitely return 
130082,Hidden Hotel by Elegancia,No Negative, Very profissional and nice staff Very well decorated hotel with very pleasant air freshner Appreciated to have water apples and magazines available Very confortable bedroom Excellent bed and pillow Very nice bathroom Excellent breakfast great variety and quality of food Very well localized hotel near Arc du Triomphe Excellent ideia to have a nice Paris guide at our disposal Paris is beautiful city guide I definitely recommend this hotel and will be back for sure in fact it s been the 2nd time I ve stayed there 
130083,Hidden Hotel by Elegancia, We were up on the second floor and had a suite with a balcony The room was small for 2 people and we did not like the shower sink area not being separate from the sleeping space Toilet area was very small and the sink was outside of the toilet area Breakfast buffet was tasty but expected more of a variety of foods for the cost There was a table and chairs but really no space for it in the room , Staff were friendly courteous and very accommodating They made the stay pleasant and they were helpful They spoke English which was a plus because I did not speak fluent French The coffee was excellent as well as the drinks at the bar We also like the balcony off from our room Location was good about a 10 min walk to the train 
130084,Hidden Hotel by Elegancia, Only one English TV channel but honestly why are you watching TV in Paris , We had requested an early check in due to an very early flight and though it wasn t available the staff could not have been more charming or helpful Arianne on the front desk deserves a special mention Local restaurant recommendations were perfect Small but very well designed room Great shower Excellent continental breakfast Would definitely return Wonderful location central but not touristy 
130085,Hidden Hotel by Elegancia, Nothing, Staff were fantastic and there is a whole ethos of sustainability and organic including bedding and natural materials and everything is just brilliant Breakfast scrumptious 
130086,Hidden Hotel by Elegancia, the room was too cold probably because it was 4 C outside The air con took a while before heating up the small room , I liked the style and the breakfast a lot It s very close to an underground station and to the Arc de Triomphe 5 mins on foot The location is also very quiet despite being in a touristic spot 
130087,Hidden Hotel by Elegancia, A little bit pricy for the location , Staff are super friendly and helpful from the moment you arrive until being walked out to your taxi Reem in particular was exceptional Room is spacious and clean design is good bed is good very good shower is very good I had a room with a terrace no great view but personally I found it charming especially in the mornings 
130088,Hidden Hotel by Elegancia, bed a bit uncomfortable needs a few more English tv channels a little expensive when peer valued Street comes alive quite early if you have a street facing room, location decor and style staff actually a lovely little hotel perfectly placed 
130089,Hidden Hotel by Elegancia, Breakfast was not included and quite expensive , Great room with a cool modern and organic aesthetic My wife and I stayed here on a weekend between business travels and enjoyed our stay The location is convenient to the Arc du Triomphe as well as lots of shopping

130092,Hidden Hotel by Elegancia, When the housekeeping cleans other rooms it is extreamly noisy Some days they had soy milk and others they didn t and their excuse is that they forgot to buy it , Loved the staff They re extremely helpful and the place is VERY clean I ve been to 5 star hotels that are not as clean The food is nice and the chef takes the time to deliver food to your room and talks to you

130099,Hidden Hotel by Elegancia, We had such a lovely stay I wouldn t like to complain about anything The only thing we didn t like was leaving at the end of our stay , A beautifully designed bedroom Lovely quiet street with almost no traffic and no noise at night The staff could not have been more helpful and spoke perfect English Possibly the most sumptuous breakfast buffet we have ever experienced

130107,Hidden Hotel by Elegancia,No Negative, We was greeted by lovely friendly staff who made us feel at home right away They carried our suitcases to our room and right asked us if we had any plans organised for new years eve as reservations we re running low in all restaurants and wanted to make sure we got the most out of our stay Whilst we went out one day they spent the afternoon recommending and calling restaurants for us trying to get us a table for the night Tanya was absolutely brilliant and the restaurant we ended up going to was amazing The rooms are small and cosy but absolutely spotless and stylish The hotel is located brilliantly in Paris with only a short walkaway from the metro We are already thinking about coming back to this hotel in the summer as we loved our 3 days in Paris Thank you to all the staff for making our new years eve the best ever
