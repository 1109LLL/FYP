260244,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, Fairly close to four different metro stations but if you frequently come in and out it would be a bit of walk , Friendly staff clean and comfortable room and facilities quiet neighbors 
260245,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel,No Negative, I booked this hotel for my daughter and her partner to celebrate her 30th birthday They said the accommodation was great and staff were really polite and helpful The location was perfect within walking distance to the main attractions They had a fabulous time 
260246,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, Lack of usual room service only for breakfast or ready dishes But in general it is not the great problem, Silence of room Very clear Unforgettable breakfast tasty and fresh Very comfortable bed and pillows
260247,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, There was a problem with our first room which we weren t informed about Wet carpet leaks in the bathroom etc We did stay there for one night and the next day staff moved all of our belongings to another room without us knowing Having this said staff was very helpful and friendly understanding our concerns of our belongings The second room was much better The breakfast room is too small for the amount of guests in the hotel sometimes there is a qeue of people waiting to be seated Other guests are not even eating anymore just reading newspapers or talking to each other but occupying a breakfast table I think staff should be able to say something about this especially when people are waiting There are other spaces to talk or read , The location is wonderful calm area good connections walking distance as well as metro lines close Staff is very friendly and helpful Even though you need to pay for breakfast it is of very high standard a lot on offer Got a free upgrade of our room 
260248,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, Coffee was untasty breakfast room to small for all clients Sauna without working shower long time temporary out of order Fitnessroom stereo without speakers, Breakfast very good except coffee was substandard clean rooms kindly reception good located 15min by Walk for eifel tower Good connection for underground 
260249,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, The Lift had a mind of its own sometimes , A very nice quiet and friendly hotel They don t offer evening dining but plenty of restaurants are conveniently located nearby 
260250,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, Not really a variety of different food for breakfast and dinner TV had no connection , Fairly close to the Metro great destination and walking distance from Eiffel tower
260251,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, If coming in on the train at Gare du Nord beware of the scammers that try to grab you and shove you in a taxi They charge three times as much should only run about 25 30 to this hotel via taxi , Loved the hotel so beautiful The staff was very helpful and the hotel was super clean The location was nice and quiet and pretty centrally located A Metro station is about 5 blocks west and gets you to the Eiffel tower in 15 mins including walking You can see the Eiffel tower as you stroll around the neighborhood and there is a lovely bakery down the street limited hours and a convenance store we also spent some time at the Cafe Basile about three blocks Loved it too 
260252,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, No immediate restaurants close by and the hotel doesn t have a restaurant , Breakfast buffet was good Quiet location but 5 min walk from Metro Segur Standard double room small but comfy good bathroom balcony nice accessories Friendly staff and no problems 
260253,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, need to go 700 1000m to restaurants and every metro station but you can reach 3 different metro station nearby the internet speed WIFI was not as good as I expected on the first day i did not work properly at all , If you prefer a calm hotel in the edge of the downtown and do not mind to walk a few its a perfect choice Beside that All the staff were helpfull and nice my every request to be served by them nice roomsize it is bigger than other parisian hotel room to be offered Incredible atmoshere at the lobby breakfast place the finest breakfast I have ever eaten everything but I did not get enough with the delicious croissant perfect bed all the size and the comfort the sauna which is absolute usefull could be used at non stop could be warmed up in 15 minutes massage sofaaaaaa amazing after sightseeing days the hotel situated on a silent part of the city and also in an absolute silent blind alley 
260254,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, Nothing as such Just if you may please add few Indian channels in your list for viewing, Excellent room hospitality was great since we were pure vegetarians the chef prepared a special pure veg dish for us which was a very nice gesture 
260255,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, I would of like something for gluten free diet Terry enjoyed the breakfast each day I was limited in what I could it The food looked great though , I liked the people who worked the front desk Very helpful and kind 
260256,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, This hotel is expensive compared to what I would normally spend on a hotel room but the cost was worth it for a special occasion , Friendly helpful staff Lounge with drinks and tea coffee to help yourself Kettle and high quality tea bags in the room Lovely area with a great view of the Eiffel Tower from nearby 
260257,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, The bed is OK but the brown blanket is not comfortable as it is too hard and rough not smooth as the white cover , I like the friendly staff at hotel and their great service 
260258,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, Probably a little away from majority of major tourist sites but fantastic for a quieter location , I thought this was an excellent property Staff were so helpful and brilliant location for the Eiffel Tower
260259,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, Can t think of a thing , The quiet of the balcony from the 4th floor facing other buildings and in the sun The location was fantastic quiet and a few good bistros and patisseries yet close enough to talk to most of the things we wanted to see for a visit of a few days 
260260,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, The gym A tiny area with 2 machines and a pair of 4kg dumbbells can hardly qualify as a gym fitness centre, Swanky room convenient yet quiet location 10 mins walk to the Eiffel Tower
260261,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, It was hot at my last night of staying while the AC was off , Staff location cleanliness I had some problem to contact the Air France when I wanted to change my reservation but miss Aioana receptionist did a great job to help me and find out a number to contact the Airlines and gave me full instructions to do so Special thanks to Aioana 
260262,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, The shower didn t had that much power on it so that was a bit disappointing , De rooms were nicely decorated with a very comfortable bed and big flat screen if you use it 
260263,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, nothing except not working printer what is absolutely negligible, excellent location in quiet residential part of the city metro stations very closed to hotel nice view from the terrace on Parisian roofs extremely helpful staff everything was perfect 
260264,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, After a long day walking around we settled for room service and were disappointed It was really pricey for the portion and wasn t great in taste either I recommend staying here but don t order room service Breakfast was very very nice though , Those croissants were amazing Receptionist was very nice and helpful Loved the interior of the reception and living room Location was also handy a fairly short walk away from the Eiffel Tower 
260265,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, Nothing comes to mind , Wine on tap in the library and coffee pop water etc available We trust our guests help yourself and fill out a billing slip Even on top of excellent facilities and superb service that was my favorite feature

260268,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, On one day we went out in the morning and came back around 4pm and our room was still not cleaned We had to leave for 30min for cleaning The following day we didn t get clean cups which was really disappointing as we enjoy a cup of tea or two every night Other than that the hotel is very clean just a few missing finer details , This hotel was about a 20 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower which was really convenient The segur metro station was just 3 5min walk away Good location Bed was super comfy and staff were really friendly Also loved the I pod dock in our room Over all lovely stay

260271,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, buffet breakfast a little over priced for what it was we only had it on the last day prior to a lunchtime flight would recommend the near by bakery for breakfast on the go , good location close to Eiffel tower but neighbour a little quiet great staff very informative lovely rooms very spacious and well equipped 
260272,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, Not applicable , The Hotel is amazing The staff is super professional and helpful Joana was incredible during our stay making sure to accomodate all our requests 
260273,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, The staff seemed too lazy to do anything we were served out of date yoghurt for breakfast our room phone didn t work and had to wait for 2 days for it to be fixed I had to get my own room service the shower flooded the gym and the housekeeper left our room door open all day When we told the receptionist he just said it happens On the last day the housekeeper didn t give us any milk for our tea so we rang down asking for some they said it would be with us shortly It never came and we checked out never having one Such a disappointment when the hotel its self is nice , The location to the Eiffel tower is good and the decor and cleanliness of the hotel is also really nice 
260274,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel,No Negative, The location was perfect As you walk out of the hotel the Eiffel Tower is at the end of the street The views are amazing It was about a 7 8 minute walk to it and also the metro was only a five minute walk away which takes you all over Paris in just a couple of minutes There is a huge choice of restaurants around the area aswell as bakery s and also on Thursday and Saturday a local market sets up right outside the hotel It s beautiful and very Parisian The staff were amazing Very friendly and helped us whatever our needs The whole hotel is decorated beautifully Rooms are clean contemporary and stylish We loved every second of our stay 
260275,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel,No Negative, On Thursdays there is a local farmers market in the street near the hotel Amazing The location is easy to get anywhere and near a major shopping street that is much more authentic than the tourist areas I love this hotel The breakfasts are also really good It s a great place to have a walk in a Paris suburb that is not simply a tourist destination Although obviously this is an area of Paris not easily afforded 
260276,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, Not many close restaurants and shops , The bedroom was a good size very clean and comfortable Very friendly staff would recommend We stayed in a double room

260279,Hotel Villa Saxe Eiffel, They have reserved 214 euros at the time of booking than charged one more time the same account at the time of leaving As I didn t expect extra spending the charge was declined Than I had to use another cc to pay the amount Now there are three times one can see the transactions and reserved money on two of my accounts In the bank they told me I had to wait for two weeks before money will be released , This is amazing hotel not far from all the attractions It is not big or small just right I had one of the best breakfasts for 4 star hotels anywhere
