260928,Rochester Champs Elysees, We booked on line and breakfast was not included in the price We felt it should have been included given the cost of the room Perhaps to warn and inform guests of the overcharging on journeys when using taxis which happened to us and was difficult to deal with , We had an excellent service from all the staff who were extremely polite friendly and helpful The hotel facilities were very good the room was very comfortable clean and bathroom and shower spotless There was a good choice of food at breakfast and staff were very helpful and accommodating The hotel had a good location within easy reach of the Champs Elysees We enjoyed our stay very much 
260929,Rochester Champs Elysees, The guy on reception was possibly the rudest man I have ever met on a hotel reception desk it was almost laughable he was so rude , Fabulous position this is our 4th time in as many years for the Tour de France

260932,Rochester Champs Elysees, The staf didn t greet us well and also they didn t gave us two single beds as we requested before in our email to booking com also they gave us the rooms very late and they didn t noticed our email about early check in and late check out as well ,No Positive
260933,Rochester Champs Elysees,No Negative, Great location and very nice comfortable family and couple hotel we had requested an early check in the hotel emailed us and told us that they will try their best arrived at the hotel by 9 30 am after a long and tiresome flight and found the hotel to be fully booked the reception staff asked us to wait a while and did indicate and apologise for the inconvenience as check in usual time in 2 00 pm By 11 00 am our room was ready to move into which was not very late as we only had to wait 1 and a half hour in the comfortable and well decorated lobby A complimentary tea or coffee for the waiting guests would have been nice and would have made us really appreciate the service from the hotel and would show that they really cared nonetheless the room was very clean and comfortable as well as the bathroom however while taking the shower the bath tub drain was closed and stuck so had to call the housekeeping and very promptly they came and fixed it in 5 minutes The breakfast was well served and up to the mark Would definitely come back and stay here 
260934,Rochester Champs Elysees,No Negative, I loved the location and decor of the hotel It was also very clean The staff was helpful in arranging my sightseeing reservations and providing directions 
260935,Rochester Champs Elysees, Small rooms very small kind of old furniture not good for long stay, Friendly staff good location near to the champs also to rivoli and saint honoree thats perfect for shopping clean and cozy
260936,Rochester Champs Elysees, We were checked in and checked out by a rude obnoxious receptionist named Said He did not help us with our luggage when there is a sign on the desk concierge I asked him politely for help and he rudely told me to do it ourselves At checkout he overcharged us for breakfast as I politely asked him to explain he pounded his hand on the counter Fortunately a lady staff intervened and helped us and from what I can tell told him off The cleaning lady replaces our towels daily but doesn t clean it very well because I can still see hair and dust in the sink and floor , Location was great Most of the staff was very friendly and helpful Room was a good size for a couple and cozy 
260937,Rochester Champs Elysees, the room service On the first day i puted do not disturb label on my door but they opened the door and cleaned the room why they open the room when i put do not disturb ,No Positive
260938,Rochester Champs Elysees, If you are staying on the weekend request a room overlooking the terrace then you are not on the road as there are some discos nearby I would also say it s well worth paying an upgrade for a superior room as they are much nicer than the classic , Location was good with Tiffany not far down the road and if you walked the other way a very well prices mini market with a huge selection of food drinks including chilled wine 
260939,Rochester Champs Elysees, Rooms are very dark no extra outlets in the bathroom no proper fan in the bathroom ventilation system was odd , Location is fairly good staff was friendly and helpful 
260940,Rochester Champs Elysees, Unfortunately the hotel is very noissy due to very hard closing hoteldoors And housekeeping left our door open after cleaning Therefore our room was open the entire day and after mentioning it at the reception we just received an OK , Very comfortable and large hotel room 
260941,Rochester Champs Elysees, TV wouldn t switch off so I had to pull out the mini bar to unplug it Hairdryer fell apart could do with updating the hairdryer as they are old fashioned boxes on the wall Cost of mini bar was extortionate 11 00 for a gin and 7 00 per soft drink , The room was cozy with a large balcony Good hearing system and nice lightening Room services was very quick Hamman was nice and the gym has good facilities Nice reception area
260942,Rochester Champs Elysees, 1 Bed is too short If you are taller than 180 it s surely better not to book here I m 185 and my feet hung down Not comfortable 2 Door and window noise isolation is poor So it s often noisy at night even though the streets around are quite narrow and you hear well doors closing on the floor, 1 In the very city center All the main tourist attractions are really close 2 Clean 3 Quite a pleasant interior
260943,Rochester Champs Elysees, in room 512 contiguous twin beds like double bed No enough place to move in the room full of furnitures No wifi signal at all I could never use the internet of hotel The price of the breakfast 25 is unworthy According to campaign that i choose from booking com they shouldn t have charged pre payment but they did And even if it is told that they cancelled didn t recieve it back yet 143 , location is great Staff is smiling and helpful lobby and yard are gradoise 
260944,Rochester Champs Elysees, We re used to a Super King bed at home so the bed felt slightly small That s about it , The staff were really helpful and even put up with my pidgin French check in was seamless even at 1am everything was comfortable and well laid out and very usable 
260945,Rochester Champs Elysees, Would have preferred to pay in full on arrival Could not get safe to work Very small point Room very clean apart from toilet which was slightly soiled as though it had not been used recently , The reception staff the reception area and lift The room and especially the internet access Bed was very comfortable and bathroom was lovely 
260946,Rochester Champs Elysees, We could not adjust the temperature in the room it was too warm So we opened the window but it was on a busy street and the noise was unbearable We were kept awake most of the night because drivers were honking their horns for hours The bathtub did not drain and the sink had a large crack , The room was spacious and clean We were given an upgrade to a larger room The staff were very cordial and helpful 
260947,Rochester Champs Elysees, The rooms are smaller than what I like , The staff were super friendly and helpful The breakfast every day till 13 30 Few walking minutes from the Champs elysees
260948,Rochester Champs Elysees, The room had a wall mounted radiator in front of the bed that had no operating controls Therefore we were not able to lower the temperature which became a bit unbearable at night , The hotel is centrally located well appointed and extremely clean The room where we stayed for three days was very comfortable and had a mini bar stacked with beverages and snacks There are many restaurants and a mini market a short distance away as well as a Metro station 
260949,Rochester Champs Elysees, We were booked in a cheap room that faces the road Apparently these rooms normally sell for EUR 430 You d have to be mad to pay that money to get no sleep For whatever reasons the road outside the hotel becomes gridlocked from about midnight to 7AM and Parisiens like nothing more than composing sonic masterpieces with their car horns I have never in all my life heard so much noise from traffic in a hotel room It is utterly impossible to sleep at night Bizarrely the road is peaceful during the day so it is easy to check in and believe you are on to a winner Don t be fooled When we asked if we could change due to the noise problems we were told We have no rooms in your category Note the distinction It is clear the hotel had some rooms that would have allowed us to get some sleep but they refused to allocate them despite them being available Hence my low rating for the staff Finally the breakfast is about as bog standard as it comes You ll get better food around the corner for half the price ,No Positive

260961,Rochester Champs Elysees, 1 The limited options of the breakfast buffet 2 The room rate was a bit expensive compared to the provided facilities 3 They didn t serve me a welcome drink as I am entitled for it as a genius on booking com , 1 The location of hotel near to Champs Elysees street by walk around 5 minutes or less 2 The long duration of breakfast serving from 7 00 to 14 00 very smart idea 3 Very close to Saint Philippe du Roule metro station by less than 2 minutes 4 Easily you can connect to the Internet without neither password nor username 5 my classic room was specious and nice

260971,Rochester Champs Elysees, The room and bed are quite small We had a room viewing the street and at night it got very very loud so that there was no way you could sleep Another thing that wasn t very pleasant was the fact that the cleaning lady would knock on our door every morning at 7 30 8 am for maintenance , Location Clean preety rooms Helpful staff at front desk
