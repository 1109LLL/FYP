55265,Le Marquis Eiffel, The breakfast was expensive, We loved the location the pet birds in the lobby the clean and chic room the restauarants that were available for room service and the very helpful and friendly staff 
55266,Le Marquis Eiffel, The breakfast was very poor very few fresh products sticky floor not appealing nor tasty food , The setting is perfect only 5 minutes fro the Eiffel Tower between 2 metro lines
55267,Le Marquis Eiffel, breakfast quite expensive for the small amount on offer , Rooms very spacious clean and comfortable bed Quiet street so not much traffic noise Not much of a selection at breakfast but what was there was tasty Very pleasant staff 
55268,Le Marquis Eiffel, The wifi could have been a little better , This was a very nice hotel They made us feel very welcome here I had asked for the room with a view of the Eiffel Tower since we were going to be there on my birthday and they gave it to me I had already known it was not going to be a full view from the other reviews I read but I didn t care this was our first time In Paris and I wanted it to be nice We were gone all day the day of my birthday and when we returned there was a bottle of champagne waiting in the room for me and a card signed by the staff I did not expect that The walk was not far from the Eiffel Tower and it was nice to get to see it light up every night from our room Lots of nice eateries in the area and a wonderful pastry shop next door 
55269,Le Marquis Eiffel, We arrived at the hotel on the hottest day in Paris The air conditioning in our room and the entire hotel was out The staff would not make eye contact when we inquired and only kept saying that someone will be out here soon to fix it It was a miserable stay and the staff did not even try to bring fans or ice buckets or accommodate us at all I wish we had moved hotels when we had the chance ,No Positive
55270,Le Marquis Eiffel, The receptionist did not inform us that the beverages in the room is free of charge and the elevator is sort of tight , The location is wonderful the size of the room and the bathroom The bed is comfy as well 
55271,Le Marquis Eiffel, The quality of the breakfast was pathetic Not enough variety There was no need to have full pate of kiwi fruit, The lady at the reception was very courteaous balcony was nice Had their been flowers in the balcony pot it would have given a wonderful view

55275,Le Marquis Eiffel, The crib for the baby didn t have any sheets Our bed wasn t big enough nor very comfortable Nice hotel but not what you would expect for a 4 hotel, Location amenities and attentiveness of the staff
55276,Le Marquis Eiffel, A restaurant for guest in the hotel to experience a fine French dinning instead of going out would be great in the future , My wife and my first time to see France and wanted to have a special anniversary to remember Very warm and friendly staff Very clean room and comfortable bed Amenities were just a walking distance Museums Cathedrals Eiffel tower Restaurants Shopping the big bus 
55277,Le Marquis Eiffel, Nothing , The facility was awesome and the staff was great Everyone was super helpful and would go out of their way to make sure everything around our stay was the best it could be 
55278,Le Marquis Eiffel, There was nothing that i didnt like about the hotel everything was perfect , The breakfast was awesome the room and bed was so comfy everything was awesome 
55279,Le Marquis Eiffel, The layout of the shower was a little strange because there wasn t a shelf for hair products and soap Other than that it was great , Staff were very helpful and friendly Great location Great price 
55280,Le Marquis Eiffel, The rooms need a refurb to match the modern vibe in the lobby They look a bit dated , The staff were SO HELPFUL and we got free champagne on arrival as it was my boyfriends birthday very nice touch
55281,Le Marquis Eiffel, Pillow is hard like a rubber ball , Nice Hermes amenities Located in nice Parisean residential neighbourhood just a stone s throw from the Eiffel Tower 
55282,Le Marquis Eiffel, My bathroom had an old school bathtub I prefer the modern walk in showers but other than that all was great , Everything was great here Bed was comfortable it was quiet major great location supermarket right ascross the street for cheap eats bus right near by to go to and from Orly airport The staff was super nice the decor nice too 
55283,Le Marquis Eiffel,No Negative, We love this neighborhood in Paris and Hotel Marquis is somewhere we definitely will come back for and recommend our friends Even though I checked in 2 days after my birthday they gave me a nice bottle of champagne and a nice note They actually wrote my name in chinese characters what a pleasant surprise The tower is just steps away lots of restaurants nearby and there is local market on sunday Really nice area to explore real Parisian life 
55284,Le Marquis Eiffel,No Negative, excellent hotel would recommend to anyone who would be close to the Eiffel Tower yet in a quiet street Exceptionally clean the staff is ready to help you with everything excellent breakfast 
55285,Le Marquis Eiffel, rate too high and should have included breakfast which on its own is too expensive for what it is 18 , very helpful staff and excellent location and good wifi for free
55286,Le Marquis Eiffel, Recomandation ONLY I recomanded the managmement to provide bottles of water on the room bar better than the soft drinks as the soft drinks are free of charged , Everything s was great We enjoyed our stay with them and diffidently we will be back soon 
55287,Le Marquis Eiffel, Nothing it was excellent , The service was excellent staff very friendly we were upgraded to an executive suite which was a nice surprise Eugenia was very helpful booking our tickets for hop on hop off bus and explaining tourist attractions on a map nothing was too much trouble We had a mobile phone to use while we stayed at the hotel compliments from Le Marquis it had city mapper on it which helped us get to our destinations Hotel was located in a quiet street with some great cafes and a super market handy It was close to the train line we found it easy to get to from the airport Would definitely stay here again it was lovely 
55288,Le Marquis Eiffel, Walls are not soundproof and can slightly hear other guests in other rooms but other than that everything was superb and very close to the Eiffel tower with very nice staff ,No Positive
55289,Le Marquis Eiffel, The location was not bad but can t see view of Eiffel tower even bit The maid didn t fill out the mini bar in the room we have to call reception almost everyday , They give us all a glass of Champaign to Celebrate New Year before everyone going out to Count down Love it 
55290,Le Marquis Eiffel, The shower is in the bath tub This is really bad , One of the best hotels in this area a bit pricy but worth it Great bed with fether duvet and pillow The oroducts in hhe bathroom are exclusive The breakfast is very expensive but fresh ingrediens with high quality Freshly pressed juice 
55291,Le Marquis Eiffel, Wifi speed was poor Street noise from supermarket opposite early morning for front facing rooms , Tempted to keep this quiet not a pretty location but interesting and very convenient for work and leisure with helpful front desk people and a major city rarity a good sized room with quality facilities 
55292,Le Marquis Eiffel, The hotel has birds in the lobby and it gets dirty around and is not cleaned They should clean more carefully the hotel corridors also , Good location 
55293,Le Marquis Eiffel, The stairs alternative to the lift were very dangerous Wi Fi Connection slow Car Park very expensive , The room has everything we need it s all very clean and organised The staff is Kind and always available to help 
55294,Le Marquis Eiffel, Nothing, Eugenia at the front desk was awesome and so helpful There was a market right across the street which was perfect The hotel was only about a 15 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower 
55295,Le Marquis Eiffel, One day they forgot to clean my brother s room never understood why The room and bathroom were really cleaned sheets and towels changed everyday however the WC brush was really dirty when I arrived and there was always some kind of faint urine smell near the toilet so that created some uneasiness every time I had to go to there I did report it and someone went right away to try to fix the problem but it never really went away I wondered the whole time if they did not use some cleaning cloth on the toilet and elsewhere maybe on the walls I don t know So I became afraid to use the drinking glasses and stuff Thus the reason I did not give a better rating on cleanliness You have to go to the whole process of reconnecting to wifi everytime your computer or telephone goes to sleep which was very annoying especially that some times it will take time to find the connection But once you are connected the wifi worked well , The rooms were nicely decorated and of a good size for Paris Mattress pillows and sheets were of excellent quality The hotel generally made a successful effort on decoration the toiletries by Hermes were a real pleasure and a good choice The staff is very professional friendly and always prompt to help I did not like everything however from what I could tell by the way this hotel is managed I am pretty sure they will look at my complaint and fix the problem so I 100 recommend this hotel
55296,Le Marquis Eiffel, Room wasn t sound proof Had to call reception to notify them that at around 2AM the other room was really loud even if they were just talking to each other The price didn t include breakfast though but you can buy from nearby stores outside , Loved everything There s a grocery store in front of the hotel book shop and bakery beside the hotel Just a few minutes walk to the Eiffel Tower The hotel room was really clean To top it all we were given free wine for our honeymoon Extremely love this hotel and will definitely refer to my friends 
55297,Le Marquis Eiffel,No Negative, This boutique hotel was in a fantastic location 5 min walk from awesome restaurants and the Eiffell tower The staff went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable As we were a group travelling we really loved the courtyard area that was available to us for meeting up and relaxing together Thank you so much for an unforgettable stay

55300,Le Marquis Eiffel, The wifi is not good , The hotel was very nice the bedroom was clean and a decent size for a Paris hotel executive Nice bathroom except the bath thumb didn t have a curtain or sliding glass door so water splashed Great location and not in a touristy location which we loved

55305,Le Marquis Eiffel, Checkout was slow when I left Hotel has one reception desk and the customer ahead of me took ages to be served Corridor in the morning was quite loud as I was distrubed by people slaming doors and loud talking shouting Whilst the rooms and reception are very well maintained the corridors leading to the rooms are probably in need of some cosmeric redecoration at least the floor I was on floor 3 None of these criticisms however would put me of staying again which I will soon , Reception staff were very helpful and friendly both at check in and check out Reception area leaves a good first impression My room was nice large clean and was in good conditon Bed comfortable Bathroom was clean Excellent location as quite close to metro station Will come back

55308,Le Marquis Eiffel, the hotel as most of Paris hotels is very small I sometimes come back at 5 pm and the room wasn t cleaned yet No drawers in the room , The location is absolutely amazing the staff is so friendly the bed is comfy and the room is clean as it shows in the pictures I liked the bath products too

55313,Le Marquis Eiffel, I think the room price should include the breakfast anything else is perfect , Great service nearby the eiffel tower and the front desk is sooooooo kind he is cool and borrow us the french charger and when we left he helps us to call the taxi and the cleaner is kind too she gave us the gift of the easter About the r o o m the room is very clean and comfortable althought the room is not very big but it is enough the tea the coffee is free and the bathroom is amazing hot water comes quickly and the light is so bright all in all I m sure I will choose this hotel again when I come to Paris next time thanks to everyone of this hotel to give us such a wonderful experience Merci
