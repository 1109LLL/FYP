349369,Gran Hotel Barcino, You can only buy coffee in the vending machine it s not very good Late check in 14 00 No good cosmetics in the bathroom just simple shower gel , Great location The beds very comfortable 
349370,Gran Hotel Barcino, We would have liked tea coffee machine in the room The bathroom shower needs attention , This is a great location lots of places around to eat in very good tapas bar next door Lots of narrow alleys to explore very close to Barcelonas catheradal and near Metro The room was comfortable but we were at the front and there was noise until midnight Ac really good and quiet 
349371,Gran Hotel Barcino, There was a lot of noise at night and also the hotel had a strange smell inside due to its ancient furnitures maybe But it was close to the center and the metro ,No Positive
349372,Gran Hotel Barcino, Window does not close properly so a lot of noise from outside travels through to inside the room and could not sleep well There are 2 euro per night for security box , Location was nice for walking around Gothic Quarter 
349373,Gran Hotel Barcino, Bath was old and grubby I put a Shirt in for ironing at 10 15am the cut off time for that day was 10 30am it should of bin back to the Hotel for 7pm it never arived back till 8 15pm I had a table booked at a Tapas bar for 7 30pm wich I lost my advise is don t use this service, Location
349374,Gran Hotel Barcino, Stuff was not friendly nor effective nor responsible the room was really small the shower gel shampoo was not added after one day of stay and the quantity of if at the beginning was very small , Location
349375,Gran Hotel Barcino, Lots of outdated hardware Elevator a bit rickety dark corridir lights as you advance along but too slowly Bed covers looked shabby felt prickly had some holes in them A missing corner in a floor tile Room 403 But top of the negatives was the hardly lukewarm water in the shower my 12yo wouldn t have it so went unshowered to the airport , Location was the best attribute of the Barcino no doubt Ramblas Gothic quarter Wham bang center of everything 100m to a Metro station buses port 
349376,Gran Hotel Barcino, No drinking water no tooth brash no lotion very old shower towels uncomfortable bed very bad and old blankets without cover no slippers no kettle no glasses no soundproofing dark corridors no climate control It s not at all like 4 stars hotel , The location
349377,Gran Hotel Barcino, Hotel internet was very bad the rooms are very very hot the rooms are very dark no sunshine comes ever In the toilet we saw 2 insects the stuff of hotel is not so kind I can only say good words for this hotel is the location unfotunately I am not advicing this hotel ,No Positive
349378,Gran Hotel Barcino, Staff again some of the people working there should probably do something else unfriendly and kind of arrogant also if you work in the reception don t stand in the entrance and smoke Kind of basic hotel dosen t feels like 4 stars, Helpful staff specially the cleaning staff
349379,Gran Hotel Barcino, I was forced to pay for a breakfast more than I had Due to booking made on 2 vouchers paid by 2 different creditcards The breakfast was paid on one voucher but could only be used that day not the next This is not a Hotel with any etics or it is very poorly managed or mayby in financial trouble since they must trick their guests like this They get their money for booking com but it is lost for the guest because it was on the wrong voucher Don t book in this hotel ,No Positive
349380,Gran Hotel Barcino, Curtains need to be darker to block light and sound out Steps down to my room with heavy suitcases not great , Comfy bed location amazing right near Barcelona festival and the mall and market 
349381,Gran Hotel Barcino, The breakfast could be more fresh like coffee could be man made and not from machine fresh orange juice etc , We liked our twin room with the private terrace at the top
349382,Gran Hotel Barcino, Nothing good really in the hotel plenty of good breakfast places around the area Smelly room noicy hotel got their stars probably 20 years ago when they did the last renovation I wouldn t book it again , great location that s all
349383,Gran Hotel Barcino, A To reach the lift we need to use stairs With big suitcase was not easy Nobody help us B The clima was out of order even after we inform them C The windows balcony door was simply so we heard all outside noise we feel that we sleep in the street D The payment was made 100 one day before arrival All fees must be pay at arrival Is unusual when they heve as guaranti my credit card , The fact that is in center not far from Rambla 
349384,Gran Hotel Barcino, Hotel is less than its star rating Extremely poor customer service I got charged twice and went through hell to get a refund The rooms are just okay with a lot of ants , Very close to the metro Jaume I 
349385,Gran Hotel Barcino, Staff during evening and nightime unfriendly Wifi mentioned doesn t work Bathroom sinks stucked didn t even say sorry nor didn t fix it, Location only
349386,Gran Hotel Barcino, The work of hotel personal are bad organised and not professional especially by job handover They gave keys of a room to different guestes on same day and doubt the guest entered wrong room They didn t have apologise and were impolite The room were not cleaned in time ,No Positive
349387,Gran Hotel Barcino, Decor very very outdated something from the 80 s Breakfast awful and inedible Very noisy during the night , Beds are comfortable It s a very central location 
349388,Gran Hotel Barcino, It look 20 mins to check in cause the guy at desk was barely moving and picked his nose while checking us in The room was meant to be 2 singles but we got a double and were told we had no choice but we had booked 2 singles The room was really dated and just unkept The bed was just disgusting and smelly The room had no air con and no tv signal Overall a terrible hotel and should be removed from booking Com, Nothing was really poor hotel 
349389,Gran Hotel Barcino, Everything But more specifically the room smelled horrible when we arrived It was a hot day and after failing to figure out how to turn on the air conditioning which is promised as an amenity we asked the staff to help us They were very rude and told us there could be no air conditioning until next month We tried to make the room comfortable by opening the window but it was still very hot and the sounds of the city were obnoxious This hotel should not be listed as a place to do business with on booking com or any other site , The only thing we liked was the relief we felt when we escaped to another hotel after a sleepless and horrible night at this place 
349390,Gran Hotel Barcino,No Negative, The staff was arrogant since the moment we arrive till we left The windows are not soundproof so at night its very noisy Bad wifi Conditions of the room don t match to a 4 star hotel Tv only had 4 Spannish channels the rest didn t had a signal The location is good
349391,Gran Hotel Barcino, I asked not to charge the credit card before arriving in order to pay in cash This was an option given during the booking process The hotel charged the credit card before I arrived, perfect location
349392,Gran Hotel Barcino, Very unpleasant experience dingy rooms and moldy bathrooms holes in curtains window which can not be closed Very loud noise from outside No real willingness to help from staff Poor breakfast no vegetables only paprika , nice surrounding near Subway
349393,Gran Hotel Barcino, We booked a triple room and it was basically just a twin room with a camp bed squeezed in Wasn t a major issue as it was just somewhere to sleep but the beds were pretty much joined together with a narrow space to walk round Not too bad but wouldn t go out of my to stay there again , The location is fantastic And the staff were all lovely and helpful Breakfast was okay but nothing special It was clean enough but I wouldn t describe as 4 star 
349394,Gran Hotel Barcino, Worst hotel experience i had first of all the room was filthy dirty floor ugly smell and never cleaned under the matress i work as a hotel manager and i know where to look to bad for them very poor customer service with untrained staff i was double charged for the stay so i had to deal with booking com to get my money back they even told that i was lying but luckly i kept the receipt Anyway very inconfortable stay pillows felt like rocks the bedding was damp and probably from previous stay for the price i paid of 65 euro you wouldn expect much but the staff was so rude and i never get an apology for the double charge n my opinion booking com should stop making bussinnes with this hotel, Location
349395,Gran Hotel Barcino, At the time of the booking we were promised a room of a certain size and standard Upon arrival we were given the smallest room ever with the window facing a narrow shaft Hardly any day light Except for the twin bed there was not enough space to unpack the suitcases I had to make a lot of fuss to get a new room of the agreed size and standard , The location of the hotel 
349396,Gran Hotel Barcino, The hotel was under construction The room we got was in the 6th floor while the 5th floor was closed and right beneath our room s window there was drilling knocking and generally a lot of noise during early morning hours up until 5 30 pm So we couldn t take a nap from time to time when we needed it I have to add that when I ordered the room from booking they didn t mention that the hotel was under construction When I asked the receptionist what can be done about it he said I m sorry but I have nothing to do It will last for 2 more days Of course the construction works didn t end but continued all week Also I wouldn t recommend taking a room with a double bed since it was a back breaking experience , The location of the hotel is very convenient 
349397,Gran Hotel Barcino, It was hard to find the hair dryer it was in a drawer that looked like a towel rack and the shampoo soap etc was very small There was a door stopper in the floor which was by the luggage bench so every time you went to your luggage you stubbed your toe plus no US plugs the hotel did supply 1 adapter for our use , The room was very clean the location was perfect 
349398,Gran Hotel Barcino, Hotel is good but I paid twice First I paid after arrival later my credit card was charged Management informed but they deny Require invoice immediately ,No Positive
349399,Gran Hotel Barcino, Old furniture and d cor Squeaky bed No mini bar Noise from the street Miscommunication over breakfast We had paid for breakfast on booking the room but were refused entry as on the hotel records breakfast was excluded for our stay But we spoke to the receptionist and finally we were allowed to eat , Location and friendly chamber maid 
349400,Gran Hotel Barcino, Dreadful place Was traveling with two grown sons and had requested three beds First room they put us in had two poor beds and a very sad cot Ceiling was low and A C was close to non existent Phone didn t initially work Wifi didn t work in that area of the property Asked to be moved but had to wait until second day to be moved in slightly better room with still terrible third bed Better wifi but still poor A C In both rooms we literally moved all of the furniture to put my poor middle aged head directly until the A C vent so that I d survive Desk staff mostly unpleasant bordering on surly Not particularly clean including water stained ceiling tiles and rust stains Tiles need grout and too few towels which were slightly raggedy and scratchy How many characters do I get because I can go on Spent part of one night in lobby just because of the A C Fold out chair that functioned a third bed shaped like a child s roller coast ups and downs When we checked out there was no one at the desk found our own taxi My son only told me on the last day that his sheets had sand in them sand from him but they didn t bother to change , Good location 
349401,Gran Hotel Barcino, The payment was deducted from my debit card before I arrived which was not pay later as I thought it was Secondly there is a damp smell when you enter the lobby Also the bed covers are not appealing, Very well located in the city centre making it easy to visit the areas of interest
