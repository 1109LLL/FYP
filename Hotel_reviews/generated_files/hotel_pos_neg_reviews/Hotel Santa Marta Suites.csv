487188,Hotel Santa Marta Suites,No Negative, A nice terrasse on the 6th floor with a view over Milano Good ap ritif there Beautiful decoration and high comfort room with a sweet expresso machine Great breakfast although a bit expensive but wonderful room PERFECT location In summer heat we enjoyed the air conditionned room 
487189,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Slight miscommunication with waiter in the santa Martha restaurant Despite that very good food , Facilities were excellent Beautiful refurbished former Palazzo Staff in Hotel incl Manager very attentative Strongly recommendable 
487190,Hotel Santa Marta Suites,No Negative, The staff was extremely pleasant and desiring to assist in any smallest question The suite we got was fantastic with two bathrooms I would definitely return to Santa Marta Suites 
487191,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, We were on the 5th floor top and unfortunately our air conditioner struggled to get the room temperature down to a comfortable level Lighting in the bathroom was poor especially if you were applying make up The foam mattress was past it s best as it had a large dip in it on one side The carpet in the elevator needs replacing sooner than later as it did not look that clean and seemed to have a bad odour to it , Generally staff were very friendly and helpful A very delightful boutique hotel which is in easy walking distance to many major attractions and shops A great restaurant and staff to go with it 
487192,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Nothing we had a delightful visit , Small boutique hotel in central location Family hotel Excellent staff friendly and very helpful Delightful roof terrace great for evening meals and a direct view of Duomo Gret breakfast and restaurant Many restaurants and bars close by A historic site st almost very turn Close public transport We loved being close to Duomo La Scala and Galleria 
487193,Hotel Santa Marta Suites,No Negative, What a fantastic find in the heart of Milan The location is great walking distance to all the major sights shopping and train stations The rooms are elegant clean and comfortable and the public rooms are interesting and quirky Have cocktails or dinner on the terrazzo and enjoy the breathtaking view of The Duomo Chef Stefano Urso treated us to off menu Italian delights and wonderful signature dishes make sure you try the molto deliziosa cotoletta alla Milanese All the staff were super friendly and so helpful night and day Thank you Lucca Sara Ruggiero and Francesca for going the extra mile to make us feel at home in your lovely hotel 
487194,Hotel Santa Marta Suites,No Negative, Stayed only one night and wish it could have been more Room was very spacious and bed extremely comfortable The bathroom was clean and spacious Staff very helpful with travel and where to go shopping and where to eat Great inexpensive coffee bar on the corner 
487195,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, The facility may still be breaking in its digital sensor based electronics Thus lights shut down in stair wells while the room air conditioning had to be reset on the second night after a warm first night stay All of this is fixable but it is best that management is aware of the issue , Conveniently located in the center city within walking distance to the Duomo as well as Milan shopping areas Well appointed rooms with antique furnishings and a friendly helpful staff 
487196,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, No complaints , The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful with taxis luggage storage finding locations to mail packages home etc the hotel is finely decorated and has an excellent rooftop terrace with a great view which can be used for meals as well as drinks and relaxation Small number of very nice rooms Location is close to the Duomo the underground lines and particularly the Via Dante pedestrian mall for dining and shopping The location is just out of the way enough to make it private and special 
487197,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Breakfast not included and if consumed on the terrace there is an additional room service charge Stuff although friendly at times are not on top of things left without towels overnight when asked to book a restaurant not informed of the booking until 15mins before the actual time of the reservation and even that after a repeated inquiry ironing service not available after 3pm , Location great historical building exceptional decor
487198,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, zero, Faultless service location room comfort and meals The chef even came out to our table and explained his menu and how he had hand picked the ingredients at market They have a magnificent roof top terrace for dinner or cocktails The most amazingly comfortable bed we have ever slept in It was like staying with family The staff could not have been more helpful and hospitable Always happy and helpful It is an easy 4 min walk to Domo and Milan s main Tour operator Zani Viaggi is an easy 10 minute walk A casual Pizza restaurant is just across the quiet laneway If you want the authentic Italian experience this beautiful small hotel will not disappoint We will be back 
487199,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Hotel and Surrounds not quite as glanerous in the real Very expensive for what you get and they have the cheek to charge 20 each for continental breakfast hot food extra Also very noisy at night bar at end of laneway and bin recycling trucks right under your balcony very early in morning Again a big negative not allowing guests to iron own clothes fire risk although every other country we have visited this is standard room facilities , Reception staff and restaurant staff lovely and alway helpful
487200,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, I could not work out the heating system, All the rooms were very individual and and tastefully decorated We were offered an upgrade to a suite for an extra 50 Euro
487201,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Stairway to roof is winding metal and pretty hard to navigate but worth the climb for the panoramic view of Milano , We had reserved a room but took the suite when offered Large with beautiful furnishings and totally modern bath Service impeccable and amenities perfect 
487202,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Nothing it was perfect , Everything We received a free upgrade to a lovely suite grazie Luca The accommodation is perfectly placed in a quiet street within a stone s throw of the Duomo Spotlessly clean with a lovely rooftop terrace The staff were kind and charming Would return in a heartbeat 
487203,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, The other half of the stuff the bold guy said that broken wardrobe is part of the design non working safe box is that we can t read the instruction the need to leave a key at the entrance broken window locks short bed view , Location half of the staff lady was extremely nice and helpfull 
487204,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Bit overpriced Pictures of the lobby do not correspond to reality or at least not to the expectation they create, Centrally located Friendly personnel Clean and comfortable
487205,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, The room was baking hot and no way of controlling the temperature However we called reception and they adjusted it , Decor was so quaint and charming Staff knowledgable and friendly 
487206,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Nothing negative , Immaculate hotel beautifully decorated friendly helpful and welcoming staff central to everything you want to see but quiet and serene Go visit and stay here 
487207,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, photos and information on booking com website did not match the room assigned and this even if the staff said the contrary the bedroom window overlooked the lift we had to ask for another room a suite because all other rooms overlook the elevator for which there was a charge of 50 euro per night around 6 00 in the morning we were awakened by loud noises garbage trucks works the behavior of the staff was only apparently polite H tel not recommended POST SCRIPTUM I would like to thank Booking com for giving me the opportunity of this post scriptum This refers to the reaction of the hotel to my negative comment I never said as affirmed in the above mentioned reaction that suites are regular rooms for us politicians In fact I am not a politician Most probably the hotel confused me with another client Regards , Position
487208,Hotel Santa Marta Suites,No Negative, I will definately stay there when I go to Milan Very nice warm atmosphere and always smiling and helpful employees Specially we have to thank the manager Luca you can understand he is passionate about his job and dealing with every detail to make comfortable We didn t eat in the hotel I will review food at the end of march hopefully
487209,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Terrible mattresses my wife could not sleep all the night Noise from hotel ventillation system Poor breakfast Booking policy non refundable for the whole period , Location 5 min by step from centre Duomo 
487210,Hotel Santa Marta Suites,No Negative, This is the best hotel I have ever stayed in Great suite lovely staff and near to the main attractions In particular I was impressed with how the manager dealt with a very obnoxious man complaining about a triviality when he was dealing with three other clients He would have been justified in telling the incredibly rude man to foxtroct oscor Instead he dealt with the situation with great decorum and professionalism Next time we go to the Opera we will be staying here 
487211,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Internet was non existent The room we got was overlooking a dark and narrow courtyard , Location and the staff Alessandro was very nice and professional Beautiful view from the rooftop terrace that would be great to hang out at during spring and summer 
487212,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Congestion pricing is in effect on weekdays Luckily we were there on a Saturday and Sunday morning Last time I was in Milan I ended up with 2 tickets driving into the regulated zone by accident 45 euros , They upgraded us to a lovely suite on the top floor We had to leave a little to early to try their breakfast Parking is expensive 27 euro for about 17 hours 
487213,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Our room was right next to the elevator I could hear it going up and down with people chatting all night I didn t sleep In addition there is an automatic fluorescent light in the bathroom that can not be turned off So the bathroom door must be kept closed since any tiny bit of movement will turn the light on Even rolling over in your bed turns this obnoxious light on , Comfortable beds and a maginificent patterned Parquet floor made the room appealing even though there was no view The reception was enthusiastic and welcoming and couldn t have been more helpful and lovely Except I had prepaid for breakfast for two and unfortunately I had not calculated that I would have to leave for the airport before breakfast had begun I wish they had been willing to offer a refund or some kind of compensation like a piece of fruit and coffee 
487214,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Location of bathroom switch is difficult to find behind the door there is also a sensor that turns it on automatically but it also turns it off in the middle of the shower so make sure you pay attention to the instructions on where the switch is at check in Staff is very friendly but not receptive to positive suggestions for improvement such as better location for the bathroom switch or a written sign They also seem obsessed with pushing you into putting in a good review and can make you miss your train listening to suggestions would help much more for a good review rather than arguing why they think they are right but overall a great place and I will go back for sure, Room was fantastic so romantic and cozy
487215,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, My girlfriend and I had requested a twin bed and the hotel confirmed we were getting one before we arrived Once there they gave us a room with a queed bed and a little bed in the hall at the entrance of the room The bed was clearly designed for a couple traveling with a child When lying on the bed are legs did not fit in the bed We complained to the manager and the owner and both insisted we got what we had requested We found out from another employee that in fact they had rooms with twin beds but ours was given to someone else The owner was rude and not accepting of their error The rooms are expensive and you would expect a better approach with dealing with customer dissatisfaction , Location
487216,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, if you go for the great food of the restaurant ask the waiter always for the price without this they will serve you the best which is obviously always the highest priced wine or dish , Very friendly staff who gave us a very enjoyable good service Cosy terrace on the top floor of the hotel typical Italian restaurant perfect 
487217,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, The only low point and this was minor was that the heat was not controlled in the room For us 24 is too warm So we had to call down to have it reduced each day , Alex in reception was particularly helpful and courteous The hotel was a beautiful blend of old world charm and modern facility 
487218,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, We couldn t figure out how to control the temperature in our room so we were hot at night The bed was a little hard I generally like a hard bed , Staff was super super nice and helpful The location is very convenient and the room and bathroom were very nice 
487219,Hotel Santa Marta Suites,No Negative, It s all about the suite on the 4th floor and Trattoria Milanese across the street Lovely quiet side street terrific staff excellent bedding Gorgeous room It s my spot in Milan from now on 
487220,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, If anything could be better maybe a hot meal for breakfast, The servive at the desk was excellent and helpful All over The rooms and the roof terasse gave us the little extra after long day of walking 
487221,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, I wish our double room wasn t so dark as it is not possible to have a window to the street but the ambience of the room still made it worth it If you can afford it get a suite There is more light Next time We will be back here , This is a gorgeous small hotel beautifully decorated in Italianate style with a bit of modern mixed in Amazing rooftop lounge with a panoramic view of the Duomo and all Milan I loved our stay here The staff was extremely accommodating with everything It is located off a tiny street in the historic center which also makes it quiet at night 
487222,Hotel Santa Marta Suites,No Negative, Superb friendly attentive staff throughout the hotel and restaurant The front desk staff were especially helpful with specific sightseeing and restaurant suggestions Their beds and pillows were by far the most comfortable of any Italian hotel in which I stayed 
487223,Hotel Santa Marta Suites,No Negative, Everything was divine I have been upgraded to a Suite The staff was amazing from the reception desk to the room service High quality service Breakfast is excellent Lots of taste in the decoration Classic decoration with a touch of modern art Amazing roof terrasse I highly recommend this hotel 
487224,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Only a fancy coffee machine in room charged per pod Would like to see Free Tea and coffee making facility , Great staff Roof top restaraunt excellent with good food and service Breakfast very good a variety of goodies Great location Would stay again 
487225,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, The air conditioning was inadequate and it was quite hot when we were there so that was the one downside , The location is terrific and quiet The restaurant was excellent especially the opportunity to sit on the rooftop and enjoy the night air and the views over Milan 
487226,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, See above, Air con poor Breakfast a bit odd Didn t offer a cooked option until another couple asked and so they asked us as well We upgraded to a suite but it was a disabled setup so not perfect for us Waste of money
487227,Hotel Santa Marta Suites,No Negative, Great location very friendly small hotel And a brilliant little roof terrace The attention to detail and service make you feel at home instantly Will be back again and again
487228,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Lighting on roof terrace could be adjusted to work better for diners As it is it shines down either in people s eyes or casting shadows Otherwise lovely experience , A lovely unusual property with high level of design including what looked like Gio Ponti chairs in our beautiful suite fifth floor Excellent staff Fantastic location Luca the manager was a wonderful host We did eat on the roof terrace and the food was better than we d anticipated I wish we d have had more than one night 
487229,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Couples things unfortunately mediocre check in misleading information regarding the address of an open air market no food menu was offered on the roof even though it was said to be an option worst was motion detectors lights turning themselves off while showering Good luck getting out the shower in the complete dark so that the lights turn back on overall many distressing details for the price that force me to write this review which is very unusual for me , Very nice rooftop view vue sur la terrace du toit
487230,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, It didn t bother us but if somebody wants a nice view from their room beware that our room nr 1 was facing the small but nicely arranged courtyard The air conditioner is placed at the bottom instead in the upper half of the room As it was very hot 36 degrees Celsius it didn t cool down suffiently Also whenever you leave the room the electricity is cut off and so is the air conditioner The room though stayed cool , It was our first time in Milano and we chose the Santa Maria Suites due to it s central location The welcome was very friendly thanks to the staff who were all very helpful They all spoke very goog English Our room was spacious and clean Only the air conditioner was a little insufficient as it was very hot The highlight though was the rooftop terrace and it s view overlooking the surrounding area and the Milano Duomo We didn t bother to look for a restaurant in the evening but chose to stay home in our hotel and were served very good dinners both evenings on the terrace But beware although you are in the middle of a city nature strikes an about 9 30 p m when little flies invaded and stung but with a good anti mosquito spray bring your own the problem was solved easily When we will visit Milano again we will surely come back 
487231,Hotel Santa Marta Suites,No Negative, Location you can t ask better 3 min walk to the Dome or Metro The Suite was exceptional Proper designer boutique suite with lots of Vintage details and very modern as well Spacious and exceptional clean Will definitely come back and will recommend to everybody Especially I wanted to tell about the stuff which is very friendly polite good mannered proper professionals Explained how when and where to go in the town even draw it on a map 
487232,Hotel Santa Marta Suites,No Negative, We were upgraded to a suite for free The bed were very comfy and the bathroom was very nice and clean The staff was also very friendly and supportive But all this is to be expected for this price 
487233,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, The hotel is in a bit of a construction area temporary no doubt but that should not deter anyone A short walk in any direction easily allows exploring of the city The ONLY thing I thought could be improved was to replenish the coffee capsules each day The second day there was no coffee in the room in the morning Very minor change can fix that with no problem , The hotel was extremely nice Perfect location and amazingly helpful staff The dinner on the roof terrace was completely worth it We were able to check in early and the front desk even offered coffee and water while we waited Very much first class treatment 
487234,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Breakfast could be in the room price, Beautiful hotel in city centre very quite considering location where is situated Great personnel very helpful and pleasent 
487235,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Lighting in bathroom could be improved , Excellent hotel Small but very comfortable and quiet Staff very helpful and friendly Aperitifs on the roof terrace not to be missed lovely view of the Duomo from the terrace Rooms very clean and nice comfortable bed Very central great location 
487236,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Extra charge to reserve breakfast of the rooftop , Extremely nice and helpful staff Luka was above excellent Beautiful rooftop The beds were very comfortable we did not want to get up 
487237,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Broken coffee machine Lack of free large bottle of water every day which you would really expect, Location Style of interiors Food in restaurant Excellent staff Quality of towels
487238,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Nothing, The staff were wonderful couldn t do enough for you The place is full of character The rooms are lovely Just one thing we came back hoping to sit on the terrace and it was closed due to a private party It would have bee good to have known that before hand 
487239,Hotel Santa Marta Suites,No Negative, Very helpful and friendly staff excellent location close to the main attractions in central Milan very comfortable and clean It also has a very good restaurant 
487240,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, The lighting in the rooms are very dim , The property is very interesting and the staff very friendly Rooms were immaculately clean On a side street away from the crowds but still a great location 
487241,Hotel Santa Marta Suites,No Negative, Fantastic hotel and great location The staff was welcoming and very helpful Nice breakfast buffet I can warmly recommend this hotel for Milano visitors 
487242,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Nothing, Great location Really friendly staff speaking excellent English They really couldn t do enough for us Fabulous room we upgraded to a suite and it was well worth it Lovely breakfast good coffee and plenty of choice You must have an Aperol Spritz on the terrace yummy snacks too 
487243,Hotel Santa Marta Suites,No Negative, A great centrally located hotel in Milan close to a couple of metro stops and open 24hrs The staff were extremely helpful and welcoming and the rooms were spacious and comfortable There s also a terrace on the roof where you can view the skyline and an embedded restaurant Also there s free wifi 
487244,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, We booked a double room with king size bed and we noticed that the bed was done by two single beds linked together which moved all night it was very inconfortable for sleeping They have 10 rooms totally and only 2 of them have properly king size bed even 3 suites have this problem , Location design of the hotel staff very nice terrace placed in a very quiet are
487245,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Overly noisy fridge that woke us up in night Simple answer switch it off Small gripe for a wonderful place , Wonderful design genuinely friendly staff great breakfast fantastic location in centre of Milan but on a quiet street Perfect 
487246,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Avoid room 5 this has entire hotel air con units above it is noisy Air con might disappoint those looking for US type coldness , Very friendly staff fantastic central location walking distance to many sights shopping large bedroom Nice bathrooms Hotel has 5 suites 5 bedrooms The bedrooms have external lift outside one window which is v unsightly but not noisy 
487247,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, When we first checked in we were taken to our room and it was described as being small and not very comfortable It also had an internal window so was claustrophobic but if we paid 50 euros more we could upgrade to a suite I felt pressured into doing this and thought this was a bit cheeky In the suite you had to pay for water and coffee so it was all a bit of a rip off The restaurant did not have any atmosphere and the service was very slow , The bed was very comfy and the location was excellent approximately a 10 mins walk to the main shopping area and Cathedral 
487248,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, breakfest is poor and very expensive better to eat outside , its in the center of the center relay good location beautiful hotel unique design very friendly stuff we loved our stay there 
487249,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Perhaps not everyone would find the combination of a older style building with some of the modern touches just so but this a matter of taste and not a gripe I didn t find it easily with the booking com map the street its on being not obvious to me anyway, A more bespoke offering than the standard corporate hotel even though those can be very good in Milan Quality of bathrooms high The connecting breakfast and dinner restaurant very convenient Staff extremely helpful and efficient
487250,Hotel Santa Marta Suites,No Negative, The location was perfect close to city centre but the street was very authentic and very calm Very friendly and helpful stuff We were upgraded to suite for a reasonable price and it was charming and spacious 
487251,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Having to pay for the in room coffee pods and tea bags , Everything Facilities were excellent and the location was even better Every single staff member was friendly and went out of their way to assist Room was amazingly roomy and comfortable and furnished perfect Cannot speak highly enough about everything 
487252,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Rooms a little dark The suites are much more comfotable and spacious than the regular room , Great location Quiet wonderful hospitality and great caretaking Very comfortable bed and pillow Great bathroom design and quality materials We had a wonderful time Also must mention that the restaurant was exquisite must dine for an evening Als great minibar selection A real boutique
487253,Hotel Santa Marta Suites, Don t bother with the buffet breakfast which was a waste of the 20 additional euros per person The bread was obviously left over from the day before as was a chocolate tart and some cookies all stale A lot of pre packaged items a few cereals Two small plates one with a few slices of ham the other a few slices of cheese on the buffet table The coffee was weak and lukewarm Eggs could be ordered but we skipped them for fear of what they might be like They should check to see the abundant and fresh foods that other hotels are offering for buffet breakfasts either included in the price of the room or for a lot less than 20 euros We opted for it as a time saving convenience on our last day we wanted to leave the breakfast room when we saw it but felt uncomfortable doing so You ll do much better at any local cafe , It s located on a quiet street very close to the center of Milan s historic district Our room was nicely furnished and very comfortable the staff was very attentive and helpful 
487254,Hotel Santa Marta Suites,No Negative, Very friendly and helpful people Very nice boutique style hotel with tasteful furnishings and accommodation Central location close to the cathedral and other sites Roof top terrace from where one could see the Duomo itself and the many spires and domes of the churches of the city Highly recommend this place for a city break
