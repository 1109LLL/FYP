116993,Hotel Vignon, The double bed that I had to share with my mate yes we were travelling together not as a couple The complimentary breakfast on the last night sort of made up for it though I ve had worse in Paris though don t let this review put you off , Breakfast was fantastic but needed air conditioning to make it just perfect 
116994,Hotel Vignon, Breakfast not impressive Staff not willing to give greetings even , Great location small but comfortable room Good wifi In Paris that area a valuable choice
116995,Hotel Vignon, Nothing perfect stay, Nico cosy hotel size bigger dan the avarage parisian hotel very very Nice staf especially Adam who was very kind and helpfull Good clean hotel with hausman Shipping on 5 min Wajong distance 
116996,Hotel Vignon, Hardest beds you will ever find above the floor Unrefurbished lift and pokey corridors look depressing Single member of staff and a little front foyer for a lounge did not suggest a 4 star hotel You could clearly hear the plumbing between the bathrooms , Freshly decorated bedroom and bathroom and size of both was fine for one night French windows overlooking quiet side road yet walking distance to shops and restaurants Close to a Pret for breakfast Kettle in room BUT bring teabags unless you like lime tea 
116997,Hotel Vignon, No night open shops in the nearby area The shower in the bathroom flooded the floor due to inadequate suspension bad isolation in superior suite Thin walled rooms made sleep without ear plugs impossible , Very nice staff The hotel was quite tidy warm 
116998,Hotel Vignon, The breakfast was rather basic for the price and I who just wanted a coffee and croissant still had to pay the full price of the buffet breakfast , The location was the best for walking to all the places of interest The breakfast was rather basic for the price and I who just wanted a coffee and croissant still had to pay the full price of the buffet breakfast 
116999,Hotel Vignon,No Negative, Nice quiet hotel in a central location with friendly helpful staff and a spacious nicely designed room and comfy bed I can t fault anything about it Really good value for money 
117000,Hotel Vignon, Slight unhealthy smell in the foyer No proper cartons of milk and not enough tea bags in the room , Staff friendly and helpful Rooms nicely decorated and welcoming 
117001,Hotel Vignon,No Negative, The staff were friendly and helpful The room was a good size and the beds very comfy Two pillows provided per person Included a mini bar although we didn t use it The hotel is located in a good spot for sightseeing as it is easy to get to the main sights from there 
117002,Hotel Vignon, The bathroom is a tight squeeze and a little tired around the bath but still clean and working fine , Large spacious rooms for Paris Bed was comfortable and the rooms were warm Location is fantastic
117003,Hotel Vignon,No Negative, Very friendly staff Excellent location I cannot call the hotel perfectly clean but by comparison to other hotels in France one can name cleanliness as excellent 
117004,Hotel Vignon, I would have liked the complementary shoes as the bathroom floor was cold The cleaning stuff walked right into the room waking me up at 9 even though I had until 12 to check out They didn t even knock which I found very rude , Loved the combination of strips in the design of the room The bed was huge and very comfortable which always makes it great for rest 
117005,Hotel Vignon, The haircare amenities were tiny we kept having to request more I felt that the toilet and bathroom tile weren t being thoroughly cleaned over the course of our entire stay , The room was very warm The bed and pillows were comfy The shower head boasted strong pressure 
117006,Hotel Vignon, Matresses were harder than I wanted Due to nearby apartments the weekend nights brought a few loud returning residents , Loved the front desk staff English speaking and great help at figuring out metro Loved location Was central to most of the attractions we wanted and Neto stations nearby 
117007,Hotel Vignon, Location was not easy to find first time as our GPs missed the place though the inputted adress was right though clearly this is not a fault of the Hotel There are no elevators to reach the rooms in the second floors nevertheless the staff people was quite happy to help us with the bags This was not an issue , Good location excellent food friendly atmosphere good attention Nice rooms
117008,Hotel Vignon, We liked everything , The location was excellent The room was bright attractive comfortable and extremely clean with the sheets and towels changed each day Reception staff were friendly efficient and helpful It was useful having a Nespresso machine and kettle in the room We would definitely stay here again 
117009,Hotel Vignon, The area is very busy during the day too many people , Excellent transport links lots of good restaurants around Comfortable room and friendly staff 
117010,Hotel Vignon, Nothing not to like , I stayed at Vignon in 2011 and decided to book it again during my recent visit to Paris What a great choice The hotel s location is perfect for walking to the main attractions the top floor room was freshly decorated with lots of natural daylight and immaculately clean We tried their breakfast on the last morning and it was perfectly adequate 
117011,Hotel Vignon, Nothing negative about our stay here at all , This hotel is in a great area walking distance to many attractions including the Louvre Easy access to the Metro and to the Rouissybus for CDG Paris Airport There are good restaurants and shops on the doorstep The staff were very pleasant and helpful The room was excellent comfortable clean and attractively decorated We would love to stay again The price we paid including an extra room for a stranded daughter for one of the nights was much less than the rate advertised at the hotel and was excellent value for such a good standard of accommodation 
117012,Hotel Vignon, The sheets didn t get changed whilst we were here My fianc spilled tea on our sheets and we could tell the sheets were not changed as the stain was still there everyday after room service would make up room, Great location Comfortable bed and friendly staff 
117013,Hotel Vignon, First of all this is definitely NOT a four star hotel It is barely three stars I booked a superior double room and it was minute I can t imagine how small a classic double room would be The rooms facing the street are rather noisy they confirmed no double glass windows I told the hotel manager later why they didn t give me a quiter room to begin with as the hotel was quite empty To my amazement I was told I should have asked for it as some guests prefer the noise The hair dryer wasn t working so I was given a little hair dryer later on However I could use it only by sitting on the floor all plugs are by the floor The worst however was the cleaning staff knocking on my door at 9 15 am the first morning despite the do not disturb sign on my door It turned out that the problem was the sign had fallen and the cleaning person didn t know what to do so knocked on the door I get that However having traveled all over the world I am surprised to see a four star hotel to have one single sign for don t disturb on one side and pls clean the room on the other side Why not get two Not thinking clearly Lastly the credit card machine didn t work when I tried to pay However I was told my cards I tried two US cards both of which worked everywhere else were denied Then had to pay cash Later when I came back to pick up my luggage I was told the system was down at the time and they said they had told me this so I didn t have to pay cash but they hadn t told me any of this I found this a bit insulting as I work in finance and I can tell the difference between system down and your card is not working The saddest part was when I mentioned all the above to the hotel manager He basically said There is not much I can do as you are already unhappy w the experience I guess they would do something if I had been overall happy , The location was great Quite close to great locations such as St Honore Champs Elysees the Louvre Seine and is surrounded by great restaurants and cafes in the area Quite safe area as well The hotel is a boutique hotel with relatively small rooms and is quite clean 
117014,Hotel Vignon, In the bathroom there is no electric outlet In the room there is only one electric outlet that is not used by something else But when two persons are travelling we need to charge our mobile phones every day Sometimes we need to charge other electric items as well There should be at least 2 preferably 4 extra outlets in the room and they should be placed in a convenient position not close to the floor , This hotel has an excellent location only 200 m from a Metro station Madelaine We had a nice room facing a courtyard There was no noise from traffic The bathroom was also nice There is a safe in the room The hotel has wi fi It is free and works well The staff were friendly and helpful Breakfast was not included with the room You can order a small breakfast for 15 euro and a big breakfast for 20 euro We tried the big breakfast once It was fine but you can get a small breakfast at a coffee shop for less than 10 euro 
117015,Hotel Vignon, Nothing, The hotel is in an ideal location in the 8th close to everything but located on a quiet street with lots of restaurants close by and public transport This was also the best price for quality that I ve seen in this area 
117016,Hotel Vignon, Nothing , Everything was excellent the bed was really comfy location was fantastic especially for shopping and it was a really good value for money Loved it 
117017,Hotel Vignon, The design of bathtub is very bad no matter how you be carefully when taking shower the water always flood all the way to the ground causing bathroom wet all the time , Location is very nice the staffs are friendly 
117018,Hotel Vignon, The Hotel is very red so if you don t like this colour consider another one The breakfast is not part of the price so you have to pay 20 plus tax a day which is just for some buffet breakfast waste of money for that , Location to where I needed to be in Paris Very clean and simple 
117019,Hotel Vignon,No Negative, This is my second time at Hitel Vignon All members of staff and I mean everyone have excellent customer service standards and skill The hotel and its facilities are excellent and I like ok forward to a return visit and sharing my recommendation with friends and family 10 on 10 
117020,Hotel Vignon, No sleepers in the room Housekeeping can knock the door early in the morning unless you put the dont disturb hanger on the door , Well designed very comfortable room and bathroom Very well located in Paris 
117021,Hotel Vignon, It would be nice to offer a free bottle of water in the room , Excellent service very good location walking distance to all the shops Clean and very nice decorated Second time we stayed at the Le Vignon We ll definately visit again when in Paris Highly Recommended 
117022,Hotel Vignon, The air conditioning is not working very well the room was a bit stuffy and hot when we visited in late December The room is really quiet though but if you open the window there are a few bangs during midnight , It is a small hotel located right in the centre of Paris Madeleine Concorde and Saint lazare station all in 5mins walk Perfect for shopping and taking trains for day trips Friendly staff 
117023,Hotel Vignon, Could have been a bit more generous with the shampoo and shower gel bottles Temperature was a bit too warm in the room and wasn t really a way to regulate it opened the window , Spacious room great bath tub nice closet space nice minibar nice tv even had a couple of English speaking channels staff was very helpful with restaurant reservations and taxis Location is a minute s walk from gallery Lafayette and the metro 
117024,Hotel Vignon,No Negative, Very close to Madeleine station and only a 15min ride away from Gare de Lyon by Metro line 14 Very convenient to walk anywhere central 5 min walk to the department stores 
117025,Hotel Vignon, Internet was sooooo bad and poor, Everything was perfect and comfortable and clean One of the staff was extremely friendly helpful and polite Ahmed Adam 
117026,Hotel Vignon, Air conditioning vents not adjustable blowing at our faces Bathtub didn t drain so was showering in a pool of water , Spacious room new carpets fairly quiet good WiFi good location 
117027,Hotel Vignon, Terrible customer service do not stay here if you are a business traveller who needs to print We booked this hotel three days in advance and then asked that we could print if necessary a presentation in colour in A4 Hotel says of course no problem but only A4 We then emailed them again to confirm that we would need the printer to print 45 one sided A4 colour slides They confirmed this and then said that we would pay 1Euro per page A professional print shop probably charges less but we agreed in writing straight away You can guess what happened next no printer working and mad panic and dash to find a business centre Not acceptable from a supposedly business friendly hotel Very sloppy service , good location and comfortable room but all irrelevant as a service we requested that was confirmed in writing days before was not carried out and therefore negated the choice of this hotel 
117028,Hotel Vignon,No Negative, The location is excellent It is walking distance to the Eiffel Tower Arc de Triomphe Louvre and Champs d Elysees The Service is excellent They have people who speak English and Spanish Around the corner is the London Paris Cafe an excellent place for food dinner and to chill and watch people 
117029,Hotel Vignon, The lack of electrical outlets in the bathroom distressed my husband who uses an electric shaver , Great little hotel in a great location The staff was gracious and friendly We wish we could have stayed longer 
117030,Hotel Vignon, First visit in Summer first night a c not working second and third nights were good Second visit in October first night wifi not working and hairdryer broken and fixed in the night Second night is ok , Great location closes to shopping area both Saint honore and La fayatte The room was very clean and spacious in our first and second visits I enjoyed it very much Got a bath and small fridge in the room 
117031,Hotel Vignon, Rooms are quiet small but this is Paris and for the price you pay i find it fair, Location Price was the main determent lovely staff and atmosphere boutique in a romantic way
117032,Hotel Vignon,No Negative, Perfect location a really quiet street but just round the corner right into the opera district with excellent shops and bars Within walking distance of loads of the main tourist attractions 
117033,Hotel Vignon, Add 20 Euro for a young kid There are two sex shops on the street Room has a bad smell The elevator and aisle are really narrow and the wall was painted in pink Makes the whole place like a love hotel There is no lobby at all Have no idea why this is rated as a four stars hotel To be honest any 3 stars airport hotel is far better than the place , Close to public tranportation 
117034,Hotel Vignon, Breakfast too expensive Red pink hallways a bit too Moulin Rouge , Location was good and quiet easy walking distance to shops Gare St Lazare and places of interest Friendly staff and good facilities air con bar fridge tea making safe 
117035,Hotel Vignon, The room were made very late everyday We came back to the hotel around 2 3pm everyday for a short break and not once was the room made despite us putting the please clean the room sign out early in the morning when we left , Room is spacious Washroom facilities are good too Staff are very friendly location is really good close to the tube we did the big bus tour and there s one stop right across the street from us 
117036,Hotel Vignon, The housekeeping theived my sun glasses and the hotel didn t want to know about it They put the blame back into me and tried to make it seem like I took them out with me that day and they got pick pocketed I have 2 pairs and I tried them both on that morning so definitely left them in the hotel I am a cautious traveller and keep all my expensive things out of sight or locked away the safe was tiny wherever I stay so to say I am angry is an understatement I worked hard for 3 years to afford this trip and the sunglasses which I bought duty free before I went to Paris They offered no apology but claimed they would contact me if they turned up They are never going to turn up It ruined what would have been a lovely stay in a quaint small hotel Also it is definatley not worth 4 stars You don t even get free bottled water I do not recommend this hotel , Good location to everything
117037,Hotel Vignon, The air conditioning was not working well on the first night and the weather was 34c on that day , The location is superb for shopping and traveling to Disneyland The room is very clean and well designed 
117038,Hotel Vignon,No Negative, Great location Was able to walk everywhere very easily or catch a metro Room and bathroom were excellent size for Paris Staff pleasant and very helpful Will stay here again 
117039,Hotel Vignon, The internet was very inconsistent and kept dropping in and out It s worth noting that there is very little open around the hotel on Sundays very tricky for dinner as even the local supermarket is closed The whole of Paris seems to shut down so not a fault of the hotel but worth knowing in advance , The staff were very friendly and helpful Room was clean and tidy The breakfast offered is 20Euro which is too steep so we ate at a local cafe Close by to train station and buses
