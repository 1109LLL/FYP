401618,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, The front desk staff weren t very friendly and their communication lacked I emailed the property on two separate occasions regarding our very late check in and received no reply , Right next to the Sants station Rooms are modern and clean Wifi was great
401619,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, Cleaning could be a bit better Dodgy looking flats or apartments just behind the hotel , Breakfast was great Proximity to Sants Station Central between most areas around Barcelona and the airport One train ride to the airport Sound proofing 
401620,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, Prepayment 5 commission charged for paying in non Euro currency when we weren t given the option to pay in Euros even though this is stated on the bill that s already paid it was our choice it clearly wasn t , Clean modern rooms very nice design offers all mod cons large TV wifi fridge rooms can be a little small Excellent location for overnight stay for onward train travel 
401621,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, No issues really but would gave been nice to have tea making facilities in the room, Very close to the railway station room service staff member was very helpful They also acted on our request to have a room on the lower levels 
401622,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, Nothing bad to report Didn t find any issues and hotel facilities and staff were up to the expected standards , Great location is your work or leisure visit floats around Sants train station just a few steps away from it Very good breakfast good quality and plenty of options Comfortable bed cozy room peculiar but decent bathroom set with plenty of amenities Plenty of public transports options and restaurants around Fluid check in and check out process 
401623,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, The WC was separated from the bath area and there were no hangers in or outside around the bathroom to hang clothes or towels It was very uncomfortable as we stayed as a group family There were no single beds and had to pay for wifi facilities Because of the inconvenience of the bathroom setting it was not worth it , The staff and the cleanliness of the hotel was good The location was very convenient and easy to find 
401624,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, No bathroom door Shower overlooked by bed Toilet in a wardrobe cupboard with no lock and no extractor TV size utterly overbearing Bright blue light on TV shining at bed preventing sleep Way too hot in room No soda water in bar , Close to station but there are alternatives
401625,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel,No Negative, Next to the Sants train station Very convenient to commute Was pleasantly surprise by the size of the room and amenities available Good value for money
401626,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, I booked this hotel for the purpose of the gym but the facilities were not as advertised and we were very disappointed with what was available to us when specifying the use of a gym when searching for a hotel this was one of the first to appear not good ,No Positive
401627,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, Staff were courteous but not particulary friendly I wanted to book an additional night on our return and the receptionist told me to go online We did go online but subsequently found a better property for a cheaper price I thought that was a missed opportunity for your business, Rooms were clean and well appointed Location was great for us as we were leaving on an early morning train and it was ideally located to the station
401628,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, No tea coffee making in room and no onsite eatery only room service , We were only there a few hours between train and plane In that time it filled our basic needs It is very handy to train station 
401629,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, Staff were not as expected I was promised that my points should be added to my Marriott rewards membership upon departure Nothing has been added up till now and when contacting Marriott s rewards worldwide I get an answer that any booking made through a third party isn t entitled to points If that s true shouldn t I have been told by the hotel employees Disappointing, Location is good next to a metro station
401630,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, Bathroom very unusual , Just good value and beside major train station and metro line Very easy to get around the city Staff very friendly and helpful 
401631,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, Towels were missing from the room I asked for room service at 10 45pm for 1 salad and they told me that the kitchen is closed while they are mentioning on the room service that guests can order till 11 00pm A C was not working ,No Positive
401632,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, strange open plan bath room facilities, Great location next to Sants station which you can get a train straight from Barcelona airport staff very helpful
401633,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel,No Negative, Very close to Sants railway station We did use this hotell becouse we travel with small children and could easy find our way fast to the hotell and travel to Salou the next day from the same railway station It is also lots of places to eat outside the railway station and inside McDonalds 
401634,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, Nothing, Being so close to the main train station is great for people travelling by plane as the airport train arrives approx 100 from the hotel and all regional trains leave from the same rail station Staff were fantastic The local metro also makes it very easy to go to any where in the city 
401635,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, The location is the worst Is very far from every point of interest of the city The neighborhood is terrible , The day time girl Laura was the only nice persona that work in that hotel The other staff members were very unfriendly 
401636,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, The noisy hotel and unfriendly staff, It is good if you are travelling by train But it is very noisy and the staff is not friendly or helpful They only had one receptionist that had to answer phone calls and check in and check out customers She must have been a student doing a summer job 
401637,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, Some issues with the wifi fitness center very small and basic Overall we were very satisfied with the stay , Excellent location if you travel by train well connected by public transport to the rest of the city very new and modern rooms comfortable bed everything very clean
401638,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, Location is perfect but there are petty economies on things such as shampoo and towels The room was quite small and the room design exacerbated this The staff were lovely, The location and the staff
401639,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, The air conditioning It was hot and more food options were needed They also need a guide for tourist on how the local transportation works etc , Best location for traveling around the city lots of food options in the same block atms etc 
401640,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, Would loved to have had a tea coffee tray with kettle in room rather than a minibar but room service was prompt and not too expensive However just read another review about free tea and coffee in the hall which I was not aware of a note in the Room Service Menu to mention this would have been useful , Right beside Barcelona Sants station so perfect for an overnight stay between trains and will use again Good sized room for a double with large comfy bed 
401641,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, It looked like they were renovating and it was let down by little things let it down such as dreadfulTV reception no soap dish for the basin surface finishes and so on , Location right next to Barcelona Sants was excellent Comfortable bed quiet room very helpful staff Could have been a great little hotel 
401642,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, I encountered 3 reception staff during my stay there They were all surly and gave me the impression they would much prefer it they did not have to deal with me The reception desk was unattended one evening and when the receptionist eventually came from a room at the rear she was still eating When she spoke to me it was quite clear she had been enjoying a glass of rioja with her meal The pair of well worn trainers she was wearing certainly did not go well with the uniform she was attired in either I asked her what Night Bus serviced the area of Sants she just shrugged her shoulders and said she did not know I would normally only comment on staff if the my expierence has been positive but in this case I feel I need to make an exception The room was quite small with one of those bathrooms that are not separated from the sleeping area by an actual bathroom door just a narrow sliding door To get to the wardrobe you had to pass through this area All a bit fiddly , Next to Sants Railway and Metro Stations so handy for access to both Airport and City Centre I recommend using the R line to Passeig De Gracia as it is only 1 stop and trains are much less crowded than the Metro Line Comfortable bed I was on a room only basis so I cannot comment on the quality of the breakfast 
401643,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, After a long train journey was disappointed that no hot food was served at the weekend breakfast only available from 8am which was too late for me , The room location was perfect 
401644,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, I found the breakfast extremely expensive for what is offered Very small rooms and not confortable bed I was expecting to have the marriott standards was a bit disappointed , Location near the main train station
401645,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, Being next to the train station meant a few dodgy characters but not a big issue The bed was not the most comfortable but it was all right , location is great for public transport but quite far away from the centre So if you need a cab it will take a while to get to your destination Very clean and most importantly staff are always there to help There is also a mini shop at reception so if you forget your tooth brush you can buy one 
401646,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, I found staff to be somewhat Indifferent not too warm and friendly Sometimes the desk was not covered with no one in sight , Perfect location to public transportation Clean rooms
401647,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, The room and the bathroom are in an open space it s not comfortable if one should weak up earlier or going at night , Big and comfortable bed Good soundproof 
401648,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, Sink is in the room You enter directly into the shower cabine from the room If you share a room with someone your privacy is compromised, Nice location Good breakfast 
401649,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel, The hotel reseptionist was hopeless She kept up waiting for 30 mins while she took telephone calls before she checked us in which took half a minute Very unprofessional I shall never ever stay at this hotel again , Close to the railway station the bedroom was clean and comfortable 
401650,AC Hotel Sants a Marriott Lifestyle Hotel,No Negative, Very nice BUSINESS hotel Small but very modern room Was only there for about 7 hours between late check in and early check out but breakfast buffet was MUCH better than I would have expected for a hotel like this Good mix of traditional and other foods Also location is directly across from the Barcelona Sants station Extremely convenient
