488052,Senato Hotel Milano, We were very happy with our breakfast but my family commented that their hotel had a better selection of fruits and hot food For young people with larger appetites this might be a consideration , We travelled with our small dog and were made most welcome and they did not charge extra although their info said they might There was a park very nearby which was essential as Milan central has no grassy areas We has our 50th wedding anniversary while we were there and when they realised they sent up complimentary drinks and a little cake we thought it was a lovely gesture The room was cool comfortable and large and immaculately clean We had booked a terrace room and it was lovely to sit there on an evening It was a 10 minute walk to the Duomo and 10 minutes to the Brera area where all the trendy eating places are My family stayed in the area next to the Duomo and loved being in the noisy part however we were very pleased that we had chosen a quieter area 
488053,Senato Hotel Milano, Everything was splendid , The design of this little boutique hotel is superb every detail in the room is on point especially the parquet floor was beautiful and nice and cool during the summer heat The breakfast was very good excellent selection of sweet and savory dishes The location of the hotel is perfect close to all public transport sights shopping restaurants but not right in the middle of the noisy traffic and hustle and bustle Rooms facing the inner courtyard are beautifully quiet and calm 
488054,Senato Hotel Milano,No Negative, Staff were friendly and professional Hotel was stylish and clean Short walk to centre of Milan Lovely breakfast especially when taken outside on the patio 
488055,Senato Hotel Milano, Water in shower did not go down the drain No ironing room for guests like in other smaller grade hotels Do not justify it by saying the Law does not permit it That s not true Hotels can provide the use of an iron as long as it s NOT in the guests room Totally ridiculous No one even offered to help All I got was there is nothing I can do Really poor service , Lobby and Garden
488056,Senato Hotel Milano, The shower could have been a bit more powerful , This hotel is super stylish and the staff are super friendly and not snooty at all Breakfast was busy and had everything you could want with a great selection of herbal teas

488063,Senato Hotel Milano, The room is a bit tiny its a problem in practically most the hotels in the big cities of Northern Europe , Well located walking distance of the best 2 museums of Milano Villa Reale modern art Pinacoteca Brera italian paintings 1400 1900 Plus near the best shopping areas the fancy via della Spiga and the casual area of Corso Venezia

488065,Senato Hotel Milano, Minor niggle the towels were a bit worn on the first day but quality improved when the were replaced next day , Convenient location for the centre Pleasant and helpful staff Quiet and relaxing especially in the secluded garden next to the bar Drinks were usual hotel prices but were served with substantial light bites and snacks 
488066,Senato Hotel Milano, Staff weren t always as helpful as they could be at reception I e I asked for a glass of water just before leaving and was told I would need to go to the bar it was a very hot day and for the amount we had paid this was the least one could expect ,No Positive

488068,Senato Hotel Milano, I would have preferred wardrobe doors and more shelves There was only one shelf in the wardrobe which was too high even for me at 6 3 My wife couldn t use the top shelf 5 5 , The bed was the most comfortable bed I have slept in for a long time 
488069,Senato Hotel Milano, Location for tourists is so so If you like to walk rather than take public transportation or taxis it isn t the best located hotel It is more a business district location at breakfast the people at the next table were talking about the launch of their next fashion season, Bed and room were fine although the room was a little small Breakfast was good with excellent pastries Staff were very friendly and helpful

488080,Senato Hotel Milano, The room was very noisy due to some air circulation other than AC We did change rooms twice but all rooms do have this annoying noise Cleaning hygiene in bathroom was not in depth ,No Positive
488081,Senato Hotel Milano, Air conditioning cannot be controlled from inside the room and the fan is located right above the bed so the first night we literally froze despite the reception telling us the ac was at 29 degrees celcius Ended up switching rooms twice but the other rooms were also extremely cold So we went back to our original room and ended up moving the bed Bed sheets were all over the place not happy with those either , Good location friendly staff nice design
488082,Senato Hotel Milano, few members of the team were not so friendly as it could be the ventilation hood in the bathroom is very noisy you could hear it all the time especially at night And its no possible to turn it off, Location of the hotel is really good Inside the hotel you could feel mostly warm friendly atmosphere Young man at the reception was very helpful also the ladies at the bar Breakfasts are very delicious
488083,Senato Hotel Milano, They gave us room 111 and it is not nice room we aske to change the room they said not available Every day I see people check in that mean there is a room but they don t want to chang our room,No Positive
488084,Senato Hotel Milano, Hotel is a little North of the main tourist sites but most are still within a reasonable walking distance , Hotel has been recently renovated and is quite modern is decor Very comfortable balcony room Hot water brewer made decent instant coffee 
488085,Senato Hotel Milano, Nothing, Breakfast extensive choice local fresh ingredients healthy Friendly staff Small but functional gym sun deck on the rooftop beautifully designed rooms and communal areas super central location Extensive choice of pillows 
488086,Senato Hotel Milano, There is so little that could be better maybe a caddy in the shower for shampoo etc But this is just quibbling , The staff was fabulous We arrived early and they checked but our room wasn t ready So they took all of our bags and when we returned later in the day everything had already been out into the room no they didn t unpack The room was great with a lovely balcony into an inner courtyard So we had no street noise The bed was really excellent The staff also arranged for a car to take us to the airport 4 30 am yuck We only wish we could have stayed longer 
488087,Senato Hotel Milano, The room was very small we did not have enough space to open a large suitcase The curtains could not block the sun completely so the room was light and the bathroom was not clean with the shower clogged with hair , The location is good Near the quadrilatero Della Moda 
488088,Senato Hotel Milano, When we where leaving in the morning the doorman did not lift a hand to help us put our luggage in the cab which was not very nice I expected that especially as we had two children and his help would have been appreciate it and he would have received a tip But he just was not interested Very bad I hope that the manager of the hotel has a talk with their porters This was very disappointing , Great location breakfast was great and excellent quality The brought fresh orange juice and fruit salad to the table as we arrived The hotel and room where very clean We stayed in the Junior suite on top floor with our children and the room was specious and airy with a cute balcony The bathroom was nice and all white so very clean The mini bar was free with really nice stuff in it We enjoyed staying at the hotel very much 
488089,Senato Hotel Milano, The rooms look very stylish but appear to have been designed by someone who does not use hotels For example there are no drawers of any kind in the room apart from one in the wardrobe meaning that books paperwork and any other odds and ends that you use have to be left on the visible surfaces in the room One day room service missed our room and three items from the mini bar appeared on our bill even though we had not used anything Both problems were sorted out swiftly by the reception staff , To start would I stay here again definitely This is a small boutique hotel with rooms on four floors that appear to be split into three separate room areas served by three separate lifts We were in room 104 and there were three other rooms off our corridor The room had a large balcony with two relaxing chairs and overlooked the enclosed courtyard The d cor is very good the whole hotel clean and the staff were helpful and friendly We enjoyed using the sun roof in the evening to chill out on the very comfortable sun beds The breakfast was perfect for us but could be a bit lacking if you are really into cooked food There was a good selection of quality cold meats cheese cereals pastries fruit etc but only scrambled eggs and bacon on the cooked side The coffee and tea were very good quality as was the fruit juice We had a problem with our Air Conditioning on the first night and reported it the following day Unfortunately it could not be fixed that day but we were given another room to sleep in or the option to move into that room for the remainder of our stay Things can always go wrong but it is how they are dealt with that is important and the Senato dealt with our issues very well indeed 
488090,Senato Hotel Milano, Nothing at all , We arrived at 10 30 AM after a long long flight from the U S Check In time was not until 2P M But the wonderful person attending the desk found a room for us for early check in The room was beautifully modern and spotless While not huge it was more than adequate for two friends traveling together Can t say enough about all the staff and the fabulous breakfast buffet Can t wait to return to Milan to visit Hotel Senato again A small jewel box of a hotel 
488091,Senato Hotel Milano, THE AIR CONDITIONING WAS TERRIBLE AND THEY COULDNT FIX IT VERY HOT , THE BEDS WERE GREAT EVERYTHING ELSE GREAT MOST OF THE TIME THE STAFF WERE GOOD A COUPLE OF TIMES NOT VERY HELPFUL AT RECEPTION 
488092,Senato Hotel Milano,No Negative, Beautiful extremely clean and very nice staff Loved the garden seating for breakfast It s also in a great location Can t wait to be back 
488093,Senato Hotel Milano, The car parking was a little too expensive Otherwise everything was superb , The hotel is beautiful and in a lovely part of town The staff provided an excellent service they were friendly and professional The breakfast was quite nice Also I got a good recommendation for a restaurant for a late meal which was much appreciated I intend to stay here again when I m back in Milan 
488094,Senato Hotel Milano, We had booked a junior suite for 2 adults and 2 children but when we arrived the children s beds had not been prepared and there was no bedding Once alerted the staff were quick to come and make up the beds , Excellent breakfast Beautiful bathroom No extra charge for minibar or for very large glasses of milk for children at bedtime 
488095,Senato Hotel Milano, Early check in would have made the experience way better , Room was lovely especially the bathroom and felt a good size for 4 friends Breakfast was delicious Good outdoor spaces too 
488096,Senato Hotel Milano, software employees were not up to a 4 star standard or well trained some of the staffs were not get used to greet hotel guests at all especially the guy with moustache on night shift I need to greet them before I can get a hello ciao back from them overall it wasn t an enjoyable stay , breakfast was nice and the guy who s work there was in very good manner and attitude centrally located near metro within 3 mins walk the bro classic design and decors are very in trend 
488097,Senato Hotel Milano, Multiple staff members insisted on speaking to me in English assuming that all travelers were foreign despite that I am Italian and spoke to them in Italian on all occasions Would suggest that staff listen more carefully in order to not offend the few once locals that it sees pass through , Great design and location
488098,Senato Hotel Milano, Parking expensive and not included in hotel price costs EUR 25 per day EUR 3 pollution tax City tax of EUR 5 per person per day , One of the best hotels we ever stayed in Great staff excellent English comfortable beds great location looks brand new 
488099,Senato Hotel Milano, The restaurant is small breakfast variety not many that s why they don t offer the room with Breakfast as a package , The staff are friendly trust guests and do what they can to help
488100,Senato Hotel Milano, For a decade or more I stayed at the Hotel Manzoni prior to its closure and long winded renovation This is the perfect replacement and I wouldn t change a thing , This is a stunning design hotel and a worthy addition to the choices in Milan The attention to detail in design is formidable both in the rooms and in the lounge corridors breakfast and bar area and splendidly the courtyard garden with its giant golden door The staff are attentive courteous and helpful The breakfast is perfect with fresh Lombardy ingredients Please don t book I need a room available whenever I return 
488101,Senato Hotel Milano, The shower over the bath in our room was not easy to get in and out of if you re elderly ask for a room with shower only Hot water took a long time to get hot too But these are minor points in a hotel that is quite perfect in every other respect , Very nice big rooms clean everywhere gorgeous beds great breakfast in a nice area Staff were exceptional the whole time 
488102,Senato Hotel Milano, No iron in the room The rooms could be a bit larger and the umbrellas could be available in the room, If you love to be within five minutes distance to the luxury shops in via Monte Napoleone i e Chanel Missoni Tory Burch Hermes and many more and around this is one of the best affordable hotels in my view Do not leave Milan without seeing the display window of summer 2016 season by Dolce Gabbana located in via della Spiga no 26 Coming to Senato Hotel the hotel is typically Milanese trendy stylish modern and chic I had the best sleep ever in a hotel there was no noise there were 7 rooms in the 2nd floor 5 rooms in the 4th floor and only 2 rooms in the fifth highest floor Although there are not many different choices in the buffet breakfast we found it very delicious and more than OK we appreciated the complementary fruit salad If the weather is nice try to have breakfast outdoor and enjoy secret garden golden door The garden is very enjoyable and cool at night as well we had franciacorta Italian champagne and toast in a wonderful gold plate presentation I will always remember The decoration and accessories such as plates room closets lighting were in great harmony you feel the completeness of the decoration details in the entire hotel A useful tip for smokers our room had balcony looking at Via Senato We were during there during menswear fashion week and exhibitions were very nearby Personnel was also very helpful and polite Last but not least Global Blue has an office nearby via spirito no 5 first floor so that you can receive cash VAT refund there and benefit from fast track at the airport and avoid the crowd 
488103,Senato Hotel Milano, we loved the smell floating in the hotel but it was too much our room had the balcony of the adjacent room giving on the glass door of our room, yes good and simple clean deco
488104,Senato Hotel Milano,No Negative, We had a junior suite for 2 adults and 2 children room 502 and it was really nice Beautiful and modern and clean Large bathroom and cute little terrace as well The breakfast buffet was small but of good quality especially for the price 18 euros The location is good for many of the upscale shops it s just a street over from that area On the tail end of our trip we stayed at a different hotel right next to the Duomo and I think I probably preferred that location but this hotel is so lovely 
488105,Senato Hotel Milano, Avoid the rooms with the small bathrooms there s no place to put your bathroom things , Great breakfast Nice big bed Close to Napoleone Street if you like very high end shopping

488109,Senato Hotel Milano, The parking for this hotel is a mess I don t speak Italian but learned some curse words from the angry drunken parking attendant For such a hotel with such attention to detail working with such substandard company is odd , The property is beautifully done very modern and chic The rooms are large and very clean The location is also great out of the busy touristy area yet an easy walk to the city center The night staff is super friendly and helpful 
488110,Senato Hotel Milano, Late check out not available , The set up the details it s all beautiful and brand new Food is great and staff super helpful and attentive It was my husband birthday and they sent us some chocolate covered strawberries and a fruit basket very thoughtful

488112,Senato Hotel Milano, I wasn t able to stay for a month longer , I couldn t fault this beautiful hotel From the moment I arrived the staff at reception concierge and the bar were friendly helpful knowledgeable and welcoming The decor was impeccable and sensitive to the original features with a beautiful balance of form and materials I have never slept so well on the superbly comfortable mattress and it was a treat to open my balcony door each morning and experience the open skies and peaceful water feature in the courtyard The small peace garden I named it the peace garden as it was so serene was the perfect place to unwind after walking the streets of Milan all day Finally the breakfast selection was presented so elegantly and was sublime way to start each day There is a beautiful park behind the hotel where you can go for a walk or a jog which is located within 5 minutes walk or if you prefer a walk to Via Della Spiga to visit the stores or The Duomo then the hotel is within walking distance of all of the luxury shopping area sightseeing destinations Thank you Hotel Senato staff I will be definitely returning next year

488119,Senato Hotel Milano, The bathroom not very practical they need to install holders for soap etc Breakfast is very simple To much sweet things , The hotel location is really good Just 10min walk from Duomo and shops The staff very friendly 
488120,Senato Hotel Milano, Dining room is too small for the size of the hotel Although the breakfast was good the proximity of the tables and the size of them made it difficult to fully enjoy our breakfast The breakfast room was very quiet because of this The room servicing was hit and miss The last day we didn t get the tea and coffee supplies replenished We didn t realise until 05 30 the next morning when we wanted a hot drink before leaving for the journey home The A C seemed to have a mind of it s own and kept changing temperature that being said it could only be adjusted between 20 and 24C The shower had little power and the temperature was erratic came close to scalds several times , The hotel looked very classy decor was good reception staff were very good There is an area on the roof where you can go when it s warm No view but pleasant

488123,Senato Hotel Milano, no place for luggage uncomfortable bath room and shower the worst smell in executive room which was supposed to be the best the breakfast, being clean
488124,Senato Hotel Milano, The staff attitude made us feel like we owe them money Firstly as we check in and out nobody ever welcomed us or even said thank you Usually when you check out the front desk will ask a question about your stay Unfortunately even something terrible happened during our stay none of them asked our opinions or apologized at all The second night when I was taking shower the shower sink somehow stopped working Due to the weird design of the bathroom there is no door or glass blocking the shower from the rest of the bathroom Thus the water came out and flow into the room I told the front desk about what happened and they sent a staff over and he took a ton of hair and wastes out of the shower sink in front of me Then he left to get cleansing tools to wipe out the water and WITHOUT washing his hands he brought us a new set of sheet as the previous ones got wet It seemd like it would take him at least 40 min to get the job done and it s already 1 am I called the front desk to see if we can change to another room Shockingly the first reaction of the front desk is why didn t you come out of the shower when you found out it s not working Why did you let this happen Excuse me is this really the way how four star hotel service people talk to their customers And remember as we checked out the following morning nobody ever said anything about this issue In addition the air conditioning is controlled by the front desk you have to call them to set the temperature to your desired ones and it s locked It seemed like they are not familiar with the operation of the system either It took us 3 times calling to get it right ,No Positive
488125,Senato Hotel Milano,No Negative, Staff was extremely helpful The location is very convenient It is close to the train stations and to the city center The rooms are very stylish and clean Definitely worth a visit when you are in Milan for leisure or with kids milan s best park is a 5 min walk away Even if you are business it is easy find to find taxis nearby and the 2 metro stations are very close 
488126,Senato Hotel Milano, The temperature in the room was a bit low and there was no possibility to increase it so it was a bit cold , The hotel is in an excellent location 5 minutes walking distance from the main shopping area and 10 minutes from the Duomo The rooms are very modern spacious and the bed is very comfortable Staff is very friendly The breakfast is also excellent with a good choice and the coffee is freshly made when you arrive So make sure to take a room with breakfast option We will definitely come back

488129,Senato Hotel Milano, My only complaint about this hotel was that one morning I had the do not disturb sign on my door yet the housekeeper still came in I was very upset but the front desk was very apologetic , AMAAAAZING location You can easily walk to the best locations in Milan The hotel is absolutely gorgeous and everything is new Extremely comfortable beds which is hard to find in Italy The breakfast buffet is one of the best I have found during my traveling fresh juices coffee baked goods eggs etc

488134,Senato Hotel Milano, Quality price ratio is not good No internal garage available No Kleenex in the bathroom to save money just a detail but this quite small hotel with approx 25 rooms has probably a rentability problem since the architectural investments were very important , Very important architectural work in an old building Very good breakfast with quality products Personal is very kind
