433640,H10 Universitat, Parking is complicated There is a parking on the next street for 27 euro per day But to know about it I had to talk to the reception which means that I had to park a car somewhere close to the entrance to the hotel This was quite expensive around 4 euro for 30 minutes , The location is great and the staff is very helpfull All the rest is on a very good level 
433641,H10 Universitat, The sink is not in the bathroom Asked for coffee pods on 3 rd day and told supply is for first day only although tea bags were supplied daily Air conditioning is not adjustable although there is a dial on the wall , The location is very good within walking distance to cafes restaurants shopping several tourist attractions airport shuttle bus station and Metro The bed is comfortable and shower is good 2 complimentry bottles of water provided every day 
433642,H10 Universitat, Terrace was big enough but offers little privacy since you practically share it with your neighbors and the noise of some equipment beyond the terrace wall was a bit annoying A bit pricey but OK given the location , A nice and very clean hotel in a great location with helpful and friendly staff The size of the room was OK closets and shelves were big enough The room has all of the expected amenities such as good WIFI safety box fridge espresso machine tea maker They don t save on the small things so you get tooth brushes extra glasses etc The complimentary cookies a couple of bottles of water tea bags espresso and milk capsules were a nice gesture The bar on the roof has a great view I would stay here again 
433643,H10 Universitat, I ve worked in the hotel industry for over 20 years so my expectations are high but realistic The front desk clerk who checked me in was not as friendly or helpful as she could have been I arrived very early in the morning and my room wasn t ready so before I left I asked them to call me when my room was ready they didn t I didn t use any of the facilities when I was there but the hotel smelled great ,No Positive
433644,H10 Universitat,No Negative, Good and kind personnel Our firs reserved room was little small because we need baby bed so i had to ask bigger room Personnels were kindly accept and changed our room Our new room was bigger wider and front Perfect breakfast 
433645,H10 Universitat,No Negative, The hotel is a beautiful and wonderful location and the reception is treated more than wonderful especially the mention of the receptionist Karluta was greeted with welcome in addition to making some bookings coordinating tours and booking a rental car thanks all the hotel staff
433646,H10 Universitat, Nothing, Great location Room was amazing and we had a balcony which looked over the street Great facilities in the room Hotel staff all amazing especially the reception staff who were so helpful gave great advice on best restaurants 
433647,H10 Universitat, The room was a bit too small but it s ok Only thing we didn t like was the construction noise that started at 7 30 am after we arrived from long flights and we were hoping to have a good sleep but the noise woke us up so we couldn t really enjoyed the comfy bed that much , Location stuff and cleanliness was great 
433648,H10 Universitat, The hospitality and service was bad The staff at reception does not have enough knowledge to guide a tourist properly Wrong or half toutist information was given They charge you 3 euro just for getting extra glass or plate to your room Not expected from a 4 star hotel We had special dietary requirements but they were not ready to customize anything for us inspire of informing in advance so we could not opt to include breakfast in our stay , Location was good Close to bus stops and metro stations Close to place catalunya and la ramala 
433649,H10 Universitat,No Negative, We booked room only and were happy with that The hotel is located close to Catalunya Plaza between two metro stations It was only a short walk from the Aerobus stop to the hotel and close to La Rambla It was possible to buy tickets for the Aerobus at the information desk at the airport 
433650,H10 Universitat, We had a basic double room and it was very small 450 for 3 nights room only and there was just enough room to walk round the bed The view from the window was more hotel rooms on all sides so we kept the curtain shut , The hotel was very central Well placed for exploring on foot 
433651,H10 Universitat,No Negative, Our arrival was very early and it was Saturday After a walk in the city eating the breakfast we were still early but the room was ready for us and it was with a cool view of the city It was a nice surprise for us Thank you very much And what s also important the quality of windows was great so you can t hear any noise from outside The bed and pillows were comfortable towels were so soft All requests were taken care so fast Absolutely beatiful view from the roof terrace We will be definitely consider to stay again 
433652,H10 Universitat, 1 I asked for a double bed and received a twin single bed 2 The room I received smelled and when I complained I was told their were no other options 3 The staff informed me this was as a result of the information Booking com passed on to the hotel rather than any fault of the hotel and they directed me to complain to Booking com, Location
433653,H10 Universitat, See above , The location was excellent the hotel staff were very helpful and the breakfast was very good but I am baffled as to why the food was quite cold even though it was kept on a hot plate 
433654,H10 Universitat, The shower temperature was a little iffy the first time we used it but later showers we had no problem , The staff were excellent On check in we got our choice of sparkling water fresh squeezed orange juice or sparkling wine The room was very modern and a good size with a good bed Transport was easy with buses right out the door and the metro down the street The Ramblas is a block away 
433655,H10 Universitat, Many common items only available on request such as hotel slippers tea cups kettle etc which one would expect to have in the hotel room , Good location good selection of bread for breakfast 
433656,H10 Universitat,No Negative, The Hotel was perfect for us we didn t include breakfast or dinner and didn t dine in the hotel restaurant as we prefer to eat at one of the many cafeterias restaurants in the city so we can t comment on the food in the hotel restaurant The hotel is in an excellent location Staff were very friendly helpful The room was very comfortable clean The room was cleaned to a high standard on a daily basis A fantastic base for a very enjoyable visit to the marvelous city of Barcelona 
433657,H10 Universitat, I lost my passport in the hotel and I called back to them they didn t even search it and told me that nothing been found So I went back to the hotel and they told me the new tenant is in so I went up with the cleaner by myself there s no tenant in the room and my passport was there Such a horrible service Btw breakfast isn t worth 18 EUR at all Can t find any 4 stars hotel with this kind of attitude ,No Positive
433658,H10 Universitat, the standard room was awfully small for 2 people but on description it says for 2 people we barely could fit 2 suitcases and the sink was too small the room doesn t have a window ,No Positive
433659,H10 Universitat, I booked double bed room but I got two SS beds attached together which have slightly diffrent hights , It s close to every point in BCN You can go anywhere by foot There are great restaruants few blocks away and you can also easily find nearby convenient store I visited rooftop terrace at around midnight and even though they were not offering any service I could still enjoy night view with comfy chairs it was open but no staff was there Also it was very quite while we are staying 
433660,H10 Universitat, The roof terrace is only a few chairs and sofas on the roof The room is quite small but it was totally ok for my needs , Good quality hotel in a good location the internet worked well and the bar was good too Also many good places to eat nearby 
433661,H10 Universitat,No Negative, While checking in our room was upgraded by the hotel at no additional cost since there was an availability We went out for drinks and when came back in the room was a complimentary bottle of champagne 
433662,H10 Universitat, Rooms too small No drawers to put clothes in so I needed to use my suitcase as storage I would not return to this particular H10 because of the size of the rooms , Location staff were fantastic
433663,H10 Universitat,No Negative, I slept in room 103 and I think it must have been next to the washing maschines because it was so nosy all night long Not very nice Secondly people could see through my window as there was only a thin curtain in the room so I didn t really like that Apart from all that the hotel in itself was nice and great great location 
433664,H10 Universitat, That we had to upgrade as the room was v small with no outlook whatsoever and we were there from six days, The location The breakfast The cleaness of room The staff 
433665,H10 Universitat, Rooms and corridors have laminate flooring and very thin walls so were woken frequently with toilets flushing people having sex walking using the corridor and maids from 8am Rooms also tiny you can open the door from your bed , Good shower and roof terrace
433666,H10 Universitat, The small size of the rooms and lack of air conditioning Rather expensive for what you get , The staff were incredibly helpful friendly and informative They couldn t do enough to make our stay the best possible Even with a mess up by our booking company they resolved it to the best of their ability 
433667,H10 Universitat,No Negative, I left my necklace in the hotel room and realized it when I was already out of the city The staff mailed the necklace to me as soon as possible I was very touched and grateful 
433668,H10 Universitat, The basic room has only a glass wall separating the bathroom room wasn t very soundproof some rooms have windows facing only a small shaft like space couldn t really tell between night and day But it s all minor stuff , Excellent breakfast rather comfortable bed outstanding location right next to the airport bus stops Universitat and Pl de Catalunya Very good for a short stay 
433669,H10 Universitat, If you stay you d better put don t disturb on the door Cleaning starts at 9 am However the room was well cleaned Was good , Good location Minibar was good The reception was very kind Everyday the room was well cleaned 
433670,H10 Universitat, The price from booking com is really higher than walk in price and even higher than other agency I don s see any reason to continue use booking com The room wall cannot seperate voice from neiboughour room ,No Positive
433671,H10 Universitat, All minor niggles Our beds rolled away from the wall if we sat up in bed and leant back Silly little expresso cups to use for coffee tea not big enough for normal drinks No kettle for tea although there were tea bags in the room Had to use water from the coffee pod machine My son didn t like the frosted glass bathroom door it could not be locked , Excellent location Lovely quiet dark room at night you d never guess its on a busy street Super quiet air con heating Lovely rooftop seating area 
433672,H10 Universitat, Our room was tiny the door just about opened without touching the bed just enough room to walk around the bed and a very small wardrobe However the bathroom was massive , The bed was comfy free toiletries replenished most days staff were friendly
433673,H10 Universitat, Uncomfortable bed and noisy Noises came from water pipes it sounded like the pipes were running through the room Woke us up through the nights shame the alcohol was so dear on the premises would of spend lots more money at the hotel if it was cheaper , Lovely cosy little room with everything we needed Everything was clean Clean towels and bedding every day 
433674,H10 Universitat, Facilities on rooftop patio not open had to get own drink and take it up in lift Hotel is missing an opportunity especially at new year time Walls very thin could hear people in next room, Hotel was quite central had rooftop patio
433675,H10 Universitat, Nothing, I was very contented with excellent staff including bartender clean cozy and nice room It is very close to the attractions and there are many nice restaurants near by Thank you for the hand writing welcoming letter yummy chocolate and cava If i have a chance to visit Barcellona again i will stay at the hotel 
433676,H10 Universitat, The roof terrace closes at 21 00 I ve chosen this hotel because of it as we wanted to watch New year s fireworks from Pla a d Espanya and avoid going out to the street After staying in other H10 hotels in Barcelona where the roof was always open for guests regardless the hour we were very disappointed to find out that it s not available It s understandable that the hotel might want to keep certain schedule but on a night like new years there was a place to enable guests to enjoy the view the roof offer However even though we and several other guests asked for it to be open if only for the 15 min of the fireworks we were met with no explanation a shrug saying that s that Very thin walls we were able to hear the snoring man women in the next room and every door that closed in the hall if you e a light sleeper come with good earplugs In the future will rather stay in other H10 hotels which are also close to Pla a de Catalunya like H10 Montcada which I found to be excellent and does much more to give its guests good experience , Excellent location Close to the Gothic quarter and Pla a de Catalunya which is the central point for many buses metro lines to different parts of the city Very nice roof terrace with good view of the city Nesspresso machine in the room which enables you to have a nice coffee when you want
433677,H10 Universitat, The room did not have a view out onto the city but instead was just looking onto the building No fresh air able to come into the room and air con was very poor The room was perfect for just the two of us but some people may feel it was on the smaller side , Location of hotel was great very close to things and easy access to metro stations shops restaurants etc 
433678,H10 Universitat, Our room 404 was very small especially for 2 persons with luggages We bought from the hotel reception tickets for sagrada familia and they charged us commission without informing us in advance Maybe its their policy but i would like to inform me , Couldn t ask for a better location The interior is really nice Bathroom is very comfortable Consierge was always willing to help Value for money 
433679,H10 Universitat, Accepted a room upgrade which was a lovely gesture but found out later that our request for late checkout could not be given as this room was booked Our flight wasn t till 9 that evening however we could leave our cases and use hotel facilities if we needed too Which was fine so we did Thanks , Hotel creates s very relaxed atmosphere Good quality decor and service and food lovely Easy walking to all attractions with helpful friendly staff Stayed here before been updated since Tastefully done Love it and will be back 
433680,H10 Universitat, No signal on TV, Location just off Placa de Catalunya ideal for accessing main sites within walking distance Metro on doorstep as well Modern striking decor in hotel Breakfast excellent Wifi access all over hotel
433681,H10 Universitat,No Negative, would recommend to a friend breakfast was superb Location is great 1 block from hop on hop off facilities were great overall I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to be centrally located and oh yes 1 block from mc donalds
433682,H10 Universitat, The cost of Breakfast is too high in my opinion and the air con was turned off not working It was 26 in room and noisy if you have to leave balcony doors open Not really a huge problem as we still love this hotel and would always recommend , We had been before to H10 Universitat the staff are friendly and helpful Adele and Cesc are especially lovely Bed very comfy sheets pillows good quality Would have liked a walk in shower but will request next time 
433683,H10 Universitat, Room on small side though we were warned of this But good use of space good bathroom But overpriced despite good location, Great location friendly helpful staff welcome glass of cava upon arrival 
433684,H10 Universitat, Rooms could be bigger View from back side really poor, Location is great 100 meters from Plaza Catalu a and Barca s Official Store Incredibly large double bed Friendly staff
433685,H10 Universitat, There seemed to be a problem with providing tea cups in the room only had coffee cups and not enough tea bags and milk Being charged over 4 euros for two tea bags , Bed was very comfortable but room was too small Is this reflected in the price 
433686,H10 Universitat, might be a swimming pool , Great location so close to the plaza of Catalunya beds are very comfortable we are onn7th floor facing the main road but still very quiet free wifi is great Nice stay in Barcelona 
433687,H10 Universitat, Room was tiny and more specifically I stayed with a friend and the bathroom was literally in the room and there was no privacy , convenience cleanliness staff helpful
433688,H10 Universitat, There could be more space in the room for stowing clothes and putting away the empty luggage , The roof bar is one of the highlights sipping a drink with a view at Barcelona s nightlife is gorgeous Breakfast is very good both in quality and width of offer Staff is very friendly and supportive 
433689,H10 Universitat, the best mattress is not comfortable at all , The room is good with right amount of aminities and location was great as well Staff super helpful and friendly Gr8 value for the money

433692,H10 Universitat, The single room is a bit narrow no much room to arrange things in contrast the bathroom is very large , The hotel is in an excellent position very close to Plaza Catalunya Rambla AirBus to the airport metro My room was clean and very quiet air conditioning and Wifi were ok the staff is very friendly I did not try breakfast too expensive 
433693,H10 Universitat, To state clearly which room is suitable for family as we upgrade our room as we have dicover that our double room is not allowed to have any child over 2 years, Location
433694,H10 Universitat, the hotel needs maintenance floorboards were peeling or had water damage air con wasnt sufficient would rate at lower end of 4 star Would recommend their H10 Montcada hotel instead although pricier , nice and helpful staff saving grace for hotel decent location 
433695,H10 Universitat, The breakfast was quite expensive , Roof terrace and the view over the city was fascinating The location near the city centre was good and the metro station was near less than 5 minutes walk There were many delicious parts in the breakfast although it was quite expensive Nearby there are cafes where you can also eat breakfast 
433696,H10 Universitat,No Negative, Excellent Very central location to all sites one needs to see either within walking distance or short trip Close to metro and bus station Nicest safest and most elegant part of Barcelona Super for best shopping at Porta del Angel Passeig de Gracia and many others 2 mins to Rambla Many good restaurants in vicinity Staff ALL very nice and helpful Breakfast very good too Very nice ambience in dining room Hotel is very clean Excellent shower Bed very comfortable pillows just right Air conditioning very efficient WIFI very fast This is the hotel we will definitely book again in Barcelona Great

433699,H10 Universitat, The shower only produced tepid water despite being turned as high as possible Sometime it was just down right cold water Not pleasant first thing in the morning , The rooms were very clean comfy The location is good as well 
433700,H10 Universitat, I was disappointed when I got there and the connecting rooms that had been confirmed were not available to us We paid for the upgrade to a room with a balcony but that was not necessary , Very clean The staff was very nice Location is fantastic 
433701,H10 Universitat, Rooms were very small not much space for luggage , The hotel was in a great location 1 block away from the Placa de Catalunya and a supermarket right next door Although rooms were very small they were clean and modern and well equipped 
433702,H10 Universitat, was all good for once, The rooms were spacious and delightful Had a massive wetroom area Breakfast was a good layout and good choice doorman was really pleasant and helpful
433703,H10 Universitat, Visible dust on the side of the minibar while that area is difficult to access the hover tube should do it Otherwise the room and bathroom were very clean , Welcoming staff good location spacious room requested quiet room was indeed quiet easy to control A C super comfortable mattress roof top bar is nice too While H10 Arts hotel is my favourite this one come close as it s a good value for money 
433704,H10 Universitat, Our check in time was 2pm When we arrived at 2pm our room still wasn t ready We had to wait another 30 minutes , All the staff were friendly the doorman staff behind reception desk and cleaners The location was ideal near bus stops and metro 
433705,H10 Universitat, Car park does not belong to the hotel quite far away No special parking zone in front of the hotel for guests you need to stop at the bus lane taking the risk of getting a fine Air conditioning a bit too weak to be able to deal with the temperatures outside , Nice roof top good interior Room had a balcony towards the street providing a nice view we didn t notice any noise from the street 
433706,H10 Universitat,No Negative, The stuff was great Christian was very helpfull guy And guide us to places Which we give him the map through the cell The position of the hotel is very good Near 
433707,H10 Universitat, There is always something that you can find that you don t like But while on vacation you have to allow for things not to be perfect for it is not your home So I don t have anything negative to say We make the best of any hotel we stay in while away , Great location Our room was very clean and the bed was comfortable We had a room with the terrace which was very nice for relaxing in the evening Our stay was very short only 2 nights but the staff was very helpful in assisting us with questions We would recommend this hotel and we ourselves would use it again

433709,H10 Universitat, The room with two twins or one queen was very small We stayed in Hotel Jazz one night before moving to the H10 and that room was about 50 larger for the same price , Location and the nice architecture and feel of the hotel very modern and clean Coffee pot in the room a plus Bathoom was nice but on the small side 
433710,H10 Universitat, Nothing All was good , The location of this hotel excellent closer to catLunya square Comfortable bed Small balcoy but excellent view to the street All clean all very good Thanks to wonderful staff Brgds solly
433711,H10 Universitat,No Negative, Location is brilliant just by cataluna square and the top of the rambla loads of transport around you Easy for the airport bus tourist bus metro 
433712,H10 Universitat, No slippers and complementary water bottle was in the room toilet door was uncomfortable to go in and close In meeting room area there were flies and mosquitos, Very friendly staff especially Grace in the breakfast restaurant
433713,H10 Universitat, Room 107 was comfortable but a little strange with the bathroom just behind a sliding glass door Breakfast at 18 is dear El Fornet 50 yards away is a better bet , Very friendly and helpful Reception staff lounge waiter also very quick 
433714,H10 Universitat, Attention to detail like no batteries for r c no milk for Tassimo machine etc Rooms a little small , Clean rooms Roof top terrace Stylish bar Tassimo macchine in room 
433715,H10 Universitat, Hotel did not provide complementary water in the rooms , We didn t realise that the hotel room did not come with bedroom slippers and kettle However upon request they provided them immediately So thats good Sink drainage wasn t very good and made a loud gurgling sound occasionally But it was still tolerable Good and convenient location 
433716,H10 Universitat, The water temperature of the shower is not stable , Great location it s in the centre of Barcelona The room is clean and tidy Fast wifi connection Gd value for money 
433717,H10 Universitat,No Negative, Welcomed upon arrival and was given a complimentary bottle of cava birthday celebrations as requested Staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble Location was excellent Fab stay city and a great weekend was had 
433718,H10 Universitat, The curtains let in too much light from the street To make a cup of tea I had to use the hot water from the coffee machine which resulted in my tea tasting vaguely of coffee , The staff were friendly and always willing to help 
433719,H10 Universitat, I gave breakfast a miss at 18 euros it was the price of a decent evening meal in the neighbourhood Lots of nearby cafes if you just want a coffee and a croissant , My room was quiet and a little oasis of calm to return to from the busy street It was smart but fairly small well furnished and clean The hotel is in an excellent location near Aerobus 2 or 3 metro stations and close to the smart Passeig de Gracia and Rambla de la Catalunya Wi fi was excellent in my room quick and strong 
433720,H10 Universitat, Extremely noisy Because of tiled floors in corridor every bit of noise was magnified Room attendants very noisy doors do not close quietly they slam shut , Excellent location
433721,H10 Universitat, The basic room we were in was not very soundproof as the door opens straight into the room with the corridor very close to where we were sleeping We were often woken in the night or in the morning by people leaving or going into their rooms , Great location staff were very friendly and the hotel room was clean and had everything we needed 
433722,H10 Universitat, The rooms were very small and the airconditioning didn t work very well, I liked how the hotel was so central to everything and the staff were very friendly
433723,H10 Universitat, The room we stayed was simply unacceptable The door did not shut properly letting light and sound pass throw The window to the street was really old with no soundproofing what so ever and since we were in the 1st floor it was really noisy and we could even hear the conversations of people in the street So we didn t have any sleep that night Also you need to sort the parking issue we paid parking only to be delayed 20 min in the parking lot for a second confirmation of payment from the hotel staff , Just the location and the free nespersso but it was decaf 
433724,H10 Universitat, Would have preferred a proper door on the bathroom The thin glass one doesn t give much privacy Also lots of noise from outside as it s a busy area , A welcome drink upon arrival Very clean and inviting room 
433725,H10 Universitat, Nothing , Great place in a perfect location Two minutes walk to two Metro stations and from the Rambla The staff is very nice and helpful We had a room on the eighth floor so it was very quiet I would recommend the stay in H10 Universitat hotel and hoping to visit there again 
433726,H10 Universitat,No Negative, Great location super friendly staff excellent breakfasts We spent 5 days in Barcelona and the location of this hotel was perfect for both the Gothic quarter and the Eixample district Keeping this review simple there was pretty much nothing to complain about Would stay there again without a doubt 
433727,H10 Universitat, The smell of damp in the room was a way too strong If they wouldn t have an air conditioner it wouldn t be possible to sleep, Location and roof terrace were good
433728,H10 Universitat, We had a basic room and the sink is in the bedroom on a very small shelf It wasn t the most practical arrangement and as the sink was very small the water splashed over the shelf and floor so it was difficult to keep makeup etc dry However we had friends in standard rooms and their bathrooms were completely separate which was a much better arrangement , This hotel is very modern and clean We loved the roof terrace which offers great views over the city The staff were very friendly and helpful It is in a central location just a stroll away from La Ramblas I would highly recommend this hotel 
433729,H10 Universitat, We had late check in notified the hotel and were then given a very poor room late at night instead of the room we booked We were then charged for the superior room that we did not get moved into until the next evening Disappointing ,No Positive
433730,H10 Universitat, Hotel is located above one of the city s bus stop areas so you may hear bus noise for us it wasn t a problem but if you are a very light sleeper perhaps requesting an interior room is best Also to note if traveling with a small baby or child under 2 a basic room is not allowed for three people even if the baby is to sleep in the bed with the parents just a note when booking so you aren t surprised , Contacted staff via booking com special request box regarding a birthday surprise for my husband and received an answer quickly offering a romance package cava chocolate covered strawberries waiting in the room for 40 euro After filling out a credit card authorization and sending it via email to the customer representative all was done When we arrived the goodies were waiting in the room as promised The location is very good near Plaza de Catalunya and within walking distance to that area of town Staff was helpful in calling to make a dinner reservation for us and welcoming of our 1 5 year old daughter Room balconies can be walked out on and can see the plaza from there 
433731,H10 Universitat, The walls are thin which means that you are aware of your neighbours and people walking past the door It didn t become a problem , I enjoyed the hotel s proximity to two Metro Stations and the Airport bus I enjoyed visiting the Terrace at sunrise and sunset My bed was very comfortable 
433732,H10 Universitat, It would be better if complimentary water bottles are given and to have an iron Have to ask for water kettle if available thankfully it was available for us so yay , Very strategic location near to the metro and shopping area in front of the bus stop and especially convenience store Receptionist very helpful especially adrian and even the door man Loved our room and was clean and everything was new Nespresso machine also available The toilet dried up pretty quickly as well and a lot of toiletries and good towels available 
433733,H10 Universitat, Great selection of breakfast but food could have been hotter , Great location just 5mins walk from aerobus stop Friendly staff to greet us with complimentary drink Very helpful with info on how to get to sight seeing locations Room spacious clean and very comfortable 
433734,H10 Universitat, The bar seemed to close early I never actually saw it open The roof terrace was excellent but would have been better with a bar up there , Location and staff were extremely friendly and helpful The check in was particularly swift 
433735,H10 Universitat, the hotel and the whole H10 hotel chain position themselves at a 4 star level howevere the hotel does not provide for a free bottle of water in the room at least one bottle at the arrival would be fine and there were no slippers and bathrobe in the room the towels are of a bad quality I am planning a two week trip to Spain in December 2016 and I was considering hotels of H10 chain for my accompdation I decided to check one hotel in Barcelona there is no balance of price quality here And I will look for alternatives , good location spacy double rooms nice terrace on the roof of the building which is worth visiting in sunny days you can negotiate additional 1 2 hours for free after the check out deadline 
433736,H10 Universitat, the fact that there was no daylight in the room faced the narrow high backyard in the middle of the building very noisy during the night when you hear everything because there is a loud airconditioning machine for the whole building breakfast to expensive t, the location the clean room coffee machine but just one welcome coffee
433737,H10 Universitat, Room was so tiny booked a room for 1 2 people and if there was a second person you would have to put your bags in the bathroom as no space whatsoever, Breakfast was fabulous and was the reason for my return visit along with its great location
433738,H10 Universitat, The staff were nice and helpful but the poor barman was covering two bars and room service Be aware that they verify your credit card details before you go by taking out and then putting money back in My card company saw it a fraudulent activity and blocked my card , This hotel is in a great location for las Ramblas shops restaurants and bars You can pick up hop on hop off bus to go sightseeing The hotels choice for breakfast were great the rooms were clean with a fair amount of space 
433739,H10 Universitat, Bars closed so no late night drinks and sketchy service on roof terrace, Room good size bed and bathrooms good standard and comfortable Location and grew roof terrace
433740,H10 Universitat, Street noise Specifically buses backing up with warning hazard beeps day and night , Location was good Included breakfast was better than expected 
433741,H10 Universitat, The price was significantly more expensive in comparison to a 5 star hotel AVENIDA However I must mention that I booked my room in this hotel a little bit later in comparison to my colleague who ordered earlier I enjoyed the breakfast and free Wi Fi ,No Positive
433742,H10 Universitat, The bar on the ground floor had a sign saying closed and the roof top bar was open if you wanted a drink It was a bit cold in the evening to sit up there We had the sound of running water like a shower running all night Couldn t sleep Booked room with a terrace but no lighting out there so couldn t sit out in evening , Our room was very clean and the staff were friendly The arrival drink was a nice touch The location was good for our purpose 
433743,H10 Universitat,No Negative, Nice friendly staff Staff at reception Recommended a nice sea food restaurant along the Marina and what a great choice indeed The best sea food place we have eaten so far hands down We thoroughly enjoyed it and the food was just amazing Sorry I lost the business card and I can t remember the restaurant s name It was a positive experience from an otherwise unpleasant start of the evening for on our way to the marina we had an unpleasant experience with the taxi driver who drove us there The drive was plain rude and very aggressive At one point he and another driver were arguing with each other bec Our diver had cut him off We felt uncomfortable and was getting scared We wanted to get off from the cab Luckily we reached the marina in one piece without getting into an accident Not only was the driver rude and unfriendly he also overcharged us for the fare by pressing the meter more than once so we ended up paying 5 6 euros more than we should When we got back to the hotel we reported the incident at the front desk since they were the ones who called the taxi for us Christian Fernandez the hotel s concierge called the Taxi company and relayed our bad experience with the supervisor The next morning Christian informed us that the taxi company supervisor reimbursed our fare and apologized for the driver s erratic driving and rudeness What a big surprise I did not expect to be refunded for the fare but we were very appreciative This is what I call great service and being attentive to the guest needs I would recommend this hotel to anyone I will not hesitate to stay at this hotel again if and when I return to Barcelona 
433744,H10 Universitat, The room was tiny the smallest hotel room I ve ever stayed in The bathroom was essentially part of the room itself with the wall and door consisting of a glass screen More bothersome though was the noise the corridors aren t carpeted so the slightest sound reverberates and I was woken up several times by other guests , The location was perfect 2 minutes away from Placa da Catalunya with lots of good cafes and bars nearby The rooftop bar is also lovely staff there fantastic
