48808,Sofitel Paris Arc De Triomphe, When they make up the room they can ensure it is clean they did not pick up the showercap wrappers after they had been used had left the wrappers as it on the table, The staff was very helpful made sure our comfort was taken care of They were very pre emptive to our needs
48809,Sofitel Paris Arc De Triomphe, Nothing maybe it s a bit pricey , The location close to The Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees restaurants shops and metro stations Very convenient We watched some of the national day fireworks from our balcony 
48810,Sofitel Paris Arc De Triomphe, I have bought a early checkin and when we arrived our room was not ready We have to wait almost 30 minutes do go to the room In the same day we try to eat something in the bar At 10 10pm I ordered a sandwich and until almost 11 pm it had not yet arrived I canceled my order after knowing that the sandwich machine was in trouble Why did not they tell me that when I ordered the food The hotel don t have a well trained staff Unfortunately Sofitel is out of my list of the best hotels , The location and the cleanliness

48813,Sofitel Paris Arc De Triomphe, There was no security scanning at the entrance and that was worrying in the light of events in today s world The room was not as spacious as I would have loved or thought going by the booking com description, The location was excellent for a solo traveler bed was very comfortable
48814,Sofitel Paris Arc De Triomphe, I was having a very different opinion about Sofitel but this one was not even close to that Most of the experiences were negative a Restaurant staff were very rude and they do not know how to treat the customers b Breakfast options not good very limited and routine c Not much option for Lunch and Dinner d In house restaurant didn t even had veggies for preparing a Salad for a dinner e At 10 30 nothing except a soup was available for dinner in an in house restaurant then hows it a 24 hour restaurant f Doorman staff were not that friendly , Hmm good question but to be honest it didn t meet my expectation Room service and house keeping was bit ok 
48815,Sofitel Paris Arc De Triomphe,No Negative, We had a wonderful time here The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and attended all of our needs Check in and Check out were swift and uncomplicated The croissants at breakfast were delicious The hotels location near the Champs lys e made it very easy to explore and enjoy Paris We will return here for sure

48817,Sofitel Paris Arc De Triomphe,No Negative, We were the guests of the day at our arrival received beautiful and comfortable room with welcome drink Service is excellent staff is polite and discreet However the room had street view noise was filterd by the windows which ensure us relaxing nights and afternoons in the room I strongly recommend it 
48818,Sofitel Paris Arc De Triomphe, We haven been in dring congress time and the room is far overpriced When sleeping with open window it is pretty loud AC users might not face that problem , Hotel is very clean and has a nice breakfast
48819,Sofitel Paris Arc De Triomphe, Low internet speed Massive charge for high usable speed internet Had to wash our own cups think house keeping missed them Room service was of good quality but we had one meal turn up cold and the prices are quite high , Super comfortable bed Staff were really friendly The staff Spoke better English than me I m English The location right next to the Champs Elysee was ideal for getting out and seeing the city View from room was lovely 
48820,Sofitel Paris Arc De Triomphe, Booking com did not make it clear that I hadn t paid for breakfast with the booking or maybe I made the wrong assumpton I had to pay the difference during checkout Breakfast was a great spread and delicious but quite pricey , We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Sofitel Arc de Triomphe and intend to make it our regular place to stay whenever we visit this great city Particularly liked our junior suite the guest lounge with its books the gym the bar and breakfast 
48821,Sofitel Paris Arc De Triomphe, We had to move rooms because there was bed bugs we had spent an awful lot of money at that hotel and was extremely disappointed , The staff was lovely great service lovely food in the restaurant 
48822,Sofitel Paris Arc De Triomphe, Not great value specially considering 1000 per night paid for Prestige suite and without even having breakfast included , Great location small rooms typical of London Paris even whilst being in a junior suite however ended up moving to Prestige Suite after 3 nights with 50 sqm of space but very expensive at almost 1000 per night Great staff and service Dined at their great restaurant Les Cotittes for 4 nights in a row Magnificent food and great cocktails 
48823,Sofitel Paris Arc De Triomphe, Small room even Jr suite was not spacious Breakfast is poor Wi Fi is quite slow, Good staff Clean rooms Fast service Area is quite and close to everything I would like to stay again here
48824,Sofitel Paris Arc De Triomphe, Washroom sliding door got jammed and one door couldn t slide any more Couldn t fix it myself and found separation between door and wall dirty from lack of cleaning This is why the facilities and cleanliness parts didn t receive better grades I would rate this a 4 star hotel and not a 5 star ,No Positive
48825,Sofitel Paris Arc De Triomphe, In room dining menu can be improved with more casual options Hygiene could be better Automated procedures to welcome guests can be more personalised It was great to have a cake and a letter to wish me a happy birthday but the title was Mr instead of Miss Madame Mademoiselle , I stayed for my birthday got a nice happy birthday card cake Very nice helpful staff They try their best to understand your requirements regardless of your French language skills The concierge helped me to book dinner in a restaurant that I wanted to try The location is good for those who look for a quiet stay and do not mind walking for few minutes to the Champs lys es Taxis are available easily too and not too expensive 
48826,Sofitel Paris Arc De Triomphe, The Bose sound system is outmoded and can t be used with current generation iPhones without a Lightning to 16Pin adapter , The location was superb right in the middle of a quiet neighborhood yet not too far from the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs lys es The staff were all excellent and charming The food came in generous amounts compared to most places I ve been to I actually couldn t finish the meal I ordered 
48827,Sofitel Paris Arc De Triomphe, The bed mattress was not great It was a king bed that felt uneven It was higher in the middle and flat on the ends That s what happens to a spring mattress Nothing feels right when your mattress at home is a Tempurpedic Also the room was a little small for a Jr suite but I guess it s normal for Europe , The staff was excellent Restaurant was amazing Perfect locatiion Overall experience was A

48833,Sofitel Paris Arc De Triomphe, Inadequate Human Resource Management The service level was good in patches good part was that at the checkin they accompanied us to the room On the other hand I had to wait for a long time at front desk to get an additional access card at least 15 minutes and then for conceirge at the time of checkout another 20 minutes so definitely something not to talk about In the end I noticed conceirge focal person came personally to pick the luggage May be staff shortage or poor resource management , Location

48846,Sofitel Paris Arc De Triomphe, Rooms were not as spacious as i thought it would be due to the layout like most properties in paris the toilet is separate from the rest of the bathroom , the staff were super which really makes such a huge difference in any hotel the room and the hotel in general was extremely clean and everything worked the way it should complimentary water everyday was very welcomed i rarely find this in hotels outside the middle east espresso machine in the room was fantastic should be a new requirement to get a 5 star rating if you have a special occasion the hotel is more than happy to help you organize anything ahead of your trip from flowers to chocolates to even reservations
