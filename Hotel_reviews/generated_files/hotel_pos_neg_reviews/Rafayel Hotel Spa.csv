154911,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Everything was adequate , The first night very noisy with group of people stood outside below our first floor room and kept us awake The second night the party of people had left so all was quiet and we could sleep 
154912,Rafayel Hotel Spa, There wasn t anything I was unhappy about loved it all, I loved how clean the room was very impressed with how helpful the staff were Will definantly go again 
154913,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Waiting 3 hours to check in while people who arrived after me checks in ahead Had even phone to advise early check in Others were accommodated ahead of me , Amazing bed Great bathrooms
154914,Rafayel Hotel Spa, In the sparoom one of the steam rooms wasn t available was a shame as I really enjoyed the spa , Was a lovely hotel very comfortable room quite staff was friendly and helpful Also very clean plus a beaiful view from our hotel room I would happily stay again 
154915,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Helicopters flying outside my bedroom window for hours so couldn t sleep kept waking me up it was constant and very loud For the pleasure of 389 staff didn t talk to me other than quick basics at check in and check out didn t even ask how my stay was so didn t get a chance to give feedback so disappointed as expected alot more as I wanted to treat my partner to a spa weekend but was ruined by not being advised an army of helicopters will be 50 feet from my bed so didn t even bother to try it, Hot tub and the high ceiling windows
154916,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Wifi reception was terrible Couldn t open the windows to let fresh air in so the bedrooms all have a musty smell to them Air conditioning was too noisy to sleep through Mini bar prices ridiculous although same in every hotel No coffee pods available for the coffee machine and reception had none Mood lighting in the bathroom not practical for shaving was a comment from my colleague Not really 5 star , Nice sized rooms and bathrooms
154917,Rafayel Hotel Spa, I don t feel that this hotel should be rated a 4 5 star It was nice but no way near to that nice The room was very average , The location the staff 
154918,Rafayel Hotel Spa, We parked our car underneath the hotel which cost 15 a night and you had to ask a member of staff if you wanted to go to your car, The room was a lovely size and we particularly liked the floor to ceiling windows
154919,Rafayel Hotel Spa, I didn t like the fact i had paid a lot of money to stay but yet I still had to pay 4 to watch a film on the tvs I also was not made aware that I didnt have a river view until the day before , I liked the room we had it was very spacious and clean The bar was nice and I liked how we could order takeaways to the hotel 
154920,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The shower was difficult to work out even with instructions still didn t work properly It also wasn t very clean inside the shower with a build up of grime where the shower clearly hit the wall That people could easily see into our room unless the curtains were closed The staff on reception didn t have great knowledge of the area or services they were helpful in trying to find out but didn t give us the greatest of confidence , The shuttle bus to the station The room was ready when we checked in early 
154921,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Some of the staff were not very pleasant aloof The lighting in both the hotel and room wasn t good very gloomy The refreshments coffee wasn t replenished on the second night , Spacious and clean Fantastic shower and vert comfortable bed 
154922,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The only negative ghing we didn t like was the location of our room withon the building it was on the ground level with lots of large windows all the vehicular access to the hotel drove passed our room therefore privacy wasn t great , The location was ideal for where we were visiting so for us that was the main purpose for our stay 
154923,Rafayel Hotel Spa, That there is no twin rooms in the hotel and it s a long walk to restaurants other than the one inside the hotel and also room was looking out onto the restaurants bin store and staff parking I think it was so was noisy up till midnight ish, It s in a position we re the area in the next 10 years will be absolutely buzzing
154924,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Shower leaked excessively despite heeding the warning and placing a bath mat towel next to door Only one key card and one spare pillow Lift was VERY unsteady and worrying every time we used it Staff kept questioning who we were why were we there , Beautifully big bed fab air conditioning and free shuttle to train station 
154925,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Total confusion between check in and check out staff Check in said breakfast had been included as an automatic upgrade then check out wanted to charge for it and were quite adamant to the point of wanting to check CCTV for proof , Self contained appartment overlooking a part of the Thames and views of central London in the distance 
154926,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Small signs of wear and tear on furniture iv not seen in other 5 stars but perfectly ok considering the price, Beautiful location on riverside close to Chelsea 
154927,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Although I am all in for planet care it was way to dark in the bath room Wall next to the toilet has not been cleaned in a while as it was soiled when we arrived Hotel is very hard to find needs better signage Events during the second and third night might give the impression that the rooms are sold hourly Had to go to the reception at 1 30 am and ask for security No apologies from hotel staff , Absolutely beautiful room very modern stylish large and well furnished bathroom was luxurious We had some minor issues with the air con and the safe that where addressed immediately and to our satisfaction 
154928,Rafayel Hotel Spa, LOCATION It s a little out of the way and isn t served by a tube station so it s either Clapham Junction 10 minute walk or taxi so help you get anywhere a decent distance away AIR CON Controlling the air con temp wasn t possible and room was too cold at night so we had to ask reception to switch it off completely , THE ROOM SUITE The suite was very spacious and great for hosting our 9 year old SERVICE Great team very professional 
154929,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The location is so far noting that the hotel provides free shuttle bus The staff are not friendly beds are not really king size bed the room is so expensive for auch a hotel noting that we could find a cheaper rate within the same level of stars and actually we have found on booking very cheap rates like the hamptons aloft hotel the hotel charge you for water noting that there were no complimentary drinks the check out is at 11 am and every hour i am late i should pay 20 pounds and this os the first time i face this issue knowing that i travel a lot and have checked in to lots of hotels , Nothing to like It was a very bad journey 
154930,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Aircon freezing and couldn t turn it off in the room Phoned reception and they turned it off centrally Breakfast in room ok asked for gluten free bread but didn t get it Lighting a bit too dim difficult to do my make up , Fabulous room Helpful staff Great shower Well stocked mini bar 
154931,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The staff were not friendly at all they look very unmotivated and were quite dismissive The restaurant was not that great either , The room was very clean and spacious
154932,Rafayel Hotel Spa,No Negative, Just a little suggest for the food More healthy options like just egg whites omelette Bodybuilders we like the comfort as well but we need to keep our diet 
154933,Rafayel Hotel Spa, It was aiming for high class but just missed the mark and appeared a bit underfinished The first room we had was very dark and overlooked the centre carpark so we asked to be moved which they did and had a better room which was helpful , Nice sized rooms for London though it was a bit further out but still short distance to west London There was a good gym and spa facilities which was a bonus Staff were helpful Good sized bathrooms Nice White company toiletries Nice cocktail bar overlooking the Thames 
154934,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The choice of breakfast should be a different price Only had a slice of toast and some tea and was still charged 14 95 Be good if there were different options price wise , Beds very comfortable
154935,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Breakfast was dull except for excellent service The smoke alarm waking us at 8 30 but the offending smoker was fined , Convenience to our Battersea evening reception and M4 return to Devon Staff were fantastic 
154936,Rafayel Hotel Spa, We had previously stayed at this hotel in November 2016 for my birthday and really enjoyed it therefore we booked to return back in June for my partner s birthday However our return back was awful The staff were rude and unhelpful the room was not as expected No view the layout was not as any of the pictures shown on booking com we then had to upgrade our room at an additional expense like the Junior Suite wasn t costing us alot of money already We will NOT be returning back The duty manager Kuman was extremely rude and very very unhelpful We checked in around 3pm and we were in the lobby with the duty manager u ntil approx 5 30pm and nothing was being done to resolve our issue during our 2 5 hours in the lobby there were 4 other client complaints regarding their room and their stay ,No Positive
154937,Rafayel Hotel Spa, There was no hot watercoming out the shower as it was going warm to cold and then warm then cold again and when I told them about it they said it was regulation that they have the water set at that temperature so me and my partner were shivering when we got out the shower Also when I brought them up on it the receptionist tried down grading me Also I couldn t ring through to get room service so ever time I wanted something I would have to go to the reception and ask for it myself I don t think what I got was 5 or worth 210 a night I was not happy with my stay and would like to speak to the head office of the company and resolve this matter as paying 210 for things to go wrong isn t my ideas of good hospitality ,No Positive
154938,Rafayel Hotel Spa, I could only shower once as the shower was so hard to work asked man to show us still problem As got burnt also got charged twice for breakfast not happy,No Positive
154939,Rafayel Hotel Spa, There was no information about a deposit when I booked the hotel but the receptionist was adamant that there was one and quite rude when I had shown her that there wasn t ,No Positive
154940,Rafayel Hotel Spa, first room s bathroom was not cleaned and I had to change room Room was not made up despite putting up sign to make up room Explanation provided was that they could open the door and through someone was in the room, Comfortable bed and spa facility being offered
154941,Rafayel Hotel Spa, BOOKING COM DOES NOT INFORM YOU WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION when you arrive at this hotel you will be asked for a 50 deposit PER NIGHT Also I highly do not recommend the restaurant , The staff were very lovely and the hotel overall is in a stunning location 
154942,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The light tv system was a bit complicated with no real instructions on how to use The tv in the bathroom was just not working properly We just had to hit the remote in hopes it would turn off as the on switch was not working Was quite warm in the room even with the ac on the lowest setting The mini bar is quite expensive but i guess that is to be expected, The junior suite was amazing Very large and cozy The bed was great and the bath tub with the jets was the icing on the cake Nice quiet area where you can get away from everything Accidentally left my phone at the check in desk and someone ran up to give it to me in my room without me asking The staff were very pleasant and happy 
154943,Rafayel Hotel Spa, We were given room 301 which is an adapted room for people with disabilities This room is not suitable for able bodied in particular if you are tall as the sink is vey low I am not even sure whether this room is suitable for people with disabilities as the bathroom is very slippery and lighting is very poor The room is spacious , Loved the river view great to dine good breakfast the hotel staff were very helpful parking on site Shuttle to the train station 
154944,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Unhelpful staff wanted to charge me 40 to extend my check out time by an hour Unwelcoming receptionists with very poor English Dark corridors even darker stuffy rooms and no way of opening any windows so stuck with AC No tube close by so everywhere had to get taxis Best bit was the comfy bed and 50 deal off all meals in restaurant in evening Hotel was a real let down ,No Positive
154945,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Bar is a bit on the expensive side Staff in the bar restaurant were a bit rude unhelpful, Well decorated finish clearly justifies the star rating Staff at reception very friendly and helpful Spacious rooms Amazing shower
154946,Rafayel Hotel Spa, It is stated that we would have a city view room when in actual fact all I could see was a factory Should not say city view if the view is bad Other than that pretty pleasant,No Positive
154947,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The cost of the restaurant Not a lot of restaurants within walking distance , Really good spacious rooms Located on the banks of the Thames Best of all telly in the bath Awesome 
154948,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Poor welcome on check in from front of house lady no personality no smile no effort Room cramped Bed uncomfortable Lots of noise from below room and coming through aircon vents affected a good night sleep Room stuffy due to no opening windows only air con Raucous atmosphere in restaurant at dinner meant no romantic dinner for the wife and I Food was poor , Restaurant staff were very friendly and helpful Decent value for money for drinks at the bar Lovely outside area to drink and chill Beautiful view from our Superior Thames side room Amazing shower 
154949,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Not sure how flying ants ended up in my room A lot more than I was comfortable accepting as a mishaps Everywhere I went in the hotel I could hear the air con which was not a huge deal but was slightly uncomfortable A lot of hidden charges The junior suite stated that some rooms have Hydro baths however when we arrived we were told it is an extra 30 to be in a junior suite with a hydro bath otherwise we would has a view and a shower We got that taken down to 20 after a chat with management The 15 for breakfast in your room is an extra 4 if you actually want it in your room Only to be told if I wanted an extra Omelette I would be charged even more So essentially I paid 18 for a small Omelette which was nice but small and a croissant Not on Lastly the room was not well enough equipped I called reception and asked if there was supposed to be toothpaste in the room I was told there was not lol but they would do me the favour of sending me some , The Jacuzzi in the bathroom was the hotels saving grace and a brilliant touch as were the speakers around the room and bathroom The restaurant and bar was perfect Food was delicious and the cocktails were made generously I will probably return just for the restaurant which is a lot more gracious at night than in the day The treatments in the spa were very good as were the spa facilities Despite my gripes with the hotel which I detailed below the hotel is actually very good value for money I was just concerned that even in booking the second most expensive room in the hotel I had that many gripes for a hotel with that many stars 
154950,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Room wasn t available Staff didn t understand English Room temp was freezing Shower was small Over all horrible When I told them they didn t care, Absolute disgusting I m a disabled person and booked this for comfort and a retreat before my big operation I ended up ill flared and cried all the way home
154951,Rafayel Hotel Spa, not easy to get to unless you want to travel by bus or taxi Tv in bathroom non working air conditioning not working breakfast poor quality compered to the price 38 for 2, Room spacious staff attentive
154952,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Pool too small, Staff were very nice It s not really a five star hotel in comparison to others I ve stayed at Tiny pool Close to the river and other spots worth visiting 
154953,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Breakfast average with slow service Helicopter pad next to hotel noisy if you sit outside for breakfast , Bus stop 170 outside hotel takes you to Victoria station Courtesy coach available from hotel if you book in advance 
154954,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Being awoken at 7am in the morning by the window cleaner who thought it was acceptable to tap the window with his equipment for over 25 minutes I raised this with the reception desk later in the morning and was told that luckily the window cleaner comes only once or twice a month so this shouldn t be an issue tomorrow The staff seemed to just accept that I d had a very rude awakening When checking out after two nights I was again asked about my stay and I brought up the issue with the window cleaner again and for a second time the staff seemed completely unconcerned for my discomfort I guess they d already taken my money so they were happy , The room was very clean 
154955,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The toilet was too close to the hand basin in room 301 , Excellent room but not overlooking the River Thames The staff were very attentive nothing was too much trouble even parked our car for us in their under ground garage Garage cost per night 15 00 The restaurant food was very good and as you stay there you get a 50 discount on your food bill A large starter was 6 and my main a chicken dish was 13 whilst my wife s steak was 21 Eating outside and watching the sunset was really very lovely experience 
154956,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The dinner menu was supposed to be heavily discounted but was actually just about the right price , River edge location and quiet not a lot of helicopters Clean in good order and modern Our basic price room even let you see the river if you got right by the window Comfy bed 
154957,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The best thing is to keep it as it is superb, All of it and the staff were excellent very nice guy in the car park and a lovely meal over looking the Thames
154958,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The complete exposure in room meant curtains had to closed all the time and the shape of the room was just claustrophobic couldn t wait to leave, The location and parking although expensive on site
154959,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Staff need to have better customer service skills they don t make it about customer it s all about their policy rather then making it comfortable stay for their customers I won t be staying at this hotel again Neither would I recommend it to anyone else , The hotel was ok not what I expected in terms of their policy which we kept on hearing from the staff 
154960,Rafayel Hotel Spa, no flannels no clock no bath shower needed a lesson how to use No radio channels View from room disappointing Noise from helicopters , the bus stops outside to Victoria and the Chelsea Flower show free shttle to Clapham walk over bridge to the show Restaurant on river Lovely rooms Sky sports 
154961,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Lighting in the room poor v dark and controls complicated Need a magnifying mirror in the bathroom , Didn t have breakfast Pizza in the bar late in the evening was good we got the music changed and volume lowered as was more like disco staff helpful 
154962,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Didnt like Nothing absolutly smashed it best hotel iv stayed in best staff there very satisfied with everythink Impressed my wife like never before Jacuzzi most relaxing experience ever , Most amazing luxary and clean place great facilities always have advice anyone to spend a night there Well worth every penny 10 out 10 staff was amazing 
154963,Rafayel Hotel Spa, For a hotel to claim itself as 5 star I was surprised to find that they wanted 2 50 for the water in the room and 1 for a coffee machine pod, courtesy bus to the station
154964,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The accessibility is just a nightmare to get to it Sure its only 5 min taxi from Clapham Junction but that means getting the train from Waterloo The location Battersea is great it s just the accessibility that sucks , Superb room amazing size Comfortable Modern Aircron system great reception Create shuttle service to Clapham Junction 
154965,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The location was a pain to get to most places It s about 20 30min bus ride to the nearest tube We took public transport with 2 huge luggage and a kid it was a pain A transfer from the airport would have been great The shower was a strange thing no matter how I adjust it it went from cold to hot then really hot I had to time to get in to wash myself it was a pain The air con couldn t be switched off so it was really cold at night without a heater , Booked 2 nights to explore Battersea The room size was great room was spacious and clean Breakfast wasn t included but we paid for it and it was great The receptionists are polite enough and can be quite friendly depending who 
154966,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Nothing it was all great, I booked 2 double rooms and at check in they asked if we wanted an apartment This was great we had 2 bedrooms 2 bathrooms lounge with sky tv kitchen with fridge and utensils all set over 2 floors with a great picture window overlooking the river Being with 3 friends all of us entered into the Moonwalk this was great as we could sit around talking and getting ready it was so much more relaxing The hotel asked if we would like free transport to the Moonwalk venue which was brilliant Can t thank them enough 
154967,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Nothing, The exceptional staff Hotel courtesy driver to our venue and train station We were doing moon walk for cancer from Clapham Common and they said we could have extra time in our room as we didn t arrive back u til 4am Nothing was to much trouble 
154968,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The bed would have been more comfortable if it was 2 x 3ft single beds joined together If every room was like this then it would be possible to offer twin rooms which I believe you don t currently offer My husband found the mattress collapsed when he laid at the edge Also I had asked for a quilt to be placed under the bottom sheet because of health reasons But instead another mattress cover was put in place I did mention it to the lady at reception She asked the staff but no one came to change it over I think there was a misunderstanding as to the difference between a mattress cover a quilt , The shuttle from train station was excellent though we waited at the wrong entrance as we hadn t been told otherwise I had asked for 4 pillows which I was given when prompted I had mentioned in an email to the hotel that my husband I were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary When we arrived at our room we found 4 chocolates red petals on our bed plus a note wishing us a happy anniversary But best of all we had been given a room with a view of the river I had asked if it would be possible but didn t it would be possible at the rate we paid That really made me happy as I had pictured in my head that we would wake up in the morning looking at the water And we did Thank you so much The spa beautician made an excellent job of my eyebrows lashes She was super friendly explained everything she was doing 
154969,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The food at the restaurant wasn t great Curried prawn starter not spicy at all The haddock was really firm and I think it was frozen The staff in the hotel were ok and efficient but it did make me think that we are more welcoming up north , The property was really nice and comfortable Great room which I could not fault I couldn t find a hair dryer but not really required 
154970,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Nothing to moan about , Excellent service wonderful staff always smiling and helpful would definitely stay again well done to everyone for making it a lovely weeken 
154971,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Because there were two of us it would have been nice to have two welcome chocolates in our room when we first arrived , Staff were very professional and welcoming There was nothing they would not do to make you feel at ease Trudy the G R manager is so on point with her professionalism along with Ben at reception and another staff member who s name we never checked In fact staff were amazing 
154972,Rafayel Hotel Spa, No air conditioning in the room The room was extremely warm throughout the night causing us to get very little sleep We were only informed by the staff that it could actually be switched on although they didn t favor having it on when we checked out Shower running scolding hot and very cold My wife and I were forced to have very cold showers Advised the staff on check out and they had very little to say about the matter Disappointing really , Nice bed Clean and contemporary feel to the hotel We ve used it before and enjoyed the stay hence this return trip 
154973,Rafayel Hotel Spa, That they charged for delivery of water to my room It is another thing to charge us for the water this is fine but 4 to come up the lift Pretty ridiculous , I love the location it is so easy to find and close enough to central London The overall stay was lovely I surprised my boyfriend with a stay here in the deluxe double room which is HUGE defo worth the money Upon arrival my room was not ready so there was a little wait unfortunately BUT because of this the gentlemen at the desk let us choose our check out time This was so lovely Generally enjoyed my entire stay 
154974,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Room was a bit tired carpet peeling in places Hotel is also difficult to access from public transportation although they offer a shuttle to make up for this Also some rooms face the street rather than the river Spa facilities i e sauna are only open till 8 PM , Staff was very friendly and accommodating of my bike which I was allowed to keep with me in my room The hotel is right on the Thames and accessible from the Thames Path Not quite a 5 star property but this is a good option if you want to explore Battersea and or don t mind staying outside of the city centre of London 
154975,Rafayel Hotel Spa, London breakfast prices My little boy had a bowl of cereal and that cost 9 45 , Lovely spacious room Staff very attentive and friendly Car park a real bonus for us 
154976,Rafayel Hotel Spa, We had to move rooms as there was mould on the bathroom ceiling but once moved the room was fine Wouldn t say it lived up to what s expected from a 5 star hotel Chipped furniture slightly grubby furnishings etc Breakfast wasn t great for the price and the continental selection was limited , The bed was comfortable and staff where friendly enough 
154977,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The shower was dripping once it was turned off The spa and restaurant could of been opened for longer and later maybe till midnight as we didn t get a chance to enjoy it There was no clear instructions to how to keep on or dim lights in the bedroom The water and tea should be free , I liked the ambience it was very quiet The layout was perfect The staff were polite and friendly I thought the junior suite might have a balcony 
154978,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The staff cleanliness and staff attitude I booked for two nights and had to walk out the second day due to nasty horrible staff Liars cheats and rip off hotel Not the best way to spend my anniversary Booking com is also accountable for the misconception the hotel was nothing like described hardly nothing working Engineer had to spend over an hour in my room trying to sort things Bathroom was dusty Staff couldn t speak English took over 30mins to check in Fridge stunk room and corridors smelt of damp No lighting paid for an executive room and ended up with a smelly room Not the size and description shown on booking com pictures didn t even match This place is a joke showed no remorse let us check out without any apologise and charged us for the full two nights Please do not even bother to reply or patronise me You know exactly what you did wrong Especially the part when one of you walked into our room at 7am whilst myself and my partner were undressed in bed He got a good eyeful I was wrong not to have called the police I wish j did now, The soundbar That was the only thing to like 
154979,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The water temperature in the shower is not stable It goes from burning hot to freezing within a fraction of a second , All was fine Spacy room for London Great location on the river close to batersea park 
154980,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The only problem with the room was there was another door into someone else s room next to us and we could hear everything they said and even the tv , It was a lovely hotel with great staff we had no problems over our period we stayed at the hotel The room was amazing especially the bathroom parking was simple 
154981,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The light switches were a bit complicated I ended up sleeping with one dim light on because I couldn t work out how to turn it off , The room was very luxurious with excellent tea and coffee facilities The bathroom was spotless with good quality toiletries towels and face cloths The view over the river was amazing 
154982,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The hotel staff was rude or didn t have a clue not a 5 star hotel needs to improved so much the 2 nights we was there was awful the swimming pool was in construction and didn t say that on there website or on booking com and urban view should state your going to look at a car park and be more clear about it too The room was not clean too and the mini bar never got replenished we used up all the milk and didn t get new milk for teas or coffees They won t take the food away until the next day if you get room service too not a 5 star hotel Needs a lot of work and staff need training too , The bath
154983,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The cold hydrotherapy pool in the spa is out of service Would be great to get this repaired for guests to enjoy alongside the jacuzzi steam room, Complimentary upgrade to room thanks to the manager and really friendly staff Shuttle to the nearest station a nice plus too 
154984,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The standard double rooms have a standard sized bed which doesn t seem right for a hotel advertised as 5 star The room we booked seemed incredibly hot and humid We switched to an excellent larger room on the ground floor which we were more than happy with , This is a great independent hotel It s a 15min walk from Clapham Junction but there is a hotel shuttle service running during the day 
154985,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The hydro pool was not working the jacuzzi was faulty The bar staff were incredibly unprofessional and also the people they allow to drink in there bar we re drunk and rude Also there on arrival there was a huge complaint so that was off putting Guests looked really unhappy We sat outside and there was a huge leak on the floor which wet all my bag No way can this be a 5 star, The room was ok and clean but we had no milk
154986,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Very bad customer service worst room in the whole building Was given a very dark plain room after requesting a room with a view and bath tub on a higher level floor , Nothing
154987,Rafayel Hotel Spa, I had high hopes for this hotel but a complete waste of money It does not live up to its 5 star rating at all There are far better hotels in London The cleanliness of our room was not impeccable as you would expect in a hotel of that standing and I have found better in Premier Inns The bed is good but the room was far too hot and could not turn the temperature down more than a couple of degrees so ended up calling reception in the early morning so we could finally get some sleep The worst was the restaurant food heated up not fresh and barely edible The chairs in the dining room were chipped and the tables outside were dusty Such a let down that I will not be booking again ,No Positive
154988,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Can we please have large bottles of water in the rooms These would really be useful , Everything was excellent the room was superb and the experience second to none The staff were really helpful and nothing was too much trouble In terms of access to the West End and the City the bus service is great with buses till the early hours of the morning You will not be dissapointed 
154989,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Bulbs gone in some lights in the room Distance from transport would make me reluctant to stay with children Although a shuttle bus was available to Clapham Views away from the river are not great , Reception staff when I arrived were really helpful I was able to check in early and my bag was brought to my room for me and the car was parked As I was alone this was really helpful Room was lovely large and spacious and bed is very very comfy 
154990,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Service trying to check in was poor The thermostat in the bedroom did not work properly and would not let us adjust the air temperature to below 23 c so was rather warm all night and so difficult to sleep There was also a very loud noise water pipes or heating which came on early hours of the morning 2 3am and it was so loud it woke both of us up and we struggled to sleep though the noise , Style of the hotel was lovely and room layout was brilliant Close to train station and good value for money Did not eat at hotel so cannot comment on that aspect 
154991,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The meal from the banyan restaurant was poor , We were upgraded from a standard double room to a 2 bed apartment would like to say a huge thank you to the staff for upgrading us for their quality service We will return 
154992,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Noise sleeping very difficult due to yelling shouting and music drunks in bar lack of any management to intervene coffee not hot at breakfast lovely location but just poor management reception no power to do anything , Location 
154993,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The car parking wasn t very clear and when we did find it and did park the car we was told we had to move the car as was in an incorrect bay , The room was huge with big windows The bathroom was beautiful it had a lovely shower massive bath which you could watch tele in I had mentioned it was my boyfriends birthday and they put petals chocolates and a note on the bed Was a nice touch We had a drink in the restaurant along the river they was friendly in there aswell cannot comment on the food as we went out for dinner I would recommended this hotel for a quiet night away 
154994,Rafayel Hotel Spa, My first room had a broken shower and terrible view so I was moved The spa facilities were very below standard and treatments such as massages unavailable These facilities were my only reason for booking this hotel in the first place, The bed was comfy and that s all
154995,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Spa facilities are limited with the controls for the jacuzzi not working properly The pool was out of use but looked small The room temp control wasn t the best as we still felt cold The tv in the bathroom was not working but we didnt need it The tv in the room was in an awkard place amd not adjustable Would also be better if the audio dock was closer to the bed area for control or if a wireless option was available The hotel is also in an area without much around need to travel to clapham area for restaurants and shops, Good media system with audio dock to play your own music throughout the room Also able to Commect your laptop ipad to the tv if you bring your own HDMI cable with access to free wifi Spacious room and the shower was strong
154996,Rafayel Hotel Spa,No Negative, Breakfast was great got room service had a beautiful view of the Thames Dinner in the restaurant was lovely a little quiet though and a bit away from the town 
154997,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Access to car park was restrictive as if you wanted multi visits to get things from your car as you had to be escorted so tended not to go to the car as much as I normally would This was more of an irritation than a problem , Location was great for where we needed to be The hotel was of a high standard well staffed and friendly 
154998,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Food to room charges were a little pricey but understandable for a 5 , Customer service was impeccible and the smart room was great as was the spa and other facilities Was a Birthday stay for my fiance and the guy checking us in informed us of a free upgrade to a Superior suite Felt very spoiled amd definitely will stay again 
154999,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The staff made me feel uncomfortable asking for too much information from myself Put this way I wouldn t recommend any my family or friends to that hotel Wasn t happy at all, The food was OK
155000,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Impossible to have a relaxed shower the water was either got or cold I left something in the hotel and wrote to enquire but received no answer at all , Spacious and quiet room Wonderful bathroom
155001,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The staff were pretty rude on reception and the whole point of going there was the use of the spa The pool wasn t in use which meant everything was just too hot jacuzzi and steam room there was no coldness to offset the heat I almost passed out , Food was great
155002,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Most complicated shower in spite of instructions surely something wrong if instructions needed for a shower in any case Proximity to helipad, Great river view form Banyan restaurant
155003,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The pool was broken , The hotel met all my requirements as requested for my partners birthday Amazing hotel would definitely return and recommend to friends and family 
155004,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The pictures on the walls weren t straight and even had paint on them from the walls the lights didnt work The bottom of the wardrobe was all sticky and dirty not sure what went off in there the ironing board cover well there wasn t one a very cheaply done 5 hotel Not so sure how it got 5 starts 3star max, Bathroom Big windows
155005,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Not happy that the 50 minibar deposit was not mentioned in our booking Being treated as a potential thief was a deeply unpleasant way to begin our stay We ve never had to pay a deposit before and the onus on the hotel is to recover the monies from guests who do abuse the minibar as opposed to making honest guests pay a deposit because of the actions of others I d also add that charging for coffee pods is exceptionally mean spirited Secondly the heating was not adjustable below 18 degrees This is not very green despite the hotels claim to be so Finally some members of staff were dour and unwelcoming This needs to be addressed as it is not pleasant to be greeted with sullen unsmiling staff members , Good sized bed huge clean rooms Quiet 
155006,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Shower operation illogical Very noisy at night with other guests in the corridor making a lot of noise into the early hours woken at 3am Some electrical operations not working lights a c heating , Great view Comfortable bed Good bar Excellent in room tea coffee making facilities Nice helpful staff Secure parking 
155007,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Check in was quite busy but must have been the time I arrived The hydro pool was being reconstructed so was out of use , The feel of the hotel really was lovely The spa was small but quiet so didn t matter at all Intimate feel 
155008,Rafayel Hotel Spa, the bed was two singles pushed together could have been better for 365 pound , the Jacuzzi was great and good choices in mini bar lots of seating in the room also which was nice
155009,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The hotel itself was confusing It was apartments and a hotel which wasn t stated when booking and when I arrived it looked a mess from the outside as the apartments at the top looked like it was a dumping ground for furniture There was no clear entrance for parking or the hotel and we were greeted by a woman who was anything but warm After a couple of minutes she became helpful however never cracked a smile or made us feel welcome The bathroom had hair all in the shower which made us not want to use it Our room was nice clean and spacious but our view was tainted by it literally being face to face with the gym window so I had to be careful when walking around getting changed as people on the tredmills could see me very clearly The whole reason I booked the hotel was because of the spa facilities however the hydropool was out of use which we weren t told and so we cancelled our bookings because we wanted to relax in the pool and we re disappointed we weren t told until check in as this would of changed my mind on the hotel We ordered breakfast room service and ordered tea even though it was free in our room because we wanted larger mugs When it arrived we had no cutlery no cups no spoons no toast So I called downstairs to tell reception which took 3 calls because no one answered and they gave me attitude because I asked for cups and cutlery After 15 minutes we received our cutlery and toast etc however the man delivering it really didn t believe me and came into the room without me allowing him even though I was not dressed comfortably for this On check out I had to pay for the breakfast and the tea and it was not worth the money for the hassle I felt stressed leaving which I shouldn t have , The room was nice Spacious The shuttle service to the station was good and the drivers were very friendly 
155010,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Location is what it is but was not great Access was tough and hard to find especially for taxi drivers The hotel is not 5 Even if I owned it and was trying to big it up I would be embarrassed to called it 5 The place was badly designed grubby and had a whole host of random pieces of furniture everywhere very odd The rooms were not very clean badly maintained and corners had obviously been cut in every aspect Sure signs of a hotel not making money or management who simply don t care Very poor , We had an Emporer Suite and the jacuzzi was OK I can t think of anything else nice to say 
155011,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The TV in the bedroom wouldn t work so we had to call someone up three times and when we was looking for a second remote we found an empty comdom packet in one of the drawers and there was a hair bobble on the side of the bath which suggested the room hadn t been cleaned properly , The jacuzzi in the room and the space of the rooms
155012,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Preauthorisation of card still waiting for a refund of 50 to go back to my account , Spacious rooms great staff and I like the fact it was right by the river 
155013,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The Spa wanted to use the facilities with my friends but the hydro pool wasn t working and we couldn t all fit in the jacuzzi steam room or sauna at the same time very disappointed, The room was spacious and really comfortable
155014,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Unable to control room temperature it was stuck at 25 degrees Jacuzzi was not working during our stay and the whole spa facilities were in any case far too small for a hotel of this size , Excellent room layout comfortable beds river view 
155015,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The jacuzzi and pool were out of use doesn t say on the website or anywhere, The rooms were very nice and bigger than expected Beds were very comfy the bar at night was lovely with all the lights Staff at the bar were also friendly and enthusiastic music was good 
155016,Rafayel Hotel Spa, No bars or eating facilities nearby only restaurant not in hotel being charged 50 pounds deposit on room and having to give I d not told bout either be fore hand miles from any had booked for may but have cancelled overload building yards not great at all, The bed the shower
155017,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Staff were rude unprofessional not helpful and non chalon I tried to set a romantic jacuzzi for my husband the sprinklers were activated and we were drenched along with our MacBook clothes And food Ruining our 5th anniversary The staff moved us next door but we were given nothing complimentary in fact we were made to feel like it was our fault and were promptly asked to leave at 11am We have stayed in hotels around the world and have never been made to feel like this After spending 400 a night for a room we would have attest expected a complimentary breakfast this hotel is HORRIBLE and I pity anyone prepared to invest there hard earned money into a shambles such as this we are horrified and will NEVER be returning here , Nothing
155018,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The rooms facing south overlook a flooring company that seems to have wood cutting sanding machinery day and night an irritating low frequency hum , Beds comfy rooms strangely laid out lots of floor space but little cupboard space for example but good coffee tea area fridge etc great bathroom 
155019,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Service at the restaurant Room temperature not easy to control Bed super uncomfortable Party disco right above the room Shower controls Spa facilities not offered, Food and breakfast was good Check in was fast Could watch the fireworks on New Year s Eve from roof terrace
155020,Rafayel Hotel Spa, I was not informed that the spa pool was closed at checkin and given the was the reason I picked this hotel I was very very disappointed The pool is also very very small which most pictures do not indicate , The room was lovely and the restaurant was amazing for dinner 
155021,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The noise from the helicopter pad was constant during the day s the morning service of the room was very poor there was a stale smell in the bathroom the entire time we were there , Size of room was generous positives pretty much stop there 
155022,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Food was horrible Room not to standard for price I paid The furniture was broken Could hear loud base couldn t sleep Should be 3 star not 5 star , The staff was accomendating
155023,Rafayel Hotel Spa, I have been to 7 different 5 star hotels in London and this seemed more 3 star then 5 stars The bed was not comfortable the room was so small and the room was very small I didn t like the fact they took 50 off my card as a deposit now I have to wait 3 5 for it back They should of taken my details and given me a choice to pay 50 cash so I could get my money back faster , The bathroom mirror
155024,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Wasn t aware that I had to pay a 50 deposit which I am still waiting to be refunded , Nice hotel and room Friendly staff with a quick check in Good location 
155025,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The layout of the room the door to the fridge was broken the lights in the room were not working as I visit many 5 star accommodations this was far from a 5 star to my standard We were only given one room key there was no lift to our room we had to walk up a flight of stairs , Bathroom
155026,Rafayel Hotel Spa, I realised that the hotel was not well sited for public transport and it was not They offer a shuttle service to nearby stations that works well and a friendly local taxi company is on standby , Great value for money Friendly staff Good on site restaurant offering international cuisine 
155027,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Swimming pool jaccuzzi and bar were all unavailable If had been noted we would not have stayed Location is quite far out so nowhere else really to go View over building yard also not ideal , Room was modern clean and large Would have expected some sort of seating for 5 in room but only one desk chair 
155028,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Minor grumble is the lighting Despite this being our forth visit we can never quite get the hang of it Our view wasn t great The river view rooms are nicer but cost more I think 118 is more than enough and wouldn t pay the extra There s nowhere to sit and do your makeup There s a desk but no mirror above it It s a small thing but would have made so much difference to me , Very large bedroom and the bed and pillows were exceptionally comfortable Well stocked mini bar fridge which had room for our fresh milk which was great Huge bathroom with complimentary toiletries from The White Company The shower head is huge and the controls are easy to use Really lovely bar area serving great cocktails and the adjoining restaurant looks over the Thames We ve been to this hotel a few times and the food is hit and miss 50 off for hotel guests I definitely wouldn t eat there if it wasn t for this 
155029,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Heating did not work for a long time spa pool was cold , We loved that we were on the same floor as the spa Friendly staff the bathroom with the TV over the bath very spacious clean great location 
155030,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Staff were unhelpful If i had been expecting a 3 hotel i might have been more satisfied The room was sincerely lack lustre Had a view of the multi storey car park ,No Positive
155031,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Struggled a little with the air con as wouldn t come on in the morning but didn t really effect our stay , Very reasonable price and the staff were friendly and helpful 
155032,Rafayel Hotel Spa, I v booked the hotel via booking com but the reception couldn t find my reservation In the end they offered us a room i ve asked for deluxe exactly like the one i ve booked But unfortunately our expectations haven t been met It was a standard room for the price of a deluxe one small bed walk in shower no tv I am very disappointed as I ve stayed here before and i was really pleased with the room and services But never again at Rafayel I m afraid ,No Positive
155033,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The resistance pool was not working for the spa Also there is no draft beer in the bar, The shuttle that they offered was excellent for us traveling wise The hotel staff were friendly
155034,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The room was big and the air conditioning was noisy which meant I had to turn off the ac heating This then made the room cold in the morning The restaurant wasn t great the speed the food came out I thought I was at a McDonald s not a good experience would not eat there again , The pick up from the tube station was great Checkin was good Hotel is nice but somewhat in need of an update 
155035,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The view although you can pay extra for a better view , The staff were very helpful and friendly Our DVD player didn t work therefore we were allowed to watch some of the movies on the tv for free I liked the tv in the bath aswel 
155036,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Room very small Shower water temperature constantly changing on its own Pillows were uncomfortable Awkwardly placed power sockets Lighting in room wasn t great, Staff very helpful and polite Lights and electronics in room can be controlled by television remote Laptop points at desk for business trips
155037,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The child s bed was a fold up bed and not very comfortable The area really didn t offer anything , Very clean and comfortable The staff were very friendly and helpful Easy access to London 
155038,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The location isn t the best as there aren t any restaurants or bars local enough to walk too however there is a free shuttle service to Clapham junction and common which is close enough and is full of beautiful chain and individual restaurants , The room was very spacious clean and just what we expected The staff were so kind and I d like to say a special thanks to Ben duty manager for making our anniversary such a pleasure 
155039,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The bed was uncomfortable The shower hardly worked and changed between no water water not being able to turn off and the temperature constantly fluctuating They also charge you 1 for a coffee pod in the machine in your room Disgusting , Nothing except the location was good for where we were visiting 
155040,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Lady on check in was rude Lied to us about the suite we had booked I ve stayed at the hotel before Wifi didn t work throughout the bedroom as an international traveler I had to use my data roaming and have racked up a bill for that Shower was not clean Bed was half made when we got there TV broke at 11pm and whilst the technician did his best and did manage to fix it in about 10 minutes we had to get dressed and be inconvenienced whilst it was fixed Avoid this place like the plague I stay in at least one hotel a week and this was my worst experience in 2016 by far , Stayed here twice in the past And thought I would be returning to a decently run and pleasant hotel in Battersea Unfortunately the stay was terrible
155041,Rafayel Hotel Spa, A few of the the fixings and fixings were not working or loose I do like attention to detail and happened to notice the few things there were , We like the hotel in general Have only ever booked the junior suites and enjoyed the last one slightly more than the one this time I find the parking very convenient and appreciate being able to leave it there the next day while visiting the city center 
155042,Rafayel Hotel Spa, My partner and eye fancied a staycation so we booked the Junior suite room 214 We specified that we get that particular room since we had stayed previously stayed in that room We were told it had been sorted but on arrival that hadn t been done and staff doubted us when we said we called and made the request After being given the room we went up and the room smelt of weed and smoke and had two single beds still in the room from the previous guests who checked out We have stayed at this hotel before and loved it hence going back but I am afraid to say that we won t be returning after this experience , The bathroom had excellent detail 
155043,Rafayel Hotel Spa, I wanted to pay cash for my room As i had lost my credit card the day before I wasn t allowed to do so because a deposit had to be taken via a credit card I offered double the room rate as a deposit in cash but the reception staff refused even though i had called the hotel prior to my arrival to explain my situation and assured i would be able to pay cash on arrival Add this to the fact the staff were extremely rude and that we had travelled from swansea and this was xmas day needless to say we weren t impressed ,No Positive
155044,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Not like any 5 hotel I ve ever stayed in before That said it was good value for a a three star price and experience Didn t like the atmospheric lighting the hotel and rooms are badly lit Didn t like the noise from the party on 2 of the three nights we stayed we moved rooms but didn t really help Charging 1 for using a coffee pod on the room is pretty cheap , Spa facilities are nice Good quality beds and bathrooms Staff polite 
155045,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Breakfast was not included which I didn t realise As we ultimately stayed in one of their apartments it didn t matter as we popped to the Sainsburys Local 5 minutes down the road and bought some breakfast things , The first room we were offered on the ground floor was magnificent and huge but a bit on the noisy side as there were taxis pulling up etc I asked if it was possible to change the room We were offered a choice of two both lovely rooms so I chose the one I thought would be the quietest as my husband is an extremely light sleeper The staff couldn t do enough for us and were very pleasant and helpful at all times 
155046,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Spa is a bit tired looking and hospital like with yellow stickers like at Heathrow airport Had to ask your Times for a dvd and waited four hourd, The bed was comfortable and once we figured it out the shower was lovely Great dinner
155047,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Beds uncomfortable wet bath mat on floor when we checked in to room Shower water switched between hot cold Hair Conditioner in shower had shower gel in it even though it was labelled Hair Conditioner We were in Ground floor room which was positioned next to front door and was noisy as we heard a fight erupting and someone knocked on our window , Location was fair Modern new facility with parking bays shared with residents 
155048,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Truly awful Internet for video skype Google hangouts Had to switch to my mobile As a business traveller Internet is perhaps the most important thing Won t be back to this hotel Make sure you have mobile data as a back up or if you intendo to work from your room avoid this place , Room size and bathroom were amazing Really good For a leisure traveller this hotel is really good 
155049,Rafayel Hotel Spa,No Negative, Nice rooms small bedroom huge bathroom amazing shower and lovely decor Used the spa facilities small sauna and steam room but quiet so not an issue 
155050,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Poor lighting in the room so difficult to do my make up and hair as no mirror near a plug socket room not comfortable to get ready, Lovely hotel and spa
155051,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Spa facilities bigger , The lighting in the hotel gives a really calming effect The bed was very comfy I loved the rain shower it was like having my own spa 
155052,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The restaurant was dated in appearance and my meal was disappointing Wish he had a river view room , Ben the hotel manager was very friendly and helpful Spacious comfortable room 
155053,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Paying for the car park didn t like looking out of the window and seeing all the crap in the other apartment rooms windows Would have loved a river view , Spa it s was very clean loved the big bathroom Food in restaurant was good 
155054,Rafayel Hotel Spa, I was expecting a bigger more spacious room As website clearly shows so when booking this was what i expected , The room was lovely but is WAS NOT THE room in picture I called prior to booking to confirm i was booked into room on pic i was told yes with Thames view which it was but not the spacious room i was expecting I would have prefered to be told this on telephone eg yes this does have Thames view but IS NOT THE SAME ROOM IN PIC 
155055,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Nothing like pictures Got given a tiny room View wasn t anything special Got charged incorrectly Shuttle service to Clapham finishes at 10 so the walk isn t plesant Use money else where I wouldn t stay there again, Looks nice from outside Shuttle service
155056,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Beds were not as pristine as you would sometimes get in other hotels Mini bar prices are tear inducing the hotel room phone connection wasn t the best either, The view depending on your room the TV in the bath the little luxuries like a bidet the spa facilities the sofas in the reception area I originally booked a Premium Deluxe Double Room which was on first glance really lovely with an amazing view but being on the first floor room 102 you find yourself practically nose to nose with the passing public out below This room was also located with a view of the Thames with a helipad spot as seen in the first photo Upon further inspection I found that the TV above the bath was not working neither were a few of the lights which after almost 20 minutes of trying to be fixed by the management team I was offered a free room upgrade to the Nile Suite room 102 is above the restaurant BTW not part of the main hotel area the Nile suite is in the main body of the hotel and this room blew me away Oozed grandeur stunning views all the glasses you d need without calling down to reception as the title stated if it wasn t for the free upgrade it wouldn t have been as good an experience AND you get a free shuttle service to Clapham Junction station Sidenote The French lady at reception in the mornings is so lovely 
155057,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Pool not possible to use so cold Brrrr Jacuzzi also a little on cool side , Bed Large rooms D cor v modern and 5 star Sauna etc Staff v helpful and responsive
155058,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The staff are very rude Before I booked I asked if I could have a massage booked they told me YES This is the only reason I booked a spa with a hotel when getting there I wasn t shown where anything is I called the spa repeatedly for an hour no answer I then had reception get the spa to call me to which the man said the therapist has no time for treatments I said i need a massage just got off a 14 hour flight to which his response was unfortunately not my problem I sat alone in that room for 24 hours ANNOYED AND IN PAIN Disgusting service for 5 Have contacted the hotel since and they like to ignore my emails , NOTHING
155059,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Air conditioning controlled externally , The staff are friendly and keen to help The rooms and facilities are excellent especially the suite The bathrooms are fantastic 
155060,Rafayel Hotel Spa, I would say that this hotel is like a fake Luis Vuitton Bag It might look from distance the real deal but the closer you look the more it is evident why you pay a cheap price for it Everything is done with equipment that looks potentially good but is cheap installed badly and it is terribly poor maintained There were broken things everywhere in our room shower not working bedside lights half hanging electricity sockets that pulls out of the walls end much much more I just gave up in looking around We where in the new built part of the hotel in a superior room The rooms where also not clean enough if compared to any above 3 stars hotel I stayed in just forget about a 5 stars And I do travel a lot and have been to plenty of 4 and 5 stars in my life It is a huge shame because the room with some TLC could be very nice The staff is nice and you could see that they have no much power in what is going on and really not sure what to say rather than apologise SPEND some money to put it right tight owners of this hotel please , The price is good for an hotel in London but is not a 5 Stars at all 
155061,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The room was smelly , The first room I was given was not ready and seemed to be still in use The new room I was allocated was smelly and didn t seem clean but I just put up with it 
155062,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The lighting in the rooms and especially the bathroom was very dim Almost impossible for trying to apply make up This would put me off staying there again , Hotel was lovely and clean Staff were very friendly and helpful 
155063,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The spa could be bigger And would be nice to have towels for use in the spa Also ice water and fresh fruit would be a nice touch, The junior suite was very nice and the bathroom was amazing 
155064,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The bedroom wall had mould on it deffonetly not a 5 star more like 3 5 star the spa was dirty in the jacuzzi and it was cold i moved rooms due to the mould on the wall and tv turning off by itself and R rrally he room just being very tired around the edges not luxary like a 5 star hotel should be When I moved rooms no one helped me with my luggage and no one took my luggage to my room on arrival i had room service and my mood arrived with tin foil around it , breakfast was nice although staff were not friendly and kept me waiting for a table 
155065,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Dirty and smelly room Bad mannered staff and on complaint nothing offered or refunded Room overlooked main entrance and road very noisy Hotel quiet and was told I could not be moved Room needed a good clean ripped carpet and stains on curtains Bed old and lumpy Pillows smelt musty No where to do my makeup side light no working Furniture scratched and dusty very very poor show and would not recommend never Asked to see the Manager and I waited 20 mins and a man arrived as his stand in and sat there nodding and not offering any refund Very poor show and a very unhappy customer , Location 
155066,Rafayel Hotel Spa, There wasn t a plug for hair straightener close to the mirror in the bathroom, The view from the emperor suite was amazing the music all over the suite included the bathroom with the bath spa 
155067,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Room service breakfast was quite cold when it arrived though fairly tasty , Excellent rooms incredibly clean Friendly and brilliant staff Dinner in the restaurant was fabulous 
155068,Rafayel Hotel Spa, 1 Car parking was 15 per night 2 iPhone 7 audio wouldn t work with their audio connection, This is my second visit here we stayed from a Friday Sunday in the Amazon room which costed 358 00 for the 2 nights As it was a surprise for my partner I had emailed the hotel to pre arrange things in the room On arrival they put petals on the bed a small box of chocolates a card for him The room was big very clean There was a king bed ceiling to floor windows with a blind curtain walk in shower no bath ironing board walk in wardrobe tea coffee facilities his her slippers robe The tv also had pay per view movies that costed approx 4 per film music station that played a variety of genres all room functions including lighting could be adjusted via the tv or keyboard Whilst here we also booked spa treatments which were amazing the room service menu had a few options available depending on the time but was still good portion sizes at a 4 room delivery charge overall the service was amazing Other than that a lovely expensive weekend 
155069,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Loud aircon Couldn t lower the aircon enough Couldn t close curtains completely so light woke us up early Sealant in the bathroom turning black with mould Carpet fraying at a joint, Large bathroom with large shower head Good mattress
155070,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Unfortunately the hotel is situated in a undesirable council estate and the area is spoilt by the smell and look of poverty The room smelt of marijuana Safe wasn t working although we told staff several times about the problem In the end we had to take our personal belongings with us when we went out for duration of our stay , Spa facilities including gym were good although pool wave machine wasn t working Restaurant staff were friendly and food was nice Car park accessible on site so no trouble finding a parking space The hotel offers a free drop off service to Clapham Junction Tube Station which was useful 
155071,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Not at all a 5 hotel Free shuttle service is unreliable Shower kept going from hot to cold Irons in room arent steam irons so are useless Awful location and rooms look out onto builders yards Would not recommend ,No Positive
155072,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The air con would only go up to 24 and felt like it was blowing cold air I felt cold In my room at times room 201 The fridge in the room was fully loaded with things I could buy rather than being any use to me for anything I wanted to refrigerate , The sauna and steam room gym and I feel I must give an appraisal to the nice natured parking attendant who was always smiling and happy to help with bags and supervising parking exemplary customer service skills 
155073,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Was upgraded to apartment which was not buce at all They showed us another apartment one of their best apparently it was not impressive the bed was a standard double in all apartments even though we paid extra for a king bed it seemed like the staff did not want to give the room we paid for as they kept showing us all other available apartments not impressed when it s late at night and just wanting to check in and sleep Eventually got to our original room which was hooked after of lugging around our luggage Got to the room had to pay for bottled water usually free in most hotels Tv was very old could not plug in USB Bathroom was for disabled people did not request this Dust on the table tops Breakfast is usually included when executive rooms are booked we were unable to have breakfast even though breakfast was confirmed the night of check in Overall will never recommend this to anyone consider a 5 star hotel I would degrade this to a 3 , The bed
155074,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The apartment I was okay but dated and worn For example some lights didn t work the carpet had worn patches the bin lid didn t open when you pressed it there was a manual for a coffee machine but no coffee machine inside of cupboard had loose panels the TV didn t have very many channels e g no BBC One The non smoking rooms smelt of cigarette smoke Whilst housekeeping came daily to replace towels they never made the bed I stayed 3 nights There was no shower cap and a very limited mini bar which seemed a bit strange for a 4 star hotel Overall it was okay but it didn t look anything like the room photos on booking com I shared all this with the staff when checking out and they said that using the next door apartments is a new thing they are testing and that the normal hotel rooms look like the website in which case I d suggest you make sure you are in the hotel bit and not the apartment bit , The room was very large 2 floors with 2 bedrooms lounge and kitchen I had booked a deluxe double room they gave me an apartment Which wasn t needed for me on my own but would be better if there were several of you The bed was comfy the shower was nice and hot with good pressure and the view is very nice 
155075,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Windows to room looked into ground floor lobby entrance and so had to have the curtains blinds closed all the time The spa closed at 8pm I arrived 7pm Expected better quality considering price It was ok but I d go elsewhere next time ,No Positive
155076,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Nothing, The check in staff were absolutely brilliant i normally use the Crowne Plaza in Battersea but will instead be going back to the Rafayel instead 
155077,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Should not have to ask for what is advertised Be nice to have a full size pool Location good for us but not for all Espresso tabs should be free in a decent hotel Charging a pound seems petty , Food good in bistro but had to ask for set dinner menu Room big Spa ok Parking a bonus Staff tried 
155078,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Staff attitude extremely poor not all but most Deposit charged on arrival in case you charge anything to the room as well as payment in full on arrival Long walk to nearest train tube Hair dryer supplied won t reach mirror so ladies you won t be able to dry your hair No power points within reach of the bed and no bedside clock Rooms extremely dark very poor lighting , Nice view of the river if your room faces that way Very little else this time sadly
155079,Rafayel Hotel Spa, There was no instructor in the gym plus some of gym facilities were out of order , Stuff hospitality they were friendly cooperative and sooo humble Nabeel Fahad Taqi Aga Fich Farhan and the French girl can t remember her name 
155080,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Shame that hotel don t have YouTube in tv, I really liked the people who worked there especially Mr Masud he was very helpful and pleasant he helped us very much thank you for a nice stay Can t wait to visit again 
155081,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The location is a bit of a pain 15 min walk to Clapham Junction They do have a shuttle bus every 30mins though, I had a ground floor room and it was huge and well appointed 
155082,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The bed was very hard and uncomfortable , The room was lovely and spacious Once I worked out how to use the shower that was really good but the instructions were very poor 
155083,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The only slight criticism that I have is that the bar area can get a little cramped because it is a long and fairly narrow area with bar stools It would be nice to have a more comfortanle seating area for post dinner drinks but I am being picky , This hotel is a little gem Its location by the River Thames makes it so peaceful So hard to believe that Central London is a short bus taxi ride away The food in the restaurant is delicious and they do a wonderful breakfast menu too From check in to check out the service is first class and nothing seems to be too much trouble Rooms are very comfortable This is our second visit and sure it will not be our last 
155084,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Lovely room although the view wasn t that great We were facing a yellow storage warehouse and a couple of others Bed was positioned awkwardly so it was tight to get through one side When we got our room serviced the second day bedsheets we re not changed which was rather disappointing and our tea and coffee were not replaced , Spacious room Pleasant staff Overall pleasant stay
155085,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The annoying 50 refund you have to wait for all because I booked via booking com Didn t get the room I had requested , The size of the room I did request a river facing delux and didn t get it This is the 3rd time I ve stayed at this hotel Definitely recommend this hotel It s lovely Location is great 
155086,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Location could have been a little closer to underground fir our preference but they do run a shuttle bus to it for advanced requests We checked that breakfast was included before eating in the morning and later found out it was not and were charged for this, Staff here were very accommodating for entire stay In particular we asked if we could continue to leave the car in the parking until well after we had checked out and they did so at no additional charge for us Very impressed
155087,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Nothing had to to do with them Only the helicopter landing area is next to the hotel which causes a lot of noise Otherwise everything was perfect , Very kind and helpful staff 
155088,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The customer service was really poor the staff seemed like they had no idea what they were doing they put me in an apartment at first when i payed for a deluxe double room which smelt and was dirty so i requested to be moved to the room i actually payed for i was not happy I do not think i will be attending hotel rafayel again,No Positive
155089,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Bar in restaurant has no draught beer and menu is limited of you don t like Asian cuisine, Room was excellent genuine 5 star Shuttle service from the station very convenient Riverside location spectacular
155090,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Housekeeping was appalling and had to highlight this with pictures of how badly the room had been cleaned following asking several times for it to be done Waited 1 5 hours for 2 diet cokes and only received them when calling reception for a 2nd time No booking made for our dinner reservation despite being told it had been dealt with for us as we were on our anniversary weekend Discussed our disappointment with the reservations team on checking out and were advised we would receive a call back to discuss further but almost one month later still no call Have now sadly cancelled a booking for our birthdays in November due to the poor customer care, Very good value for money for a London hotel Very comfy beds Chose to upgrade to an Emperor Suite which was outstanding having stayed in a standard room previously Food in the hotel restaurant was excellent Extensive range of drinks Good spa facilities Hotel shuttle facility free to the tube station to get you into central London Hotel is beautiful and well maintained 
155091,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The reception desk is under staffed and cluttered My partner and I who are both very tall were put in the room with accessible features the disabled access room without being informed The sink is roughly at knee height there is no shelf to put any toiletries unless you want to lean over the toilet and the toilet itself is so close to the sink that our long legs could barely squeeze in The shower had weird tacky stickers on the floor and the disabled handles inside it were covered in grime Sorry just not good enough for 5 star , The spa was reasonable though no swimming pool 
155092,Rafayel Hotel Spa,No Negative, Couldn t do enough to help Everyone was excellent Parked my car dropped guests at the nearest tube using a shuttle bus and picked them up again Upgraded to a lovely 2 bedroom suite 
155093,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The staff on checking out the lady was very stuck up and also when I complained about the AC blowing out hot air all night resulting in feeling very hot nothing was done , I loved the spa facilities I stayed in a king suite with own spa bath 
155094,Rafayel Hotel Spa, First of all when we arrived late the reception guy gives us an apartment flat which is not what we booked for and it was under the average as well so we returned to him and asked for our hotel room which we had booked through booking com and we found that the room has been taking by other people so they upgraded our room from the Deluxe Double Room to the Junior Suite which is much better than the ugly apartment Secondly because we did not accept the apartment they give us a room in the ground floor with ugly view actually their is not any view a all Thirdly the staffs were unhelpful as we called them many time and they keep saying we are coming and no one comes until we went to them in the reception Fourthly the air condition was on all the time we tried many times to turn it off but it did not as their was a problem with their system Finally the spa was close Only the gym and swimming pool are open while the other parts are close because the staffs are off that day , The room was nice 
155095,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Even with the discount we thought that the restaurant was overpriced However we found a lovely restaurant nearby , The hotel was lovely modern and clean We both had treatments in the spa and used the spa facilities Good blackout blinds in the bedroom which is always a bonus Fab shower and a nice comfy bed 
155096,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Air conditioning was not very effective , The Main Hotel was Full so i was upgraded to an apartment which to be honest was far to big for my requirements lovely if you were staying for a few days but not for an overnight stay 
155097,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Poor reception services Also room next to helicopter landing pad Very noisy Showers in changing rooms not working Reception forgot to give room card Went back down to collect and she was not too bothered ,No Positive
155098,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Our Room was next to the helicopter pad which made it a bit loud and woke us up a couple of times Other than that have nothing bad to say about this hotel, Can t praise it enough Hotel was beautiful loved the decor staff were really friendly and helpful bedrooms were immaculate and really comfortable but very stylish just like the pics Beautiful views
155099,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Staff are rude and not helpful They do not offer to help with luggage and you have to come down to collect food Also my card was charged 250 in my absence for ciggearate remains being found in the bin even though I don t smoke ,No Positive
155100,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Spa wasn t great jacuzzi was broken Don t think your hotel should be advertised as a spa as it was so small , Bed was really comfy room was lovely 
155101,Rafayel Hotel Spa, my room was overlooking a main road and a big yellow self storage warehouse even though i informed them that i booked it for my friends 50th birthday when i queried this the staff wasn t very helpful, the decor
155102,Rafayel Hotel Spa, My daughter who is 5 fell in the shower and they could not do anything to accommodate How can u give a standing shower to a child unattended it s common sense And they wanted to charge for a upgrade complimentary I don t think they know how to do their job , Just the reception Sitting area 
155103,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The staff were courteous but cold and not overly helpful and nothing to do but sit in the hotel reception while waiting for a taxi etc the hotel was more like a residential property with rooms below for the hotel Bizarre set up , The rooms were very big clean and good facilities like mini bar etc The bed was comfy and the rooms were airy and fresh
155104,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Air con in the room was rubbish didn t sleep well at all Generally wasn t clean toilet was filthy marks up doors Tried to have a nice drink outside by the bar but customers were shouting and making it very uncomfortable Did t get the warmth feeling you wish to have on arrival all very dull Lighting in the room was terrible room was situated outside the main street so couldn t open curtains , The style of the hotel was good Modern feel 
155105,Rafayel Hotel Spa, I don t know if I m being a bit fussy but I felt like the hotel lacked soul Decor was Bland Staff a bit diffident never rude but not particularly welcoming either nor especially on the ball For example I had room service food wasn t great and the waiter asked me to sign a slip but hadn t brought a pen with him We had asked for 1 hour early check in which they said should be ok but then wasn t possible upon our arrival so we dropped our baggage off and told them we would be back late that evening They didn t bother to take it up to the room for us The room was poorly laid out e g No electricity points near the bed light switches not easy to find Light in the bathroom was this horrible fluorescent style white light not at all relaxing No complementary water or tea which just felt cheap to be honest No shower gel just shampoo Long corridors with no signs so it s hard to find your way around All niggles really but when you add together make the experience underwhelming which is not what you expect when you pay 300 for a suite It wasn t terrible but nor was it great In fairness I didn t try to the spa so maybe that would have made a difference , Emperor suite was spacious Enjoyed the river view Everything was very clean We liked the spa bath There was a box of chocolates and petals on the bed as we had told them it was a special occasion They gave us late check out 
155106,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The amount of complimentries you get basic coffee and tea in a travelodge something a bit more was expected from a 5 , Room very sleek clean and modern shower was very good don t listen to reviews about the air con it s easily turned off through the control panel or on the TV also you can control lights etc through the TV shuttle service fantastic 
155107,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The continental breakfast could have more choice of cheese and sausage The next underground station is far away but they offer a free shuttle service , The location at the Thames is really nice especially the view to the river and open terrace The service is friendly and try to help you everywhere In the third floor is the gym and spa area but don t expect too much It s quite small but sufficient The rooms are big and comfortable it depends of the kind of rooms but you need too search because in every category is a perfect room All in all it s really a nice 5 star hotel for a good price in London 
155108,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Lighting in room not bright enough Folding doors extremely hard to close Called for the shuttle to pick us up at train station shuttle sent to wrong station Hotel did pay for the cab we had to take but 15 minute trip turned into an hour and 20 min Air conditioner noisy Pointed out problems lot of so sorry but nothing done to correct problems , Didn t like anything for the price we paid for the room Overpriced 
155109,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The bath tub wasn t the best could not drain water efficiently and the taps for the shower could come off when you are opening for the water The Airconditioning was too noisy at night and you could only breath the fun directly from the bed So uncomfortable for someone who is sensitive and affected by AC blowing too much could have put the AC outlet in a more better place not close to bed too expensive for the restaurant Forced to eat 2 course meal to have a discount , The bed was comfy and the idea of having an iPod connected to roof speakers was great It was really functional for me the complimentary shuttle to the train station was great and the staff were helpful 
155110,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Well the spa an stream should stay open till 10pm I think 8pm to early an I think it will be nicer an enjoyable for your money if u booking late, I like the bed was very comfortable an bathroom was really nice
155111,Rafayel Hotel Spa, In my room there was no full length mirror No full length wardrobe And the lighting was bad for doing make up to get ready of an evening , Comfy bed breakfast was good and the staff were reall friendly
155112,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Colour changing ceiling light over the bed didn t work went down to reception to be told someone would come and sort it out No one came to room to fix it Following morning asked again to be told those lights are no longer used and went on to tell us why If that s the case these lights should not be in the hotel room description Things like that really bug me Was told there was a shuttle bus to the train station when I checked in and told the times I was not told you had to book in for the shuttle service though , Lovely room with fantastic river view Fantastic shower 
155113,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Upon arrival we was challenged with a bill of 300 deposit which broke down to 50 a room per day this was not in our booking confirmation staff were attentive through our stay but a receptionist under the name Fahad was very very disrespectful he had try charge us extra for things we had already payed for when challenging him on this and showed proof he still denied our claims after a good 10 minute battle he had agreed that everything we used had been payed for but still no apology was made , The rooms were very spacious and clean although some of our other friends whom stayed in other rooms complained of damp smells apart from that rooms were lovely and very big bathrooms jacuzzi was lovely as was the decor throughout the hotel 
155114,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The room s lighting is a little dim and the television at an odd angle to the bed making near on impossible to view in comfort with a crick in the neck The restaurant food doesn t have much choice for vegetarians and is limited in its variety No green vegetables or simple healthy salads which is a shame , Great confortable bed and amazing power shower 
155115,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Sightly awkward with room being overlooked as on ground floor at front of the hotel had to have blinds closed the entire time we were in the room , Huge room and bathroom good facilities lovely bar terrace overlooking the river 
155116,Rafayel Hotel Spa,No Negative, Me and my best friend stayed in the Julius Caeser suite and it was amazing really big room beautiful view of the river and helipad Lovely floor to ceiling windows so you can watch the sunset The spa bath we had was amazing brilliant to come back to after a long day shopping 
155117,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The room was very nice but expected more especially from a 5 spa hotel The spa was smaller than imagined Breakfast on the expensive side so ventured out for a bite to eat , The location of the Thames room with the views was good especially in the evening although people outside could see right in so had to be careful and shut the curtains
155118,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The pool is tiny you cat even do a lap AC didn t have a heat option Hard to change settings had to get staff to turn off completely which it then got too hot and wouldn t turn back on Quite pricey considering it s only in Battersea 50 deposit think that s ridiculous , Thought the treatments was the highlight not a whole hour which is not fair seeing as that s what I paid for
155119,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The only thing that comes to mind is that the operation of the lift could have been explained , Excellent front of house upon arrival First impressions are very important
155120,Rafayel Hotel Spa, You have to get to the center or the attraction about 20 30 minute with bus or train, Very large room with new style Very very quit beside the river And value of money 
155121,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Didn t like that the bar was not open upstaires when we checked in, I loved the view from the suite right into the river Thames and loved the big jacuzzi
155122,Rafayel Hotel Spa, We had trouble trying to turn off air conditioning fan This was from 11 30pm and still trying at 1am No staff were answering phone so not a good night s sleep However upon complaining we were given 25 off bill , Room was lovely and shower was amazing 
155123,Rafayel Hotel Spa, No tube station nearby but free shuttle to Clapham Junction railway station much appreciated , Room was very comfortable and modern Nice location by river 
155124,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The view was not great at all it over looked the lobby and as soon as you opened the curtains you could be seen by the restaurant staff so we had to keep the curtains closed for privacy , I liked how spacious the room was and the fact that it had surround sound when you connected your ipod to the room 
155125,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The only downside of our stay was when we went for breakfast We walked to the restaurant and stood in the doorway assuming that we would be greeted by staff and seen to a table There were 2 staff behind the bar both of whom looked at use stood there waiting and they just carried on with their argument Only when I walked right up to the bar and asked if this was the right place for breakfast was I told to go and find a table The service wasn t great we were simply asked if we wanted a continental or cooked breakfast Some subsequent guests were offered a menu of the offerings so we felt that we weren t terribly well informed of the options available Again when I asked about cereal and juice we were told to go and help ourselves The food was very tasty and extremely well prepared so full marks to the kitchen staff The waiting staff however could do with a course in how to handle guests bothersome though they are , The hotel was absolutely fantastic very modern and nicely decorated Our room was huge with plenty of room to swing a great number of cats I must remember to take some for my next stay The staff were incredibly helpful and even arranged for their courtesy shuttle to drive us to Clapham Common for the concert we were attending The car park is incredibly secure so I was more than happy to leave my new car parked there 
155126,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The room could have had a small sofa The breakfast continental was very pricey even given the location , The bathroom was fabulous The views were fab Loved the spa and pool facilities 
155127,Rafayel Hotel Spa,No Negative, Great hotel found it a little quiet and very few staff around Hallways were very dark The room was huge with everything you could want or need Would certainly book again Arriving by helicopter was a breeze with the helipad so close 
155128,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Noise from outside the appartemnt the sound proofing wasn t good Otherwise perfect , Beautiful upgraded flat We had asked for twin beds and there were none so we were offered it Fabulous space 
155129,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Our room overlooked the coutyard and other rooms there was blinds but they made the room very dark this is a very small moan , The staff were very friendly and our bed was so comfortable 
155130,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The beds are ridiculously small it s just about fits a 6 1 male let alone a couple in future will be upgrading but the price not worth that so unless it s s deal won t be going because I need a bigger bed n to get that you must upgrade your room, The location and actual building
155131,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The distance to the nearest transport link was quite a long way certainly not within walking distance During the busy traffic periods in London it took over half an hour in the hotel shuttle bus to get to Clapham Common underground station Taxi s from the centre of London to the hotel were always over 25 , The room and facilities were great lovely setting on the river although you had to go into another building to get to it The rooms are on the lower levels and the view is very much blocked by the tower in front of the hotel 
155132,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The bed was extremely uncomfortable and the carpet on our landing was very dirty due to the building work taking place It s also very unsightly the way in which you can see the contents of the residence properties through the balcony windows The property looks like a block of flats rather than a 4 star luxury hotel, I was given an upgrade to an apartment which was a lovely gesture 
155133,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Rooms were noisy from outside noise we were over reception area Noise from heliport not as controlled as a neighboring hotel we used previously Didn t consider it 5 star Some surfaces in room were dusty didn t think it was as clean as it should be Breakfast confusing as to what you can and cannot have and poor choice on continental Having to walk outside to separate breakfast area not great Floor in dining room needs attention looking very shabby and worn Hotel overall too dark and rooms cannot be made bright with in room lighting Restaurant staff friendly , The location is good reception staff were good although some did not acknowledge you when you were passing through which is something I believe staff should do 
155134,Rafayel Hotel Spa, staff unfriendly verging on rude wanted p copy of driving license and pre authourisation of credit card before I had even signed to check in location is within an industrial park 25 mins walk from batersea park various lights in room and corridors not working shower dripping all the time decore in room marked and edge of carpet frayed kept awake all of Saturday night due to function with incredibly loud music and people complained to reception at 0135hrs but our sunday event was ruined due to tiredness on checking out was told sorry nothing I could do about that taxi s no plates or badges so didn t use hotel and staff were very oprresive to top it off we were told to use the back entrance all thetime walking through stench of bins and bottles Definatly NOT the 5 star rating or what we are used to as a 5 star absolute rubbish 500 wasted they even asked me for PIN number of card without showing us bill and then gave us bill for wrong room having just returned from brazil on a 5 star trip this is not a good experience or what I would have expected Rubbish avoid, leaving
155135,Rafayel Hotel Spa,No Negative, Stayed for one night with a friend the room was beautful immaculate and had everything you could ever possibly need Including the most amazing shower We were very lucky and ended up with a room facing straight out on to the Thames which was the highlight for us it was stunning The staff were very polite and helpful at all times calling for taxis and sending the free shuttle bus to take us back to the train station We ordered room service and the food was also beautful Although we didn t get into the restaurant we wished we could of as it looked and smelt fantastic Will definitely stay again 
155136,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Unhelpful staff and inflexible Shuttle service to train not reliable Adjacent restaurant forgetful with orders It seemed to me that the paying customer was a bit of a nuisance The immediate surrounds including entry were dirty Litter on floor Chair in lounge had same dirty tissue on it for three days It is in a good spot but poorly managed ,No Positive
155137,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Difficult to dry hair No power point near mirror Otherwise nothing, Position of the hotel for convenience to travel into London and Wimbledon Hotel was peaceful and clean 
155138,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Room was really stuffy and smelt like stale shower steam had to have air con on constantly and lowest fan setting was quite loud Noise from helicopter pad nearby Awkward to get to would be better to be closer the train or an underground Bed was pretty small double Staff didn t give any advice didn t know there was free shuttle to clapham and walked with my bags to the hotel Wasn t advised on the spa or restaurant or breakfast so no idea what was available to us , Electronics in the room Good shower 
155139,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Resistance feature in pool didn t work , Enjoyed rooms spaciousness and super staff Helped us to access some of London s attractions Would definitely stay again Shuttle service invaluable 
155140,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Wifi was a little flakey Would randomly disconnect at times , It was wonderful little plesant surprise I had I am American and my wife is Brittish when we ordered breakfast they served me American style bacon and her Brittish style It was a little rememberance of home that I didn t even ask for 
155141,Rafayel Hotel Spa, They had gave me the wrong room I had then asked to change my room they then said that none was available except emperor suite Then went on to tell me that I would have to pay more if I want to move my room I explained out of good will I shouldn t have to pay because they had messed up my booking already For the rest of my stay here I was stressed and couldn t relaxed I was upset and disappointed as I had booked this hotel to celebrated my boyfriends 26th Staff was rude wasn t helpful at all door handle on the bathroom door was broken there was a nail sticking out of the wall where the desk was Unstable chairs for the dinner table in my room I had taken pictures and I will be emailing HR about this Wasn t worth the headache or money spent not a 5 hotel, Breakfast
155142,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The view I particularly requested the river view room and a room high up but got the first floor and the view was bus stops traffic builders and people walking past Had to keep the blinds down , Really liked staying here and the staff Didn t make use of the spa or restaurant but visited them and liked the look so I would go back The room double room was nice and really spacious 
155143,Rafayel Hotel Spa, No free bottled water or extra towels in the room we had to ask for it Staff was not friendly at all View was over the building next door not the river , The jacuzzi tub was wonderful and the room very spacious We didn t use any amenities at the hotel 
155144,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Room could do with a good dusting and some of the cupboard handles where hanging off bit of attention to detail and the room would be perfect , Nice size room floor to ceiling windows with a view down the Thames Comfy bed 
155145,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Restaurant staff were quite patronising and house wine was very poor , Great view from the rooms and extra bed added for my teenage daughter at no extra cost 
155146,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Heating was dofficult to control so the room was cold that was the only downside , Friendly staff excellent hotel and facilities very clean I was very impressed with this hotel I spent one night with a friend and found the service was excellent the rooms and decor were very modern and clean 
155147,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Would have been nice to have had some help loading the car so that we weren t blocking the drive too long As it was the person collected the car and then left us to it Felt a little impersonal even the chap that was waiting patiently behind commented , Very smart and clean lovely room 
155148,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Price of meals then half price for two courses seems silly Could all just be a bit cheaper , Lovely room staff polite friendly and helpful Food on site
155149,Rafayel Hotel Spa, We moved room as AC noise and smell of smoke The over bed light could not be turned off without a service engineer and a screwdriver The bar steward did not give a darn , The views from room 122 was awesome The lady on breakfast duty was very helpful and attentive
155150,Rafayel Hotel Spa, 1 The fridge has only the alcohol do provided by the hotel and no space for even a small milk 2 The room temperature was difficult to change and I had called reception a twice to change it for me and they still didn t change it nor come to check on their guests 3 As soon as I arrived before I went in the room I received a call from reception telling me that room is booked for 2 people not 3 I had explained downstairs that I had just arrived from Morocco and my brother helped us with the luggage Receiving the phone call made me feel undermined already 4 There s a constant reminder of the hotel policy about smoking posters and on TV Felt like prison and laws around me They should have just explained this to me and made me sign a doc 5 The car park system states overnight is 15 The receptionist made me sign it and then said I have to pay 15 I said it says overnight payment I m only unloading luggage This was awful for me in front of my partner and we just got back from our 1 years anniversary I will never book with this place again, The shuttle bus service
155151,Rafayel Hotel Spa, No shower caps tissues cotton buds or usual toiletries provided from a hotel of this standard Room lighting could be much brighter had to hunt for a plug Had problems finding their car park had to call the hotel not very obvious or signposted ,No Positive
155152,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Room relatively small pretty much the same as what you get in a travelodge but smaller granted it is central London though View was of a blue wall out of window not of the river as I had hoped , Staff were pleasant and helpful
155153,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The reception staff the temperature in the room it would have been nice to be able to open the window , The size and comfort of the room the jacuzzi 
155154,Rafayel Hotel Spa, very minor one of the toilets had not been cleaned properly but otherwise superb, We were upgraded to an Apartment which was Phenomenal a large Kitchen Dining room Lounge with 2 Bedrooms upstairs one with a large walk in wardrobe and both en suite and both with a full high glass viewing area overlooking the Thames All for 139 for the night awesome Shuttle Bus service to Clapham Junction gets you anywhere
155155,Rafayel Hotel Spa, I got told I had to leave my room 2hours early when I asked for a certain time I then had a phone call and was told I had 15mins to get out before I get charged 20 They brought me to the wrong room and didn t do any of my requests I arrived on time and they still made me wait in the lobby for 25mins to take me to the wrong room, Lovely bed and shower
155156,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The location of the room G08 and the view was a bit disappointing for a deluxe room in my opinion The TV in the room was also at a very strange angle making it difficult to see from the bed , The bathroom was very well equipped The bed was large and comfortable 
155157,Rafayel Hotel Spa, I thought the hotel was not as pictured the outside was dusty and unkept the plants were dead it most certainly was not 5 star The staff were indifferent and offered a basic level of service I asked for directions and they didnt know so instead of finding out that was the end of the conversation I then asked if he could look on line and he did but it was all rather awkward no smiles no happy to help I actually felt I was in a foreign country with a language barrier There was no mini bar again never had this in a reputable hotel before There was no fridge There was no milk not even dried There were no snacks in the room other than two packets of crisps no biscuits with the tea It was all very value led and certainly not as billed I would not recommend and I would not stay again , The rooms were modern The shower room was palatial and had great towels and robes Good toiletries 
155158,Rafayel Hotel Spa, A little dusty in areas such a shame as it was rather noticeable, Room was very comfortable Free shuttle service to train and tube station was faultless
155159,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The air conditioning in the room was noisy and could not be turned off so I slept with a pillow over my head The shower controls were virtually ceased up and the instructions on how to use it was confusing or even wrong The night light in the room could not be switched off and the TV controller did not work ,No Positive
155160,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Reception staff is not kind enough for 5 star hotel i doubt it s real 5star hotel though Spa facility is very poor No sufficient toiletaries provided no cotton balls no hair dryer No soap bar in the toilet Tv didnt work for some menu , Room is clean 
155161,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Communication before visiting hotel I had requested a river view and arrived to find we hadn t been given one Disappointing also requested late check out again email was not responded to , upgraded to 2 bedroom apartment with river view Excellent service from staff whilst at the hotel Free shuttle service to and from Clapham Common underground 
155162,Rafayel Hotel Spa, there was only one pair of slippers and the bath robe had a dirty plaster in the pocket better housekeeping checks, good value for money and taxi service
155163,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Mini bar prices 2 50 for a bag of crisps service charge of 3 50 added to breakfast tray no instructions for VERY complicated shower power sockets in the back of cupboard poor lighting near mirrors no power socket next to bed to charge phone All the emphasis is on design not practicality ,No Positive
155164,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Spa facilities were broken hydropool Did not get shown how to use anything in spa People behind the front desk were hesitant to help us out fully because what we believe we are a young couple For example the people before us got shown to their room and the receptionist even tried to speak their own language French However ours did not Spoke poor English very quietly and did not offer to show us to our room at all ALso booked us into a room that was being occupied we walked in on a laptop and belongings on the desk , Room was lovely Spa was a nice extra Location was good Shuttle bus to nearest station is great 
155165,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Was not made aware of 50 deposit you had to pay on arrival for your room Also the hotel is in fact a 20mon walk from Clapham not 10as the advert stated , Rooms are lovely and staff and helpful
155166,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Location out of the way battersea helipad right next door helicopters landing from 7am onwards, Bed was superb jacuzzi bath was very good staff quick to help nice and quiet apart from the helicopters landing next door
155167,Rafayel Hotel Spa, When we initially checked in the staff member on reception assumed we were there for the party instead of asking how he could help us Wasn t the nicest of greetings Get there early if u want a river view room We arrived later and therefore received urban view aka street view however room was beautiful and very spacious and on a high note still received a room on the top floor , My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday Loved how spacious our room was fantastic location beautiful spa facilities and really friendly staff that were happy to help with the smallest of things 
155168,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The spa was atrocious I wouldn t even call it a spa Also smelt damp The staff woke me up 3 times when I was asleep because apparently there was a problem with the air conditioning That really annoyed me , The room view was nice and the room itself was spacious
155169,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Would of liked our shower problem resolved even asking at reception for this to be fixed cold water , Very spacious modern room Restaurant had great food 
155170,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Facilities in room broken and spa very small, The spa was very small the shower control dropped on my foot the only thing was the food was very nice I was disappointed for the money it was very bad would not stay again
155171,Rafayel Hotel Spa, No coffee machine perhaps a mirror above the desk so I can get ready by the mirror , Spa the location was great and the amenities were really good room very spacious 
155172,Rafayel Hotel Spa, bar staff was nice but when we didn t like the drink because it was too strong he re done them but we still couldn t drink it 30 for 3 drinks that we could not drink and wasted as we would not get a refund very dissapointed with this Also had to pay 15 for continental breakfast normally that s included or under 5 so we went out for breakfast , The room was really nice clean and you listened to my request very happy with shuttle both friendly men and made sure we knew where we were going and where to get picked up from 
155173,Rafayel Hotel Spa, How confusing the staff were they were polite but took a long time to do anything and seemed very confused, How easy it was to get to and how clean the rooms weee
155174,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The staff on arrival were not very welcoming and a little abrupt The staff on reception the next morning were more friendly , Bed was very comfy we were able to cool down room to a comfortable temperature The whole room was spacious and well equipped
155175,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The way one staff member made up his face when my little a ones were crying at dinner made us want to not eat there our waiter was the best though, I loved the way reception made us feel welcome
155176,Rafayel Hotel Spa, My view was the back of the hotel with a few cars and building work But wasn t bothered for 1 night stay Breakfast overpriced so decided not to have it , Room was nice and clean Staff friendly and helpful Restaurant was nice with a good view Food was lovely and very accommodating for 10 people Next would like to take advantage of spa 
155177,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The room was on the ground floor an accessibility room and no potential to change The original room temp was very high and the suggestion to change it was turn it off and wait 15 mins in a boiling hot room I slipped twice on a very slippery tile in the bathroom and one of the ceiling tiles was hanging off The times for the spa make them practically inaccessible for a business traveller Really dissapointed , The staff were helpful eventually 
155178,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The restaurant staff gave my partner and I the wrong meals but we said it was fine and would eat it After watching us take a few mouth fulls the clueless staff and the poor trainee lad ran back to our tables and whipped the plates out from underneath us and apologised saying we had someone else s meal They then proceeded to walk down a few tables and place the meals in front of another couple To top it off they knew we had eaten parts of the meal and the watched us AND brought us clean cutlery Very poor restaurant service Also I asked for a Port to come with my cheese board and after the waiting staff asked me about 10 times what port was it arrived How can a 5 resort have such little product knowledge and poor service skills I didn t even feel it was worth complaining about at the time of checkout as the staff looked down upon us I m presuming down to our age 19 21 even though we were fully paying polite customers This place has fully put my partner and I off of 5 hotels better customer service and waiting staff at a premier inn , Facilities very nice 
155179,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The pillows were uncomfy the hotel was cold there was only 1 restaurant eating drinking establishment and the hotel was in the middle of no where and the shuttle service didn t start until 9am , The puddings were amazing The showers were great 
155180,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Long wait for room to be ready even though we arrived at check in time a few hairs found in bathroom Confusion over times for me and my wife , Lovely room emperor suite Jacuzzi was brilliant Great view over looking the helipad Friendly and helpful staff 
155181,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The water in shower in the evening was at best warm when I really wanted a hot shower I discussed this with Reception and told them that as I had already had a luke warm shower there was no point in sorting out anything in the evening as didn t want to be disturbed in room at that point however was re assured that in the morning when I would be showering that there would be hot water The morning came I went to have my shower and to my dismay there was again no hot water only luke warm At check out I advised the reception desk what had been relayed to the night team and the lack of hot water in the morning The colleague at reception apologised and advised that they would do something for me on my next visit to the hotel I was still charged the full room rental amount even though the lack of hot water was woeful I would like to ask the owner manager of this hotel whether he would return on service like this , Nice room excellent view of the river very comfortable almost 
155182,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The attitude of the cleaning staff There was a little dust on the drawers and the curtains didn t shut properly There was also no soap and everything was nailed to the wall The staff could do with smiling a bit more they did look very miserable , Nice room with lovely hydrotherapy bath 
155183,Rafayel Hotel Spa, There was only one problem with this hotel the room we were staying in was a premier deluxe room which was situated above the bar so the music kept us up till 2am when it stopped , Best shower ive ever been in amazing view very comfy bed recommended to everyone who can stretch their budget
155184,Rafayel Hotel Spa, couldent fault a thing, The staff were very helpful the food in the restaurant was divine And the bed was like sleeping on a cloud The rooms are immaculate great views could see the river thames from room 
155185,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Wasn t a proper swimming pool only a really freezing hydrotherapy pool , My partner and I had an amazing stay Location was great scenery spectacular Never short of things to do Staff are extremely accommodating even In the early hours of the morning the breakfast was delicious Overall the hotel has a very relaxed feel Will most definatly be retuning 
155186,Rafayel Hotel Spa, nothing , Fantastic view of the Thames Helpful friendly efficient staff The full English breakfast was perfect and SO delicious Very comfortable bed 
155187,Rafayel Hotel Spa,No Negative, The staff were extremely helpful and the courtesy shuffle bus from the tube was a big plus Not forgetting the Thames view room overlooking the helipad All round 10 out of 10 
155188,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The Emperor suite wasn t very impressive It was less spacious and comfortable than the Nile room The only thing that was an upgrade was the jacuzzi which was slightly bigger than the one in the Nile room , The bar and restaurant area was spot on Extreme comfort in the Nile room 
155189,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The fact that i was told on the phone that i had to come in to ask to see if they had apartments available and they didnt then i was told to take a leaflet when i got there about the spa treatments and decide for the next day because it was available and wasnt booked up i went back downstairs to the spa after deciding and another man ended up telling me and my friend it was all booked up which made no sense because a man before him told us different the experience was not good this time round as too last few times i have stayed in this hotel Ive stayed here many times before and ive been very happy thats the reason why i recomended it to 2 other of my friends that decided to book a room same day as us and experienced the same disappointments as they had to change there room due to health and safety issues which made me look abit stupid because i rated it highly all other times i had been happy but this time i was not happy , The jacuzzi was nice and the restaurant was amazing aswell as the food 
155190,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Would never book again my GHD straighteners were stolen by the cleaners and we were also put into a room whilst a machine stating do not enter when on was in place which caused my partner to have an asthma attack , Restaurant was lovely
155191,Rafayel Hotel Spa, This is a hotel run by people who don t know what they are doing Sorry but it was that bad The decor is garish and tacky The room a junior suite overlooked the side of the hotel with a glimpse of the river one way if you overlook a dump of building materials and over a builders merchants the other See pictures The first impression wasn t good why did i have to produce photo ID when checking in Apparently it is Company policy The two huge massage chairs which greeted us outside then list on our floor had scrappy out of order signs on them Why have them there The room layout was bizarre We had a junior suite so you enter a large hallway where the wardrobes are then turn a corner to find a huge bed occupying most of the space in the bedroom area To get past this and into the rear lounge area you had to contort yourself past the end of the bed whilst avoiding the eye level hazard of the television which was affixed to the wall We didn t bother to use the lounge as it was at the back of the suite with no windows and just a one hideous brocade sofa and a six seat dining table I think the room was design to be the other way round the lounge should have face the windows and the rear part should have been the bedroom presumably the current operators think that guests will prefer to have a view of the building site from the comfort of their bed whilst giving the occupants of the flats opposite an entertaining or otherwise view through straight on to the bed through the floor to ceiling window The bathrooms was huge The jacuzzi bath was good the shower was a complete joke Loads of jets at every angle controlled by one tap which was impossible to regulate It was hilarious absolutely impossible to not completely soak the floor whilst trying to work out how to just take a shower The spa was a joke Poky scruffy and crowded , Honestly nothing much
155192,Rafayel Hotel Spa, It s not handy for public transport but the Hotel does a free shuttle to Clapham , Friendly welcome great room well equipped and quiet Comfortable bed and an awesome shower what more could you ask for And a reasonable price for London Would definitely stay here again 
155193,Rafayel Hotel Spa, They could do with putting two tea bags in the breakfast teapots for one guest the tea was a little weak , Staff were very helpful the bedroom comfortable and the free shuttle service to Clapham Junction is a nice touch I was only there for one night so I can t comment on the spa or gym The free Wi Fi works very well in the rooms simply find the network and select it No need to log in with a long winded process 
155194,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Decor is a little dated The bar restaurant is too expensive and dated , Very helpful and professional staff River view bar and apartment Parking alway available Free upgrade 
155195,Rafayel Hotel Spa, nothing, Beautiful view of the river very comfortable bed We ate in the restaurant beside the river and the staff were friendly helpful and polite we got the bus from Victoria station which stopped right outside the hotel would stay again 
155196,Rafayel Hotel Spa, 1 When we check in the receptionist told us all rooms were occupided and we upgraded you to an apartment eventhough we booked a room The aprtement was okd fashion and not clean So we did nt accept it After all there were rooms available so it was a lie 2 The rooms are very old fashion and not clean with a ugly view 3 In the middle of nowhere , One of the managers were supported us 
155197,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Decor was just all wrong over the top odd Lighting in my room was bizarrely wired up every switch did different lights but then next time they d do other lights Utterly bizarre I had about 8 light switches and you never knew which ones they d turn off or on next time , Location Cooked breakfast
155198,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The bed was awful We stayed in one of the apartments and the bed was so hard and uncomfortable Also they said we had been upgraded to an apartment however the apartment was not very clean at all and I have a feeling the hotel room in the hotel side would ve been a lot more comfortable and clean , The location was good and the reception decor was very nice 
155199,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Reception staff are quite abrupt even though they weren t very busy The spa is very small and packed at peak times We got his on an offer if we hadn t it would ve been hideously over priced for the quality of service , Restaurant staff were fantastic including the barman The room was huge although we asked for the whirlpool bath or a river view and got neither The free shuttle to the tube is a nice idea and the driver was a lovely bloke but you do need to book a few hours in advance 
155200,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Location too far from a tube station needed overground train or bus Would have liked the spa to stay open a little later , Ground floor room was very spacious
155201,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Room service should have a wider choice of dishes Better to be able to book massages and spa treatments directly at the reception or on the website , Great location even if the rooms dedicated to pet owners are the smallest ones we had a nice space available the shower was great and in general I have been very satisfied by the structure 
155202,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Not near tube however found out bus service was good Also there was a free shuttle service to Clapham junction, I liked the spa and the shower in the room was amazing
155203,Rafayel Hotel Spa, I was in the Thames room but the bed wasn t in proportion with the TV so it wasn t really relaxed, I liked the fact there was a TV in the bathroom and the speakers playing in the bathroom aswell 
155204,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The room was boiling when we arrived and the air con was so loud we couldn t sleep additionally we found a cigarette but on the floor, The gym was free and the jacuzzi was nice
155205,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Service in restaurant pretty off hand although reception staff were quite helpful First room we were given looked directly into reception Would have meant blinds down all the time Air conditioning hard to control I feel the cold so it was ok for me but a normal person would have expired from the heat , Great rate for room and car Very large stylish room with massive comfy bed and a stunning bathroom Nice food in restaurant not bad at 1 2 price offer for guests Lots of tea coffee and milk in room Free shuttle service to Clapham Common and Junction Bus stop just outside to Chelsea and Victoria 
155206,Rafayel Hotel Spa, How the deposit works how there s no complementary breakfasts with the suites And the TVs not working well , The room emperor suite was Amazing The view was 100 
155207,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Lighting heating a c system extremely difficult to work even for a technically competent person, Comfortable bed great shower shuttle very handy 
155208,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Booked the junior suite and was expecting a separate living dining area as suggested in the photos however recieved a large room with a sofa Location is pretty poor they do offer a shuttle service to and from stations however This had a tendancy to run late over the two nights we stayed Constant loud musuc being played next door Spa facilities mediocre Staff not very engaging or friendly Requested house keeping after the first night whilst we were out only to return to minimal cleaning No fresh towels bath had not been cleaned Shower was cold and the attempt at fancy gadgets such as lighting temperature control via the tv seem to be unescessary and more hassle than it s worth Overall not very impressed will be unlikely to return , On arrival the room was clean however i had called ahead a few times to guarantee this after reading a few not so pleasant reviews 
155209,Rafayel Hotel Spa, when arriving for check in staff did not give us information on how to use facilities in the room Staff took us to the room and left striaght away The bed lights were not working and the hot water was not working Other than that everything else was great,No Positive
155210,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Inconsistency temp of jacuzzi hot tub Rude staff at Hotel restaurant the Banyan Constant laundry bags left in hallways of hotel which even though I stepped over one a string from the bag wrapped round my ankle causing me to fall Told reception they did nothing Nowhere AT ALL to park on side roads hotel parking prices are extortionate , The lovely room great staff members Clean room 
155211,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The view of quite a busy road in the day and the night The location is quite hard to get to until we discovered the free shuttle service once arriving at the hotel Although the shuttle service was late numerous times , Speakers in ceiling were a really great added feature Very nice bathroom and shower facilities Good television with movies and music channels to choose from The layout of of the room was fantastic with a lot of space 
155212,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The only thing was the spa was a bit too small We had to wait for the facilities The jacuzzi only could have 3 people in at a time , I loved the location and the decor The staff were very helpful and friendly any problems we had got sorted straight away i would definitely recommend 
155213,Rafayel Hotel Spa, No hot water for the shower in the morning Manager refunded 30 for the inconvenience You get charged for EVERYTHING Not even a free biscuit with your tea 2 50 for a packet of crisps Heating didn t work system needs updating , Room was nice modern but starting to look tired 
155214,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Loud music played till late Head board had hand prints on it Towels were rough Dressing gown had a smell to it, The view was AMAZING The room was set up nicely 
155215,Rafayel Hotel Spa, No bath Was told room was upgraded to having a view but was overlooking the hotel entrance Breakfast was cold and way overpriced Spa was oversold Restaurant food was also overpriced Room was very clean but shower had very poor pressure and gadgets that didn t properly work , Check in was good Hotel looks nice inside
155216,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The Tv was on when I entered the room with all its features Then when I turned it on later it was a coloured scrambled screen so could not use it Also didn t have a good experience at Breakfast, Reception staff were lovely the place was clean and comfortable
155217,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The only downside was not having a bath tub in the bathroom , The rooms were really lovely big and the staff were very friendly The breakfast in our room was an extra bonus for an extra small amount 
155218,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The lighting in the room and bathroom were terrible Not enough light to shave or do make up Not even enough light to read in bed , Party going on all night in the corridor outside our room Very noisy and gave us no chance to sleep
155219,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Tiny spa facilities a terrible view which overlooked a storage facility we couldn t open the windows and despite the air con it was too warm chipped furniture tears in the carpet and 15 to park overnight , Comfortable bed large bathroom 
155220,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The bathroom TV was not tuned or working , Beautiful big bathroom speakers in the bathroom and room Queen bed was very comfortable Complimentary chocolate and bed made up with flower petals for our anniversary 
155221,Rafayel Hotel Spa, This was the least nice room we ve had The bed faced away from the lovely river view The mirror should have been above the desk as it was impracticality positioned and I couldn t see to straighten my hair The lighting is very odd It s an eco hotel which is great but even on our third visit the lights still baffle us The restaurant and bar are lovely to sit in but the food is very processed and the quality isn t great We ve eaten there three times now and each has been very poor The prices are over inflated and then discounted by 50 We eat there because it s convenient and saves getting taxis elsewhere , Third time at this hotel We come every January as we ve had special times here and the trip has become part of our calendar The room is comfortable and we like the decor It s absolutely spotless and the linen is good quality Excellent tea coffee tray with plenty of everything and a good mini bar We bring our own milk and wine and it s handy that the mini bar is refrigerated Lovely bathroom and good quality toiletries Little touches that make all the difference 
155222,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Location is not great area but only 10 min walk from station View from room not that great but could upgrade to room with river view which I would probably do next time I stay there , Lovely big room amazing spa and attentive staff Really impressed with room size room decor and was spotlessly clean and modern 
155223,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The TV sometimes dropped out of signal The electronic blinds in the bathroom did not work very well , Jacuzzi in the bathroom Staff were very friendly and helpful Emperor Suite was very big inside with lots of luxury features such as a under floor heating electronic lights control The TV was also very large and a nice little feature was that it could control all the lights and heating in the suite The Spa on the third floor was very good and was included for free with the price of the room 
155224,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Well I wasn t overly impressed when I first checked into my room I found a stocking a tube of lubrication by the bed which made me feel sick after complaining I was given an upgrade in that room the light switch was loose I didn t feel to complain again as it was 5pm by now I just slept and left in the morning,No Positive
155225,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The hotel was nice but not the luxury you would expect for 5 star The screens on the treadmills were broken the steam room was switched off there weren t any towels in the spa area There was also loud music and talking coming from one of the rooms all night which wasn t hotels fault but suggested that rooms weren t soundproofed,No Positive
155226,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The shuttle service mucked us around a bit didn t turn up to pick us up and we had dinner reservations The spa was difficult to access in the morning on Sunday because nobody was at the desk and so we couldn t turn things on It also would have been better if the spa was open later Even for just an hour or two until 8 Just would have made our stay that bit better , The spa was amazing so lovely The restaurant was gorgeous The room was AMAZING Absolutely stunning and so so comfortable Bathroom was incredible Dinner was by far the best I ve ever eaten 
155227,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The bath was not clean and full of hair the shower gel had been filled with water and something else that smelled awful , I was very happy with the staff and the little extra touches provided like our anniversary note and shuttle service 
155228,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Dubious guests in the hotel Physical fighting outside Poor response from staff in terms of getting situation under control Extremley disapointed in this hotel and its care of guests, Rooms were spacious and well equiped 
155229,Rafayel Hotel Spa, staff was unaware about dissabilities damaged carpet no interest to find lost forgotten items, jacuzzi was nice nice big tv amazing bed good view over the river
155230,Rafayel Hotel Spa, We have stayed here numerous times but on this occasion were subjected to fighting swearing and shouting in the corridor outside our door resulting in no sleep and a totally ruined New Years Eve reception told us to email the manager so I called to get his email address and a very terse woman wouldn t give it to me and told me to send it to reception and they would pass it on needless to say a week later I have heard nothing back very disappointed, We liked the location and our room
155231,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The cleaners could do a better job Would help if residents with a car have a fob to get into the building from the car park Parking per night was quite expensive , Everything in one place Room Spa Car Parking
155232,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Nothing, I loved it from start to finish Took my boyfriend for his 22nd birthday Had a little view of the river Thames which was nice breakfast got delivered to the room within 15mins which was amazing and the jacuzzi steam room and sauna was lovely I highly recommend X
155233,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Room was not cleaned or bed linen changed after my 1st night had to ask for clean towels and the furniture was dated and a bit poor this is not a 5 star hotel Possibly not even 4 star at best 3 star by European standards , View of river was ok
155234,Rafayel Hotel Spa, In general don t think the price of the stay is worth it There are nice extras you don t get everywhere else like speakers in the ceiling etc The spa doesn t have a proper pool apart from a cold hydrotherapy pool which if your anything like me and don t want to swim in cold water is of no use what so ever The pictures also make everything look bigger than it actually is , The decoration of the hotel was nice The hot tub in the spa was also very nice and the way it was all set out Bathroom to the bedroom was lovely and big Had a note and chocolates in our room when we arrived and petals on the bed 
155235,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Based on the cost of the room I was not impressed that a bottle of water was not complimentary , Location great and pleased that parking was provided at a fair rate Free shuttle service to Clapham junction station a good service 
155236,Rafayel Hotel Spa,No Negative, Although we didn t know he was the owner of the hotel we had the chance to meeting Iqbal Latif He was around the reception area and welcomed us warmly and had a small chat with us He keeps his hotel at the highest standards and we were really pleased 
155237,Rafayel Hotel Spa, pool was abit small thats about it, went to this hotel on my 1 year anniversary and we both really enjoyed the stay I recommend this hotel to everyone u wont be disappointed
155238,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The delux rooms are facing the road and really noisy with passing traffic The aircon hides the noise but really cold so you either can t sleep as too cold or too noisy Worst night sleep I ever had at a hotel Also shower gel was not shower gel and shuttle bus was a beat up Ford Fiesta Not near any station , Decoration and space of room
155239,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Staff was cordial but did not go that extra bit to make us feel welcome , I liked the fact that given we had a toddler with us we were given a room with a bath as requested and a spacious room Hotel offers a shuttle service to Clapham Junction train station Also there are bus stops right outside the hotelast 
155240,Rafayel Hotel Spa, When it was time to check out down at the reception the staff there tried to impose a bill on me that wasn t mine They accused me of taking a bottle of beer even when I don t drink they even went further to say there was an empty bottle of beer right on my fridge That was a big lie, The massage spa facilities were excellent and the members of staff there were very cordial effective and respectful
155241,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Work going on and some areas closed not told before hand My room was a bit disappointing size and layout for the money lots of gadgets but most slow or not working Pay extra for a river view , Staff were great Food at the restaurant was very good as was the bar 
155242,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Our heating didn t work so our room was freezing giving us A horrible night sleep we were given a small heater but the room was too big for it to warm up, The room and politeness of staff was great
155243,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Not clean Horrendous view for the price Was told it would be a sea view Horrible location of room have to walk past the spar reception every time Hearing people being loud in the spa reception and the cleaning room next door and the shower going off couldn t sleep well, Nice big bathroom shower was very good
155244,Rafayel Hotel Spa,No Negative, This was my second time visiting hotel Rafayel and I absolutley love it The staff were lovely they changed my room as I wasn t satisfied with my first one and they really made us feel welcome our room was gorgeous will definitely be visiting again
155245,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Can t fault this hotel one bit , My overall stay was excellent the staff were extremely accommodating and friendly and the hotel itself was very clean and upto a high standards Would definitely visit again 
155246,Rafayel Hotel Spa, i didnt like the fact that the bathroom was all glass and see through i felt no privacy Also the vent on the roof had partly collapsed and the nails fell out , I liked the jacuzzi bath and the view of the river thames 
155247,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Room very small looking over large pile of rubbish at back of hotel Reception sofas are grubby Staff very pleasant but I would not stay again , Location was very convenient 
155248,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Only issue was transport from Tube Clapham it is just too far away and there were no Cabs to use Staff were very attentive food good but expensive need to cater for snack eater Room was fabulous and overall hotel is 5 ,No Positive
155249,Rafayel Hotel Spa, It was all good really Just wanted another night , Loved the location and the spa and gym Room was spacious and modern speakers in the ceiling great bathroom great bed 
155250,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Restaurant food was very basic and expensive Spa very basic Reception a mess poor customer service not friendly, Next to where we needed to be fit a party
155251,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The room was cold for a number of hours and we had to phone down to reception twice to get this rectified, The room was great Really liked the Jacuzzi bath 
155252,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The two way glass into the ensuite from the bedroom took some getting used to until it steamed up, We were luky enough to have an Emporer suite as we were upgraded super views and excellent room Valet parking useful but should be advertised as access is difficult
155253,Rafayel Hotel Spa, It s a good hotel but I feel that 5 stars is maybe a little generous considering only very basic shower gel shampoo no conditioner etc , I stayed in one of the lower value rooms 179 per night and I d say that it was excellent value for the money Rooms are comfortable and well appointed If you re thinking of getting some work done you might want to request additional lighting as lightning is more along the mood lighting spectrum but otherwise good Not too close to any major transport hubs but they do have a completely shuttle to Clapham which largely resolves this 
155254,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Firstly I arrived for a surprise for my girlfriends 21st birthday I d booked champagne for the room which they told her when I arrived then it wasn t in the room They forgot our room service Staff spoke to me like I didn t belong to be there Was made to pay extra money at check in Would never stay here again ,No Positive
155255,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The location was difficult to access by underground or bus Taxi was 40 from Liverpool St station Hopefully with the new line this will improve , The hotel is modern stylish and very clean with every comfort I could have needed Massage chairs in the walkways modern art on the walls and tv in the bathroom Loads of added extras Close to New Covent Garden
155256,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Some of the staff did not seem to know the area and told us there were no nearby locations for dining which was not the case They indicated that everything was far away We later discovered that either Clapham Common a or Clapham Junction station and shops and restaurants were only a ten or fifteen minute walk from the hotel , One of the shuttle drivers a local man was very helpful telling us of nearby local business areas Also we loved being right on the river and the hotel was peaceful and the room was lovely 
155257,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The noise in the room from vent on ceiling also the lights and air con was quiet annoying instruction for shower was not clear the bathroom had no complementary tooth pastes or tooth brush,No Positive
155258,Rafayel Hotel Spa, I didn t realise you couldn t book a room with a view through booking com Very disappointed as this was the sole reason I booked the hotel then early in the morning there was a staff member outside cleaning leaves with a machine which woke us up Also the sink wouldn t drain properly and bathroom had a funny smell , The hotel looks nice and was comfortable 
155259,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Although my room had a good sea view i was on the first floor which meant people were looking in so found that I couldn t draw the curtains as much It would ve been better to be on the top floor with that kind of view Also when I was checking out I realised that I had been overcharged Although this was rectified very quickly I was surprised that this kind of thing could happen at a five star I don t like questioning a bill but I was glad I did as I would ve been paying for somebody else s bill , People working there were nice The service is good I had a good room view and absolutely loved the TV in the bathroom 
155260,Rafayel Hotel Spa, As a frequent traveller I have stayed in many 4 and 5 star hotels and would only rate this hotel as a 3 E g No safe in first 2 rooms given although stated on room description soap and shampoo in fixed bottles on wall like a premier inn and no other toiletries in room very low lighting apparently as eco friendly But then had air conditioning that wouldn t turn off and kept us awake all night The staff were just about ok apart from the one gentleman who was trying very hard to find us a suitable room Location and walk to Clapham junction did not feel safe so we used taxis Shuttle bus needed 30mins notice Would definitely not stay here again ,No Positive
155261,Rafayel Hotel Spa, For the last two days of my stay I did not get any internet connection in my room I have to go down to the lobby for wi fi connection , The river view by the restaurant is really nice Evening walk along the river is breathtaking 
155262,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The room was lovely but we kept getting disturbed during the night by the guests in the bar downstairs And also could hear bumping in other rooms which kept us awake Other than that the room and staff was great , Staff were excellent and very helpful 
155263,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Location reason for free shuttlebus service Small room with no chair but the bathroom was fine , Free shuttlebus service to Clapham Junction was fine Friendly staff 
155264,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The check out process was an absolute nightmare It was so bad it made me 15 mins late for work when I had left an hour to travel the 17 mins walk to my job, Really nice hotel rooms are huge
155265,Rafayel Hotel Spa,No Negative, Loved it would return Location is not right in the heart of it but near the Thames and the hotel accommodate really well by offering a free shuttle to the station
155266,Rafayel Hotel Spa, very bad loud noise outside bar area until 4 am kept awake also poor service in bar barmen had too much to do on his own, being close to the river good shuttle service with good drivers 
155267,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Nothing to do with hotel but the access to the hotel and London traffic sucks, The rooms are huge some very helpful staff plus onsite parking beautiful view great location also a free shuttle to local tube and over ground stations
155268,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The room lacked the usual bathroom amenities apart from Soap Shampoo whilst the furniture was looking a bit battered tired The lighting in the room was insufficient , Good location in Battersea by the river The bathrooms were large and spacious 
155269,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Surprised to hear that this five star hotel doesn t have hot breakfast buffet I don t like the fact that in order to control the room temperature the receptionist need be contacted to switch it off or on , I like the size of the room it s quite spacious 
155270,Rafayel Hotel Spa, as usual getting in and out the parking is a problem you have to bother one of the staff to open the door to the hotel for you coming along from the reception each time you go and come can be easily solved with a door key , large clean rooms and nice view as well as location incase you have your own car
155271,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Mostly good experience the variability of the water temperature was the only concern When it was hot it was very hot , Good sized room with plenty of space and an excellent bathroom which was nicely modern but water temperature was difficult to control The king size bed was one of the most comfortable I ve ever slept in Battersea is conveniently situated for getting into the West end and to lesser extent the city but there didn t seem to be much in the immediate vicinity so not quite sure why it was built here but maybe things are about to happen 
155272,Rafayel Hotel Spa, I couldn t turn down the aircon to a temperature lower than 25C It was very uncomfortable and stuffy in the room because of this and the windows could not be opened I did turn off the aircon at the wall switch but despite that it kept turning itself on automatically and although it wasn t pumping out any heat it was buzzing through the night so I had to leave my radio on to drown the sound infuriating Otherwise very quiet at the hotel This wouldn t put me off using the hotel again I have to stress , Very friendly welcome and helpful staff The secure underground car park was brilliant and at 15 for 24 hours wonderful Fantastic view over the River Thames good food at sensible prices and a good room which was spotlessly clean with good quality fixtures and fittings The bed was very comfortable I loved the floor to ceiling windows The bathroom was nice and large with mood lighting The hotel also had a good arrangement with a local taxi firm and direct door to door service into central London Google HQ was just 16 50 before a tip this was fantastic especially as the weather was so bad 
155273,Rafayel Hotel Spa, This is definitely not a 5 star product There are too many compromises on quality Our carpet was torn and frayed there were only two pillows on a double bed only 4 coat hangers the bathroom has soap dispensers and no amenities the standard of a business travellers hotel but so wrong in a luxury hotel curtains and artwork were cheap and tasteless They promise two restaurants but in practice all meals including breakfast are served next door in a Thai restaurant And the vehicle access is like a service alley Do not expect this to excite It s just a disappointment and deluded to be described as 5 star , Rooms are oversized for a city hotel
155274,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Unfortunately there weren t any windows allowing fresh air into the room only a very noisy air conditioner which ordinarily would be able to be adjusted and switched on off from the room but was not working so we had to call reception every time we needed to adjust it It was not possible to sleep with the aircon on as it was a little too noisy We would really have enjoyed some fresh outside air On the night that we thought to try out the jacuzzi the spa and pool facilities were closed just after 8pm at night When we asked if we could use the facilities we were refused we re grown adults for Pete s sake it s not like we re going to drown or something I didn t quite understand the restriction here and that was a pity Wifi connectivity was inconsistent in our room The restaurant across the way was severely short staffed on the Sunday morning when we tried to get breakfast that after more than 10 minutes of waiting to be served when we had already said to the manager that we were desperate for a coffee we decided to walk out Two other couples had walked out before us complaining of lack of service Many of the tables had not been cleared and there was bird excrement on one of our chairs overall not a good experience in the rather expensive Banyan restaurant and we did no return there during our three day stay Preferring to walk into Clapham or Battersea square for coffee and breakfast , The size of the room was fantastically huge albeit a little excessive at least it was clean modern and nicely decorated A smaller room with a view of the river as requested when booking would have been far better 
155275,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The pool was being refurbished so was out of use which was unfortunate and there is nowhere to sit and relax by the jacuzzi pool of this is what you want to do , The room I was in was lovely Unfortunately the bathroom and towels smelt strongly of stale cigarette smoke however when I informed the staff the attempted to rectify the situation Very friendly and helpful staff and the shuttle service to Clapham junction was very handy 
155276,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Staff didn t respond in an effective time frame for problems we had with our room Also they were painting when we arrived so it was difficult to get to our room and they didn t clean up effectively so the next morning they made a great deal of noise while cleaning up Very frustrating ,No Positive
155277,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Maybe wider range of toiletries in batbroom e g hair conditioner as well as shampoo Breakfast buffet could be expanded to include hot food our fault did not leave enough time to order and eat the hot options but would have loved to have tried them , Excellent room clean comfortable plenty of space and fantastic bathroom with spa bath Staff most courteous friendly professional and all gave very good service from hotel reception to restaurant staff 
155278,Rafayel Hotel Spa, At the time of booking via booking com I was particularly attracted by 5 rating you have there and hence I was eager to pay a premium given that this was going to be a very special night for me and my wife after a very long and difficult period when I had to be in hospital Upon arrival we were greeted professionally and though we had to queue for reception I found the member of staff working well However we were quite disappointed when we went up to the room where we did not find essentials like toothbrushes or toothpaste which would be a norm even in a 3 hotel Later on we realised there was only an empty box of tissues We wanted to use Internet on TV but the keyboard did not work We reported it to the reception and it took a member of staff over half an hour to come to us and change batteries by which time we did not need the keyboard Later it happened that the bondage I have on my neck leaked and we asked for a firs aid kit plasters and cotton pads These were brought to us 15min later no scissors which we asked to bring and they cam another half an hour later and we were asked to return half empty Asda plaster pack when we finished This again did not look particularly 5 to me We asked for a large bottle of water paid and were said that you don t serve water in large bottles I appreciate you are trying to do your best for environment and that s what appeals to my wife and me too but we could not quite understand why the duvet cover had holes in it and gowns were 50 polyester with belts not matching On the final note the water temperature in shower was very difficult to regulate it was piping hot and cold and you could not predict how it would change next minute so there was a chance of burn PS This feedback was sent to the hotel management with no response received from them , Spacious room large bed large window
155279,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Shower didn t work in the room but hotel staff gave us a key for the next room when we contacted them so that we could keep our original room which we preferred to the alternative room and still shower A good service , Really comfy bed and spacious room on 3rd floor Lovely breakfast delivered to the room Free shuttle service runs every half an hour to Clapham Junction and Clapham Common stations 
155280,Rafayel Hotel Spa, The shower was very awkward I ended up scolding myself with hot water and all the staff could say we re we are sorry about that Due to running out of the shower we left the door open which triggered the smoke detector and someone called our room It then came to light half of the technical things such as out air con the lights and other things controlled by the TV weren t even working I didn t feel like the staff even cared about anything as they just said oh we will fix it at the mains and never called back to see if the problems were rectified , It was peaceful Room was a decent size and bed was comfortable
155281,Rafayel Hotel Spa, It was quite difficult to get to on public transport Though it was useful to be able to use the shuttle service I had not checked beforehand and should have booked a collection , The rooms was beautifully appointed and I loved the Neals Yard toiletries The bathroom was enormous and the standard of cleanliness excellent The breakfast was delicious and freshly made so no rubbery eggs The whole experience was lovely and we will definitely return 
155282,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Apart from the breakfast the food menu is tasteless Room service is poor had to hassle them twice for bottles of H20 , As a Professional woman I was upgraded free of charge with wonderful river views 
155283,Rafayel Hotel Spa, Better anti slip mats are needed in the shower The shower floor was very slippery and there were I think 4 anti slip fishes dotted around 2 of which moved Proper shower mats are seriously needed before somebody falls in the shower and has a serious injury , The terrace overlooking the River Thames was one of the highlights Also 50 from the a la carte menu but must have starter and main course makes the restaurant very good value and the food was excellent Had a sandwich lunch they were excellent we took advantage of the offer at dinner and very impressed and then a lovely breakfast before departure Drinks very reasonably priced too from the bar
