338329,Hotel 55,No Negative, The position of this hotel was perfect Right next to the tube station off licenses restaurants and cafes It is along the picadilly tube line so it is a quick and easy journey into Central London Could not have picked a better hotel for position price quality and also the fantastic staff

338346,Hotel 55, If I say it was the smallest room I have ever had I am telling the truth I only had one suitcase but it was a logic game to manage it in the room , However the location is a bit far from the center but the transportation is absolutely perfect The staff is kind the accomodation is stylish and clean 
338347,Hotel 55, A bit out of the way not an issue as I often stay in Ealing but in this case there is very little nearby so you either eat in the hotel Japanese or get something from the mini Waitrose at the garage down the road , Nice comfortable rooms always love a nespresso machine

338355,Hotel 55, Put a separate room for food but he didn t charge list and print reminders For English is not very good we can t get relevant charges required Too few parking Spaces two days didn t see there are parking parking roadside paid area only suggest the hotel don t write free parking space to provide charge parking space , Near the subway

338376,Hotel 55, I think the rooms should have been equipped with more information such as drinks menu breakfast times and mini bar information , We were complimented on a free drink upon arrival due to a birthday This made a lovely touch after travelling from a far 
338377,Hotel 55, The traffic noise it was just too noisy and the rooms are quite a squeeze , It s cheaper booking directly on the Hotel website which comes with complimentary breakfast Receptionist was very polite friendly and helpful
338378,Hotel 55, It was a little hot inside the room and the bathroom is quite small but expected for London hotels , Great location for a short journey into London Not a great looking hotel from the outside but very modern inside Lovely breakfast Only downside is the lack of parking but there is a car park behind the hotel which cost me 3 70 for 2 days

338387,Hotel 55, Cold shower Also the air con heating did not working properly To be fair reception did say that we should have reported it at the time The problem was we got in at 12 30 so we were to tired to bother about the heating I m also not sure what they could have done to fix the hot water when we had showers 20 mins before we had to check out in the morning , Good parking good location nice bar

338393,Hotel 55, Parking situation was a bit confusing they only have about 6 spaces actually so we had to block people in then hand our keys in at reception it would be helpful if there was a sign outside or on the booking confirmation to let you know what to do to save sitting outside in your car not knowing what to do to , Hotel was fantastic beautifully decorated clean room with good facilities delicious restaurant friendly helpful staff all at a really great price 
338394,Hotel 55, The water was slightly on the cold side for the shower but not to the extent that you couldnt use the shower , Rooms were up to date washrooms were very modern and television and entertainment system very high end Beds very comfortable and the bar was very nice

338399,Hotel 55, Poor breakfast Not a value for money We went for breakfast 30 before the closing time and some things had already run out We were not informed that ordering eggs would have been of additional cost Breakfast should have been included in the price of the room , The room was great

338405,Hotel 55, Door key took three times to get working which was a little bit of a pain after a long day needing to trek up and down the stairs each time to let reception know Reception dealt with kindly and courteously Being upgraded to the room that I had booked ie from Street View to Garden View But no biggie as only there one night and could not be troubled to get out my paperwork to prove the point better to be nice than right , Nicely organised room with everything needed in a small compact space Nice and clean Thoughtful touches nice toiletries enough towels spare toilet tissue 
338406,Hotel 55, room was extremely small just about space for the bed and then the width of a person around the entire bed perimeter was the size of the room sound proof door and walls would ve been great could hear everyone in the corridor but this was also due to the room being so small, very friendly and helpful staff rooms very clean lovely bathroom and shower modern decor

338418,Hotel 55, When we arrived there was a power cut We were grateful for a bonus breakfast but felt as this had spoilt our daughters graduation due to stress and worry more might have been done like offering the family a free drink in the bar We were hoping to do something in the evening but had to waste hours to be booked in and the evening before her graduation at Wembley was a disaster, Nice hotel rooms and location and friendly staff

338420,Hotel 55, Courtyard room was a bit damp but I m not sure if it was due the horrible humid weather in London those few days I would def go back there , From outside its not much but when you go in Narnia opens up Fantastic decor and atmosphere 
338421,Hotel 55, Although the rooms look very clean while searching for my kids car I was shocked by the area under the bed uncleaned for ages with remains from a few generations of clients before us The disturbing one were the beer bottle caps that can cut children feet easily , Although far from touristic attractions the location is tranquil and safe Very close to a metro station and a shopping restaurants just 15 mins walk Generally clean with good facilities and comfortable bed
338422,Hotel 55, My only dislike was that the mattress was soft foam sunk in the middle and was very hot This was more noticeable due to the fact the weather had changed it had been a hot day thank goodness for the aircon , It was a fab hotel the decor was very tasteful throughout Our room had everything in there that you could need The staff that we encountered were all very polite courthouse

338427,Hotel 55, If you are going to mainly want to be in the centre of London it works out about 30 minutes on trains but is simple enough and we fount it fine to do also you then have the option of a quieter day away from it , Liked how the train station was literally a minute away Me and my sister went to London to see Beyonc at Wembley and it was 11 in an ber which the hotel has 15 00 off vouchers which we used on the way back as was higher price due to traffic coming out of the concert So many leaflets and discount cards for loads of places and attractions in London The staff were lovely brought us fresh bottled water and extra tea and anything else we needed also check out was early but our coach home was a night coach so they happily held our luggage with them whilst we went for a day sight seeing around London They couldn t of done anymore Only thing was the tea and coffee shelf kept falling in the wardrobe but we told them and they offered to send someone straight up but we advised it wasn t causing an issue so was no need Don t let the road outside put you off if you get a road facing room it didn t bother us and we had a great 2 nights here

338432,Hotel 55, Restaurant tables were dirty and the restaurant lamp shades surfaces needed polished they were dusty The bar doesn t serve cider , Excellent location staff and rooms lobby room service and facilities Comfy bed lovely garden 
338433,Hotel 55, That when we booked it gave us a alloctacted parking space on the premises but when we arrived there wasn t anywhere so we had to pay to park in the station around the road then move it late that night when the ticket expired and find somewhere else to park,No Positive
338434,Hotel 55, Charges for items left in fridge Either leave it complimentary or don t leave anything , Very accommodating and helpful Not at all stuffy Restaurant was lovely too 
338435,Hotel 55, Location of hotel was difficult to find as signs weren t the best and it was located in a residential area so it looked like a house, Easy location for Wembley Stadium Taxi with UBER was very cheap to and from hotel but if weather was nice it could of been walked in about an 1hr

338440,Hotel 55, My only negative was that we visited on a Sunday and the sushi restaurant was not open which was unfortunate I don t remember this being mentioned in the write up But not a reason not to stay here , The room was perfect and the free coffee in the room was very nice too Very good location for Wembley stadium and the member of staff that checked us in and out was very pleasant helpful and cheery 
338441,Hotel 55, Could have had a few more breakfast tea bags and a few less peppermint tea bags Bigger cups in the rooms would be nice too but that s it, Staff couldn t do enough for you we were upgraded for free as it was our first stay great facilities in the rooms North Ealing tube is 3 4 minutes walk parking in front of the hotel OR 4 for a day in the NCP round the corner

338444,Hotel 55, Nothing apart from Price, Great Stunning hotel got it for a great price too Shame I cant get it for the same price for the rest of the week or I would stay longer 
338445,Hotel 55, As I booked through booking com the breakfast was not free but a buy extra option Felt that it was a bit expensive for this choice of breakfast Japanese restaurant was really London pricey , Liked everything Otherwise nice comfortable bed renovated feeling overall Not like in most London townhouse hotels that have this old old molded feeling Hotel 55 was modern Staff super friendly 10 point to them Nespresso machine in the hotel room can t beat that 
338446,Hotel 55, Shower did not give hot water however was given a good discount and offered another room to shower in by very helpful and apologetic staff , Excellent staff very helpful clean modern hotel deceiving from outside 
338447,Hotel 55, The first room we were in was a street view room you can really hear the traffic outside it s a fairly busy road It s not so much of a bother in the day but not ideal if you re a light sleeper We got moved because the bath broke to another room away from the street which was perfect no noise , The staff were absolutely lovely so helpful The bed was comfy nice and warm and the bathroom was great The in room facilities were good too there was always fresh water and tea coffee available Unfortunately the restaurant was closed whilst we were staying but the bar area was lovely 
338448,Hotel 55, There is very limited parking so spaces are at a premium The road outside the hotel is very busy with lots of traffic noise I wish I had spent the extra to get a room overlooking the garden at the rear of the hotel , The room and facilities were of a very high standard and the staff were very courteous and helpful The Momo restaurant serves excellent Japanese food and has a lovely relaxed atmosphere The hotel is very close to the North Ealing tube station making it easy to access London
338449,Hotel 55, The room was at the top of the stairs and No lift Also the room was very hot loft type room so this did put me off as it was so small However the price was fare for London prices , The location was perfect the staff were friendly the room was clean and smart looking 
338450,Hotel 55, We were given 2 rooms at the road side which were EXTREMELY noisy due to the traffic even with the windows closed Did not sleep at all A small compensation was given after complaining for 15 minutes but does not make up for a night without sleep Parking is almost non existing 4 lots for the whole hotel , Friendly staff but cannot recommend 
338451,Hotel 55, Lighting was very ambient which was lovely until I wanted to read I couldn t get either of the reading lights to work , Coffee pods in the room how civilised amazing shower like a workout Right by a tube station for easy access into London 
338452,Hotel 55, Not much we didn t like but on our way out we checked under the bed for any items we may have left and found some unexpected items not belonging to us but this didn t knock the quality of our stay would definitely go back , The room was a comfortable size for a couple the shower was awesome we didn t get chance to taste the food and only stayed over night but wish we had time to But the staff we re friendly and welcoming the rooms where well presented 
338453,Hotel 55, Continental breakfast was 8 50 in addition to room rent, Stylish little hotel courteous staff willing to help good location near a tube station decent breakfast
338454,Hotel 55, kids comandeered the big bed so us adults had the sofa bed , the room was brilliant well away from any noise from the roads clean comfortable and well decorated 
338455,Hotel 55, The parking there was very limited parking only 4 x spaces and this should of been highlighted on the hotel s details i would not use this hotel again because the parking is very limited I had a nightmare journey driving up from Southampton and it took me 4 hours because of the horrendous traffic then to arrive late and no parking , The Staff were very helpful
338456,Hotel 55, There was no hot water in the morning when we tried to have showers we tried to call reception to sort it out and called them three times with no answer ,No Positive
338457,Hotel 55, Unfortunately the station that is just around the corner was closed for repairs so had to walk quite a way to the next station if I had known I would have got a taxi , Very friendly staff suprisingly luxurious accommodation and quiet even though it is quite close to the main road Slept extremely well I would recommend this hotel 
338458,Hotel 55, A very busy main road to manoeuvre out of during rush hour but that was all , I arrived very late around 4 30am and staff were more than happy to check me in then I had called ahead and asked if a package could be delivered there too and again they were happy to oblige I had a lot of cases to bring in and they helped me with those The room was very comfy very clean and the nespresso machine was a fantastic addition 
338459,Hotel 55, Can t fault anything, Staff was superb A min walk from tube station Decor was cool n room was so clean with lots of extras Magazines nespresso coffee rocciatane products in the bathroom green peppermint tea etc etc there were all nice little touches around the room Very pleased 
338460,Hotel 55,No Negative, Staff were very welcoming and helpful We were upgraded to the suite on arrival and there was parking available right outside the front door We were visiting for a friends wedding and asked for a late checkout so the bride could get ready stress free which was given to us without hesitation Would definitely stay again 
338461,Hotel 55, Nothing, Everything was excellent the staff went the extra mile ensuring gluten free bread and biscuits for breakfast nothing too much trouble Rooms so clean and bathrooms of high quality
338462,Hotel 55,No Negative, The Hotel staff were very friendly Mike on reception was very professional and friendly he made me feel very welcome and I would definitely go back again and tell all my friends
338463,Hotel 55, The lack of free WiFi in rooms was highly disappointing and I felt mislead by the website Also not good utensils no vegetable peeler for example, Location
338464,Hotel 55, Traffic on the north of circular was a little loud , Staff at reception very helpful in providing directions and generally trying to exceed expectations 
338465,Hotel 55, One of the blinds did not work well and the room was a little dark as there was no ceiling light The memory foam mattress was not good for someone with back problems , Superbly located for tube access to Central London Staff were friendly and helpful The room was spotlessly clean and had a lovely garden view A Nespresso coffee machine in the room was a great bonus 
338466,Hotel 55, Room was rather dark not enough lighting one small ceiling light, Staff were excellant reception sorry don t know your name was helpful made us so welcome and gave very welcome advise
338467,Hotel 55, There is no elevator for top floors Only 5 car parking available first come first serve and requires a bit of skill as well but that s just London I guess , Very good location very close to North Ealing underground station Restaurants close by and a supermarket open till 12 am Very easy access to motorways it took me less than 10 minute to hit the motorway from the hotel 
338468,Hotel 55, The room is small and the bed is small but clean and comfortable , The North Ealing Picadilly line station is a two minute walk and the Ealing Broadway Central line station is 5 or 10 minute walk so good location Nice pub around the corner Shops Restaurants within easy walking distance The desk clerk breakfast guys and cleaning staff are all pleasant 
338469,Hotel 55, Very minor but as we were in an annex it wasn t easy to get back into the main hotel A card reader on the back door would help , Fantastic loved every minute and the staff were extremely polite and helpful 
338470,Hotel 55, My only criticism would be the walls are paper thin you can hear pretty much anything that goes on in any of your surrounding rooms had an awful nights sleep due to noise , This is a lovely little hotel rooms are small but very cosy they are well equipped Ideal for a single night but wouldn t want to stay any longer as lack of space North Ealing tube station within a stones throw 
338471,Hotel 55, The lighting is really quite dim in the rooms and is the biggest issue we had The wi fi is a little patchy at times as well , The staff are especially helpful in particular Shay who helped us with our bags and arrangement of a car service 
338472,Hotel 55, The bed was very uncomfortable and the temperature of the room wasn t good too , Mainly good everything is lovely facilities are good Would stay again 
338473,Hotel 55, Right next to a very busy main road TV was a long way away and limited visibility Limited parking means 4 spaces if you re lucky , Very near to a tube station with full access to central London Inexpensive parking at station 
338474,Hotel 55, It had a fancy coffee machine but no kettle for making tea There is very little parking space which meant I had to park in the nearby NCP Car Park The Hotel did however refund the cost , Very clean and staff were attentive 
338475,Hotel 55, A couple came in late 01 45 and then spent around two hours arguing I think they were above me I was extremely tired and ended I with a migraine the next day , The room was lovely the facilities in the room excellent and the luxury bath products a real treat The staff friendly 
338476,Hotel 55,No Negative, The staff were amazing Very friendly chatty and helpful which makes you enjoy it all the more I have never stayed that side of the city before but from now on I will make that my go to place Great room good size with a lovely bathroom My friend and I were very happy 
338477,Hotel 55, We were allocated a suite within the annexe which was very well fitted out but unfortunately was a smoking suite and spoiled what was a really excellent break, We have stayed here many times fist class well situated for tube station into central London
338478,Hotel 55,No Negative, The staff could not have helped us anymore morning noon and night they were there to help Breakfast was lovely bed comfortable le Occitane toileties lovely decorated Thankyou for a wonderful stay
338479,Hotel 55, Down side I noticed the public areas were very dusty and the parking was a little awkward but not insurmountable, All the staff were very helpful especially the guy who checked us in Our room was small but very comfortable and loved having a good cup of coffee to wake up to first time I ve had an Nespresso machine in my room Nice touch The shower was excellent and 3 ply loo paper too 
338480,Hotel 55, Room a little noisy due to traffic noise but this is to be expected right next to main road limited parking on site although I was lucky and did get a space , Staff friendly and helpful good location for access by road and tube 
338481,Hotel 55, There were some small restorations going on but this did not effect our stay overall , The service at Hotel 55 was exceptional The night staff especially treated us extremely well The restaurant was phenomenal and we really enjoyed the Japanese culture that was included 
338482,Hotel 55, I brought a few gadgets that I wanted to use on the TVs however I could not attach my HDMI cable as the TV was built into a combine the on the wall That was a let down as I had stayed for 2nights And need to use the TV, The comfort of the bed I have stayed in a lot of hotels but the mattress for me was amazing 
338483,Hotel 55, Nothing, Amazing reception guy Lovely staff amazing location near North Ealing station it s a nice hotel I was worried it was a B B but it s a lovely hotel
338484,Hotel 55,No Negative, Very convenient location next to an underground station to take you to central London Walking distance from Ealing Broadway with lots of shops and restaurants more locally Friendly staff and comfortable beds Amazing showers Would definitely stay again and recommend 
338485,Hotel 55, Room v small No lift Beware if you re a leisure traveller with a large case I could only just lay my small hand luggage flight sized case open on the floor Worth paying a bit more to not be facing a busy road Parking tricky need to pay for 24 hrs at nearby rail station , Japanese them through toy hotel was impressive Fabulous Japanese restaurant downstairs though London prices of course v good quality fittings in bedroom and bathroom not usual hotel shabby standard 
338486,Hotel 55, Mattress quality not consistent in all rooms I d had a bed with a memory foam mattress in a prior visit not the same this time I m afraid , Staff s attentiveness and willingness to oblige 
338487,Hotel 55, Safe in the room did not work Shower although worked amazingly was inside the bath with screen built on difficult to get in and out of and I am a healthy adult so anyone older or with disabilities won t be able to use this Lighting was dull Room a little dull my husband stayed here with my son and they had a fabulous room Mine was boring dull lighting poor But adequate just expected more after knowing what some rooms are like , Convenient location with parking 1st come 1st served Nesspresso machine in the room was excellent thought plenty of water and milk to use not stingy at all ask you will receive Very clean with Very accommodating happy staff Did not try the breakfast so cannot comment went to Costa round the corner next to Ealing common tube into Ealing Broadway town where there are plenty of places that do breakfasts less than the price of hotel 55 
338488,Hotel 55, Our first night the room faced the street and the noise from the traffic was almost too much The staff moved us to the back for our last 3 nights and it was quiet , We liked that it was next to the Metro less than 30 minutes from central London 
338489,Hotel 55, We stayed in room 101 Room with a street view The traffic noise from the road outside was incredibly loud and intolerable Our room would have certainly benefitted from double glazing The bed was also very uncomfortable Thankfully we only stayed 2 nights , Cheap Close to North Ealing tube 
338490,Hotel 55, mold on the ceiling in the bathroom room 202 busy street right next to room was impossible to sleep or watch TV with open windows continental breakfast for 7 50 night was not a real breakfast little more than croissants and tea no warm food for warm breakfast it s 11 50 night , friendly staff cute interior comfy bed big shower it was a good hotel for an 8 day vacation and not too pricey 
338491,Hotel 55, The price is higher a lot than before The toilet roll paper holder in the Deluxe Twin Room I stayed in needs to be fixed because it is loose from the wall The toaster in the restaurant is too old and need to be replaced , Small but fully equipped High quality room facilities Friendly and helpful reception gentleman The yard even though small makes confortable and relaxed A little further from the central but only less than 5 minutes to walk to North Ealing Station to take the central tube line Piccadilly Line Friendly and helpful reception gentleman It is the third time I stayed at this hotel 
338492,Hotel 55, Not bad but would have liked the room to be little bit bigger as well as the bed , Everything included in the room did not missing anything I needed Nicely decorated hotel felt very comfortable Super close to tube station 
338493,Hotel 55, overall good but just a number of small niggles shower not that clean but ok waste bin pedal not working blind did not fully close tea and coffee in a cupboard towels small and thin room a bit dark, location staff very friendly breakfast very good although not extensive 
338494,Hotel 55, The room size is REALLY small Could hardly move around if we have more than 1pc of luggage be it in the room or the corridor No lift at all so if you have a lot of big bags good luck to you , The hotel is really small but the location is good as it s easy to get around to city of London or the Ealing Broadway Shopping mall Only good for Solo traveller 
338495,Hotel 55, Smell of drains The reservation staff lying that there was no parking on premises He was so unhelpful and was willing to lose a sale , Nice bed polite staff
338496,Hotel 55, Breakfast could have been included, We stayed in the garden suite room it was extremely well fitted out and comfortable huge comfy bed perfect after a long day at near by kew gardens
338497,Hotel 55, The breakfast offer is limited and i had to wait for 25 minutes for the croissant before being rudely told that it will be another 15 minutes This incident was reported to the manager who was very apologetic and polite but the rude employee never bothered to apologize , Friendly staff except one rude employee in the restaurant Good location close to Tube station Clean room
338498,Hotel 55, The room was very small There was not a lot of room to get ready in I was surprised at this as the room did not look this way in the pictures There was only a side table on one side of the bed , The staff were very helpful and polite 
338499,Hotel 55, I was in a room by the front door and reception as a consequence I was woken up at 5 30am by the loud kitchen breakfast staff s phones going off and loud clattering of plates , The room was smart clean and comfortable The staff member was friendly and the amenities good 
338500,Hotel 55, Room could have been a little brighter , Friendly helpful staff Nespresso coffee and range of ordinary and herbal teas in room as well as stocked fridge Lovely L Occitane en Provence toiletries proper hair dryer and iron and ironing board provided Tube just around the corner Quiet and air conditioned so able to get a good night s sleep 
338501,Hotel 55,No Negative, A quaint little place the room was lovely for the price very clean and tasteful we loved the fact that we were left completely undisturbed and could wonder in and out of the garden all night if we wanted a cigarette Staff very polite and pleasant I honestly could not find a fault with the place We also got upgraded for free to garden view room Definitely will use this place again a lovely stay 
338502,Hotel 55, The room was small and cramped and had a sloping roof which made it difficult to move around the room for two people who are tall trying to get changed It was also very very hot and we required the aircon on all the time The Japanese restaurant attached to the hotel was awful and the worse Japanese food I have ever tasted and to make matters worse it was massively over priced especially given the quality of the meal, The location was ideal for what we required
338503,Hotel 55, First room was situated on front and was noisy however we were moved to a room on the side which was fine Lighting a bit dim for us oldiesc, Staff were friendly and very helpful
338504,Hotel 55, Nothing as such just perhaps the car park is small but there is free off road parking at weekends Our air con leaked the and there was a slight bit of mould on the shower bath glass door think the bathroom could do with a extractor , We had booked for Wembley over a month ago because of the easiness of free cancelation and pay on arrival The location for us was excellent in between Wembley and the bars in Ealing The building is very nicely presented and plenty of facilities in the room 
338505,Hotel 55, Just a caution that parking is limited , Convenient location round the corner from North Ealing tube station means you can be in central London in around half an hour Friendly staff
