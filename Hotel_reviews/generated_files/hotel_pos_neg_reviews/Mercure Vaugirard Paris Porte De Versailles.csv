232227,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, We had some issues with the shower the water was hot and no matter what we did we couldn t get it cooler , Close to the Metro and bus stop it was a quiet location peaceful walk to the Seine 
232228,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, I still have a double charge on my credit card But I still love this hotel and would stay again , The room and its view were amazing My daughter loved the kids area in the lobby We enjoyed the location because we were able to walk to close by bakeries and restaurants The area is very safe and beautiful 
232229,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, Parking was tight A little awkward as you have to drive in to a lift to go down to the internal parking lot but once inside we had secure parking with lift access directly in to the hotel so were happy with that , A really lovely hotel with some nice cafe restaurants locally We had one night there to visit Paris before heading to Eurodisney Not far from the main attractions so great for us to make the most of our time Very friendly helpful staff Room was great size was very clean and well appointed 
232230,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, After being told I could park my car with a roof box We arrive to be told I would have to take it not an easy feat, Staff very helpful breakfast very good
232231,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, I felt and hurt and cut my self badly in the bathtub their tubs are poorly designed they have a incline section at both ends and their shower heads are placed at a point where it forces you to step in the inclined area of the tub and as anyone can imagine if you are showering normally you will be using soap and this makes this inclined area very slippery The air conditioning was not working well and when we asked they sent some one to check but the first question was where are you from which basically meant what do you expect this is the Mercure hotel The evening manager did not seemed to enjoy his job always with an attitude , Most of the staff were friendly and attentive 
232232,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles,No Negative, Breakfast was good 30 seconds walk to metro station and trams nice clean rooms and washrooms market and variety of restaurants on 2 5 minutes of walking distance
232233,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, Shower has low pressure the showerroom design has some problems every time after we showered a lot of water would dripped from the bottom of the shower screen , Although the location is a bit out of city centre but it s very easy to access all the public transport Love their beds super comfy the cleanness is definitely 5 stars Most staff members are very helpful and knowledgeable Unfortunately I had a little dispute with one of staff members when I checked out front office manager maryse soon came to rescue and resolved my queries made me smile again so for her I would give a five star 
232234,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, I think it was a bit expensive by considering the location , I was only one night in paris and the hotel was clean and comfortable and had good breakfast It was not at center but had good access to metro station I think it was a bit expensive by considering the location 
232235,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, The staffs service at the restaurant Below expectation Front desk service average No one offer to help with bags Manager not seen at the lobby Likely they do not care much about service Being Asian don t thing they live up to the expectation of all guests , F B not much choice Everyday almost the same set up the self service Orange juice machine coffee and pancake was nice
232236,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, Location isn t the best but it is very close to the metro so it s easy to get around Paris , Staff were very friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble The rooms were clean 
232237,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, Breakfast average I realise it was late when I requested a boxed breakfast for the next morning reception checked and yes this could be done Next morning there was no breakfast the person had forgotten ,No Positive
232238,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, Price, Location was good but after spending 470 euros for 3 nights there were no facilities in the room they don t even provide basics like drinking water room crockery room sleepers
232239,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, Rooms in second tour are accessible by taking two elevators and walking a hallway between the two buildings a bit of a rigmarole Hotel was a bit expensive for so far from the centre of Paris , Loved the fresh orange juice press machine at the breakfast buffet 
232240,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles,No Negative, The room was very clean The room was cleaned everyday and dirty linens towels replaced with clean ones The hotel s location is superb it s close to every mode of transport The staff are friendly and very helpful 
232241,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, wifi connection is not stable Depending on the room and router placement not same in all parts of room, Exceptionally friendly and helpful staff Special thanks for Ms Ruth for her professional attitude efforts in trying to resolve matters in best possible for client
232242,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, The tap was hard to close it kept running every time we used it the elevator was out of service once and we had to take the stairs up to the 7th floor , The hotel was clean and next to a metro station which you may use to reach anywhere in Paris
232243,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, We let the hotel know when booking it was my daughter s birthday trip to Paris not acknowledged at all We were actually there on her birthday , Easy access to public transport and a good breakfast The beds were really comfy and a room was spacious 
232244,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, Wifi code was daily so you would need to be clear about how many days you need access for , Nice room nice bathroom tea coffee in the room I asked for a quiet room and got one Breakfast was more than enough for anyone and the hotel was directly opposite the exhibition centre I was visiting No restaurant but plenty of places close by to eat at and opposite the tram stop and metro plus they gave me a voucher for a free drink at the bar what more can I say a good experience Also used the transfer service recommended by Booking com so had a car arranged in advance to drive from CDG to hotel and return two days late Thanks for the recommendation 
232245,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, For a 4star was a bit surprised to find paper cups for the coffee in the room Wifi was incredible slow And 20 Per person for breakfast is a bit of a joke , Good location for palace du sports
232246,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, I did not feel welcome at all 1 My checkin time was around 7pm and somehow there was only 1 assistant in the reception The other guy left and did not show up any more The only one person tried her best but for me it looked like a bad organisation of duties 2 My room key did not work They sent me back to the room 2 times after rebooting the key It turned out that the door lock did not work So finally I was given another room But before that I needed to go back and forth with my luggage 2 times trusting their words it should work They offered some drinks as a compensation but the drinks never appeared 3 The hotel looked like needing refurbishment dark and worn off The room was still quite ok 4 The breakfast wasn t expensive however rather limited in choice The service was non existent Personnel deliberately speaking French even if they understood that that s not my language , Bed was very good bath ok 
232247,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, The staff was a bit rude Maybe because of a language barrier We asked the staff to see if they do currency exchange because on their electronic board it showed the currency value and we thought Oh that s better than some of the places we saw on the streets and one of the staff said they don t do it in this hotel so she told us to go to Montparnasse Bienvenue We asked for the name of the Currency exchange place but she just told us to go there We got there and we got lost and confused We went to the other Mercure s that was in that area but they all had language barriers It was just a waste of time We ended up going to some Change place somewhere else We also had a Do Not Disturb Sign on our door because we don t feel comfortable people coming into our hotel room with our stuff out in the past we had hotel housekeeper steal things from us so it was just a mindset thing The housekeeper still came into our room and cleaned it up I mean what s the point of having that sign Sure we might be a little picky But it s better safe than sorry right What if that happened to you If we needed something we would call down to receptions , I liked the size of the room it was pretty big The bed was comfortable The rooms were clean The location was decent Just a 40min metro ride to places into Paris and the metro is literally right outside so it made location fair Should get a visitor pass to make it easier for the trip so you don t literally have to keep paying for the metro every time you take it 
232248,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, The hotel will lock the front main door at night and you have to phone the receptionist in order to open the door I had to wait several minutes until the receptionist opened the door because he was the ONLY person who were on duty that night it would be better if there are two or three persons stand by I would say , The fact that the tram and metro station is only 20 second walk even less Thts awesome 
232249,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, The hotel has two floors with rooms where smoking is allowed Unfortunately we got such a room Not very happy because I suffer from asthma There was no option to change to another non smoking room Did not know smoking was still allowed in European hotels Next time I book a hotel I will specifically request a non smoking room just to be sure , Location is great Rooms are quiet and clean 
232250,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, Breakfast is expensive at 20 each unless you have a big appetite Children eat free Bakery just on the corner of next road for pastries croissants 4 for 3 and coffee or nearby cafes serve breakfast for about 9 No restaurant for lunch or dinner though some room service options , Outside a good metro line Great base for sight seeing 
232251,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, Absolutely nothing , After a long journey and problems at Dover we arrived at 1 am to be met by a very friendly helpful male receptionist wish we could remember his name Hotel room was excellent comfortable clean and modern Breakfast was superb Absolutely no complaints about hotel or staff Thanks for a excellent short break 
232252,Mercure Vaugirard Paris Porte De Versailles, The rooms are very small and not comfortable beds When we arrived the girl in the lobby told me that they where only going to charge us for one night But few days after the checkout I was told by Email that it was non refundable Not exeptable , Location good
