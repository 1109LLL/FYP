250780,H tel Arvor Saint Georges,No Negative, The beds are incredibly comfortable the shower pressure is EXCELLENT and the staff are genuinely amiable and speak excellent English but are also always willing to indulge you if like me you wanted to practice your modest French 
250781,H tel Arvor Saint Georges,No Negative, Fantastic hotel with perfect location in a very lively central neighbourhood it is however surprisingly very quiet The rooms are not very big but they are very well equipped with a large comfy bed There is clearly attention given to the decoration of both the hotel the rooms which is charming Amenities are of great standing as well But the best is by far the staff of the hotel they are one of the nicest friendliest hotel staff I ve met 
250782,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, The bathroom flooded due to a dodgy shower fitting It was a bit of a hike to get to the closest Metro The location is to the north of Paris bit too far for me to walk , The Staff were friendly and helpful Very easy to talk to The area has many little cafe s It is within walking distance of montmatre 
250783,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, the TV channels we flipped through were all in French yet we noted a lot of the guests at the time were English speakers would have been good to have Euro news or BBC news or France 24 English if you book a taxi from there there is an extra charge of 7 Euros on top of the fair which i hadn t been informed before making the booking , the staff were very very friendly and went out of their way to give us directions to various places and suggestions on places to visit the location was great Breakfast was lovely the croissants were great 
250784,H tel Arvor Saint Georges,No Negative, Although the staff on hand was minimal they were all very efficient and helpful The area the hotel is in is quiet but with lots of interesting local shops and cheaper than the tourist centre restaurants 
250785,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, The rooms were at the front of the property and were a little noisy early in the morning bin collection etc , Very nice clean rooms and bathrooms Lovely helpful staff Also in a nice location not on the main drag but still a good area 
250786,H tel Arvor Saint Georges,No Negative, The hotel is very nicely decorated If you re into modern art you ll love it Staff was also very nice and helpful Very good value for money I ll definitely stay here again if I ll have meetings in the Opera area 
250787,H tel Arvor Saint Georges,No Negative, Lovely location Short bus metro ride from Gare du Nord The hotel is in a nice part of the city from where it s easy to get to the other sites The staff were wonderful and warm and are there to help 24 7 The room itself was comfortable cozy and clean We had a lovely weekend here 
250788,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, Nothing really The welcome was great and the hotel had a room ready for me at 10 00am when I flew in from Cambodia They went out of their way for me , I loved being in a non touristy area Living like a local with lots of inexpensive restaurants to choose from The room was spacious and I had everything I needed including lots of comfortable pillows
250789,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, Could have done with a couple of hooks in the bedroom to hang winter coats that were too long for the wardrobe , Room was not huge but we expected that as the hotel is in an old house Simply decorated but very clean and comfortable Loved the quirky wardrobe which was basically a huge dolls house Staff were universally friendly Breakfast was simple but excellent quality Hotel was well located and peaceful We d definitely return 
250790,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, A wardrobe too short to hang a coat or a dress and no alternative hooks in the room An ancient chest of drawers falling to pieces Poor lighting in the room TV badly positioned Room safe at floor level and difficult to access , Location near metro and quiet Very nice personnel Good breakfast Free newspapers Good bathroom plumbing and instant hot water Good bed Good range of TV channels for anglophones
250791,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, Nothing It was as expected , A lovely hotel in a lovely area with lots of local restaurants with good reviews close by The reception staff went above and beyond to help They helped with booking and printing our tickets for the Louvre when we arrived and finding us a local restaurant at short notice The location was perfect for us If you don t mind walking and getting to see the area it s a simple 15 20 minute walk from Gare Nord The Metro station is less than 5 minutes away but you can easily walk to Galleries and Printemps in 15 minutes The room was small but as expected with a centrally located hotel but was comfortable and clean and fine for our one night stay I honestly cannot fault Hotel Arvor 
250792,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, The fact that one day when we return to the Hotel by 16H00 the room wasn t clean We had to request the change of toals Other day only replaced one toal when we were two people Aspects to improve , Location 
250793,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, A bit chilly in the room Also no heating in the bathroom and low shower pressure Breakfast not the best But these were all minor issues the rest was perfect , Great staff especially Christopher and Nicholas at the reception very helpful Clean confortable room not huge but enough good bed nice bathroom an bath products Located in a nice area and easy metro and bus access Also good that we had a safe in the room Would definitely return 
250794,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, we did not like the charge for a Continental breakfast when we discovered we were being charged we quit eating there it was way too much money for what you got we went to cafes and got much more for a lot less, we loved the location and the staff was great
250795,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, Nothing , We love the perfect location on a peaceful and attractive street in our favourite part of Paris We especially appreciate the friendly relaxed and welcoming attitude of the staff We like the breakfasts the beautiful lounge with books to browse and the general warm and welcoming ambience We especially love the design of the interiors Mixing traditional with imagination The Arvor is one of our very favourite hotels in Paris and after many stays over the years we regard it as a sort of home from home 
250796,H tel Arvor Saint Georges,No Negative, First time in Paris with my wife for honeymoon and both we loved it so much Very good location close enough to metro supermarket and cafes wonderful decoration with exceptional view of Eiffel Tower and very clean bathroom Definitely we will stay here if we come to Paris again 
250797,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, Can t really think of anything , I ve never enjoyed such warm and friendly service in Paris It was such an unexpected and lovely surprise Perfect location quiet but central ideal for nice bars and restaurants Breakfast was very pleasant and the lady working in the kitchen during the week was lovely 
250798,H tel Arvor Saint Georges,No Negative, I have stayed here before and love the atmosphere of this small hotel The location is excellent quiet but with lots of restaurants shops etc immediately nearby 
250799,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, It s fairly priced but still quite expensive Our room was in the roof and it was very hot the weekend we were there There is no air con the fan provided helped but it was still hot , Lovely hotel rooms were modern clean and super comfortable Our room had an amazing view over the rooftops we could even see the Eiffel Tower And as the hotel is on a side road it was also very quiet We heard no noise at all either from inside the hotel or out Breakfast was buffet style but lovely and had something for everyone 
250800,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, Bed a little too hard and room small but functional , Great location within walking distance of Metro stations restaurants Moulin Rouge Staff very friendly and spoke good english Wifi OK free and good for 2 days before you had to get another code 
250801,H tel Arvor Saint Georges,No Negative, Really tranquil in a quiet street in central Paris The hotel was pristine The Bedrooms were so comfy and the bathroom had Luxury toiletires Would live to return for a longer stay 
250802,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, The hotel is overprice there was no celling lamp in the room why and the area was rather isolted Doesnt worth the price tag of 150 per night, Very nice crew close to the metro room was clean
250803,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, Floors creak Doors don t shut easily Our bathroom door didn t close at all No water connection in the separate toilet in the suite guess the French don t wash hands after a loo break The courtyard which is advertised on the site is only accessible fr behind the reception the door is closed and noone really used it while we were there So don t feel awkward just ask to use it like we finally did as its really cute A mini fridge in the room wd be nice as I cant imagine the room in summer without cold water to drink , Separate toilet in in the suite Neighbourhood caf s 17 mins walking to Montmarte Close to metro station St George Room is very peaceful and quiet Charming decor Very clean Free tea and apples through the day available at the reception and a coffee machine in the suite The lady who served us tea over the weekend is super nice and sweet we selected the hotel for its location and character and were very pleased 
250804,H tel Arvor Saint Georges,No Negative, Super comfortable bed nice linen and the bath was heavenly after tramping round Paris all day Staff very helpful Great location in quiet street off the main streets off Pigalle 
250805,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, pretty compact room though well sized for the price and for what is considered to be a norm in Paris , Nice venue located 5 mins walking distance away from a metro station quiet area very attentive staff
250806,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, Nothing , Quirky Parisian feel and ample breakfast Staff were very accommodating The fire alarm went off accidentally during our breakfast and the staff were very apologetic and removed the cost of breakfast from the bill
250807,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, Room was very basic No heated towel rail in bathroom No bath , Great Location Lovely staff Cozy downstairs Fabulous cafe bar around the corner Great breakfast although not included in price so a costly way to eat Very comfortable beds 
250808,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, I don t know really I love it the way it is , I love the design of this hotel Especially the lobby which is cosy and welcoming Staff is great At the same time helpful warm and cool 
250809,H tel Arvor Saint Georges,No Negative, excellent location we had a room on the 5th floor which was really spacious especially for Paris Friendly Staff and really lovely bright clean and modern decor 
250810,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, It is not THAT important but thicker curtains in the bathroom could be a good idea light curtains in the bedroom , Stayed at the Arvor one night The staff was very welcoming and pleasant The room was clean and big with and very comfortable bed and most importantly very very very quiet Located next to a tube station and close to a range of lovely restaurants Perfect 
250811,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, the reception staff seemed rather inexperienced clueless and cold the rooms offer only minimal storage and definitely not enough for a weekend stay for two people the rooms are small and the decor although quirky is not functional the doors bang loudly and you can hear everything we were expecting a fridge and a coffee maker in a 4 star hotel but the amenities were basic, the location is great very central and in a quiet street off a lovely residential area communal areas are very nice and welcoming and it s very clean
250812,H tel Arvor Saint Georges,No Negative, The staff were so welcoming and helpful The hotel was so beautifully decorated and inviting Lovely quiet and safe residential area with nice restaraunts Would definitely recommend 
250813,H tel Arvor Saint Georges,No Negative, Staff were lovely and gave us a great room which had a view of the Eiffel Tower Comfy beds crisp white sheets and room decor was tasteful and quirky Few minutes walk to Metro and near Sacre Couer Lots of reasonably priced restaurants nearby and a Carrefour Both myself and my teenage daughter loved our stay and would stay again 
250814,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, The plug was attached to the wall in a flimsy way and came off when i pulled the plug out No kettle in the room to make tea with , Friendly staff good use of furniture in small space imaginative surroundings Good breakfast Good location 
250815,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, No water cattle in the room but you could get tea downstairs at any day nighttime Basic breakfast though very tasty, Lovely small rooms very comfortable and clean Friendly stuff
250816,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, The heating system of this hotel was not working and our stay became very uncomfortable as a result We told the front desk staff about it several times and the only thing they ever did was providing additional blankets We still paid the full price at the end despite this major issue I caught a cold during my stay in this hotel and am still dealing with it If the heating system of a hotel is not working and they know about it they should let the guests in advance and booking com should remove it from the list of amenities of this hotel This heating issue definitely requires further investigation In my opinion this hotel should be rated much lower than its current rating I would not call this hotel excellent under any circumstances , Very friendly staff Quiet neighborhood 
250817,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, They could have refilled the 2 coffee capsules daily instead of only provided on the first day I stayed for 5 days and the coffee machine was only used on day1 What a waste I know I could buy them from the reception at 1euro each but I also don t think it costs the hotel much to supple customers a daily dose of 2 capsules after all we do pay the same rate daily So why not the same care and service , The GOOD breakfast every morning Although not an extensive selection of choices but was adequate with quality food Simple and delicious 
250818,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, The breakfast could be better for the price , The location was close to metro station and you can easily walk from the Nord Train station It has all we needed for our staying in the room and staff were really friendly
250819,H tel Arvor Saint Georges,No Negative, Very convenient to transport routes nice quite area but close to good restaurants and small shopping area Very helpful staff and breakfast was good great to have proper fresh orange juice If you re lucky your room will have a good view of the Eiffel tower 
250820,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, Contrast to all the men the female desk receptionist came across a bit cold and nit really bothered It is very important to have staff that are consistent with each other so guests get the same treatment each time, Really liked the theme and furniture pieces Also the staff member with the glasses he was very approachable and kind
250821,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, Disappointing experience The hotel has physical keys for the rooms They require you to give the front desk the key before leaving every day Upon check in the front desk associate told me the wrong room and gave me the corresponding key I walked into someone else s room with all of their personal belongings out and exposed Additionally I came back on 2 separate evenings to my room unlocked after it was cleaned I expressed my concern to the front desk and she disregarded my complaint As a solo female traveler I felt uncomfortable with how casual they were with security I went downstairs at night to find the front desk man sleeping on the couch There were some great associates who were polite and helpful but overall the staff just lacked professionalism , Room and bathroom were spacious and clean Great location 
250822,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, Difficult to fault Standard room price is fairly expensive as if most of Paris but via Booking com got a very good price , Very nice staff lovely communal areas room had a view of the tip of the Eiffel Tower The hotel is also in a nice part of town just a short walk from Montmartre but also close to the central city It s on a nice quiet back street and the immediate neighbourhood has a lively feel with many excellent looking dining choices Would absolutely recommend

250825,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, There is nothing we dislike about this hotel After several visits over the years we still love staying here , The interior design The very friendly and helpful staff The peaceful location The rooftop view of Paris from our room The beautiful lounge area with books to browse with a drink from the bar served with a welcoming smile and kind words
250826,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, The parking costs , The boutique hotel vibe mixing contemporary art with vintage finds and most of all the prime location of this hotel near gorgeous caf s one off shops and of near Montmartre make this a real gem in the heart of Paris

250833,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, The only change we would have made was an air conditioner However saying that it is not expected from a 3 star , The staff were extremely accommodating and friendly Really a pleasure The reception breakfast area had a lovely feeling to it Rooms were clean and comfortable 
250834,H tel Arvor Saint Georges, No bad experiences but had it been hotter the lack of air conditioning would have become a factor although the rooms do have fans , Close to Metro stop Pleasant sitting room library one wall of books with a few English titles Lovely breakfast at a reasonable price Nice design
