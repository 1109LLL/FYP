462731,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, Nothing , I liked everything about this hotel one of the nicest I have ever stayed in Attention to detail for the comfort of the guest was evident The breakfast was superb and the location could not be beaten Highly recommended 
462732,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, Shower was placed strangely in the tub making it a little hard to use , Comfortable room and bed Good that it was air conditioned as Vienna was very hot while we were there Coffee in the room was quite good 
462733,Hotel Am Stephansplatz,No Negative, This is a great hotel Location was ideal most attractions were within walking distance The staff from the reception desk restaurant porter were some of the nicest most friendly helpful we have encountered in quite some time The room was spacious with a well appointed bathroom very quiet The breakfast was varied would suit most people the view of the passing traffic St Stephens church was a real bonus We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel
462734,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, Nothing Everything was perfect for us , Proactive and exceptionally helpful staff Proximity to venues restaurants Vienna Opera Hauser sites fine dining cafes shops was outstanding St Stephansplatz church was just 52 STEPS from hotel Danube canal was a 15 minute easy walk Would come back here in a heartbeat 
462735,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, The menu of breakfast was poor and also house cleaner didn t do a good job , We have got the upgrade of room and it was almost perfect room to stay 
462736,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, On one occasion the staff was so preoccupied with preparing Sunday brunch for non guests they cut breakfast time by one hour without prior notice and would not even offer a coffee somewhere in the corner instead of a breakfast I think something should be done about hotel staff priorities towards clients , Location is as central as it gets view on cathedral 
462737,Hotel Am Stephansplatz,No Negative, The hotel is very well situated for visiting all the tourist sights city centre bars and restaurants The staff were all very friendly and helpful making recommendations and offering to book reservations for us The hotel is very comfortable and provides all the refinements necessary to make your stay special without being overly ostentatious 
462738,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, I found the room too hot but my husband loved it , WIFI excellent in room Breakfast very good variety of hot and cold food Nespresso machine in room Very comfortable bed
462739,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, The over easy egg I ordered tasted like it had been fried in a wok some oriental fried rice type flavor Might want to use a different pan for cooking eggs Bottled water in the room would be nice , Location location location The staff were super friendly and helpful Dinner recommendation was great we went twice Breakfast buffet had plenty of protein and carbs and fresh coffee lattes and tea Loved the heated bathroom floors 
462740,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, Perhaps a little bit pricey but what else to expect for a perfectly located very nice hotel in the very centre of Vienna Definitely value for the money though , Excellent location magnificent view over the Stephans Dome really nice serviceminded staff very good breakfast buffet 
462741,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, The breakfast is not quite as good as it used to be It needs granola or muesli fresh berries and would be enhanced with Bircher muesli which it may have supplied in the past They do make a cappuccino but I d like to see it made on a large Italian espresso machine so it is creamy rather than the usual froth on top of the coffee style It would help in the bathroom if the great heating towel rack worked for drying clothes The toilet door also keeps closing on you I had this problem in another room too , I keep staying at this hotel as it is homey and perfectly located in the centre of Vienna just above the metro The rooms are spacious and well appointed the beds are comfy and have those lovely Doonas folded over Austrian style Staff are friendly and always willing to help The bathroom accessories are excellent I really appreciate the type and quantity provided 
462742,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, Only down side to the GREAT location is a little bit of late night noise that natural comes with being in the center of all activity in the old town Personally it just added to the fun of the experience , Incredibly GREAT location Everything you could possibly want for an amazing hot and or cold breakfast was included Staff was great and helpful as well Great recommendations and tickets for events and tours available right at the desk We even stayed an extra night so we could do a previously unplanned day trip to Budapest that the hotel helped organize at our request Definitely worth the day trip to see Budapest but glad it was not at the expense of a day in Vienna which we liked a lot more This is from someone who has visited over 40 countries 
462743,Hotel Am Stephansplatz,No Negative, The location is perfect right opposite the cathedral The metro right on the doorstep The staff always had a smile and were ready to answer all queries I found the bed comfy 
462744,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, Wished the heater is warmer, We got upgraded to the rooms with balcony on 7th floor and ST Stephen cathedral was literally on my face What a beautiful view Bed was comfy and breakfast was yummy Best location in Wien 
462745,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, The hotel was very hot but fortunately our room had really big windows so they were open all of the time If I m being really picky I would suggest a slight adjustment to the shower to prevent it running hot cold , The location the landmark view room and its en suite the staff the breakfast and evening drinks 
462746,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, Nothing, Staff were very friendly and very accommodating They recommended a number of restaurants There was lots of choice at breakfast and you could have any eggs specifically made Water in the room everyday was a brilliant touch as well as the welcome pretzels and goodbye sweets Would highly recommend and would definitely stay again 
462747,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, Buffet breakfast ok but not great No tea coffee making facilities in room Restaurant only open until 10 No room service after that , Bed and bedding very good Nice bathroom Great location 
462748,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, The gym was very small and had no treadmill Not a problem though as lots of parks and lovely walks nearby, The location was great near to lots of sights and places to eat and drink We found the hotel easily just head for the cathedral The staff were friendly and helpful The breakfast was very good 
462749,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, Room was too warm but maybe we didn t know how to adjust it , Large room super clean and very quite Right in the heard of the old town area View from the breakfast room was magnificent Everything certainly exceeded our expectations 
462750,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, It took too long to get the car from parking Car parking cost too much , Very good hotel rooms and service are excellent view to the cathedral is wonderful especially during breakfast

462753,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, Really missed my cups of tea Would have been 100 perfect with a kettle in the room , Everything Comfy beds great view spacious room lovely bath immaculate cleanliness huge variety for breakfast selection with freshly squeezed juice and really fresh bread 
462754,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, No negative comments on this hotel Only that I wish my stay in Vienna was longer , This hotel was conveniently located within walking distance to all the central sites in Vienna Also there was a Metro line just outside the hotel entrance We rented a car but didn t need to The hotel valet parks your car for you as parking is limited in front of the hotel Buffet breakfast was delicious with traditional European items or made to order from the menu The best part was the view of St Stephan s during breakfast The breakfast room had floor to ceiling windows that faced St Stephan s and overlooked the pedestrian zone The staff could not have been more accommodating They looked up all my questions on the internet and provided me detailed instructions maps etc The room was beautiful contemporary toiletries very nice robe included We had a full size tub and standing shower We have already decided we will be visiting Vienna again and definitely staying at Hotel Am Stephansplatz again 
462755,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, Air condition not so good, Prime location Center of the center Inside stephanplats in all shopping streets Near all historic attractions Lovely breakfast Lovely room Vwery big Bathroom is very big E erything is the best Only aircondition in rooms is a little bit slow Small problem in hot days as we had
462756,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, The only drawback was that if we left the windows open at night it could be quite noisy This was only a problem one night when there was a large group partying on the street and in the plaza , The staff was very friendly and helpful The room was comfortable and everything worked well 
462757,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, Room was on the small side There was nothing out of the ordinary and no treats or touches of luxury Generally overpriced frankly I expected more , Excellent central location Everything worked as expected and there were no surprises Solid quality good hotel 
462758,Hotel Am Stephansplatz,No Negative, Everything was perfect from the front desk to the lovely buffet breakfast We also enjoyed the art work throughout the property The rooms were comfortable and attractive 
462759,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, Nothing to give rise to adverse comment, From the minute we arrived we were greeted in a friendly and personal manner We were shown to our room and everything explained to us as it was our first vIsit The room and everywhere in the hotel was spotlessly clean and well presented The buffet breakfast was exceptionally displayed Our taxi was arranged on time to take us to the Hauptbahnhof in luxury 
462760,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, Not the hotel s fault at all but don t use the ATM across the street I thought I was being vigilant but still my ATM card was hacked there and then attempted use made multiple times in South Korea the next day Almost a month later still getting it resolved , Comfortable rooms and helpful staff Can t beat the view of the cathedral from the restaurant Amazing location is worth the price for easy walking to the museum district the Hofburg etc Subway stop right by the hotel and tram stops nearby Grabenstrasse is right around the corner don t miss the wonderful Julius Meinl gourmet specialty market Also try the open air market restaurants at the Naschmarkt a short walk away 
462761,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, Unable to suggest any improvements , The hotel is in a superb location and being in a pedestrian area meant it was very quiet at night It is very clean the beds are comfortable and the facilities are all good Our room had a direct view of the cathedral and it was quite spacious The staff were welcoming and attentive and the breakfast menu was extensive good quality and hot when it was meant to be 
462762,Hotel Am Stephansplatz,No Negative, The location was wonderful and the room was large and comfortable The bathroom was also very good I would come back and recommend this hotel to friends traveling to Vienna
462763,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, Nothing , Everything The location is right by the Stephansplatz underground line and is of course right by the cathedral Also very close to many places to eat and shop Our room was spacious clean and nicely decorated with art The bed was one of the most comfortable if not the most comfortable that we had on our trip throughout Europe Bathroom had many supplies as well as a bathtub and separate shower The included breakfast was wonderful Many options and fresh fruit and juices The servers bring you a carafe of coffee 
462764,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, We were happy with everything about the hotel Some rooms could be noisy because of the activity at Stephansplatz but we loved that aspect , The hotel staff were very professional and answered any questions we had The rooms were very comfortable clean and airy The breakfast was delicious and the view from the breakfast room to the Stephan Cathedral was very memorable It is right near and underground station

462772,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, Not sure about room service I asked for a cup of tea at about 10pm which was greeted a bit begrudgingly The main downside was that the room was too warm at night we were there in January but even with the heating turned down and the window open it was very hot , The location was brilliant with a lovely view of the cathedral from the dining room The staff were very friendly and helpful especially at reception The breakfast was good The room was comfortable with good sized comfy beds Nice selection of toiletries and a powerful shower 
462773,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, The bathroom door needed to be propped open it needed a door stopper as it would not stay open A full length mirror in the room would have been nice, The location next to the church was superb It was in the middle of the CBD and could always be found by following the church spire in the distance It was also located above a metro station The rooms were spacious designed for sustainability and all expected facilities were provided including a towel heating rack The staff were terrific Breakfast with a view of the cathedral was pretty good too 
462774,Hotel Am Stephansplatz, If you need to have a window open to get fresh air while sleeping better wear ear plugs to bed , Location absolutely fabulous apart from being right next to St Stephans Cathedral it is right at a metro station Breakfasts are superb Staff are very friendly and helpful
