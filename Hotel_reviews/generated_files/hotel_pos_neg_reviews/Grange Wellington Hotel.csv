241758,Grange Wellington Hotel, I expected more from this property I spent a lot more that initially planned because I really wanted our first hotel to be nice after so much traveling The staff did not really try to help us especially the concierge We had just arrived from America a 11 hour flight plus the train ride plus walking from the train to the hotel and it was 8am I asked for an early check in and they offered 2 30 normal check in is 3pm Gee thanks that will help a lot Asked the concierge to recommend something for us to do while we waited for our room to be ready you know like in 6 7 hours and he had no idea what to recommend Ummmm this is London you live here He said I don t know what do you like to do Do you like to walk Yes that s my favorite thing to do Tell me where I can take a nice walk Give me a break When we finally got back to the hotel they didn t even help us with our bags The room was nice but small The lights were very complicated We couldn t get them to turn off and had to call someone to come up to help I m not an idiot I tried for quite a while If your system is complicated leave some notes or instructions , Great location

241763,Grange Wellington Hotel, I thought there where hard to open child lock on the Mini Bar i was wrong in a 4 star hotel the Mini Bar is locked unless you pawn something or put your card for insurance I bet there where treasure of overpriced wine and soda in there There where warning signs and reminders in the room to guests to put laptops and valuables in the safe And guess what no safe The people in the reception would not believe me until a hotel klerk came to my room to see for himself The only answear was it had been taken away by the hotel No envelopes or pen or pencils in the room on the small desk where only threat of high fine if i d dare to lit a cigarette Bad smell in the room Cold and aircondition i could not tame , Quick checkout

241769,Grange Wellington Hotel, This hotel was a bit of a splurge for us so we were expecting it to be nicer than some of the other hotels we stayed at during our trip However this was our least favorite hotel of the trip and the most expensive For the price the rooms were very small and the beds were the most uncomfortable beds we had our entire trip They did not provide a blow dryer and our trash can was broken Both the room and the bathroom were uncomfortably small I purchased the executive room for my parents with a king bed and that is literally all you get for almost double the price Not worth it at all Also the staff was not very friendly Overall we were disappointed with the Grange Wellington , The location is about the only thing I liked at this hotel 
241770,Grange Wellington Hotel, My daughter had rung on two occasions for a request for a special anniversary of wine and of course offered to pay she was told this was taken care of and we would get complimentary chocolates and water but we had nothing and in fact payed four pounds fifty for a bottle of water It did not matter much to us but she was most upset at this Despite that we had a lovely time we would visit a grange hotel again , Very clean comfortable and quiet room with a lovely view

241773,Grange Wellington Hotel, I left my phone charger in the room and when I asked them to post it to me they said they didn t find it Also too far to walk to Victoria if you have mobility issues , Room was modern quiet and very clean Staff were great and managed to find me a room before checkin time as I arrived early Free parking in surrounding streets at wknds I loved being able to open the original Sash windows and let some air in rather than being in a sealed aircon room like most hotels 
241774,Grange Wellington Hotel, There really wasn t anything they would have done better , The hotel had a stunning courtyard at the front overlooking a beautiful square The hotel was less than 10 minute walk from Victoria tube station and 15 mins from the coach station My 14 year old daughter was having a tough time with internet trolls and they upgraded our room to a huge room with two king sized beds and the staff amazing it was perfect for us being based so centrally getting to Piccadilly and Leicester Square so easily We also had a long lie in in really comfy beds Will definitely stay here again Thank you so much for making our weekend special

241779,Grange Wellington Hotel, We couldn t sleep because the noise of the pipes was unbearable It stopped eventually after 2 am when we getting ready to ask to change room which big nuisance for one night stay and we also thought that it might be the same in all the rooms The noise woke us up before 6 am I assume that the noise stops only if no one on the floor or in the same line is using bathroom The staff wasn t rude but they gave impression that they couldn t care less I haven t argued with them just mentioned the problem we had As there was not much interest to listen I gave up When we passed by later to pick up the luggage no one greeted us both coming in and out Not because I complained because there were other people at the desk but just because they don t seem to care It s not really important I know but it s unpleasant It s a 4 star hotel i e you spend quite a lot you expect them to at least say hi , The location is good very central but silent The room is spacious and the bathroom is nice and new

241851,Grange Wellington Hotel,No Negative, From start to finish out stay was impeccable Staff was extremely friendly and professional The room itself was clean luxuriously equipped and offered a view of Vincent park We chose the location as its close to Victoria station with quick access to the Gatwick express Many cafes supermarkets and restaurants within walking distance Could not have asked for more 
241852,Grange Wellington Hotel, All the elevators were not in working order while I was there Beds are not comfortable and the pillows are deflated Rate I received weekend to weekday rate was very high and it did not include breakfast compared to the rate I received when I extended my stay weekday rate Which was significantly lower , Friendly staff and great location Walking distance to Victoria and right across from a park Well designed rooms

241858,Grange Wellington Hotel, Could have done with a couple of pans in the kitchen so we could cook eggs , Fantastic facilities Extremely quiet for central London Lots of space and great kitchen area 
241859,Grange Wellington Hotel, The menu was good and I enjoyed the evening meal which was very tasty Would have enjoyed a better bread which was mass produced and could be much improved from the standard baguette style with frozen butter The service was just a little slow Breakfast felt rather crowded maybe to do with layout of restaurant as it was busy, Great room bed and bathroom supplies I would have liked a spare blanket in the room as the room took some time to heat up This didn t spoil my stay as the staff were pleasant and helpful and the hotel had excellent decor throughout Would definitely stay again 
241860,Grange Wellington Hotel,No Negative, Wonderful hotel situated a 10 minutes walk from Westminster Luxurious rooms and extremely gentle staff I could have not desired anything better than the Grange Wellington Hotel
241861,Grange Wellington Hotel, None, The location near to main road bus stops to access major locations in London Victoria station is about 10 mins walk only Staff is very helpful to guide which bus to take to go around London Buy the oyster card at the airport off we go around London The hotel resembles London In from of Vincent square Near to main road but yet very green and peaceful location 
241862,Grange Wellington Hotel, Considering the rates having no breakfast is dissapointing With speedy on line pre check in it took us 25 minutes to check in altough we were the only one on the desk , Location is nice
241863,Grange Wellington Hotel, Slightly impractical very very minor point given the high quality of the room For example there was a hob and sink near the door with a few plates and cutlery but no utensils or pots or pans There was a microwave though , Big room lots of privacy very quiet area immaculate bathroom The cleanliness privacy and peaceful area is very surprising considering it is in Central London Near to shops too Very good TV in the room Only a few minutes walk to Victoria 
241864,Grange Wellington Hotel, It is not for the hotel why do people slam the doors around 1 and 2 am , The hotel in the very central of London Refurbished clean room with large bathroom and extra large comfortable bed The room was extremely quiet on the 3th in front of a park Definitely will stay here again 
241865,Grange Wellington Hotel, Breakfast wasnot included in price need to pay 25 extra for a couple to add to package expensive , Room size service staff dealt with all queries issues well Quiet location good

241868,Grange Wellington Hotel,No Negative, Great location walking distance to the centre The room was big very clean comfortable beds quiet area Recently renovated bathrooms also modern and equipped with all facilities Excellent variety on the minibar Big new modern elevators Friendly staff 
241869,Grange Wellington Hotel, The seemingly professional character of this hotel wears off quickly We were first given a room with no windows not unusual for London but usually comes at a decent discount not the full rate we paid then one with a very noisy cooling aggregate running at full throttle 24 7 just outside making sleeping almost impossible After an almost sleepless night we were finally given a decent room worth the money By far the worst offense was calling an unlicensed overpriced by almost 100 illegal cab whose driver had no sense of direction after I asked for a normal taxi to the train station Couldn t change this due to lack of time Didn t expect this from an otherwise modern hotel Be aware Call your own cab at this hotel and be aware of their practices , The rooms are comfortable and all facilities like TV bathroom etc are up to a modern standard The best feature by far is certainly the central convenient location 
241870,Grange Wellington Hotel, Pillows were hard and lumpy, Bed was comfy bathroom was large and beautifully furnished Everything was extremely clean and in good condition Lovely view from the bedroom window 
241871,Grange Wellington Hotel, The bed was extremely uncomfortable The mattress was too hard and the pillows were not comfy Did not have the best nights sleep , The rooms are very clean and modern 
241872,Grange Wellington Hotel, I came here for my 3rd anniversary it was a suprise for my partner I had emailed the hotel a few days in advance asking if it was possiblefor them to put a little suprise in thr bedroom waiting for us for when we get there explaining it was our anniversary They confirmed this and said it was dully noted When we got to the room nothing was there empty Annoyed and slightly embarressed that I had to go and ask about what happened down in reception I found out they forgot to put it in there The receptionist was very apologetic and I could see she was annoyed too The bellboy or whoever they are called said to me that he didn t put the cake and fruit in our room because it would melt Then it took him another 20 minutes to bring it up My other half wasn t impressed It also completely ruined the mood Room service was awful too We got back from the theatre late evening and knew the restaurant would be closed so we ordered 2 sandwiches at 10 30pm and was told it would take half an hour because he had 6 other orders of sandwiches come through I didn t need to know that really It took an hour and a half for them to finally bring it up For a vegetarian club sandwich it took and hour and a half They then forgot the grilled chicken sandwich we had asked for too so that was another hour almost Considering the hotel is lovely and quite glamorous they weren t a sorry bunch for keeping us waiting almost 2 half hours for 2 sandwiches He also brought the bill up for us to pay when we had already told him that we will pay at check ou Not listening much I m not usually the one to complain about things I rarely write reviews but since I picked this hotel to stay at for our anniversary I thought I would say something , The hotel itself was amazing it had clearly been refurbished and up to a very good standard the bathroom was lovely Very comfy beds and a decent size room I have no complains about the hotel itself and would love to stay here again if the service was better 
241873,Grange Wellington Hotel,No Negative, excellent service all round staff spacious bedrooms cleaniness good location with open spaces in front of hotel one does not feel clastrophobic as in other hotel rooms

241876,Grange Wellington Hotel,No Negative, Having spent time in many hotels in London my stay at the Grange Wellington was without doubt the most relaxing and comfortable It is now my preferred choice for my next visit 
241877,Grange Wellington Hotel, Bathroom cold and no radiator Bathroom light on detector so comes on every time you open the door No full length mirror Was woken up at 8am on the Saturday because of a skip being loaded by the hotel at the front of the property Only one of the two lifts worked for the four days I stayed Toilet flush requires the seat down draw on side table kept opening, Bed very comfortable Great location for my work Bathrobe and slippers
241878,Grange Wellington Hotel, Would have been better for the breakfast to have been included , Clean quiet location and comfortable room The hotel is ideally placed for visiting Victoria and Westminster 
241879,Grange Wellington Hotel,No Negative, Nice large bed Clean and comfy room and public spaces Friendly staff and great location for central London Would definitely recommend and stay here again
241880,Grange Wellington Hotel, Window frames They are not tighten as a result wind is coming into room without problems along with noice, Location is very covenient room is comfortable what else is necessary for good stay 
241881,Grange Wellington Hotel,No Negative, Huge room Stayed in the executive room Comfortable bed Clean and tidy Staff can t do enough for you Will defiantly be staying there again when I m back in London next 
241882,Grange Wellington Hotel, A superior double room as advertised is misleading space wise as there is only just room to walk around a double bed not what we were expecting , On arrival reception staff helped us change room to a more spacious one 
241883,Grange Wellington Hotel, Staff titled me Mr on bill and room card though I provided my name which is female I have provided precise instructions on details needed on invoice and still the moment I went to pick up the invoice none of what I requested was in place , I like the attitude of staff very friendly 
241884,Grange Wellington Hotel, Could do with some additional seating in the room I d a tub chair or similar Only chair was at the desk , Location is excellent and fairly easy to park 
241885,Grange Wellington Hotel, Some noise from traffic outside during the night The windows could have been more isolated , Great location in a quiet area Modern clean and nice room 
241886,Grange Wellington Hotel, We ordered a taxi the night before our departure for early the next morning On arriving at the reception in the morning the gents at the desk seemed flustered and only then called us a taxi The taxi was almost 10 minutes late When it arrived it was an unmarked car and seemed to have no meter for charge When we asked the driver how much it was to the station he said that they told him 30 which is 3 times the amount that our London based friend had said it would be to that station We were clearly unhappy at a late taxi which had been prebooked and then being ripped off by the unlicensed taxi that did pick us up After almost missing our train to the airport we were most unhappy with the staff at reception who seemed to be almost useless and we are unsure whether it was even a licensed taxi company Definitely not a good note to leave it on and we would not return ,No Positive
241887,Grange Wellington Hotel, the check in staff member who apparently was the supervisor offered me a room which is half the size of a standard double room from what is advertised and mentioned on the site I raised this issue with her and told her I need a room similar to what they mentioned on the site as that is what I paid for She then offered me a standard room which was bigger She was just being sneaky by giving me a small room and savig bigger ones Not at all impressed with that DO make sure you check the room you booked for and get that when checking out one of the staff members said there is a 50pence due on my account and i had already cleared all my bills at the time of check in I didnt question what this 50pence was actually for since i was running late for my flight and offered a 10pound note coz i didnt have change He gave me back a plastic bag full of 20pc coins totalling upto 9 50 and said he doesnt have change It is atrocious for him to do that I didn t have time to argue so I left , Location cleanliness
241888,Grange Wellington Hotel, Road noise our room had a locked door leading to someone else s so it wasn t very private , Friendly staff well kept and nice d cor Bed comfortable 
241889,Grange Wellington Hotel,No Negative, We had a really nice room with a view of the cricket ground The hotel is striking both inside and outside and the staff were courteous helpful and friendly We couldn t have asked for more Plus the location close to Victoria Station is perfect for us 
241890,Grange Wellington Hotel, A small fridge would make our stay even more comfortable but this is no big deal , Everything The staff was really warm and helpful The location is perfect Will definitely book again 
241891,Grange Wellington Hotel,No Negative, We visited London over weekend to go to the nearby theatre and stayed at the hotel for one night The room was clean quiet friendly staff Perfect for short break and good value for money 
241892,Grange Wellington Hotel, Pillow is a bit hard Entrance is off the street may be hard to strangers to find, Was given a room 226 in the back corner off the street very quiet Nice size bed
241893,Grange Wellington Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is situated on a quiet square close to Victoria and a10 minute walk to Westminster Recently refurbished the bedrooms are compact but modern clean and very comfortable 
241894,Grange Wellington Hotel, Pillows and blankets are really uncomfortable Otherwise everything was just perfect , Perfect location clean and modern room friendly and nice personnel though not always so able to help Quiet area close to good conenctions
241895,Grange Wellington Hotel, We were traveling back home from Scotland and booked this hotel because have to be around the Victoria When we arrived at 20 00 the hotel staff proposed to move to another hotel without any adequate explication The new one was ok but our last night in London was failed ,No Positive
241896,Grange Wellington Hotel, On checking receptionist started having a conversation with someone else Took money on pre approval for bar tab without asking Didn t have breakfast card for room service Toast came like bread not plate etc etc When I mentioned on checkout I was told to try the full English next time , Location and style great furnishings
241897,Grange Wellington Hotel,No Negative, The staff were excellent The room was a little small but everything was there that we needed the bathroom was lovely and everything was extremely clean 
241898,Grange Wellington Hotel, Not much enjoyed my stay and clearly this hotel has recently been refurbished so the facilities are in great condition , Very nice helpful young and dynamic staff and located close to the Houses of Parliament where I had work appointments 
241899,Grange Wellington Hotel, Breakfast is not included and at 18 per head I think that s a bit expensive even for London Fortunately there are lots of places to eat out in the area , Smart modern hotel with very comfortable rooms and friendly staff Even more importantly the hotel is very quiet which is great for central London 
241900,Grange Wellington Hotel, Horrible just horrible beds Beware unless you like ultra firm box spring like mattresses Was told sorry they are all like this some people love them and others don t Well we were the later I had to make a bed of extra pillows they gladly brought me so my wife could sleep I endured it with a stiff back the remainder of trip They should have an option for those that like comfortable beds , Great location for us Staff was helpful and hotel was well kept 
241901,Grange Wellington Hotel, People smoking outside the front it rises up to the bedroom window, Very friendly and extremely polite and helpful staff A credit to the Hotel Lovely and clean everywhere even in the nooks and crannies 
241902,Grange Wellington Hotel, The only criticism I have was that the bed was a little too firm for my liking but that s just a personal thing , Lovely hotel great location friendly staff great room I ll stay here again 
241903,Grange Wellington Hotel, Still a work in progress Staff willing and friendly but wrestling with incomplete establishment Guest services severely impaired by RWC team guests Beds incredibly hard , Location
241904,Grange Wellington Hotel, It said they had a TV with sky sports in the room That s why I booked this hotel could not get any sky channels no shared tv downstairs either So I missed all the boxing on that night Not good , The size of the room
241905,Grange Wellington Hotel, Room designed for 1 double bed had been reconfigured with 2 large double beds that made the desk unusable and no place to sit except on a bed Elevator was being repaired , The front desk staff was superb Last minute online rate for a Saturday double was discounted to gpb 108 Very very clean and quiet 
241906,Grange Wellington Hotel, The hotel is unfinished and has a nerve charging 200 a night One lift out of two works sporadically the second one is not yet functioning The breakfast service is an absolute disgrace for the cost remote in a different adjoining hotel in fact tables never bussed very poor buffet when it functions takes forever to serve a coffee or to replace empty hot food containers Brasserie staff barely understand English , The location is good for us the staff very kind and helpful Especially mention Samir 
241907,Grange Wellington Hotel, My only criticism was the cost of the room It was probably inflated due to the rugby world cup going on at the time , We liked everything about this hotel Location was great close to Victoria Station theatres and 15 minutes easy walk to many attractions Our room may have been refurbished recently It was modern fresh and clean The staff were welcoming friendly and helpful 
241908,Grange Wellington Hotel, There is no elevator and only a few rooms on a ground floor Family suite is located in a basement so if you are traveling with a baby and a buggy it could be problem to overcome all these stairs , Excellent location quiet area all sightseeings are in neighborhood Big clean room with a good bathroom 
241909,Grange Wellington Hotel, The staff is polite But not very welcoming the lighting System is impossible to understand and we did not realise that the do not Disturb elecronic sign was on so we did not get our Room cleaned the elevator is under conatruction not a problem for us ad we were on the 1st floor, Great location nice room very recently renovated In front of a lovely park and of great charme Because of the historical tipically British architecture The proximity to Victoria Makes the hotel extremely appealing Overall a very good choice 
241910,Grange Wellington Hotel, Having full cost and 20 taken on my credit card on arrival as guests are not even being trusted with the contents of the mini bar Only badly trained staff who had little clue and poor english language skills , the location
241911,Grange Wellington Hotel, Noise of the lift being installed hopefully finished by now , Ideal location we stayed four times in a few weeks between other travels Staff attitude excellent all very helpful 
241912,Grange Wellington Hotel, Breakfast period was a bit short , The staff at the Grange are wonderful and helpful and happy We were in and out all the time but no matter how early or how late they were there to help Lovely room and wonderful bath perfect 
241913,Grange Wellington Hotel,No Negative, Very glad to have chosen the Grange Wellington It s a little walk away from Victoria station but it means it enjoys a quieter area and looks out onto a lovely little park The building itself is elegant and stately and the interiors were subdued yet stylish We were given a twin room rather than the double which we were expecting but it wasn t really a problem so we didn t bother asking for a change The staff were polite friendly and welcoming and our room had everything we were looking for We will definitely be staying with Grange hotels again 
241914,Grange Wellington Hotel, The lifts were not working which made it a very unsuitable venue for us Apparently this is a long term problem and we had not been advised when we booked The reception staff were quite offhand , The restaurant staff were very friendly and efficient Room and bathroom were very good 
241915,Grange Wellington Hotel, Only one small problem I needed to telephone my bank in the U S making a collect or reverse charges call but the hotel told me that their charges for the call would be 2 pounds per minute for a call which from previous experience could easily last 10 minutes That was really unhelpful , Very nice comfortable hotel with good sized rooms and excellent modern bathroom 
241916,Grange Wellington Hotel, Why breakfast wasnt included Room small and couldnt leave windows open at night so no fresh air High up above bath was rack for towels Not being a giraffe the receptionist had to get them down Handbasin plug didnt work but fixed ASAP , Room was small but on ground floor as requested Lift being installed working shortly otherwise gone upstairs Hotel used by BackRoads Touring as base and walk to Victoria Stn and Thames Staff very friendly and helpful 
241917,Grange Wellington Hotel, There was nothing I didn t like , Rooms were spotlessly clean and lovely Staff were all really friendly helpful Location excellent public areas of hotel beautiful We were all upgraded on arrival my sister was delivered a birthday cake as we were celebrating her 30th birthday All round lovely place and a great stay we d come back again 
241918,Grange Wellington Hotel, Only downside for me personally was the very firm mattress I personally like a softer mattress or memory foam My husband slept very well though , Customer service from all the staff was excellent The full english breakfast was absolutely superb Would definitely stay here again 
241919,Grange Wellington Hotel, One of the receptionist seems a little bit cold but since that was a big rainy day and we carried large luggages with us can t blame her too much The Victorian train station can be confusing and it s the time of reconstruction so the train and tube station can be even more complicated We finally decided to go to St James station instead of Victoria it s far simpler and takes exactly the same time The fire alarm made some beep noise about every hour we were allocated to the first room faced the stairs so it can be not quiet in the room but still didn t bother me too much , It s a very quiet area every time we turned from the noisy street full of malls into small alleys we feel peace and comfort The little garden in front of the hotel is the playground of the Westminster School though we didn t see any students there but I guess it explains everything about the quietness cleanness and safety of course They don t have elevators but there re professional people there to help us move our luggages 
241920,Grange Wellington Hotel, The bathroom shower sprays water over the bathroom floor and due to no floor drain the floor becomes flooded every time we had a shower The wash basin is tiny and totally inadequate, The staff were outstanding
241921,Grange Wellington Hotel, Elevator not operational due to construction but staff willing to carry bags up for us, Staff helpful and provided excellent service suggestions and information 
241922,Grange Wellington Hotel, The bed was too hard firm No lift facility would prove an issue for some travellers , The bathroom was very nice and the range of foreign TV channels were a plus point especially TVE international 
241923,Grange Wellington Hotel, No bad experiences This hotel has no elevator although we were told one is being built Staff were helpful carrying baggage down flights of stairs , The room was beautifully appointed Lovely modern 
241924,Grange Wellington Hotel, My room was on the second floor on my first stay and on the third floor on my second stay so there was a bit of stair climbing involved especially since the dining breakfast room is in the basement However they are currently in the process of installing a lift so that problem will be rectified shortly and there are staff available to carry luggage to and from rooms The only other issue I found was that the beds were a little firmer than I prefer but after one or two nights I adjusted to them and it did not affect my sleep , The hotel has been refurbished in the last couple of years and everything is very nice The rooms are air conditioned spacious and well equipped Rooms at the back overlooking the street can get some traffic noise but it is not excessive Rooms at the front overlook the park and are very quiet The staff are are all very professional but also very helpful and friendly After visiting the dining breakfast room once the next time you come for a meal they remember your name and room number On leaving they checked that I had remembered to collect my medication from their fridge Small personal touches like that are appreciated as it is not easy to remember individual things about each guest I had a meal in the dining room one evening and all three courses were delicious Breakfasts also had good variety The hotel is well located being in a quiet area but a comfortable walk from Victoria in one direction and the Houses of Parliament Westminster Abbey area in the other direction and with easy access to bus routes along several main roads I enjoyed my stay at the Grange Wellington and would definitely stay there again if in London 
241925,Grange Wellington Hotel, the wi fi was a little slow but you cant expect any better from free things, everything was excellent the money was good compared to other hotels in London Really loved the rooms n the bed was big enough
