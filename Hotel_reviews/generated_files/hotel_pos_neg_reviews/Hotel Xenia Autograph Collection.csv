63316,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, I booked two rooms as there were four of us One was small but perfect with a little balcony The other was too small for two people in my opinion and overlooked some pipes The safe stopped working and as soon as we told them they came to open it At the same time I asked if there was another room with a balcony We were immediately upgraded to a lovely room with a very comfortable bed and more reasonable bathroom , Staff were exceptional and helped to sort out any problems Bathroom products were good and the room had everything you would need It not the staff were quick to resolve any difficulties 
63317,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, Room was a bit on the small size for the size of bed No bar fridge , Breakfast was excellent and dining room was bright and spacious Bathroom modern and very clean Bed very comfortable Coffee tea facilities in room Room overlooked main street but was quiet Tiny veranda but nice to be able to go outside from the room Close to underground station and Natural hiatory and Victoria and Albert museums 
63318,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection,No Negative, The room we received was a small We talked to the staff the next day about the inconvenience and asked to get a bigger room The front desk staff explained us that there are no rooms available right now and registered our request After two nights we received a large and convenient room for the rest of our stay 3 more nights We booked the hotel with a full breakfast There was a tasty and large food selection The restaurant staff was very responsive 
63319,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection,No Negative, This is a very conveniently located hotel which is well presented where the staff are extremely helpful and where you can be guaranteed a wonderful stay This is the second time I have stayed there and will definitely return if visiting London 
63320,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, The rooms could be small , The hotel and its services are excellent We recommend the breakfast and the restaurant The staff is great All people are very professional and client oriented We had a very nice time during our stay We warmly suggest Xenia Hotel 
63321,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, Room was a bit small and also didn t like the very heavy throw at the end of the bed It wasn t needed at this time of year but also too heavy to remove off the end of the bed, Design of bathroom the room although small had been thought through so we had all we needed also comfortable bed with clean crisp bedding
63322,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection,No Negative, Boutique style hotel with all the modern comforts Extremely friendly and attentive staff only stayed one night but was so pleasantly surprised with this hotel that I will book again for my 10 day stay in August 
63323,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, Do not expect a spacious room when people say they are on the small side they really are We stayed for two nights would not consider staying for a longer period due to the size I know I could probably have paid more for a larger room but felt I had paid enough Could not fault it otherwise , Service cleanliness quality of beds bedding and furnishings Lovely shower and toiletries 
63324,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, Limited opening of bar Breakfast should be included to the price I paid Staff are not completely fluent in English Restaurant does not have a welcoming feel, Clean quiet modern and comfortable
63325,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, Booked a double room Surprised and disappointed that this was infact two single beds joined together , Great hotel Friendly and very helpful staff Spotless 
63326,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, Not a negative as such but the double rooms were indeed small and cosy however exactly as advertised so this was as expected , Staff were exceptional they organised an upgrade to a lovely room for my parents to celebrate their special occasions and were incredibly helpful and friendly throughout Fantastic location in a lovely part of London and very good value We will definitely stay here again 
63327,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, Honestly not much there weren t any real negatives to our stay here at all Loved it , The rooms were just amazing slightly small but it s London so you re hardly expecting a huge room for the great price we got ours for The little additions of letters addressed to myself and a phone call 30 minutes after we d got into our rooms to ask if we d settled made it all lovely Cocktail bar and restaurant are amazing but there are so many cheap and delicious restaurants nearby we couldn t bring ourselves to not have a wander outside the hotel 
63328,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, Room could be more spacious but it s London Checkout at 11am, Staff were great the hotel was spotless A letter was left in the room which I didn t open till we were ready to leave thinking it was the bill it was telling us that checkout was at 11am We were late expecting a normal checkout at 12 but thankfully the staff were brilliant and it wasn t a problem 
63329,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, The Breakfast Buffet offering should already include eggs as part of the package , Very courteous and helpful staff I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and would highly recommend the Xenia Hotel to anyone visiting London 
63330,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection,No Negative, The staff is truly amazing and the service offered is excellent The concierge service is very attentive and useful The breakfast is super tasty and includes countless options Some of the rooms are a bit small but it s expected given the particular type of building The area is probably the best in London quite classy and with loads of transportation options 
63331,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, The only thing I would say for next time would be the size of room It was on the small size but fine for one night , We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with you The breakfast was lovely and my husband is fussy about his coffee but had three cups All the staff were very attentive and nothing was too much They made us feel special 
63332,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, The room was comfortable but it was also a little on the small side There was no blind at the shower window, The front of house staff were absolutely excellent We run a small hotel and appreciate how good or bad staff are The front of house staff at The Xenia should run classes 
63333,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, Very small bedrooms which were quite cold and one of our bathrooms had a very strong drain smell , Beautiful hotel great location and wonderful staff The reception bars and restaurant were lovely 
63334,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, There was no mini fridge in the room which we would have liked , We loved our stay at Hotel Xenia We had read quite a few reviews commenting on the bedrooms being very small but ours was just fine The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and I would definitely stay here again 
63335,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, I would be even happier if there was a magnifying mirror in the bathroom , Xenia is a lovely hotel close to Earls Court and Gloucester rd stations so you are within easy reach of wherever you want to go also Heathrow airport The staff is really nice and the beds comfortable good slippers too 
63336,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, The bedroom was too small for our enjoyment meaning we did not wish to spend anytime in the hotel Due to the bedroom size we did not feel it was value for the price we paid , Lovely communal areas friendly staff and clean 
63337,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, None to report, Great location and very friendly staff Easy access to Gloucester road tube station and pick up point FOR BIG BUS hop on hop off Breakfast was good but limited options for a diabetic or anyone on a low carb diet 
63338,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, The rooms are on the smaller side although I knew that going in , The excellent staff made our visit very pleasant The room was very comfortable and the location perfect as well

63342,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, The room and bathroom were comically small The towels were past their prime and the shower had a smell after use , The staff was pleasant and helpful 
63343,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, The only thing we didn t love was how small our room was we couldn t really have suitcases in there with us but we did know that going in The location staff and comfort more than made up for this , The location was amazing and the staff could not have been friendlier Great value for your money 
63344,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection,No Negative, Clean comfortable very friendly and helpful staff Good location for Natural History Museum and V A Good sized room and good quality restaurant on site 
63345,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, The only thing we would say is that drinking in the hotel was expensive so we only had a few drinks in there , We was upgraded on arrival and the staff were all very helpful The concierge Neil recommended a lovely local pub for our dinner and very helpful with parking taxis and lots more information Close to tube station for getting around London 
63346,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, The room was so clean with all facilities bu t would have liked just a bit bigger bathroom However not really too much of a problem , All the staff were very helpful and friendly The breakfast was delicious

63348,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, The lighting in the rooms could be brighter It would not be easy to read for a prolonged period especially if you were traveling on business There also isn t a shaving makeup mirror which is helpful for older eyes There really isn t a place to store your clothes when you unpack I used the desk but if I hadn t been traveling alone it would have been difficult Last you can finder more reasonably priced options for breakfast outside the hotel , The room was charming and the location is great The hotel is close to the Underground and within walking distance of several museums 
63349,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, There is no fridge offering in the room and house keeping were not fulfil the shower set everyday the air conditioner is not smart only over 26 degree is warm mode and it s hot My friend and I felt windy when we lie down the bed although we closed the window , The staff there are warm polite and friendly They offer different cute sweets every day Location of Xenia is great very convenient to walk to Earl s Court Station for 5 10 mins 15 20 mins walk to Kensington Hyde park

63352,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, Room a little compact hotel bar very expensive 17 for a G T and a beer , Lovely staff lovely hotel with nice decor very clean and great location in really easy walking distance to two tube stations It was a birthday so they left a complimentary bottle of wine which I thought was a nice touch 
63353,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, XENIA WAS JUST PERFECT, The rooms were of extremely high quality beautifully maintained The hotel staff made me feel SOOOO special a glass of chilled water from the porter upon my arrival he has such a passion with service The CONCIERGE ensure I had ALL information to sightsee etc As I would be officially checking in later that evening My stay at the XENIA From the time of my arrival to check out WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT MAKING ME WISH I COULD STAY LONGER Not only is it the perfect hotel to stay its location is central easy to access by UNDERGROUND after embarking from the EUROSTAR from Paris CONGRATULATIONS XENIA 
63354,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, There was nothing i didn t like , The staff were all very welcoming and could not have been any more attentative I would definately go back and stay if we visit london again 
63355,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, The price for continental breakfast should be reviewed in order to compete with nearby outlets Why offer continental breakfast at a discount to guests when most people would legitimately expect being served a full English breakfast while visiting London Noise from other rooms could be easily reduced by noise proofing bedroom doors , The porters at the door provided excellent assistance they are in fact more warm and welcoming that front desk staff 
63356,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, Slow running shower saving water however staying in shower twice as long to wash no water saved , Great staff very freindly good location good choice on both continental and cooked breakfast
63357,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, Nothing, Outstanding for the price Staff are great Super clean and comfortable High quality fittings Great bar Convenient for Earls Court Gloucester Rd easy journey into Central London and close to museums

63365,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, Rooms could have done with a mini fridge especially in a double executive , Excellent customer service and attentive staff Close to underground services and public transport links 
63366,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, 1 the executive double room is too small no luggage rack in the room we have to put our luggages on the floor then there is no room to walk sometimes I tripped by the luggages especially in the night the washroom is too small narrow you have to close the bathtub door first and then you can open the door of the washroom 2 no refrigerator3 the water preesure is so weak, the location is great near to earl t court gloucester road underground stations and also easy access to main shopping area attractions sainsbury s is next to the hotel you can have your breakfast there anther supermarket waitrose is not far away just located at the gloucester road underground entrance 
63367,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, Rooms were too small I don t need enormous accommodations but a room for two people should have two chairs and enough room for luggage , Staff was extremely professional Location was ideal

63377,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, Rooms are very small also the pressure in the shower is not good Eat in the restaurant this time last year when I travelled with my wife and it was excellent and was hoping that it would have kicked on but this time I felt the food while good had stepped backwards, Staff 
63378,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, It would be nice if a bottle of water was supplied every day , A very happy stay overall Tastefully designed room with spacious enough bathroom Considering the room was rather small as was expected it didn t feel dark or cramped

63387,Hotel Xenia Autograph Collection, The breakfast might be a bit expensive and the size of the room is quite crowed for a couple and a toddler , The location is very convenient and has a waking distance to Hyde park Besides a big grocery store nearby would earn it a bonus star
