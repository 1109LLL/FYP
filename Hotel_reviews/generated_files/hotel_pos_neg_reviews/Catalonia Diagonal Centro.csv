283272,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, Not a great selection for breakfast and 17 euros per person was abit expensive Quite a few breakfast shops within walking distance so not bad Only one mirror in the room which was in the bathroom but this is a minor issue , Great location Many places are easily accessible either by taxi or metro Lots of different places to eat around the area Room was spacious and bed was comfortable Hotel is just outside city centre so no outside noise at night great for a good nights sleep Hotel staff very polite and helpful Overall great hotel if you don t want to be in the centre but not too far from everything 
283273,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, In terms of cleaness it could have been better for the price one paid , The room size was very big And the bed was very comfortable The breakfast had plenty of food and staff was nice

283275,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, room was clean but there was not mirror in the room except bathroom , The location was perfect room was clean The hotel was close to metro staion and walking distance to attraction streets
283276,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, Just 1 minor thing Check in said 2 pm but room wasn t ready and had to wait an hour in the lobby until 3pm Not a big deal but receptionist could have at least apologized for the inconvenience or offered a drink or something while they made me wait Apart from this staff were really friendly though , Private terrace location
283277,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, If you can choose a room to the backyard its disturbing with the metro vibrations under the hotel on the front side , The location is good central The staff is very helpful and friendly nice and clean rooms A good spot for shopping with cosy restaurants A metro station is just a few meters away Not long walking distance to Casa Batllo og La Pedrera
283278,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, Staff was so so Room temp very warm had to turn thermostat down to approx 18C set to highest fan speed but still fairly warm Might be too hot during summer , Location Great breakfast buffet 
283279,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, There was only a mirror in the bathroom and none in the bedroom meaning that it held up everyone getting showered and ready each day , Staff were fabulous cleaners came in every day and the rooms were spotless Great location for all site seeing bus tours shops and restaurants Would definitely go back 
283280,Catalonia Diagonal Centro,No Negative, This location was in the center of Barcelona We walked everywhere from here but the metro and buses were options We would most definately return again 
283281,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, Some staff in breakfast area spoke little english so when you talk to them they seemed a little bit cold , I like the spaciousness of the room and the shower and toilet I like the pastries in the breakfast restaurant they are the best I was tempted to ask the staff if they were being baked by their pastry chef since i wanted to praise him her for the very delicious pastries but then while walking going back to the hotel we came across this pastry shop where we saw all the pastries that we have been eating during breakfast in the hotel though the hotel are just ordering those pastries it was still a very memorable experience to be able to eat for a few mornings such yummy pastries which never happened in 5 star hotels around the world based on my experience 
283282,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, Parking is small and difficult however the price is half compared to nearby public parking lots If you have a medium or large car or if you plan to use the car every day I would suggest that you pay the extra money for the public parking lot Sometimes you can feel the vibration of metro train This is very common in Barcelona We didn t use the pool but it s very small for swimming , We liked the location and the buffet breakfast Room is large enough for three people The third person gets a real bed not a portable one 
283283,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, we came for 4 nights the first night we spent in room 109 which had noise every time the rooms above us used the toilet or the sink after one night we changed to room 514 which was quite , very nice stuff reception clean room large shower room 
283284,Catalonia Diagonal Centro,No Negative, Staff were friendly welcoming and helpfull The breakfast as stated was a good breakfast with plenty of choice We could hear the metro but not enough to cause discomfort or to interfere with sleep the window looked out onto a well shaft so no view apart from that very comfortable good shower bathroom within a short walk of Barcalona central a metro stop very close all in all very pleased
283285,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, Gym and pool modest reasonable rather than wow Would expect two bottles of complementary water in a 4 hotel rather than none , Slick modern executive room Very quiet excellent sleep Super WiFi Read a few complaints about breakfast before booking but actually it was excellent They even had a gluten free section Great

283287,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, The room was extremely hot We spoke to the management and they said it was non controllable because it is mid season We had to leave the windows open during the night , Location was excellent
283288,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, Room a little noisy as it was at the front of the hotel No other negatives come to mind, Great location in the city A good walk from the Ramblas which I think is a bonus Short walk to Pl de Catalunya for City tours airport bus etc plenty of nice bars restaurants and shops around Room good standard 
283289,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, Breakfast was a little over priced in the hotel would recommend trying local cafes El Fornet being one , Overall hotel was excellent clean tidy and friendly staff perfect for a weekend break with the family our son was brave enough to try the ice cold pool not quite pool weather sure in the summer water would be warmer Hotel is walking distance to cafes bars and into the main shopping district Also good location for Sagarda Famillia Loved Barcelona will definitely be visiting again
283290,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, Cost of breakfast 17euro per person even for my 5 and 7 year old who eat minimal No coffee or tea in room and overpriced mini bar There was a drinks machine by the pool but purposefully empty and much cheaper than Mini bar , Staff friendly and room was clean and well maintained throughout our stay 
283291,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, Nothing , The room was very big with couch and sofa The bathroom spacious but a little bit cold inside Even though we faced the street there was no noise the room was so silent We slept very nicely Staff was good but the best man that treated us at best was Will Hi will 
283292,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, Although I specifically requested a street view room my room was overlooking a backyard which was a bit annoying The room was on the third floor and I still was able to hear some of the noise outside , Perfect location 5 minutes walk from the top shopping districts and very close metro station too Clean spacious room and very nice bathroom too Perfect value for money 
283293,Catalonia Diagonal Centro,No Negative, Very friendly staff and excellent breakfast places and restaurants around We didn t have breakfast in the hotel so can t say anything about that walking distance from sagrada Familia
283294,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, You have to pay for breakfast for the length of your stay we chose not to have breakfast as we would only need for the one out of the two days we was there , We arrived early morning check in not until 2 the staff kindly let us store our bags at the hotel Hotel was lovely and clean and staff was friendly and pleasant always smiling and willing to help 
283295,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, We did not get a double room as booked on the website but a single room we got only one key and asking for one more that was the first time when the receptionist realized it is not a double room pretty ridiculous it was 1 a m and two people standing in front of his desk We had to move to a different room but still pay more Very bad service The next day they apologized and gave us a nicer room on the 6th floor ,No Positive
283296,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, No external window Our family room looked over an internal lightwell made it very depressing ambience with no natural light For this reason wouldn t return , Good location 
283297,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, the room was unbelievably noisy the noise was coming from the elevators all night long the noise was terrible in instances even the room was shaking they should not rent these kind of rooms it is unacceptable Also in order to get to the room one had to take the elevator and then stairs 20 steps Also unacceptable for a business traveler, location was OK 
283298,Catalonia Diagonal Centro,No Negative, comfortable beds clean rooms helpful staff and easy to reach by underground Diagonal from the airport and close to the Ramblas Catalunya many restaurants and bars nearby It is a touch pricey the swimming pool is only 20ft in length but can recommend for a city trip
283299,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, Nothing, Was a bit apprehensive about staying as although it was marked as 4 star it was quite a bit cheaper than other hotels Needn t have worried Room was spotless and a decent size for a family of 4 Pool was tiny but to be honest we weren t in training for the olympics so it did its job in being somewhere to cool down after a day sight seeing in late August Would definitely recommend for a family group 
283300,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, Breakfast was a little overpriced for us so we opted out and ate out each morning The evening staff were a little unwelcoming but we were greeted by a lovely lady when we checked in , Excellent location quiet street but near enough to metro and plenty of places to eat and explore 10 minute walk to La Padrera Our room was great clean enough with a small terrace and very comfortable beds 
283301,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, A piece of my jewellery went missing it was an expensive and sentimental bracelet that I left on my bedside table before going to the beach for the day When I returned it has been taken and I didn t assume it was taken until I searched the whole room top to bottom I informed the hotel staff who told me that they would get the housekeeper to look I went back a few hours later to see if there was any good news but unfortunately the hotel staff hadn t noted my problem so no search was made and I was greeted by the rudest man I have ever encountered He may as well have said he didn t give a damn about what I was saying and even abruptly told me to slow down as he couldn t understand my accent I have never recieved such bad customer service in my life Not one ounce of concern was given by this hotel member who I believe was the manager and there was no consolation or even an option to be sent my jewellery if it was found Overall a horrible experience and put a downer on my whole holiday , The terrace in our room was nice

283318,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, Only down side was the pool It looked lovely in the pics but was infact very small More than 4 people in it would be too many more the size of a large hot tub Great for a dip to cool down but you couldn t swim in it ok for kids to splash about in though , Very convenient for the Metro and a nice quiet area so not kept awake at night Staff very friendly and helpful and room very comfortable Breakfast was expensive at 16 EU but a comprehensive selection and you an eat as much as you like

283331,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, Metro links to Barceloneta Olympic Village direction are not good The hotel is also not really convenient for anywhere south of Placa de Catalunya 15 minutes on foot but this is the inevitable result of being so convenient for Gracia etc Like most hotels in Barcelona now it is too expensive However it is probably one of the least overpriced , The location is convenient for key metro lines particularly the L5 L9 airport link and has good proximity to Gracia and anywhere along the Diagonal The staff are pleasant and helpful and the rooms are spacious and clean 
283332,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, haven t tried hotel s kitchen again since there s so many restaurants and little cafes around , Fantastic location with a really wide variety of good cafes and restaurants around Supermarket across the street that s open 24 hours 2 blocks away from main shopping street Passeig de Gracia Friendly stuff We lived on 5th floor and it was very quite despite being on one of the busiest street Balmes

283335,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, The room was too hot We had a family room and the air con wasn t switched on in the building as it wasn t summer which meant the room was roasting at night , The location was accessible to most places 
283336,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, We arrived at 9 pm and advised we had to pay for the first night on card I had registered This was not allocated to my budget which was in euros When we checked out full amount was due after some time it was found the payment was refunded back at same time as taken It gave worry and stress not required , Staff were helpful
283337,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, there are some sounds and shakes on the room which might be due to metro passage, Staff were extremly friendly especially Nuria She was truly professional amicable and supportive She provided a couple of good hints for the connection to the airport as well as she helped me out for the early check in late check out and the time time I needed to have iron at my room 
283338,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, No where does it mention in the hotel literature that our group read that the hotel is located either directly in top of or immediately next two several metro lines and a railroad line The trains and metros ran until 2 a m and started up again at 5 a m Then on Saturday night and maybe even Sunday I am still so tired from staying there I can t remember if it was Sunday night too the metros trains ran all night long Metros are wonderful for traveling because they come along every 3 minutes or so but for sleeping or even just relaxing they come with noise and a rocking motion And we had specifically requested in our booking a quiet room We thought airplanes were landing the first night before they told us about the metro The hotel did change us after the first night from the 1st floor to the 6th floor and it was a fraction better but everyone in my group of 4 2 rooms slept very little the entire 4 days we were in Barcelona I personally was only able to sleep at all by pretending that I was in Hawaii at the Kauai Surf Hotel and that the noise was huge waves pounding on the cliffs every minute or so Honestly that s the only way I could relax enough to sleep The bottom line is the perpetual noise and motion at this hotel should have been made known to us in advance as we would have never booked this particular hotel , However in terms of location to major sights and to the metro the hotel was nicely situated Also there were two young men one on the day shift and one later on in the day night shift who were extremely helpful and polite The rest of the staff was average to terse 
283339,Catalonia Diagonal Centro, Arrived and found a shard of broken sharp porcelain on the bathroom floor as well as an old toothpaste cap Let the front desk know and it never happened again Stayed in room 701 the glass bathroom door makes a loud cracking boom sound when you close it Advised front desk they said they would have maintenance fix it as we were sure it would break Stayed 5 days it wasn t fixed I think it s an installation problem We could hear the trains on the top floor but it was a low rumble so no problem for us The bed was so comfortable the first night which led to SEVERE back pain for myself after 4 nights sleeping on it The hubby s back was also sore after night 2 It s 6 days later since arriving home and I m still bent over in pain I m a healthy 30 something and walk everywhere this bed is too soft If you have any pre existing lower back problems do not stay here until they buy new firm beds , Location is a 10 15 minute walk from Passieg de Gracia Closest metro stop Provenca Staff friendly and helpful Felt secure in the room Terrace a nice touch for smokers Bought the hop on hop off tour package through front desk which was a great way to get introduced to this city Eix Central cafe is close by and they make a mean cappucino for non tourist prices Staff let us check out at 1pm with no extra cost and we also utilized the luggage storage which was very convenient A few English channels on the tv and you can hook up your laptop to the tv if you want to watch movies from your laptop on the big screen I would stay here again if they got beds that provided more back support
