207950,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Myself and my girlfriend had a wonderful overnight stay It was a special occasion and the staff went the extra mile to ensure we were extremely well looked after The bedroom suite was luxurious and the hotel itself was perfect from the decor to the amenities we could not fault it The adjoining pub serves great beer and food We enjoyed lunch there the following day before departing I have stayed in other 5 London hotels which are pricier but did not match the level of service we received here Excellent value for money Highly recommended 
207951,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Such a comfortable place our room was exceptional and the staff so very attentive I would definitely stay again and highly recommend the hotel and their facilities 
207952,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, I was traveling there for wireless festival which started at 2pm the same time as check in I called ahead days previous and asked for an earlier check in so we could get changed after travelling I was told this would be arranged When I arrived i had no room ready and the staff on the front desk weren t very accommodating with regards to the reason it was needed , The room was stunning bed was really comfy and the size of the room was brilliant The decoration of the hotel was nice too quite grande The late check out is also a plus 
207953,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The bed was too narrow remote control for TV was not working properly mini bar food was out as if they were free of charge until I checked the price list, check in speed of lifts sitting area in house umbrellas
207954,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The bed is unreasonably high, The hotel is located next to Barbican Centre with a lot of nice bars and restaurants though of course they come a bit pricy
207955,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, I honestly can not remember something that caught my attention , The staff here are simply excellent and always willing to go the extra mile to make ones stay as comfortable as possible This is my third stay here and I will certainly go back 
207956,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Well there is rather a lot I didn t like Firstly my room was flipping miles away It was in a separate wing I had to be escorted there up the lift to the first floor walk for miles across a footbridge find another lift up to the fourth floor walk for miles again Getting back to reception was a nightmare I went a different way every time and often in circles I know women have no sense of direction allegedly but this was ridiculous Then I was in a very small room with a chipped bath tiny dirty windows loose electrical parts hanging down in the wardrobe and dusty Instead of hanging a do not disturb on the door there is a small touch panel you are supposed to press near the bathroom that says if you want to be cleaned or not I didn t even know it was there no instructions anywhere and must have pressed it in the night unseen so they didn t even clean my room on day 2 The bathroom has the most complicated set up with no taps and an automatic bathplug that has to be prised out with your fingers as it doesn t work So you gingerly twist a chrome blob and the hand shower whacks you in the face full pelt No instructions anywhere and you shouldn t need a manual to run a bath All the surfaces in this tiny room were covered with things to make you spend more money I don t need four wine glasses menus corkscrews bottles of wine tubs of nuts etc etc The fridge is full of overpriced alcohol that I don t want How about putting a small carton of fresh milk in there Montcalm And reception is full of snooty staff who can t break a smile and don t even ask you how your stay went All this joy for 240 a night without breakfast Unfortunately I have to stay there again as my company is hosting an event and we will be taking 30 rooms It had better improve or there will be fireworks , A comfortable bed Black pudding croquettes in the Jugged Hare 
207957,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Unfortunately there isn t a 24 hour bar and the Juggged Hare next door closes too early, Very clean comfortable and great value Staff are always friendly and the location is perfect
207958,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Original double bed very small with mattress overhanging Base Booking com said it would be kingsize but hotel said double They did change us to kingsize though Lay out of bathroom odd few shelves and had to put everything on floor Air conditioning came on in middle of night both nights even though we had turned it off Few drawers except v shallow ones which we of little use, Closeness to Barbican for theatre in Evening
207959,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, over priced breakfast was terrible gutted we paid 45 for 2 breakfasts and a coffee , the room was gorgeous great location friendly woman on the counter
207960,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, The staff were helpful and accommodating It was one of the comfiest cleanest rooms I ve ever stayed in I had a parcel delivered and set up in my room no problems we were also upgraded because of my partners birthday 
207961,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The bathroom is really small , I requested connecting rooms but the hotel said they didn t have any The rooms we stayed in were actually connecting rooms but with the door locked One of the rooms had no bedboard 
207962,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Breakfast was too expensive but you have a lot of options in 2 5 minutes of walk 5 10 GBP full English breakfast , It was my wife anniversary so we got free upgrade to Montcalm Club room bottle of champagne and tasty chocolates Big room with 4 windows huge comfortable bad Nespresso and tea facility complimentary fresh fruits every day room and lobby friendly staff speaks Russian good and safety location 5 min to tube or 15 min to St Paul Cathedral by walk modern and pleasant design 
207963,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Check in took forever the queue was out the door Many staff were just floating about asking questions like are you checking in rather than actually checking us in The large double bed was not large in width but was very high off the ground and had a slope from middle to edges making it really uncomfortable , Location next to the Barbican Theatre
207964,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The room was very tired in places lack of storage space places to plug things in and lack of surface space My partner also very nearly sliced the top of his little toe off from one of the wheels at the bottom of the bed lots of blood Just needs a new look over and a general refresh The toiletries were a little disappointing , Breakfast comfortable bed and sheets Friendly staff 
207965,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, For a five star hotel Parking was 10 minutes away in a complicated underground car park No one to park car for you There s no bar on premises it is a pub at the end of building Room was dark Bathroom heated towel rail didn t work Heated bathroom floor didn t work Plug in bath dint work Light on small mirror didn t work No sky channels i e Sports etc,No Positive
207966,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, I Felt that some of the Staff could have been a little more helpful than just working off a script The girls on check in seemed fine earlier in the morning but when I came back later to get my keys the Gentleman on there was so cant be bothered to be here attitude Some of the staff didn t seem genuine at all actually felt a little embarrassed around them Not the best value for the Money ,No Positive
207967,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Shower was very weak Had better electric showers at uni When I go to a hotel I want a proper power shower not warm rain It also didn t get very hot Other than that it was perfect ,No Positive
207968,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing, Beautifully restored old building across the road from the Barbican great location for the city maybe not so much for tourists We were upgraded on arrival to a large and luxurious room with a glass panel view into the bathroom see to believe it there is a blind for the more squeamish Staff were very friendly and the in house Jugged Hare gastro Pub wonderful its is pricy but the quality of the food is top class Nearby is a sister hotel with a wonderful roof top bar and restaurant that is well worth a visit
207969,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Stayed previously but in London City Suites part room then was much bigger than this time Because of its location some shops and cafes close at weekend as mainly for business people during the week, The staff are really welcoming and helpful The Jugged Hare does great food and only just a few steps away Really like the location if you want a quiet place in London at the weekend to stay as close to the city mile Not too far to walk to the Thames
207970,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Overall nothing to not like , A nicely apportioned room with a comfy bed I also dined at The Jugged Hare which is associated with the hotel and found the food to be very good The menu is different to your usual fare and has a good selection of game The location of the hotel is great with everything close by and good access to public transport 
207971,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The hotel is in the financial district and is thus a little out of the way Nearby tube station though so it isn t too much of a problem Hotel bar and restaurant are really good too , My stay was excellent The staff were wonderful and the hotel itself is very well kept The decor and amenities give off a really high end vibe We were pleasantly surprised to receive a room upgrade on check in We also received a bottle of champagne after mentioning that it was the end of our honeymoon in the U K We ate at the restaurant associated with the hotel and the food was excellent I can t thank the staff enough for what a good experience we had It really made the end of our trip special 
207972,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The room was very compact and a little too small , Staff were friendly and helpful The hotel is located centrally and is a short walk from several tube stations 
207973,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The kettle in the room leaked boiling water Quite dangerous really I left a note in the room and reported the issue to reception As a gesture of goodwill the receptionist offered to waiver the cost of any minibar purchases when we departed Nice thought but I was charged anyway on my card after we left Although I would expect to pay for minibar consumption the staff should not make promises they can t keep Sorry but that s crass , Great room very comfortable bed and location perfect location for Barbican Staff friendly but see negative comment 
207974,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Can t fault this hotel Best we ve stayed at for a long time, Friendly Hotel staff upgraded our room as it was my partners Birthday They took our bags to the room for us and demonstrated how everything in there worked Beds are very comfy and we were impressed with the shower Bar restaurant next door also very friendly and do really nice food very close to the Barbican tube station which was handy 
207975,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, What is the point of that green night light in the room other than to annoy The light switches generally were insanely difficult to work out , We were very pleased to be upgraded on arrival to a studio suite which was very comfortable although located across the road in one of the several historic buildings which make up the complex The location whilst not in the centre of things and requiring a taxi to reach is a short walk for example from Broadgate Circle which has a wide range of bars and restaurants 
207976,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, There was a fair bit of road noise but I guess that s what you get in central London , Staff were excellent always with a smile and helpful The room was very well appointed and comfortable A few more amenities than you d normally expect which is a nice welcome i e fruit bottled water coffee machine etc The bed was comfortable and temperature of the room just how I like 
207977,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, They tried to send me to another associated hotel which I refused as I booked solely for the location I stood my ground and they found me a single room with a discount Not what I expected when I booked a supposed high quality hotel on the morning of my arrival If location had not been important I would have booked a budget hotel ,No Positive
207978,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Apparently the hotel had been rented for a wedding party the night of our stay Our room sat over that party which lasted well over midnight The music vibrated the walls of our room keeping us from sleeping Then to add insult to injury as staff left the hotel at 5am they stood beneath our window on the street loudly visiting with each other at times yelling and joyfully screaming This lasted for at least 30 minutes They apparently failed to consider that they were standing underneath guest rooms Our window to the street was very poorly insulated and so all sound from the street was audible The next problem was the dearth of USB outlets and universal plugs We had to keep the bathroom light on all night in order to use the plug in it to charge our devices very disruptive , Nice breakfast quiet and well appointed restaurant and friendly staff 
207979,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, It s location near barbican makes it not as convenient on the underground as you would assume , Very nice and well appointed room Nice soundproofing for a good nights sleep 
207980,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, I fell quite badly as there was a step right inside the bedroom Have bruised arm and back Maybe a sign somewhere outside bedroom would have been helpful ,No Positive
207981,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, For the price we paid I would expect a bathroom without mould on the ceiling Room was also very small and the bed was tiny, The staff were very helpful
207982,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, My only suggestion would be possibly a towel hook near the sink , The friendly staff who were really helpful The WOW factor suite that we were upgraded to was outstanding The bed was so comfy I didn t want to get out of it It was our 30th wedding anniversary weekend and they certainly knew how to spoil us bubbles chocolate and strawberries on arrival And our bed turned back with towels as swans and rose petals was a lovely gesture We were truly delighted with all the surprises and will definitely be returning Outstanding 
207983,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Pillows rock hard very uncomfortable , The Bed was very good and standard of Hotel very good Staff efficient but not that friendly Bar come restaurant over priced 
207984,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Items in room were dated for the star of the hotel I would expect digital Bluetooth radio etc and the shower and bath were difficult to operate, Location
207985,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Distance from main tourist attractions, The staff aloud us to check in early which was most accommodating as we just got of a 30 hour flight The property is a fair walk away from the main tourist attractions but there is a subway about 10 minutes walk from the hotel 
207986,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing to complain about though it was a bit of a Labyrinth to get to my room Not the most interesting part of town in terms of sightseeing but that doesn t detract from the comfort or value of my stay there as The Underground is a few blocks away , Lovely accommodations close to the Liverpool Street Train Station and the Barbican with a luxurious shower and bathroom almost as large as the bedroom they even provided a cellphone and free UK US calls Wonderful comfortable and quiet with a friendly staff and nice Pub downstairs 
207987,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Better signage around the hotel so you do not get lost Also the room I stayed in had a window with an electric shutter in side the bathroom The shutter didn t work which meant while I was showering my partner was having a free show of watching me shower while she laid in bed Forgot to report this to the hotel , Staff building location room is all good 
207988,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Entrance more like a nightclub than a hotel You walk through the bar down a dark corridor to reception 5 star atmosphere lacking Tables not clean in the restaurant , Very clean Good breakfast Comfortable bed 
207989,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Air conditioning leaked and carpet was sodden We complained and once we left we were pleased with the response from the hotel and the apologies were accepted , Staff were very attentive
207990,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Attention to detail missing I didn t have a remote for the TV in my room there were bread crumbs from the previous guest on my chair and in general the room could have been cleaner They offer a handy a smartphone for your use during the stay Would have been great had they not forgotten to charge it , Friendly staff
207991,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Room had everything including bottled water and fruit and it was wonderfully comfortable Staff allowed me to chevk out an hour past chevk out Didi not try free phone to US Did need the French phone charger plug as I had no British adapter Very thoughtful 
207992,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, No bidet but as in English standard , an old brewery in Central London just few steps from Barbican Centre and Tube Station The Brewery was visited by Queen Elizabeth very elegant and formal but highly friendly Very large and confortable rooms silent bathroom was very large and functional In summary excellent
207993,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, There was a rotten fruit in the fruits basket Not much amenities inside of the hotel such as pool or gym , The mobile phone handy was very helpful for us since we didn t have local phone The bed was also very comfy that I slept well very much 
207994,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, At 20 quid plus breakfast is overpriced even by London standards so we avoided Window only single glazed so a lot of street noise bins emptying wedding parties etc for a room being charged at 160 quid a night that could be better , Well presented hotel with friendly staff We were upgraded to a club room with a great comfy bed 
207995,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Initially the room we went to first was small and there was a loud noise outside in street so we couldn t sleep However very helpful staff upgraded us to a club room which was more spacious and quiet It was done quickly and we were impressed with how the staff responded Also no spa facilities for a 5 hotel unless you are a Montcalm club member and can access the ones at the other Montcalm hotel , Very stylish rooms if you like a modern style Clean and comfortable Staff were all very helpful and friendly 
207996,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing, Absolutely fantastic service and staff We were checking availability dates for September before we had even checked out of the hotel The hotel even provides you with a phone which was invaluable for getting around and using as a map These little extras and fantastic service sets this hotel apart from anywhere else 
207997,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Excellent location near Barbican handy for Moorgate station Staff were fantastic always willing to help with any query Thoroughly enjoyable stay 
207998,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Wee bit off the beaten track but tube station 5minute walk away, Staff were lovely helpful nothing too much trouble complementary coffee at reception were able to leave your bags and they were in your room on your return bed so comfortable also left bags on checking out and knew they were taken good care of 
207999,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Booked as a party of 6 3 X 2 2 couples got upgraded one didnt The one that didnt got a very small room Thankfully reviewed this with the manager and compensation was provided to the couple who didnt get the upgrade , Friendly and helpful staff Very relaxed breakfast with good a la carte options
208000,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The bath plug was broken and there wasn t a bar in the hotel I guess I should have checked this but I just thought all hotels had bars esp as it was in an old brewery , They showed us to our room which was useful as the place is a maze the staff were friendly and helpful 
208001,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, for 3 nights at over 1 000 spent there was no bottled water with the exception of the one on arrival feel this was poor when compared to Hiltons were you get bottles each day at a fraction of the price , great location and staff were very good
208002,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, I have stayed here a couple of times and is always been excellent Staff are very friendly and the rooms are clean and comfortable Lovely place to stay would recommend 
208003,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Really struggling here but the pillows could have been a little softer , It was my wife s birthday which I mentioned to the hotel prior to arriving On arrival we were treated to a very warm welcome an upgrade and some treats in the room The staff couldn t have done any more for us on our stay in particular Gemma who was great The room was spacious club room clean and comfortable with no outside noise Location is excellent just a short walk to the nearest tube station The pub next door has a lot of character and sells a nice selection of beers 
208004,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Please open the bar the hotel is in an old brewery You have the dining rooms but the bar pub was closed , A great hotel very attentive and friendly staff The room was great large and airey well equipped a fabulous bed very little road noise The hotel has an old world charm about it but has all the comforts of 21st century Very centrally located but not to touristy By public transport this hotel is no more than 20 minutes to most of the main attractions of London
208005,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Really spacious clean rooms We were attending a wedding nearby so didn t get a chance to make use of many facilities but everything we did encounter was great 
208006,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Having to leave after just two days , A wonderful team effort made our stay memorable for all the right reasons which was to celebrate my husbands 60th birthday Complete with a card and complimentary bottle of wine from the staff Just perfect 
208007,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, I was disappointed in the location It was in the middle of nowhere Staff should be trained to give adequate instructions or advice on areas that we can go besides the Jugged hare , I thought the rooms were nice and fairly big for London 
208008,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, It was unusual and a bit disappointing not to be able to sit and have a social drink and relaxation in the bar after a meal out in the city No bar open after midnight room service only , Great location close to Tube Quiet area Very comfort 
208009,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The room was far too dark with no proper natural light It was not a room that you would want to spend any time in which I think for the price is a poor reflection, Good location
208010,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Room standard was not of a five stars hotel small bathroom no place to place our personal belongings safe out of order after two useless interventions to fix it , Staff very friendly and helpful cleanliness
208011,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Stay there all the time when in London one of the best beds i have slept in Staff always on their game and very helpful long queue at check in due some convention that weekend but apologies given straight away and was shown to room if not stayed there before it is a bit of maze but you get your bearings quickly Continental breakfast in the club room was quite good in the package Apart from 2 dirty coffee cups in the room which was quickly attended to i would add i cannot fault our stay Will definitely be back
208012,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, N A, Liked everything would stay here again and would recommend to everyone The staff were so attentive and friendly The room was lovely and everything we needed was in there including a spare umbrella for the typical english weather luckily not needed It is a little out the way from the centre of London if you are being a tourist however we got taxis to and from which was fine and no problem 
208013,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Significant finger marks on the bathroom and doors made the room feel less clean though I m sure it was , Arranging the free fruit to reflect the overhead room lights meant you were greeted to your room by a line of smiling apples 
208014,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Ordered breakfast by room service and it was terrible Not very warm and toast was no more than warm bread Advised reception and they took action and refunded , Facilities in the room were excellent and the hotel was very clean 
208015,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Room very small for a double Returned late in the evening couldn t get a drink in the lobby Jugged Hare had closed Not ideal having to entertain guest in bedroom in order to have a drink , Bed very comfy the room has everything you could need Staff very friendly helpful
208016,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, The Hotel was beautiful and immaculate The staff impeccably professional and friendly there wasn t a single staff member we walked passed that didn t say hello or good day The room was as well equipped as any hotel I ve stayed in and to think it was cheaper than most other options available Amazing value for money Couldn t recommended highly enough 
208017,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Room terrible not 5 at all Location average easy to get round London with Underground anyway Noisey room Definately would not recommend or visit again ,No Positive
208018,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, We were upgraded to a superior room which was very spacious and beautifully decorated and furnished Lovely breakfast Wonderful views from the rooftop restaurant Very attentive staff without being overbearing 
208019,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, The Club Room Members Lounge had access to continental breakfast afternoon tea with sandwiches and complimentary early evening drinks Very attentive staff throughout the hotel It is nice to be in a building which has all the features and comfort of a 5 Star Hotel but retains much of the character and style of a historic building 
208020,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, I had a room at the front As is normal in London for some very very vague reason the hotel has not put a penny into installing decent window frames So I advise to bring ear plugs Rest of the hotel is relatively well maintained and has some nice lively restaurants Rooms at the back obviously do not suffer from the noise problem ,No Positive
208021,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, No master light switch in room hate having to search everywhere to turn off unnecessary lights TV had problems with cable access Room difficult to get to from reception, Reasonable business accommodation Appreciated them allowing me to check in and go to room early
208022,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, aircondition was problematic to set no view from window but is standard in London, the club romm was excellen choice nice room good and quite breakfest the hotel restaurant pub serving excellent food and beers
208023,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, nothing , Comfy bed very nice hotel for reasonable price in central London Barbican and moorgate tube station 2 minute walk Lovely building from the outside polite helpful staff and overall 4 5 star hotel for very reasonable price 
208024,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Comically bad shower pressure was a big let down considering the not exactly low room price Your mileage may vary but for me this was a huge minus The bed was not the best but we slept decently , Beautiful old building extremely attentive and professional staff free to use smart phone with free Internet service spacious enough room complimentary bottled water and fruits 
208025,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing to dislike, Staff were fabulous Upgraded us as it was our 30th anniversary trip made extra special with rose petals on our bed Wonderful place 
208026,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We had the breakfast in our room and unfortunately it was a little cold , The staff were excellent and we were given a free upgrade as it was my partners birthday along with balloons and the bed turned down with petals and towels made into swans a really nice touch Dorina I think that was her name she was one of the duty managers also gave us a complimentary breakfast 
208027,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The main problem was that the air in our room got very stuffy even though we didn t have any heating on We tried turning on AC and opening window but the window would only open slightly We sometimes had trouble sleeping because of this , The staff was so nice and accommodating The location was a bit out of the city center but it was nicer to be closer to East London area as it isn t as touristy and it is quieter It also was very nice and clean 
208028,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Went for evening drinks but bar area full so we went in corner out the in restaurant area But made uncomfortable by waitress staff , The hotel was outstanding had to wait a bit for room to b finished from housekeeping but was given free drinks in the Aviary 
208029,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, No hooks in the bathroom to hang clothes The toiletries table was placed bu the shower far from the sink which was tiny , Staff very friendly and helpful room spacious comfortable bed even pillows were good I liked complimentary fruit after a long travel 
208030,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Rooms are tiny if I had a cat I wouldn t have been able to swing it Bed was lop sided my feet were higher than my head for some reason I was laid on the left and gravity also the lop on the bed was constantly willing me to roll to the right Bathroom and in particular the shower was great , Nice looking hotel staff very nice and polite Good pub and restaurant added on to the property which was a bonus Decent location
208031,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The concierge desk was inconsistent when we required attention , Appreciated the extra care taken at check in by the front desk staff They were very accommodating 
208032,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The food prices were slightly excessive We would have liked to eat at the restaurant but unfortunately could not afford to However next time we will be aware and budget accordingly , The room was beautiful and the staff were so accommodating and polite 
208033,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Bar and restaurant was closed weekend Hot buffet breakfast was cold Staff serving at breakfast appeared indifferent and unhelpful , Location cleanliness bathrobes room Reception staff efficient and helpful Concierge friendly and helpful 
208034,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Its an old brewery so it can be a bit of a maze sometimes to get to your room , Super comfortable and cosy rooms with all the things you need Friendly and helpful staff would definitely visit again 
208035,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, The staff were wonderful I honestly could no fault them one bit I popped out early evening and when I had returned they had tidied my room and turned the bed down for night They all referred to me by my name Truly 5 star thank you Montcalm 
208036,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Roadworks outside meant no quiet lie in for us Not hotels fault of course but very noisy Maybe ask for room away from it we didn t know until next morning , Lovely added luxuries in the room heated bathroom floor fab lighting comfy bed even mobile phone free to use during your stay friendly helpful staff even left free gifts for my husbands birthday 
208037,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Airconditioning did not cool room correctly even when reported to front desk and maintenance staff attended , Good location Staff very professional unique transformation from brewery into hotel 
208038,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Booked a Club Room very comfortable bed air conditioning toiletries hairdryer tea and coffee facilities very clean surprisingly quiet Taxi to Shaftesbury Avenue approximately 11 but a walk along the Thames to Westminster via St Paul s recommended 
208039,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, No spa as advertised which was very disappointing and no one at reception bothered to inform us if this Rooms rather small and window frames were covered in mould, Great location and reception area rooms slightly shabby mould around windows and small
208040,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We didn t pay for breakfast as it was quite expensive at 25 00 each for an English breakfast , Lovely room with a waterfall shower and comfy bed TV with lots of channels and radio nothing missing all great Very short walk to both Moorgate underground and also London Liverpool St is only 10 15 mins away so very central to see all the sights in London 
208041,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Our stay was fantastic all around I booked as a surprise trip for my girlfriend s 30th birthday and we arrived in the free upgrade room to a bottle of champagne balloons and a birthday card from the staff I couldn t have asked for a better stay and the staff made us feel so welcome Many thanks and we will be back 
208042,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Noisy there was some kind of machine plant outside of the window and it was very noisy all night The layout of the hotel makes it very difficult to find your room Would have been nice to have a residents only bar lounge rather that just the pub on the corner , Good location and well equipped room and very friendly staff 
208043,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Constant air conditioning noise in the room air conditioning and shower controls too complicated , Perfect location very friendly and welcoming staff beautiful old buildings and lovely room with comfortable bed Easy access to public transport and surprisingly quiet 
208044,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, In general it is difficult to find some of the rooms The one I had this time under the roof 326 were a bit too small and noisy without a real window they have much better ones, Great location designer hotel friendly and helpful staff
208045,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Lovely pub and restaurant on the ground floor some of the best food in London Club rooms come with access to the club lounge with complimentary snacks and drinks 
208046,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, But the mattress in our room for disabled person was far too deep to climb up into bed Not value for money only because we didn t make use of all the facilities available , The bed was comfortable We will come back again We ve got what s important to us 
208047,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The 6 o clock Sunday morning fire alarm the bizarre extra layer a bit like a duvet but strapped on top of the mattress that made the bed really soft , The gimmicky lights and little handy 4G device that would have been useful if I didn t have my own phone 
208048,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, This is the 3rd time I have stayed at the hotel and I was disappointed this time The room was small barely 18 inches either side of the bed The air con wasnt working well and the room was warm and stuffy room 249 Sitting in the chair was like sitting in a narrow corridor , The staff remain very efficient and welcoming but I was disappointed that I was asked by 3 different staff members is this your first visit to the hotel In today s IT savvy world it would have been nice if only when booking in that it would be noted that this was my 3rd visit not feeling any loyalty to return 
208049,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, It was so very warm almost subtropical inside the hotel Points for keeping us all very snug and it clearly is an amazing place however the temperature could do with being a little more reasonable , The hotel is lovely as are the staff Nothing is too much effort food is lovely Perfect place for business or leisure 
208050,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Hotel is a bit of a rabbit warren but that s part of its history and we were shown the shortcut back to reception , Comfortable bed in stylish room Good shower over bath Nice toiletries 
208051,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, At check in front desk wanted to put me at a sister hotel that was farther away from the conference center They were likely overbooked The temperature in my room was ridiculously hot the thermostat did not work despite my turning it all the way down to 16 degrees Celsius I called front desk and was assured someone will swing by to rectify the issue Four nights at the hotel and nobody bothered to address my complaint It felt like sleeping in a sauna , The only redeeming quality was its distance to the conference center that I had to be at that week 
208052,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing , Beautiful spacious room Found out it was my birthday and I was pregnant so when I went back to the room later there was a orange and lemonade a chocolate cake balloons and a pregnancy pillow Really showed they cared and listened Room was immaculate 
208053,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Reception staff were cold and indifferent on check in slightly better on check out Given the room was paid for and credit card details given was there really any need to take copies of photo ID of a British citizen The bed had a cheap open coil mattress Putting a lovely topper on the bed does not solve the issue of a dip being created in the middle of a cheap mattress if one person weighs more than the other This outdated style also means there is excessive mattress movement everytime someone turns over Generally good hotels use hand side stitched pocket sprung or memory foam for this reason The lounge area was tiny and uncomfortable not everyone wants their social space option to be the noisy pub The coffee in the room was little instant packets at the room price point I d expect Nespresso or Krups , Great location for the Barbican Nice bathroom and great shower The Elemis toiletries were a nice touch pleasing to see a cruelty free British brand 
208054,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We were in a room that was literally just off the street and opposite to the hotel we walked out of our room and on to the street which was a bit weird and a bit noisy , The rooms were decorated nicely and the reception was quite glam Breakfast was good but expensive 17 per person I would recommend going down to the road a bit to Cotes they do a breakfast for a lot less 
208055,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Localisation close to lots of useful points business and leisure but barbican itself is not very attractive , We are returning customers and will return The room lay out some are a bit small but all optimized top personnel and room equipment The ambiance is also great and there are a couple of nice old London fashioned streets around the hotel 
208056,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Poor lighting in room Nowhere to hang things in bathroom No shelves in bathroom Bed comfy but very high Had to climb up, Free mobile phone Excellent concierge service
208057,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Property was in the financial part of the city so quite quiet at weekends but tube station walkable so not an issue , The staff were full of energy and were very helpful Great asset Montcalm Julia on front desk was particularly helpful 
208058,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, I booked a room at the Montcalm at the Brewery but was upgraded to one of their hotels 15 minutes away which was annoying on 2 counts 1 I had parked my car on the Barbican car park before I found out about my upgrade only for the other hotel to have an NCP right outside it So had to walk 15 mins to pick my car up and 2 I wanted to stay at the Montcalm at the Brewery which is why I booked there Poor show really, The bed was comfortable and the room facilities were great
208059,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Our room number 12 was on the ground floor and looked out onto what I m assuming was an air conditioning unit for the whole hotel There was no point in having a window no light came in at all I wouldn t have paid so much to stay in this hotel if I had known this in advance Not good value for money , Central location Good room facilities 
208060,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, It was difficult to get the temperature exactly right at night too hot with the duvet too cold without it and I couldn t quite understand how the air conditioning worked Breakfast was OK without quite being special enough to justify the price , The overall standard of cleanliness and the facilities The helpfulness of the staff The location near the barbican Centre 
208061,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Could not fault our stay , It was a special birthday and the staff went above and beyond their duty with the room and service Hotel is connected to pub which serves excellent beer and food Lovely building 
208062,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Our room was very small and very dark The mattress was not very good and could have been firmer The room was very dark even when we opened the curtains view was a wall so no light could get in anyway We were told at reception that we had been given an upgrade and I can t help wondering what a lower grade room would have been like I think that we should have been taken to our room by the most direct route rather than via two lifts and several corridors and steps Fortunately we found the shorter route afterwards as directed by the staff member who took us to the room , The staff were all delightful and happy to help 
208063,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The only negative was the lovely room we were in was quite low just above the street and we could hear the conversations of pedestrians outside at night Better deals on the windows would go a long way , Beautiful room gorgeous communal areas friendly helpful staff made everything a pleasure best room service chocolate brownie ever We needed a break and were thoroughly spoiled Only had one night but it felt like a holiday 
208064,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The sink in the bathroom was very small difficult even to wash hands in and I don t have big hands and impossible to fill the kettle provided , The english breakfast tea brand Jing I think was particularly good 
208065,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, If I had to be extremely picky there wasn t any lighting at the wardrobe which made it hard to what you had in there , The bed was ridiculously comfortable Spent the night in the Montcalm Club Room 100 recommended and would choose this room again myself Staff are brilliant I was greeted on arrival but a couple of members of staff whilst I waited to check in They were polite and cracked on with conversation like they knew me whilst telling me a little about the history of the hotel and how they can be of help during my stay The location is pretty good and convenient Shops are within a couple of minutes walking and Moorgate underground station a 5 minute walk away 
208066,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, wifi connection was very poor dropped connection every 5 minutes and all sessions otherwise everything about Montcalm was excellent except I did book it thinking it was a Brewery that I could drink locally brewed beer at That was sad for me , Fontina was very patient and helpful while I sorted out my corporate credit card running while out of US Staff were all very very helpful and nice Location was amazing
208067,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, I booked at the Hotel NOT with City Rooms I expected to be in the main part of the hotel not the further most distance from the facilities At one point I was offered a room in a different building entirely up the road which was totally unacceptable This made it exceptionally and painfully difficult for me due to an injury to move around the hotel and I was indeed restricted to my room after arrival by this There was no other chair in the room apart from an unstable office type chair , The rooms are all well fitted and the beds extremely comfortable Food both breakfast and Room Service were excellent as usual The hotel is very clean with excellent facilities and the are friendly and very helpful 
208068,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The Hotel looks like a labyrinth We got lost on several occasions Breakfast had to be prepaid and I had to show my creditcard 3 times on a 48 hour stay , Liked the free cellphone unit in the room allowing us to tour the city with free internet and apps like googel maps etc
208069,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Didn t like having to go across the road to my room I didn t like having to chase for my dinner that was forgotten And I didn t like my dinner turning up the following evening that was cold , Room itself was good and staff were attentive 
208070,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, The staff were fantastic all very friendly and nothing was too much trouble We were upgraded on arrival for no extra cost and the staff had put some balloons in the room as we were celebrating my partner s birthday The location was great quiet and close to the tube station 
208071,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, It was a it noisy but then we were next to a road so what do I expect , The bed was nice and big and very comfy decor was modern and up to date I mentioned it was my husbands birthday and hey upgraded us and provides us with a bottle of proseco which I thought was a lovely touch and a surprise 
208072,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Couldn t get a table for dinner in jugged Hare until 9pm Friday which was no good as we travelled a long time and the phone wasn t answered in the chiswell rooms Not great if these are the hotel eateries Looking slightly worn room 120 carpet stains and worn desk chair fabric Finally asked for a room with a bath and didn t get a reply at all in a whole week Ended up with a nice shower as it was a disabled room so large wet room but not what we wanted Check in and out queues substantial In the end I walked out and emailed the hotel about our extras The two concierge stood waiting to help should be able to check out guests and the check in process is unduly long , Great style and service
208073,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, The staff provided excellent service The tea service complimentary water in the room housekeeping great breakfast etc all made for a wonderful stay 
208074,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, entertainment system kept going down Then remote wouldn t work Asked reception twice to sort it didn t turn up went out hoping it would be sorted when I got back but nothing done Dissapointed , good location
208075,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We mentioned upon departure that there was a loud noise of running water in the ceiling space which did keep us awake The hotel were going to look into this with their maintenance staff , A very nice hotel with very nice furnishings and clearly is of a 5 star standard Bed was extremely comfortable and all in all a very nice experience
208076,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, The moment you step towards the hotel you are treated like you are part of an family The staff are friendly and caring The rooms are wonderful and spacious You have everything you may need even an umbrella in the wardrobe for those rainy days I would definitely go back hopefully for longer this time 
208077,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The electric blind in the bathroom was really temperamental the bath control was broken and kept falling off the window didn t open not really 5 star standard but 5 star price , Great staff lovely lobby area nice bed very comfortable attached pub looked great Nice bathrobes 
208078,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Breakfast service was poor No menu just help yourself to lukewarm food Tea and coffee not fresh and only provided after long wait , Location was good room was small but comfortable
208079,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Breakfast completed over priced at almost 25 each, The lobby and rooms are exactly what you see in the pictures No surprises Beautiful rooms for the price and comfortable bed Didn t have breakfast or anything in the room as far too expensive The mini bar had the biggest choice I ve seen again was too expensive but if you are prepared to pay for it then plenty to choose from however there is a Tesco opposite 
208080,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Everything has its price to the point that the room rate doesn t buy you a 4 5 experience you incrementally have to trade up to it From peanuts to toiletries to a film in your room everything costs slightly more than you feel it ought to Not permitting a burger to be served medium to adhere to a mysterious regulation is a little tiresome Nice team but ever so slightly commercial chain feel rather than boutique charm ,No Positive
208081,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Poor service A 5 hotel who refuse to cook your burger medium rare is not a 5 hotel especially when it takes 50mins to prepare Being told we can t have have a cocktail on a Saturday at 19h because the bar is closed is also not 5 And a doorman who care more about our chauffeur driven car to move from the entrance instead of welcoming us and offering an umbrella to protect from the rain is not 5 either , In the heart of the City of London 
208082,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, I disliked almost everything apart from the location and the architecture Exhibits all of the worst features of luxury hotels e g 1 Pointless staff whose only role is to suck up to narcissist guests door openers bell hops etc 2 Tediously long winded check in check out 3 Opaque pricing and billing 4 50 minute notice to use gym facilities 5 Broken desk chair 6 ridiculously small desk 7 stained shower cabinet 8 atmospheric but functionally useless lighting I could go on, location
208083,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, The property itself was beautiful but the staff really made this hotel come to life they could not be nicer or more helpful They tailored our stay to suit us perfectly and went above and beyond to make our stay memorable as it was for a special occasion Also in a great location a 5 minute walk to the closest underground station and a 7 minute walk to Liverpool Street Station 
208084,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Unfortunately the hot water mixer wasnt working in the bath however the concierge offered to help us move and a complimentary bottle of champagne , We were upgraded to a beautiful suite so this review is for a room that we were upgraded to which was amazing a great space over two floors beautiful bathroom and a very comfortable bed 
208085,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, it was cold and it took me a long time to get my room to a bearable temperature , rooms are comfortable location is great staff efficient love jugged hare and the dining rooms 
208086,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Breakfast could start a bit earlier for those of us with early meetings The food prices were also a bit high , Great staff The coffee in the lobby was a nice touch 
208087,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, There seems to be a lot missing for a 5 star hotel Starting with the inside bar which closes so early for a 5 star hotel The room was clean but super small , Clean hotel Nice bathroom amenities A good 4 star hotel Location is good walking distance to the Underground
208088,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We arrived around 7pm on a Feb evening so it was dark and the curtains were drawn in the room As a result we had no idea until morning that there was no natural light in the room We had one very small window didn t open overlooking a high wall to another building blocking out any sliver of light dark and airless Would have asked for a move if we d noticed the night before , The Jugged Hare was a superb addition to our stay for an evening meal and drinks 
208089,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Set up of the hotel was confusing to find rooms and the bar attached was small so not much seating, Service was outstanding staff were genuinely happy to go above and beyond without prompting I had an issue with the toilet flush when I got there as it was sorted out straight away
208090,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Well we sell beds for a living and we always like 5 ft Or bigger Your bed in club room 4ft 6 and very very soft didn t sleep well at all But this is my ONLY complaint otherwise fab , Loved having a bar to go to in a lift straight from hotel although we didn t eat in the bar restaurant it did look good and the bar food 
208091,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The room was quite small the breakfast was very expensive and although nice the service was very confusing and the staff seemed harrassed I expected to have more included in the price considering it was not a cheap hotel , It was high spec and very clean 
208092,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, There was a repeated whirring noise which made it a bit difficult to sleep but otherwise a great room , Very easy check in and check out process The staff also helped to accommodate my request to be in an easy to locate room as it can be a bit confusing Very comfortable room and the bed is excellent
208093,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, No decafe tea in restaurant Last time we stayed had a choice of eggs today only very wet scrambled eggs and streaky bacon Breakfast wasn t as good as normal 
208094,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The main issue was the room itself You don t have access to open windows turn AC heater off constantly blows Lots of lights from electronics clocks bar and from under the door to the hallway You can t turn them off , During the week it is a good location 
208095,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, What s not to like Great location great rooms and very friendly and professional staff 5 hotel for 3 money And the pub next door is awesome 
208096,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Hotel was in a great location close to several tube stops so it was easy to get around The hotel itself was really well decorated with nice furnishings As the hotel is an old brewery it was quite a maze to get around and rhe ceiling was quite low in our room but I think it just added to the charm The staff were very Friendly and helpful during our stay 
208097,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Lack of public areas and hotel restaurant If we wanted a drink we had to go out into the poring rain and walk round the corner to the hotels pub this was not evident on the website Did not feel like a hotel but more like a serviced appartment , Location as required However as its an commercial area most restaurants etc were closed on Saturday Sunday night had to walk a considerable distance to get a meal 
208098,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, I got downgraded to a single room which was still a nice room your insensitives helped maters on departure I was ashored that I will have a full upgrade on my next visit Which I will definitely take up , Your staff are very helpful are your biggest asset
208099,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, There were minor problems with the loo flush one night but this was remedied by the hotel , The location and comfort of the hotel are excellent this was my 4th stay 
208100,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The security staff were over zealous at the end of the evening basic attitude of we have had your money now get out not good Wasn t helped by booking com not sending the booking through to the hotel at least that s what we was told This resulted in a 30 minute wait at reception to get it sorted , The rooms and reception staff were excellent a credit to the business 
208101,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, one minor point was that I found it difficult to tell the security level of the WiFi however and as such did not use it overly , The staff were friendly and approachable and made me feel valued as a guest I would recommend this hotel to anyone The room was excellent and hope to visit again soon 
208102,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, I would have preferred a harder pillow , The rooms were comfortable and I enjoyed the decor and layout There was a handy phone you could use to find out info and even call people from for free Staff were helpful and courteous 
208103,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Not a single complaint , The loveliest hotel Spotless very comfortable and all the staff are exceptional Highly recommend this hotel in every aspect 
208104,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, I was annoyed at the repeated attempts to sell us the very expensive breakfast 25pp when we checked in about 5 times The hotel is a listed building and a complete maze difficult finding the room and way out every time , The bed was very comfortable and we slept really well Great location and quite a quirky hotel Very attractive lobby 
208105,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Our room in the South Wing was smaller than the photograph for this room type probably due to working around the architecture of the building Also the double bed smaller than expected , The design of the original old brewery is good Lovely staff The pub 
208106,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Staff were so helpful couldn t have done more Also The Jugged Hare next door was lovely for a pint before heading out or a nightcap on the way home 
208107,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing , The room was clean and spacious The facilities were perfect for one night The location was ideal for the Barbican and convinient for the tube There was always a member of staff to help when needed 
208108,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, The hotel is beautiful and the staff was very helpful The room was not very big but it had everything one needs and the bathroom has lovely amenities The bed was super comfortable We only stayed one night but I would recommend it for even more Although it is not in the heart of London the neighborhood is very nice and the Tube station is 5 on foot 
208109,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Being bumped to another hotel with no advance notice , Got bumped from here to their sister hotel on Finsbury Square which was annoying as my party venue was the Brewery but they provided courtesy transport between the hotels and a complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience so it all worked out OK
208110,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Better window glazing for sound proofing warmth The heat was set higher to balance the old windows I was warm but it wasted energy , Beautiful very comfortable room Lovely staff nice London City location
208111,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, It s not evident to switch off the television so I always need to call the reception and ask them about how to do it , Very nice room everything one may need good location 
208112,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, A little bit pricey but understandable since every other hotels in London is quite expensive , Very nice and helpful staff Also great location If you are up for a walk you can go to the river and tower bridge by foot The restaurant just around the corner serves excellent dishes 
208113,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Coffee machine in room and real milk in fridge would have been a nice touch Minibar contents were a little too overpriced Nothing else really , Nice room upgrade friendly receptionist who took the time to take us to our room when her colleagues weren t available well stocked minibar good food and service for breakfast attractive decor throughout comfy bed nice tea and biscuits in room free wifi and phone excellent location tasty bar snacks and availability of Erdinger no alcohol beer the best in The Jugged Hare great location for The Barbican 
208114,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Doesn t look the same as the picture showed on the website so I was expected a bigger room but in fact the room size was quiet small , The location is quiet convenient to the underground station And if you like shoreditch and brick lane it is very close to there Also close to one of the most famous club Fabric The room was tidy and clean staff is very helpful and friendly as well 
208115,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, That I couldn t stay longer , Everything The staff were all so lovely and accommodating they really made our stay perfect Especially the concierge and the Duty manager 22 01 17 The breakfast at The Chiswell Street Dining rooms was beautiful best scrambled eggs I have ever had The room was lovely and comfortable and well presented nice and quiet too And the building is beautiful Would definitely recommend and will be returning 
208116,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Not much , Great staff and lovely room in the centre of London Great value to for what you get compared to many places Also try the Jugged Hare next door for lunch very good 
208117,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Reception area was cold Our bathroom was even colder The club lounge was very poor understaffed and seriously underpriced poor selection and not enough of continental breakfast and not enough seating to accommodate those of us who had paid for extra comfort and Service very disappointing To have the main restaurant shut at weekends was surprising and to not have an internal bar lounge equally as surprising , The bed was really comfortable Room facilities were good Reception staff concierge and doormen polite and attentive 
208118,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The TV was in an odd position in our room This could be placed on a movable stand Although this isn t a big deal , The room was beautiful The staff where brilliant And thr breakfast was delicious 
208119,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, It wasn t super clean and I was expecting something a little more from a 5 star but it was an amazing stay though The window in the bathroom made cold air enter from outside even when closed making the bathroom not so warm and the insonorization was not so good because I could hear all the city noise in the early morning , Excellent staff and the room was amazing and well furbished Nice location for central London Bed was super comfy and the bathroom big and very nice 
208120,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, On our first morning the tone was set with a negative response to my only request Unacceptable for a 5 star hotel Lots of distance to cover to our rooms Would have preferred the club room to be closer to the lounge even though the lounge didn t offer what we were expecting The iron was old and wearing a wrinkled shirt was preferable More space needed in the kettle area aircon temp fluctuated during the night and lighting too dim , There was always lots of staff in reception One lovely guy went above and beyond duty to assist me with an uber issue The atmosphere was good Very accommodating with an early checkin The bed very comfy and the room was very quiet Very impressed with the room iPhone as it helped us get around the city 
208121,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Breakfast quality was poor family report that sausages and bacon were undercooked Pastries were overlooked attentiveness of staff in Chiswick rooms at breakfast for pensioner and teenager who weren t au fait with hotel etiquette poor guests unsure of whether to seat themselves get own tea coffee toast etc , Location and staff attentiveness
208122,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, location close to my office Additionally Quality of service and attitude of staff encourages me to stay in this hotel again and again Special thanks to Vlad who looks after me every time I stay 
208123,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, small double rooms poor bedroom and bathroom lighting no tea coffee bar replenishment at turndown service, location first impressions staff friendly and attentive excellent breakfast
208124,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Very minor quibble note to hotel in room 148 the curtain didn t fit properly and let some light in But otherwise nothing to dislike at all , very quiet room bed really comfortable Don t be put off by the location in The City it is only a couple of mins from the tube station The pub part of the hotel Jugged Hare is also very good built in an old brewery so not your normal modern hotel 
208125,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing really, The beautiful duvet and pillows The complimentary wine which I did not drink as I don t drink alachol and the chocolates were a lovely touch along with the fruit 
208126,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The staff were quite rude and icy on arrival It was difficult to understand the receptionist checking us in The bed was not made until the evening time We were requested to pay 3 nights accommodation despite staying two nights and that the extra nights fee would be returned to me within a few days not great if you had a certain weekend budget , Comfortable bed room decorated nicely quite modern The bathroom was lovely Good location directly between two underground stations 
208127,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The room was noisy this is inevitable when situated on a fairly busy road The room clearly needs secondary glazing A shame as otherwise was very good value , The excellent value courteous staff and being upgraded to a larger room Perfectly sited for visiting the Barbican centre 
208128,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Stayed in a club room it was small compared to executive rooms in many other hotels The bathroom too small too No natural light in the room a small window Decor could be better there was only one mirror in the room by the desk Would have liked to have a separate shower too The desk area was taken up by the telephone mobile and sound speaker Was not told that the hotel has a steamroom and sauna before or during my stay , Great toiletries slippers bed and bedding and tea 
208129,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Small closet typical of big city hotels weird bathroom set up insufficient room light they upgraded us supposedly but then put my wife and I in the smaller of the two rooms didn t like the service button seemed to work intermittently all that is being picky , The accommodations were very good room size bed was comfortable gave us gifts over several nights wine chocolates which was unexpected Very near many sights and good restaurants on the east central side of the city 
208130,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Limited to 1 coffee pod per each for the Nespresso although the upgrade is sold on this being a feature Little things like this really annoy Water pressure shower mixer system dreadful to operate and no pressure at all for a decent shower so had to wait an age for bath to fill Only one robe in room Bathroom needs tidying touching up in respect of d cor No information provided by staff as to facilities , Location was handy One member of staff was very polite friendly and helpful Turn down service 
208131,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Easy walk to two tube stations close to places to eat very friendly staff huge bed great shower ultimately WAY exceeded my expectations and will definitely be recommending to friends and staying here again 
208132,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, 1 Concierge seemed to have VERY limited knowledge of specific restaurants nearby for us to enjoy and sent us to a chain restaurant Cote which was certainly not the experience we were looking for He seemed disengaged and disinterested 2 The Hotel has two restaurants One of them was closed for renovations which we were not made aware of The only other option was the Jugged Hare which is solely for meat eaters Not ideal for a vegetarian They had only one non meat option which was incredibly bland and disappointing 3 Three pieces of fruit were left in our room for our consumption however the fruit was old and past its time 4 Our room on the 4th floor had very small windows and was very dark 5 Room itself was ok it had no interesting design elements or personality which is a shame as the history of the hotel lends itself to such possibilities , Architecture of the hotel and history
208133,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Service at breakfast could have been better very few people in the restaurant but staff paying little attention to those who were there , Staff in hotel were all very helpful
208134,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, It was quiet staff very helpful Room had the facilities we expect and more the complimentary fruit and water was good Overall it exceeded expectations 
208135,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, A bit of confusion at check in but staff apologised immediately and upgraded our room because of this , Smart hotel great location friendly staff and a very comfortable one night stay 
208136,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Not being in the hotel taken over the road to a different building which had none of the wow of the main building, Bed was comfortable shower was great
208137,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, It s somewhat of a maze inside of the hotel once you re on your floor My room had a window but it was very close to a wall No daylight , Nice staff concierge to carry your bags Room was pretty nice bed storage for clothes mini bar multimedia tv alarm clock with dock for smartphone Small but clean bathroom with bathtub shower in tub toilet sink large mirror Lots of power outlets including HMDI port USB 5v port 
208138,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing , Everything was top notch staff was superb especially Valentina the receptionist Room was exactly as we saw on the website maybe better eheheh All the amenities are in room Definitely a very pleasant stay 
208139,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The noise oh the noise On a quiet weekend I was put in a room above a courtyard with a party until 2am then staff dragging chairs and talking much longer Reception too dark could not read forms to sign in check in was very slow After working non stop for 6 weeks I just wanted a decent sleep and though given the price and reviews this would be possible , Location from Liverpool street
208140,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Tired room enamel coming off bath grouting needed renewing Hotel paid no attention to details about how special our stay should be for our joint birthdays and tried to move us to a sister hotel which we have stayed in before and loved but specifically wanted this one Made husband late for his meeting with an important client whilst arguing with him that as the room wasn t booked in his name he couldn t check in without me Told him we then had an upgraded room but we hadn t He has stayed here before and has a far nicer spacious room Room aircon not sufficient duvet too hot and had to strip bed down to get to a bearable temp Cups in room only big enough for an expresso not tea , Assistance to our room with luggage appreciated breakfast chef was friendly and chatty next morning couldn t do enough for us which went some way to improve matters 
208141,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Teething problems with the room technology meant we didn t get a good night s sleep Reported to management so doubt this will affect other guests , Brand new hotel so everything new clean and plush Liked the champagne on arrival and the free breakfast 
208142,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Although we enjoyed the Jugged Hare for breakfast it was often very busy in the evening with no seats and we missed a hotel bar to simply relax in after a long day But when we did drink there staff great at creating drinks to order , Great staff Nice room Elegant and interesting building 
208143,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Poor support on concierge and business services for a 5 star rated hotel Staff not on top of their game and miscommunicated services available Furniture in the room was tired looking and facing noisy street , Comfortable bed
208144,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing I loved the hotel, The hospitality I received from the staff was absolutely first rate Because it was my birthday weekend I was upgraded to a beautiful room with a complimentary bottle of red wine and some chocolate truffles and finally if that wasn t generous enough we were also given a complimentary breakfast We were truely amazed by the generosity of the hotel and we will definitely be staying there again and not only because of the lovely extras but because the hotel is beautiful the location is fantastic and the food at The Jugged Hare was just delicious I would highly recommend this hotel
208145,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, A very comfortable well appointed hotel with friendly helpful staff set in an excellent location for what we were doing We liked the traditional feel and surroundings to the hotel 
208146,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, the location was ideal for what we were going to nice quiet dark room when curtains shut really comfy bed big bathroom and a shot off a phone with info about London on it should u need one 
208147,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, My only slight criticism is there was no where in our room to sit a do hair or make up lots of mirrors but none with a surface for placing straighteners or make up But this didn t affect our stay and wouldn t be enough to make a complaint , The hotel was beautiful located close to Liverpool st the barbican we even walked to the south bank in about 25mins The staff we helpful and happy and our room was lovely 
208148,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, No pool gym Not a great night s sleep due to overnight noise from local brewery No hotel bar after midnight, Excellent Breakfast Very friendly effective staff Comfortable rooms with good WiFi Great Location
208149,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The room was dark and small and felt claustrophobic TV did not work and accessing it was like walking through a maze Given the rate night not good value for money ,No Positive
208150,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Our room was really small when our friends also booked the same room but got a huge space It was also difficult to find , Really good value for money lovely reception area and bathrooms were good Elemis toiletries which are great 
208151,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Fitness room Tiny room with no functioning air con window or ventilation, Nice rooms great building with a lot of character Very nice venue for conferences
208152,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing all good, Excellent hotel staff couldn t have been more friendly or helpful very clean and comfortable lovely pub within the hotel free coffee in reception good location and would definitely staff here again and recommend
208153,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, maybe slightly bigger room, Staff was very friendly competent Excellent service Room was small but very comfortable with all amenities and uniquely a cell phone one could use around London That was a first for us Nice bathroom with floor heating 
208154,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Staff knocked 3 times to restock mini bar replenish fruit we didn t arrive until 4 30 turn bed down greatly appreciated but at 7pm , Small but very comfortable room not in main building but good value for location well equipped bathroom
208155,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Our room was across the road in suites which didn t work for me but for some would be a great bonus , The attached pub and dining rooms were lovely 
208156,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The food hate to say it but ordered a duck salad and boy it was repeating on me my god where do you get your stock from Also my salad came out b4 my bread n butter god I hate that , Everyone and everything
208157,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, First I was given a small room in the basement with a lot noise from various air condition hanging outside on the wall But upon request was promptly given another better room ,No Positive
208158,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Lots of different lighting in the rooms but none of them particularly bright not great for putting on make up , Very comfortable and quiet great facilities 
208159,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Got room 327 on the first night and didn t love it Staff upgraded me to club room 130 after I mentioned it which was great , Great staff quirky hotel with rooms going off in all directions awesome food and pub Will stay here whenever I m in London from now on
208160,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, There was a bit of a mix up over what payment included but they apologised for the mistake and corrected it more or less The radio stations on the TV didn t seem to work , I liked the high and soft bed I liked the bathroom facilities I liked the size of the room I liked the numerous amenities on offer I liked the staff who were very friendly and helpful even when busy and under pressure 
208161,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Room could have been a bit cleaner few stray short hairs on the bedding Hot water took a while to come through and the toilet continued to run after flushing Staff advised not unduly concerned but said would inform housekeeping , The location of the room was good Second time I have stayed and the first time the room windows faced an office building 
208162,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Unable to run bath took 45 mins Staff responded within 10 mins but problem not fixed and the promise of a room change never happened Room very very small Mini bar had selection of drink but only one beer Hotel bar hard to find very small so couldn t get in it Sat night Draughty windows and shabby curtains , Well situated 
208163,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The lay out is a bit unusal over different levels and floors but we got our barings quick enough might not suit less mobile customers , We stayed here on a very busy London weekend international Rugby Football The Lord Mayors show and Remberance I usally stay over by Marble Arch and this was my first stay in the city The hotel lcation was excellant and the room had every modcon you could think of including a hotel mobile and umbrella The mini bar was well stocked if a bit expensive but the fruit tea and coffee were all complimentary I think this might also be the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in even if it was the tallest Plenty of coat handers bathrobes slippers and quality toiletaires We booked a cooked breakfast which was served in the Jugged Hare which had a great atmosphere even for breakfast This is a good looking hotel with great staff We are memebers of a club in London but I am serious about making this hotel our go to location when the club is full Very happy to recommend 
208164,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Only issue was no window in the room as such there was a window it was mirrored and didnt open not a huge problem though, Everything I didn t want to come home
208165,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Was told on checking in that I had been upgraded however this only involved being relocated from the beautiful Brewery site to the rather plain London House site which was a 10 minute walk away and which didn t look any nicer than the room I d booked , Bed is comfy 
208166,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Thought hotel was closer too many staff on desk all of them came across like they were new everything took a long time jumping from one computer to the next we had 5 rooms booked I couldn t count on how many times we had to go back down to reception as the key card would not let us gain entry to the rooms very frustrating ,No Positive
208167,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Check in was slow with some panic by the front desk Room 327 an insult to be in this room NEVER put me in that room again Let s have some better directions to the rooms, Location always works for me 
208168,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing to be honest room facilities were great and we didn t eat or use the leisure facilities , The staff couldn t be any more polite Fantastic service and great modern and clean facilities
208169,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Everything was fine, Hotel had excellent facilities everything was there from bath supplies to sewing kit plus iron and ironing board I was very happy The room we stayed in was quiet so we were able to have a lie in every morning 
208170,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The next underground station is barbican that s cool but not too cool the hotel is based in the banking district The metro is bringing you in under 10 minutes to the touristical areas , Friendly staff high standard rooms very comfortable beds I would recommend this hotel for a trip to London 
208171,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, This hotel is perfectly situated and close walking distance to the tube The hotel and staff were wonderful Extremely polite and the hotel itself is glorious The enterance hall was beautiful The rooms were excellent Shower was Devine as were the in room bathroom products Mini bar was fairly priced and fully stocked Bed was very comfy We shall definately return Thank you for a wonderful stay 
208172,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Our room was at the back of the hotel The bassy noise and vibration of external cooling units was disappointing as we had been excitedly told at check in that we had been upgraded Breakfast too expensive at 25pp , Attended a wedding at the venue so made the day evening very easy Great location Staff very efficient friendly and polite Cafes nearby 
208173,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, But don t have breakfast Breakfast was a travesty we had to ask 4 or 5 times for cutlery drinks etc and they had run out of mushrooms and brown bread and had congealed under cooked bacon Every member of waiting staff just yes when we asked for anything and then never returned The chef was excellent cooking special requests to order and the food he produced was great The hotel handled the problem really well and offered a full refund of the cost of the breakfast which I did not request , The hotel is fabulous everything you could wish for and extremely helpful staff Lovely rooms comfortable beds free wifi Very easy to find I would highly recommend staying here 
208174,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Beware they may check you into their sister hotel over the road My room was located very far away from the main reception and as the hotel is like a maze it made it a trifle difficult finding everything I had to take 2 lifts to the 5 floor , The Club rooms are fantastic the hotel is very clean and up to date The tech in the rooms is fabulous would definitely recommend 
208175,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The trash mostly bottles I assume was wheeled out over cobblestone two of three nights and dumped early the next morning Also voices were amplified in that courtyard , Nice location attentive staff 
208176,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, A bar to have a drink after midnight before you retire which on a Friday night was disappointing because there wasn t one open , Staff and the manager Dorina were simply outstanding 
208177,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Full place was excellent and the Club Room was well worth the extra Nice continental breakfast and girl in Club Room very good Staff in the hotel were all very good and room was great Great idea having the free mobile in the room for use even though we didn t need The Jugged Hare was great for a drink at night and had very good Sunday lunch there We stayed over a weekend Friday to Monday and got an excellent deal due to the area being very quiet at weekends Having stayed in area before though we know the links around London are excellent and easy to anywhere from the hotel 
208178,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Could not control the a c Two light bulbs not working Long confusing walk to the room from reception , Bed very comfortable Staff welcoming and efficient Room well equipped 
208179,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, It was my husbands birthday and we where upgraded to a suite when we arrived The staff where extremely polite and helpful We have stayed there before and we will definitely stay there again when we next visit London 
208180,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Although a good location there is no tube stop in the immediate vicinity meaning you have to walk 10 mins to get anyway Unusual for a central location A little difficult to find if you don t know your way around The room service carried a hidden charge for having food brought to the room as well as a tip being added on Paid 10 06 for a plate of fries , Being shown to your room was a nice touch Well kept and quite fancy for the price Staff were friendly and it s a good price for London 
208181,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Basic amenities were too complicated there should have been instructions on how to switch on and more importantly switch off the innumerable lights in the room The shower was also over complicated ,No Positive
208182,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, On check in I asked for a quiet room but had the feeling the polite young lady on check in didn t really take any notice of my request Our room ended up being directly above the hotels own gastro pub When we arrived back the noise was intrusive but the duty manager was polite and professional and moved us to another room , Smart hotel in a great location 
208183,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Irritatingly the lights and electrics fused As a result the appliances didn t work although a maintenance guy did sort out the lights Not what you want in a hotel of this calibre,No Positive
208184,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, The staff were very welcoming friendly and helpful Our room was upgraded FOC to a Montcalm Club room as we were celebrating our minimoon complementary bottle of champagne was also given The room we stopped in was perfect couldn t fault it at all We would stop at this hotel again 
208185,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Looking at the great reviews from others it seems to be something of a lottery how your stay will go dependent on which room you re given The room we had was so small even by London standards and dark that it was difficult for two people to get ready together without bumping in to each other There was also so much stuff in the equally tiny wardrobe and bathroom already that it was actually difficult to hang anything up or put your toiletries down The water system or something similar overhead also made a considerable noise and kept me awake for part of the night The hotel is something of a maze and we managed to get lost between the room and reception twice as the signage isn t also helpful as a side note it s also a little odd that anyone can walk into the hotel bedroom corridors bypassing reception through the wide open door in the pub next door without being checked I suspect that if we d had a slightly bigger quieter room I d be giving this close to a ten However a hotel with five star aspirations really shouldn t be hit or miss in that way We tend to go back again to hotels we trust but it seems unlikely we ll visit here again The person on reception didn t ask how our stay was when we checked out so perhaps that doesn t matter , Comfy bed and 5 mins from the Barbican if you re attending something there 
208186,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Mice in the club lounge Struggled a bit with finding light switches but that s a personal thing , Loved the room and the comfy bed The little touches like bathrobes and slippers
208187,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We had to leave the hotel to walk round the corner for breakfast Not really an issue just a little odd, The gentleman that showed us to our room was extremely helpful and pleasant I mentioned it was my husband s 50 and a card and box of chocolates appeared Such a lovely touch Thank you
208188,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, No bar What hotel in this day and age has no bar You can order drinks through room service but sometimes you need a bar , Great place history and luxury smashed together to make a excellent hotel 
208189,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Shower not very powerful Noisy outside from air con loud humming noise No bottle of something or upgrade for being our anniversary , TV great Wifi great Bed great Helpful porter
208190,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, I paid for a Club Room but not sure if I got a Club Room I did not get a room marked as a Club Room and I did not get access to the hotel Club area , Clean quiet good location 
208191,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Room and bed was a little small The road outside can be very busy at rush hours as you would expect at this location , Excellent location walking distance from Barbican Centre where we had a wedding Jugged Hare was an excellent place for food for dinner as well as breakfast 
208192,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, we stayed here on the weekend and found the local area extremely quiet struggled to find restaurants etc so had to travel probably better suited to weekday business travellers staff were helpful however we felt we were being stared at spoken about behind ours backs by some staff that clearly had a snooty attitude their problem not ours didn t ruin my visit, Beautiful hotel and really comfortable rooms with lots of nice little touches such as slippers and robes and Hermes toiletries
208193,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Reception recommended I try the gastropub the Jugged Hare opposite which I did but I was disappointed Not really gastropub quality and my sirloin steak was tough with gristle as was my neighbour s who sent his back Note did not try the hotel restaurant itself Reception could be better signposted when trying to get from bedrooms back to Reception as it is something of a maze , The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet and conducive to a good night s sleep Although the fridge door was stuck open wouldn t close upon arrival the staff had it seen to quickly 
208194,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The only person who spoke passable English was the doorman The lady who greeted us at the reception was not only incredibly rude but also very unhelpful and at times hard to understand The chap who showed us to our room while very nice also did not speak a lot of English The complimentary fruit basket consisted of one pear The staff member who showed us to our room remarked upon this fact with pronounced embarrassment and promised to have it refilled immediately Sadly this solitary pear was with us for the entire duration of our three day stay It never received any fruity or other companions The complimentary bottles of mineral water were non existent Both of these water and fruit were advertised to us on numerous occasions however we never actually had the pleasure of enjoying either of them Repeated complaints to various staff members achieved nothing All in all it was not a horrible experience but one that could have been had at a much cheaper hotel with much less disappointment After all if you stay in a five star hotel you expect a certain something and that was most assuredly lacking , The internet worked very well just as internet should neither too fast nor too slow The room was clean ish The tv was of a size perfectly adequate for the size of the room There was an appropriate number of chairs for a double bedroom 
208195,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Only fault was our mini fridge door wouldn t close But nothing major , Free upgrade on arrival Excellent room beautiful building staff all helpful 
208196,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing of note , One of the quietest rooms I ve slept in for central London it was a weekend The location was great for that area to stroll around and see the sights The pub and restaurant were also very good options to die in 
208197,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Took ages to check in while the manager moved us to another room This turned out to be disabled room The room itself was fine if a little small but the bathroom was awefull Good shower but the wash basin was only 12 x 6 inches and had no mirror above This was across the other side of the room It did have a shaving mirror but this was hanging off the wall The basin was also at wheelchair height which for someone 6 foot is a little low The hotel did not seem to have a resteruant but offered room service at a very high price Staff need a lesson in how to meet and greet guests Remember who is paying the bill and its not the staff , The ambience of the hotel lobby 
208198,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The receptionist at check in was extremely miserable and made our first impression not a good one she did not explain any facilities at all to us breakfast times nothing at all we were standing at the desk for a few minutes while she was doing something on the computer and did not even acknowledge our presence or say sorry one moment please I ve worked in a 5 hotel and would get fired if my manager knew I was treating guests like that Worst of all we walked mindlessly around looking for the restaurant there was a bar restaurant next to our room but too loud for us so we went to reception to ask about the other restaurant to which the same rude receptionist said what was wrong with the other one I replied we just wanted a quiet meal We were so offended it was almost as if she didn t want us there and looked down on us Apart from that every other single member of staff we encountered was lovely and so helpful and the food was so impressive , Great facilities very clean room amazing food
208199,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Unfortunately our room overlooked the courtyard which meant that we were woken at 8am when they emptied the bottle bins every morning this took 15 minutes and we had to listen to the guests attending functions shouting until the early hours All in all not good for getting a good nights sleep , Friendly and helpful staff Comfortable bed if you could get some peace and quiet 
208200,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Went down for breakfast and there was dead game hanging in the resterant and this has put my wife and my self off staying here again sorry, We love this hotel or we did
208201,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The Bed had a roll together in the night thing I didn t complain as we were only there one night but I would not have wanted a second night , The room was lovely the The staff really great 
208202,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, There was absolutely nothing that I didn t like , The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was well appointed I had a most enjoyable stay at this impressive hotel I just wish I could have stayed for longer 
208203,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Very noisy at nighttime and curtains in room were not long enough to fully cover the windows so light came in from street lights all through the night resulting in very little sleep , Comfortable bed
208204,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The Room service staff keep getting their tea bags mixed up Menu says Camomile flowers herbal infusion and I keep getting a basic camomile tea bag Has happened twice now Just frustrating as it s on their menu , Great location for Shoreditch Old Street
208205,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, It was difficult to locate at first and the room service mini bar was a little over priced , I loved the little gifts they gave us for our anniversary 
208206,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Breakfast was a bit average for the price maybe not worth having it at the hotel I would have liked coffee to be more available during breakfast Clearly they did not understand the concept of caffeine addiction , Great location Close to Liverpool station where London Stansted Express arrives from the airport Easy to walk to two other subway stations that serve a number of convenient lines Great staff Great toiletries I was extra psyched about a cellphone to use during my stay for GPS and phone calls to US As well as about the fruit that greeted me in my room Nice beds 24 hour room service and concierge 
208207,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Room too light due to outside spotlight near window , Room a bit light with spotlight outside but generally a good standard hotel Water in reception a nice touch 
208208,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Breakfast is expensive at 25 , Initially had a problem with our room but it was quickly rectified and we were upgraded to a superior room Excellent service by the staff 
208209,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Aircon wasn t working properly very soft bed , Great location next door to the Barbican lovely old brewery buildings some rooms are a long way from reception like ours you have to use two lifts over a bridge around the corner etc Full satellite TV package great rainfall shower 
208210,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The bed whist okay was not a super king size most hotels now have beds that my feet stay in 6 7 tall , Clean rooms we had three all good Nothing was too much trouble for the staff We left our luggage there until 17 30 no problem 
208211,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The hotel is an old Brewery and as such it can be a bit of a trek to get to your room especially when the lift is not working , Very central for the City of London and for attractions such as the Museum of London and St Pauls Fantastic property comfortable room and very helpful staff 
208212,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, When booking the hotel make it very difficult to book with a company card when I asked to do this I was to provide a whole host of private information and after this was sent they did not fulfill the wish to pay with the card and charged the traveller instead When asked about this there was little acknowledgement of the inconvenience caused and when they finally responded they barely apologised and just signed off with the barest of responses Too expensive a place to stay considering the fallow customer service experience Very disappointed but sadly all to common in such places , The location
208213,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, I booked for my son and his girlfriend and thought the deal price was excellent for the location and so did they I know they were happy with everything 
208214,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing , Fantastic club room and extra facilities friendly staff and nice touches given to us as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary Will definitely return 
208215,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, To ensure value for money I would have expected other services available such as a Spa The shower drain appeared blocked and as such water was all over bathroom floor The room was noisy until quite late as overlooking their event venue with a wedding on that day Fantastic breakfast but don t book via hotel as they appeared to accept walk in for much cheaper prices , Friendly and efficient staff nice old building as old brewery and good deco great location and very comfy bed Great gastro pub next door with amazing food which also provides breakfast
208216,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Perfect location for Liverpool Street station and central London Bed was incredibly comfortable had a great night s sleep Staff on reception were lovely as were housekeeping when I left a dress behind 
208217,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Yes there was a few small issues the vanity mirror in the bathroom wasn t working We did report this But it still was not working when we left You do get complimentary water but they do not replace it if you drink it on the first night We stay in hotels across the world and all 5 star hotels do not quibble about complimentary water There were also some issues with some of the furnishings the glass table in the bedroom had clearly been broken in the past and had been repaired badly also the toiletries shelf in the bathroom was loose , We have just left this hotel after a fantastic city break From the moment you walk through the doors you are greeted with a warm welcome from the porters to reception which was a quick and easy process The porter then took us to our room Yes the hotel is split into all different levels but that gives the place some character We stayed in a montecalm club room which was very spacious Breakfast is served at the gastro bar attached to the hotel called the jugged Hare Breakfast was good with a good selection The only warning I would say is that it gets very busy and cramped on a Monday morning due to all the City workers having breakfast So get there after 9am I am finding it difficult to rate this as 5 star due to the issues that we incurred It sits between 4 and 5 stars it just lacks the final Polish and finesse 
208218,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, A little bit noisy from the road below, The room was large and comfortable with an excellent bathroom and shower Also very handy for the Barbican Smithfields area The attached restaurant the Jugged Hare is excellent with the best Chicken Caesar salad ever 
208219,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, I liked the location and how close to Liverpool Street we were Rooms were perfect and the hotel was genuinely quiet All staff were very polite and helpful 
208220,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Couldn t get Air Con working so room was very hot We only found this out during the night but i m sure the staff would have had this sorted out if we had asked , The extras in the room were a big surprise and made this hotel stand out from many others we have stayed in
208221,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, room size was very small bathroom Bath room very small would not take 2 people at a time Booking com said we booked a deluxe room but hotel Said it was stander double Who is to blame , area was good for getting about london
208222,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Absolutely nothing , Fantastic place plush great staff quality fit out Just a 5 minute walk to underground Also the Jugged Hare pub is part of the establishment which had a great ambience Took heed of another reviewer and asked for the east wing The building was once a brewery 300 years old completely refurbished but the numbered rooms don t necessarily follow 
208223,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Great building A little challenging to find one s way around but excellent staff always helped Lovely room with lots of amenities Great bar restaurant downstairs 
208224,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Rooms could be a little nicer the bathrooms are beautiful but felt like the room decor wasn t very 5 , The hotel is stunning in a great location and the Jugged Hare on the corner is fab too Staff let us check in with no problems a little early so we could drop off our bags and get freshened up 
208225,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Bed too soft and in need of a new mattress as both rolled into middle of bed or off the edge No proper window therefore no fresh air Would prefer to upgrade to a room with a window in future if an upgrade gives daylight , Staff so friendly and helpful Room so full of extra touches and exceptionally clean 
208226,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Wifi could have been better, Really helpful and friendly staff Free upgrade Wonderfully comfy bed and quick efficient room service with delicious food
208227,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, There are a lot of miscommunication The room was too small and i don t feel like staying at 5 star hotel I booked for 2 people but found only one dressing gown We asked the staff to come and pick up the plate after we ate the food in the morning and had to explain why Well the room was too small and we don t have enough space to walk I came back home and my passport disappeared so I tried to call the hotel many times at 9 30 am and no one pick up the phone , We ordered a burger and it was really tasty The hotel provided a smartphone with free internet and free phone call which is very useful 
208228,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Within three weeks I used this hotel twice the first time the room they gave is very small but the second time it is bigger and comfortable than previous one However the hotel is very very good hotel , location is very good Room is clean the bed is comfortable Check in and check out is very fast 
208229,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Hotel is a warren so be careful which room you get allocated especially if you have luggage You can go up and downstarirs several times Some of the rooms have small windows which make them appear dingy Awkward to unload vehicles if travelling with luggage, Location the upgrades of rooms friendliness of staff Nearness to The Brewery where we were for a function
208230,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, not really 5 star no bar area bar closed by midnight rooms good if not distinguised Almost impossible labyrinth of rooms still a good stop in the heart of the city if the price is right , excellent staff on arrival very helpful
208231,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, No sound proofing with the connecting door to next room which meant that I had to listen to 3 sessions of love making and could hear every word of the talk between next door couple ,No Positive
208232,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The room was really quite small especially for a Club room with no view whatsoever and as with so many hotel rooms gloomy , We had an upgrade to a club room which was appreciated but see the flip side to this 
208233,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, my only complaint is the cost of the products on the mini bar were very very expensive 5 75 for some peanuts , Everything was excellent the room was spacious and the bed comfortable and it was great ot have a resturant next door whic hwas excellent to
208234,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The room not being serviced whilst we were out of the room for a four hour period in the middle of the day despite leaving the electronic please clean my room sign illuminated, Excellent front of house ambience around reception where staff are on hand to assist
208235,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, There were some issues with our room On that basis we would not rate the standard of the room as 5 on that occasion , Attractive hotel Friendly professional staff 
208236,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Awful service we complained about a leak in our room twice and nothing was done about it Paint was scratching off zero view directly facing a brick wall , Well located hotel
208237,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, At breakfast the tea cup was quite small and I kept having to ask for a refill , The minute I walked into this hotel I was made to feel special and welcome The staff were fantastic The room was beautiful and quite spacious for London and I particularly liked the free fruit and water in the room Breakfast at the pub down the road was also great awesome bacon 
208238,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The staff in The restaurant need more encouragement by their manager They were tired and a bit lost , Really fantastic staff confy beds good food and excellent service Good location j
208239,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Constant aircirculation noise that cant be turned off Moved rooms and was just as noisy Really crap sleep Not worth the money compared to other places you could stay , The staff were helpful
208240,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Room was much smaller then expected could do with a lick of paint Reduced price advertised on Booking com is clearly standard room rate would be upset if I had paid several hundred pounds for the room , Staff were very attentive Good location 
208241,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, I had booked two rooms for us and our daughter who arrived later on the 12th August and left on the 14th I paid for both rooms in full on arrival and yet when my daughter arrived she was charged again before she could gain access to the room It was rectified the following morning but it was annoying When we checked out on the 15th I was told that I hadn t paid for breakfast for our room although I paid for everything on arrival I had to go back to Reception when we collected our bags as it was going to be investigated further Again it was rectified and I was told there was nothing further to pay but it was annoying and inefficient The Reception staff are lovely but the administration seems muddled The coffee at breakfast in the Jugged Hare was always cold horrible , Location is great and it s an interesting building Staff all friendly and polite Breakfast excellent apart from the old coffee 
208242,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing, Type of traveller categories needs more flexibility see the answer I was forced to offer The closest response was Group of Friends None of your categories allowed for the nuance of my visit I was travelling with my son to celebrate my 70th and his 30th birthdays Apart from this no complaints This was my third visit Twice booked by myself and once by my partner Gill Thackray and as ever an excellent experience all round The Jugged Hare excellent also whether simply for a drink at the bar or really good food in the restaurant 
208243,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, At breakfast in the club lounge on Sunday and Monday was a little disappointing Firstly the member of staff was a bit abrupt and we had to ask for hot drinks Also there were no yoghurt and considering this was a continental breakfast I found that a little upsettin , Our booking had been incorrect and the manager upgraded us to a club room Most staff were really pleasant and accommodating 
208244,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Moved rooms 3 times trouble with bath and lighting no electric points in 028 had to use extension lead and room maids not speaking english one really serious issue needs addressing the sauna spa in the dungeon its steep going down wasnt supervised i slipped and pulled emergency cord nobody came i was scared having just been in hospital Overall it was nice but needs to tweak things i see everyone putting 10 for a score but sadly my expectations are of a high standard for personal reasons , Certain aspects of the rooms as it s not really a hotel and some nice staff loved the four poster bed 
208245,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, My only problem was finding my room after going out , The staff went out of their way to be helpful sociable courteous The variety at breakfast was excellent The food at The Jugged Hare was delicious 
208246,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, the fact that you have to cross the hotel y outside in order to get to the sauna and steam room There was no lockers while you are in this facility, Staff friendly Room good size
208247,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing Just the fact that Booking seems to have a bit of an issue with the reservation of breakfast it happened to us with another hotel too but that is not the hotel s fault but Booking s , This hotel is in a very central location having quick connections to both King s Cross and Liverpool Street Stations It offers a very comfortable accommodation experience as well as an outstanding breakfast Staff are extremely welcoming and helpful The rooms are well maintained clean and provide good isolation from external noises We appreciate the fact that the hotel puts a lot of thought into making each stay an enjoyable experience for all guests An example of this is the complimentary smartphone available in the room during the stay with plenty of useful touristic information 
208248,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing, Everything Fresh fruit in room a lovely touch Hermes toiletries delightful Mini bar well stocked and not unreasonable prices Decor very pleasing Location ideal for Barbican centre Staff friendly and very helpful 
208249,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, A C didnt work most nights, Great staff very comfortable bed Stay in East Wing if you dont want to take 2 lifts and go through a convoluted maze of corridors 
208250,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, 1 Staff sat on stair eating their breakfast as guest pass by 2 Breakfast being in a nearby pub not being told before booking that was the case and then having booked being told we had not paid when sat in the pub awful Poorly handled and we left 3 Communication is everything and much is lost in translation when there is a language barrier suggest you get some indigenous staff Pl saw don t take that the wrong way but it made everything hard work , Breakfast is a pub around the corner Beware in the event you are not in the list you will be ejected appalling 
208251,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, It was quite a trek from reception to our room however this is not really a criticism being part of the layout of the charming old building and the location of the room was very quiet with a lovely view of the courtyard , The room was extremely comfortable the flowers and chocolates I d requested were waiting in the room on arrival and staff couldn t have been more helpful It was our 40th anniversary and we were given a complimentary upgrade and staff had noted our celebration and welcomed us Even without the upgrade the price inclusive of breakfast was one of the best I ve found in London at a luxury hotel I wish I could breakfast in The Jugged Hare every day The hotel made our weekend away one to remember I m sure we ll return 
208252,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The shower head would not extend and kept slipping down The location Is Not great for sightseeing faraway from underground, The Bed is huge and so comfortable the room is nicely furnished in keeping with the style of the building Great value at weekends
208253,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Breakfast is overpriced for what is on offer For that price I would expect made to order rather than mass produced buffet , Montcalm at the Brewery is a terrific location for Central London Rooms are good service is good and the bar on the corner has a good atmosphere
208254,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, I stay in a lot of hotels in London From the moment I got there to the mimute we left the staff were exceptional The service is second to none The price does not reflect the standard or the facilities Very pleased and I will definitely be staying again No where competes Very cost effective if your looking for a quality hotel great facilities at a great price 
208255,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Our room also faced the inside courtyard area where there were floodlights on 24 7 Even the thick curtains weren t enough to darken the room I would suggest they turn them off or use dimmer lights at night so light sleepers can doze off more easily They also have a marquee set up in the courtyard for events but I guess the guests were moved inside later in the evening so it was still quiet , All staff are really helpful and friendly The room we had was very small but comfortable and stylishly furnished and didn t feel generic The whole hotel has a nice boutique feel Great central location too although not the most charming location being in the business district 
208256,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Paid 36 for a Rib of been with hand cut chips Beef wasn t nice and should of been for that price also not hand cut chips they were frozen On departure reception tried saying I owed 59 VAT on the room as they didn t take for it when checked in was about to pay it and checked the price id be quoted and id paid the VAT already , Rooms are incredible beds are so comfy 
208257,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Double glazing for front facing road facing rooms to ensure less noise could do with bottle water free in room and more bathroom hooks, Big large comfy beds lovely large bathroom in the clubroom with Nespresso machines to use 
208258,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing , Staff were wonderful during the entire stay The hotel is in a very interesting part of London with some great pubs and eateries nearby The Jagged Hare part of the hotel is worth a visit Our room was lovely and quiet the beds awesome felt like the princess and pea Perfect for a London break will happily return 
208259,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The air con system was broken in the room and rattled all night as well as the bins being dragged down the cobbled street outside our room at 3am consequently didn t get a lot of sleep , The staff were helpful and the room was ample 
208260,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, I was charged 94 for breakfast for my partner and I when we were offered this as complimentary for my partners birthday at check in Only after we ordered and ate the breakfast we were informed the offer only extended to the continental breakfast 94 was utterly ridiculous we would not have bothered had we have known, The location and cleanliness were excellent
208261,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Everything We came here for our 10 year anniversary The staff are lovely food great and the location you couldn t fault I ll definitely be back Thank you for a wonderful weekend in London 
208262,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Price could be a little better but we were happy to pay the price , The staff were very welcoming and attentive The hotel did a night visit to the rooms to prepare beds for the visitors The hotel is also 2 minutes walk from a Tescos which is great if you need drinks or snacks There are many restaurants near by and the underground was 5 minutes walk away 
208263,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The please clean sign on the door didn t work so we had to ask them to come and clean the room whilst we were out in the evening They were very apologetic and the room was cleaned perfectly they also left extra coffee for me which was most welcome , Lovely room and super comfortable bed 
208264,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing to complain about , Reception staff were beyond 5 star Couldn t fault anything about our stay I had emailed ahead to mention it was my husband s birthday To our amazement we were upgraded as were the other two rooms for our offspring and their partners and there was even a bottle of champagne in our room when we arrived We would have no hesitation whatsoever in staying at this hotel again 
208265,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing at all Except some sqeeky chair in the room , The most comfortable bed plus the anmeties are incredible The best part is the staff extremely kind and lovely 
208266,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The only point of criticism is that it s not clear where breakfast is served also depending on what breakfast you have We were constantly pointed back to the entrance of the hotel on your left hand side but what they should say is that breakfast is served in the pub next door , Quaint hotel with excellent rooms bed mattress pillows of high quality modern bathroom with rain shower Egyptian cotton wool towels Breakfast buffet is excellent with a wide variety of choice 
208267,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, A warm welcome was received when we arrived at hotel and check in smooth Our friends had arrived a day earlier and the hotel overheard them say it was my birthday When we got to our room we d been upgraded to a wow suite which was beautiful The staff were very helpful with any queries or questions we had 
208268,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Shower in the bath off centre average flow glass screen was too short so floor got wet, Clean comfortable and stylish rooms Air conditioning Friendly staff Excellent cocktails in bar Free mobile phone to use around London
208269,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, A very nice hotel Good service excelent room and bed Recomand to eat and drink on The Jugged Hare gastro pub in the same bulding as the hotel Excelent food 
208270,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Air con made a really loud noise at 2am waking us up We had to turn it off Serious amount of steps to get to the room with luggage , Great location Lovely room 
208271,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Got lost finding the room though can t change the building Also couldn t figure how to turn off all the lights took the card out in the end , Location room staff
208272,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, I could only choose this hotel because the room was on offer 200 night is max budget on business I squeezed a little more to benefit from this offer 
208273,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Feeling second class, Very clean and smart felt like we had been put into one of their smallest rooms because we paid a discounted price also room did not look like the advertised room on your booking form although it was also in the same colours The room was part of the next doors suite in the morning I was over come by the smell of aftershave almost to the point of an asthma attack from a nearby room It was peaceful and staff welcoming I do not believe we booked the bargain I was led to believe
208274,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, THe hotel is more or less in the square mile so very quiet in the surrounding areas at the weekened which meant a little travel to find somewhere to eat but don t let that put you off the hotel has great food , A fabulous hotel with excellent staff from reception to porter and everyone in between Amazing beds and pillows just what you need after a long hard days sightseeing and shopping
208275,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Accommodation on 4th floor and for 3 days lift out of action dinner reservations not made fire alarm at 1 30am and staff unhelpful as to why it is on only the 4th floor List was endless Will not be staying here again , Rooms very clean 
208276,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, 1 Complementary water was not restored for the second night 2 Checking in could be faster It seemed the receptionist was trying to practice her Chinese with me I was fine with that but I do not think every customer would find that efficiency enjoyable 3 A false fire alarm went off at 1 00 a m one night but no apology was delivered later 4 A lady with an exotic accent knocked on my door one night asking do you need any sleep service which did not sound very wholesome to me so I was shocked at first but later I learned she just wanted to help make my bed so I would friendly suggest better language drills be located in the hotel , 1 Breakfast and room service was amazing a bit pricey though 2 Staff were very friendly and helpful 3 They were generous in providing complementary kits 4 I left my passport in the room and it was really appreciable that the staff let me go inside the room again after my check out to look for it and I found it 
208277,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Why do hotels need to have complex bath shower operation All I want is either a simple shower or bath but to be faced with working through the operation options when somewhat tired isn t always appreciated, Very good value
208278,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, used multiple times because of the location but the room has never been clean once Because of the extremely compliated layout of the wings of the building floors and rooms if there were a fire there should be many casualities ,No Positive
208279,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Bit of a maze inside and a little dated needs a lick of paint and more attention to the small details For instance in our room the window might as well have not been there as it was very thin and there were gaps where you could feel the wind coming through just get double glazing And stuff like the curtains not going far enough to cover the window or plonking a big out of date radio next to the bed that didn t even work properly Also we were a little bit angry when the breakfast staff started clearing up and laying dinner service while we were still eating our breakfast And we weren t slow eaters but felt rushed and in the way which for a 5 star hotel is actually horrendous Please don t get me wrong though it was a lovely place to stay it just needs somebody to go through it and sort out the little things that are either unnecessary or impractical And for the kitchen and dining staff to show a little more respect for their guests , Nice people nice rooms and good food Location was quite good as well
208280,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The only one thing negative I have to say is that 24 95 for a continental breakfast is very expensive , Very welcoming very helpful staff friendly The hotel is fantastic all the facilities are first class rooms are fabulous Every night when we came back to our room the maid had turned our bed down and left chocolates on our pillows the beds are very comfortable and there was no noise from other guest in the hotel 
208281,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, There is nothing not to like here , The team were fantastic We stayed here on our wedding night last year and wouldn t have chosen to stay anywhere else to celebrate our first year of marriage this year Look forward to staying again next year for the 2nd year anniversary 
208282,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Had to go to separate building for breakfast not nice if raining I had noisy function in greenhouse that was situated under my room , Clean comfortable and breakfast good
208283,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, The Montcalm At Brewery London City is a wonderful place to stay in London It stands out from the crowds of luxury hotels with the exceptional service absolutely amazing staff and the attention to details I have had an opportunity to travel and stay in some of the best hotels in the world and my stay at the Montcalm At Brewery London City is one of the most memorable My trip to London was for my mother s Birthday celebration it was her first time visiting London and the Assistant Manager of the Montcalm Daisy Slavkova made sure that this was a really trip to remember If you want to experience first class hospitality do not hesitate to book this hotel the staff really goes out of their way to make you feel comfortable and welcomed 
208284,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The cups sorcers designed for right handed users only unstable and far too small , The staff are very helpful Enjoyed using the spacious shower room with facilities for disabled users 
208285,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The courtyard is lovely though it would have been nice if it had actually been possible to have drinks in the marquees set up there They must be reserved for special events The only criticisms I have of our stay are that the walls are a bit thin so when the other guests came in around 1am on both nights we could clearly hear the closet doors and the sound of conversation Also our room had only one bath towel which we only realised after emerging from the shower and there was no bottle opener or corkscrew for the minibar The free bottle of water and the evening chocolates were appreciated but we only had them on the night of our arrival I rather expected that these would be there on the second night as well All minor points , The Montcalm at the Brewery is as the name would suggest in the old Whitbread Brewery right beside the Barbican The building reflects its history and is quirky and stylish Our room 403 was smallish but had most everything you would need including slippers and robe though there was only one robe when we checked in It was on the 4th top floor with only two other rooms in the wing and had a small window overlooking the courtyrard and the gilded weathervane and clock from the brewery days The rooms comes with a smart phone that can be used for touring the city and making free phone calls I didn t use this but it is a nice touch Overall it is good value for London convenient to the Underground and a well appointed and pleasant place to stay and I would certainly return 
208286,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing , The staff couldn t possibly have been more accommodating given that my husband and I were travelling with our newborn baby We were offered help getting our daughter s pram in and out I never had to battle opening doors because the staff were totally on the ball and everyone greeted us with smiles We were upgraded to a suite in their apartments over the road from the main hotel because it would be a quieter room for us and the baby which was lovely of them The room was superb I wanted to take the bed home with me everything was immaculately clean the shower was great and we wanted for nothing in the room regarding facilities A fantastic stay for a very reasonable price by London standards and I would go back should I be working in or visiting the area again 
208287,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, i was given a room with NO WINDOWS Tiny room with tiny bed and no windows Really strange having no natural daylight but having instead a window to the bathroom Wall that divided the bathroom from the room was clear glass , location was right by where we needed to be and tbh it was the only thing going for it
208288,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, There was some rubbish under the bed and the grouting in the tiles was missing We didn t really enjoy the meal in the hotel and it seemed very expensive compared to local restaurants , the location was amazing and the staff were really helpful 
208289,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Lots of great additions to the room such as a steam free mirror in the bathroom to a docking station to play your music Beds extremely comfortable too 
208290,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Walk to the room is little far from reception but is still easy to find and not really a problem at all Parking is in nearby carpark and is quite expensive typical london prices , Comfortable beds Large room Great bathroom with a cool glass wall to the bedroom which also closes with an electric blind 
208291,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, D cor in places looking a little worn, Fantastic old brewery staff very friendly would have liked to have more time to look around the building and joining restaurant and pub will return
208292,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, phenomenal service made the experience memorable I was there to propose to my partner and they did everything possible to make it a special occasion Amazing staff the best room I have ever stayed in and an all round phenomenal experience Second time I have stayed here and I would only stay here when coming to London 
208293,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We had a room as were attending a wedding at the hotel The only issue is that the room they put us in was in the south building I think and as the hotel is converted from its previous use access was not very straightforward especially with a pram But very helpful staff lovely hotel and the wedding venue was stunning , Good location helpful staff and lovely decor 
208294,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Had to leave the hotel and go next door to the pub for breakfast Bed seemed a bit small , Bed was comfy Staff were very helpful and friendly Breakfast was nice

208297,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Room was quite small Perfect for 1 person not much space or storage for 2 There were also a couple of things in the room that could have been attended to pen on the curtains a frayed desk chair and the bath tap came off in my hands We received a bottle of water fresh fruit on arrival staying for 2 days i felt that could have been refreshed on day 2 , Staying in the City at weekend mean t peace and quiet around the hotel Only a 5 minute walk to the tube to get to the livelier parts of London Great staff very helpful Beautiful setting 
208298,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, It was crazy high to climb into Being vertically challenged didn t help but it has never really been a problem before , The bed was super comfy but 
208299,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, A bit noisy ventilation Breakfast is expensive , Nice authentic hotel at the old brewery building Good location if you have meetings in City Friendly staff Small nice things water small chocolate 
208300,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, nothing, The complimentary phone was one of the best surprises I ve had in a hotel You could make calls and take it with you to use Google maps Great idea 
208301,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Not having to have breakfast in a pub Abit poor for standard of rest of hotel , The club room that we got upgraded to was very tiny but the bed was lovely and comfy 
208302,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, External noise waste deliveries early in morning The Windows didn t seem to block noise out too well , Staff were always cheerful and seemed happy with their work Room was excellent very modern bed very comfortable rain shower brilliant 
208303,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, I took my partner here for his 30th birthday and would highly recommend the hotel the service is excellent the staff are friendly and eager to accommodate you in any way they can The d cor is beautiful the food s delicious and the beds are incredibly comfy The location of the hotel was perfect for where we wanted to go while in London with the tube station a short 3 minute walk away 
208304,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Very small room poorly furnished Lots of noise from outside Communication with some of the evening staff was a struggle They were generally less helpful than the daytime staff , The building itself is very attractive as are many of the communal areas bar reception etc Most of the daytime staff were friendly and competent 
208305,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Room layout a bit strange due to an old building Quite small room for a 5 star, Very friendly staff good location between 2 Underground station Nice restaurants just around the corner Jugged Hare C te

208307,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We had to change room since the first one was a bit noisy but this was done easily and smoothly, Excellent service both front desk and room Very kind and helpful
208308,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We were handed a device by a member of staff at our door to use for finding places but our room had knowhere to dock it like our friends did which meant it was useless as it had no power to switch on, Rooms were great size comfy bed great shower staff were very helpful
208309,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The room bed bathroom were a lot smaller than expected The room was also very dark The bath plughole was broken tv remote was not working batteries lights were hard to turn off , Location building staff breakfast all excellent 
208310,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The hotel doesn t really have a 5 star feel But London hotels are always expensive for what you get , Good location near tube stop Friendly service 
208311,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, no towelling robe gym poor but I was lucky and went when empty need a stepper, loved the little extras in the room smart phone even though didn t use nice villeroy bosch spelt wrong cups nice green teas loads of towels 
208312,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The only thing that would have made it a 10 instead of a 9 5 for us was the size of the room While every room has every amenity some of them are small While we didn t spend alot of time in our room because it is London after all we would have liked more space for our luggage, Fabulous facility Amazing welcome from the staff Lots of extra touches such as fruit water and coffee available on arrival Beautiful building and decor Rooms had everything one could possibly need Very modern but cozy Lovely linens care products and bed comfort Easy to get around from nearby tube station Excellent price too 
208313,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing everything was Fabulous , From the moment we entered the staff couldn t be more helpful Very attentive lovely decor Can t wait to return 
208314,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Paid for buffet breakfast at discounted rate which was great but wish we had known we could have just ordered off the al a carte menu as I love eggs benedict This is just a tiny tiny issue , Attention to detail was second to none From the concierge welcome on arrival to the rooms themselves everything was worthy of the 5 star rating 
208315,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, The traditional English breakfast in the Jugged Hare was a delicious way to start the day We enjoyed the the club room for a drink and snack between our day of touring and heading out for the evening Staff was nicely attentive and helpful Location is close to 2 Tube stops making touring simple 
208316,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Confusion booking in and out We booked an extra night took ages to explain when checking in told she understood the following day after going out and returning with bags found we were locked out of the room another long explanation and again on check out Rooms are small the chair at the desk is too big smaller ones would help Breakfast really expensive and need to go next door Restaurant next door closes at the weekend so the pub is the only option , The bed is to die for really comfortable Lovely luxury items dressing gowns and slippers provided Second night the staff had placed fruit in our room Although there was no bar in the hotel the fridge was well stocked an very reasonably priced So good for parking and round the corner from the Barbican Centre 10 minute walk to St Pauls 
208317,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, No bar It would be nice to have a lounge bar to meet up and for a nightcap , Staff fantastic very helpful Stored our cases on arrival and departure so we could extend our days 
208318,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The whole hotel had the feel of somewhere that had been given a cheap makeover to make it look more expensive that it was There was poor attention to detail e g on arrival in room we found the fabric on the desk chair to be ripped evidence of poor quality repairs in bathroom The classic double was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in made worse by the tiny windows situated high up the wall The hotel is a labyrinth and guests are provided with a poorly designed map to navigate ,No Positive
208319,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Our room was on the small side and didn t have any natural light The window looked straight onto a wall, Great location for the Barbican which is why we made the reservation Not so good for the west end

208321,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Room little smaller than expected Breakfast was very noisy like a street cafe not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel If we stay again I sure we will deffo opt for the club room breakfast , Good location staff couldn t do enough for us able to get our room before lunch facilities great If not staying in club room would not recommend adding breakfast 
208322,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The room Visited twice before but never stayed in the south building and I am will never stay in the south again, Dear location and staff always friendly
208323,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, We stayed room only which was very comfortable quiet with excellent en suite facilities We liked the location close to Barbican and Moorgate tube stations we also enjoyed the fact that it is in the financial district at the weekend and found it amazingly quiet The Jugged Hare restaurant was very good if a little expensive All the staff were excellent 
208324,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, I informed the hotel that we were staying for a particular occasion my partners 23rd birthday on arrival they upgraded us to the club room and in the room there were balloons and the number 23 written with rose petals on the bed It was a lovely touch and would 100 recommend 
208325,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Room was on the main road and curtains didn t really cut out external lighting Single glazed windows also allowed intrusive noise late on , A very enjoyable experience from start to finish 
208326,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Had to get in the bath to start the shower or run the bath The prepaid breakfast was poor value Would have been better off to order off menu , The beds were super comfy Hotel had a great style Staff were very helpful

208331,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, We had at first a room which was directing to the courtyard It was a bit dark and noisy due to the AC ventilators and you couldn t open the windows I like to sleep with open windows We asked if it would be possible to change the room and the very friendly lady at the reception checked with the manager and gave us another one which was bright calm and friendly Before we left the hotel the manager enquired about the problems we had with the other room Very delightful experience Would definetely come again 
208332,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Did seem to be like a maze with endless corridors and difficult to find your way around but not too critical for me sauna not that good , Very friendly staff great central location great facilities liked the steam room bed just right with fluffy pillows very quiet inside the room excellent hot hand held and rainfall showers with all accessories included Did not need it but did have iron hair dryer free tea coffee with kettle and a bottle of water with 3 shiny apples absolutely wonderful stay very good value for money and Vlad at the door with his bowler hat and suit really topped it off with his affable and friendly manner total joy recommended

208334,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, 50 extra added to the room bill in case of any damage I wasn t aware of this but understand the policy Reimbursed once you check out So this is knitt picking , The staff made sure we had an excellent stay and were so accommodating after I told them that our stay was part of a surprise for my girlfriend s birthday They organised some champagne to be sent to the room which was a really nice touch Staff were very helpful when asking for directions and recommendations also Great breakfast in the pub next door included in the price Check out is not until 12pm and breakfast is served until 11am which gives you time to organise your morning day 
208335,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, There wasn t anything not to like Maybe a map of the hotel as hard to find room without assistance, The room was beautiful the bed very comfortable and the staff were helpful and attentive
208336,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Complete nightmare trying to find your room It is a complete rabbit warren At one point I just wanted to find a phone ring reception and ask them to come find me and take me to my room I am staying again in a couple of weeks and have asked for a room on the first floor of the main building Guy was very lovely and took note of my request , Beautiful building and lovely staff Good location for Barbican where I was on a training course 
208337,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Online customer service should be vastly improved Emailed requesting table reservations in the 2 associated restaurants on seperate nights Received an email back basically saying book them yourself, Staff in the hotel were very welcoming and helpful Nice quiet location with nearby tube Both restaurants were of a good standard 
208338,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, A stylish hotel with comfortable beds and very helpful staff A bit pricy if you have to pay the full rate so look out for promotions If you don t want the hotel breakfast there s a Pret a Manger just down the road note that it s not open on Sundays 
208339,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The bed in the Club Room was very small In fact my husband and I woke up a lot during the night as it was just too small for us both it was a small double Too many light switches in room I nearly got smacked in the face by the doorman who slammed the door in my face , The hotel was beautiful Great complimentary breakfast and drinks in the club room 
208340,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We didn t like the fact that the rooms are small and cluttered with plenty of things we don t need There is no space to put our clothes or computers Too many things in a very small space Uncomfortable bed and too high Not a good sound insulation We could hear people pass in the corridor at night and also outside on the street , We liked the location 15 minute walk to the city 30 minutes to Islington 2 tube stations close by 
208341,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, All members of staff were friendly and efficient The room was clean the bed extremely comfortable and there was a nice range of Elemis toiletries in the bathroom We were pleasantly surprised to find at night that the bed had been turned down chocolates were placed on the pillows and a bowl of fruit had been left for us We had a lovely stay at this hotel 
208342,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Room was ground floor 029 overlooking the street Old sash Windows meant it was freezing in the bathroom and very noisy I woke up early to what sounded like people next to the bed they were on the street walking past, Lovely staff
208343,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, There was absolutly nothing that i would say was a let down at this hotel , This is the best ever hotel i have ever stayed in The staff were absolutly brilliant This is how customer service should be An amazing gem of a hotel This is how it should be done Pure bliss 
208344,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, In order to charge our mobile phones overnight we had to keep the key card in place to ensure a flow of electricity to the room Unfortunately this meant that we couldn t switch off the light above the tea coffee making section We also felt it was dangerous to not have any lights on at all if you needed to get up in the night Also although the pillows were changed to non feather pillow they were rock hard and very uncomfortable We hardly slept due to the light being continually on and the rock hard pillows Breakfast was very over priced as you couldn t have a small breakfast like coffee toast without paying an excessive amount we bought fresh croissants from Tesco around the corner instead , The Reception staff were very pleasant
208345,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, All was perfect, Told staff before arrival that it was a surprise trip for my partners birthday they put champagne and chocolates in the room with a birthday message and balloons on the bed Wonderful service 
208346,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Had a club room that was really quite small previously stayed in a club room that was twice the size , Very luxurious hotel Large comfortable beds Staff very helpful Breakfasts amazing 
208347,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The location is in the city so for leisure not really convenient But we knew and we choose it due to the great value of the room Also it s an old building so it has long and winding corridors and lots of stairs in unexpected places , The room was big enough the bathroom was amazing the bed was extremelly comfy the services top notch and the staff amazing
208348,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Our room which was not the cheapest available had a bizarre bathroom with a tiny cloakroom style sink It was thoroughly uncomfortable , Great staff Good location
208349,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Really small bedroom everything was crowded not even space for small suitcase Lots of walking around complicated buildings Lots of steps , Comfy bed Powerful shower Complimentary water 
208350,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing, All the facilities in the room were excellent and the bed was very comfortable as well Due to twins celebrating a 21st birthday the rooms had been decorated beautifully with balloons and petals what a lovely touch 
208351,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Requested on booking and early check in for a room in quiet area Was provided a room in separate building over looking road so there was traffic noise Air conditioning in room was too hot and many attempts to reduce temperature failed Had to open window to reduce temp so road noise interumpted sleep When using shower water poured through ceiling light fitting next to shower Very dangerous as possibility of electric shock as had to walk through pouring water and large puddle to get out of bathroom It took over 25 mins for anything to be organised by hotel staff for me to use another rooms shower Very poor communication This made me very late in my schedule so demanded a taxi to take me to my appointment which the hotel paid for something I guess No reduction of room rate to compensate for inconvenience , Pretty standard hotel room Bed was comfortable 
208352,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The bed could ve been slightly larger The staff could ve had a better idea of the location of the rooms the shaving mirror light could ve worked , Nice features in the room coffee machine umbrella the mobile phone etc Friendly staff
208353,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The only thing missing was a view nothing they can do about that otherwise a very good hotel , The staff were exceptional every one we met and we met quite a few were helpful and friendly they make the hotel special Comfortable room Good breakfast The club lounge was excellent Provided plenty of milk with of tea coffee in the room which was refreshing 
208354,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, No on site parking but at weekends you can park on single yellow lines so no issue for us, Superb rooms and hotel Free mobile phone and wifi Free international and local calls Free fruit Super bed and bath Great staff
208355,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We requested a quiet room and were placed away from the road which was great However what we didn t notice when we arrived but did when we were trying to get to sleep was that there were people continuously moving about above room 235 floor 2 all night There are no rooms available on this floor so presumably it was the staff It was noticeable enough to delay getting to sleep and to wake you up again during the night , The rooms were spotless cleaned throughout the duration of our stay one night which we weren t expecting The mini bar was well stocked and refilled and the room was extremely well equipped with everything you could possibly need 
208356,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The hotel is huge confusing with long corridors on different levels and the signs are misleading signs to lifts and reception lead nowhere It is impossible to find your way around Several staff members agreed but said there was nothing they could do The bathroom fittings are broken and the hot water system so complex it is impossible to use When I asked staff if they enjoyed working there they said no the hours are long and the pay is poor , Staff were helpful
208357,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Reception wanted to relocate us to a sister hotel upon check in selling it as an upgrade but also suggesting we didn t have a choice Confusion about the booking type of room breakfast included yes no but everything was solved fine eventually , Very good hotel situated in an old brewery at an excellent location Perfect breakfast at The Jugged Hare Value for money thanks to the significant discount during the weekend 
208358,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Amazing staff big thanks to concierge Vlad who made sure our stay was special Liked the room spacious by London standards Location was excellent for our needs Overall it was a 5star experience 
208359,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, It s a very nice hotel for the price but not really a 5 star We didn t like having to walk out of the hotel and to a pub for breakfast It doesn t tell you anywhere that this is the case The rooms are not soundproof you can hear the traffic at any time and creaking floorboards The staff was very friendly helpful when we arrived but after that anyone could have walked into the hotel despite a huge number of staff , The food was excellent but as you had to walk out of the building you don t really associate it with the hotel It was great to have the handy but the tool itself is not very advanced The bed was very comfortable 
208360,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, This was our third visit to this hotel and each time the room has gotten smaller and smaller to the point where we weren t y very comfortable with the space we had and it made the room very hot meaning the air conditioning wAs on all night quite noisy might try another hotel next time shame, The reception staff were excellent and the bed was very comfortable
208361,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, There are a lot of stairs so this might be inconvenient for people with disabilities , The club lounge was very comfortable and the stuff there Simona was very polite and helpful The hotel was great 
208362,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Upon arrival we were missing a bathrobe and our tissues were not topped up when empty When checking out the doorman insisted on watching our bags so we left them by him at the front door outside when we came back to the door he was no where to be seen and the bags were left outside on their own So not 5 star as a few details have been missed but otherwise excellent 4 5 out of 5, Great location just by the Barbican tube stop We had breakfast in bed both days which was hot and excellent Good WiFi Nicely decorated Great hermes toiletries 
208363,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Issues with mini bar not being stocked broken glass in the carpet and room was not cleaned despite 2 chase calls, Good location nice hotel with good facilities
208364,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Since the hotel is located in a 300 years old building it was confusing getting to my room and I had to request the help of the staff Hotel is located on the Financial district so location is not very convenient for tourism purposes Metro was located a few blocks away Rooms are small WIFI worked well , The staff was very helpful Breakfast was very good Hotel lobby is beautiful 
208365,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, This is not a criticism more an observation As a tourist the hotel location is a little out of the way hence quiet at night However Moorgate tube station is a mere 5 minute walk away as is Bank But be aware there is a large building site blocking a direct walk Barbican tube is nearby too St Paul s Cathedral is a 15 minute walk so overall the hotel is not badly placed But the location does not have a wow factor of for example overlooking a London landmark the river This is not an issue for me but may be for some , Very welcoming and attentive staff clean comfortable room on ground floor some slight traffic noise as a result as expected in Central London I really cannot fault the service I was travelling with my sister niece we had two adjacent rooms We spent our time exploring London so I cannot comment on any of the facilities or even breakfast But given what we did experience of the hotel I would expect them to be impressive 
208366,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Rooms are slightly on the small side but more than adequate , The location was great just a few minutes walk from both Moorgate and Barbican tube stations Moorgate is maybe slightly closer but if it is raining take the covered underpass to Barbican Friendly staff and doormen and was very grateful of the lend of a large umbrella during the rain 
208367,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, It was an adjoining room which wasn t specified when we booked it was locked though We could hear clearly through the door which was a little awkward Check in could be quicker and the lobby maybe a little more comfortable tea coffee papers maybe And air conditioning instructions would be helpful , When they found out it was my birthday they spoilt me with cake wine balloons a card and rose petals on the bed It was truly lovely and made the day even more wonderful Bed comfy room spotless and the staff couldn t have been more helpful 
208368,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We did get the room for a very good price but it was very small We would have started to feel bit claustrophobic had we been staying for more than a night but for the price we were very happy I m not use that I would have been happy to pay much more for a room of that size , Service was excellent We were made to feel important and they couldn t do enough to make us feel welcome Lots of nice little touches too like a hair scrunchie in with the shower cap and Elemis toiletries A lovely place and hope to go back one day 
208369,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, I didn t like that a flexible rate meant I was due to be moved to their new city road hotel It was with an upgrade but the hotel was chosen due to its location so I di not want to relocate The hotel did find us a room in the London brewery in the end, The hotel is quirky and beautiful at the same time The rooms are nice clean and modern The club lounge is a nice touch with snacks available free of charge The jugged hare is a Fantastic little gem good food and great gins The bar manager made a beautiful gin and tonic with a twist a definite must I would go back to the hotel
208370,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Not a huge amount to do around the hotel, Upon checking in the receptionist realised it was my birthday the previous day They offered us an upgrade to the M by Montcalm at Shoreditch in a suite with complimentary breakfast When getting to our room room service bought complimentary cakes wine and fruit
208371,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Location is slightly off near Barbican but very close to tube so easy to get to central London , The bed was like a meringue exceptionally comfortable 
208372,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Breakfast expensive at Jugged Hare but tasty , Really easy reach to Barbican Changing the doormats during the day a subtle and nice touch Welcoming door and concierge staff
208373,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Cleanliness could be improved as we found that a towel and a cup had not been cleaned properly Nothing serious but it stood out in contrast to the high standard of the hotel , Very kind responsive and helpful staff Quick check in and check out Great breakfast Very comfortable and well equipped rooms Location is very central with great links to trains buses and underground We will consider returning to this hotel for our next visits to London 
208374,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Room was small and being at the front of the hotel there was road noise Staff at check in could have been more helpful but the rest of the staff were fantastic , Comfy bed
208375,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Not the best location in London for a weekend but walking distance from main attractions , The room well we had been upgraded the Hermes products in the bathroom the staff the pub just outside 
208376,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing it was all great, You were made to feel special at all times nothing was too much trouble by the staff have stayed before and will stay again great value for money
208377,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, The overall stay was excellent upon arrival we were promptly meet and our luggage taken and checked in whilst offered complimentary drinks Room upgrades were given as we were celebrating a friends birthday and the hotel had made a cake and placed a free bottle of bubbly in the room arranged by Daisy the Assistant House Manager Service from staff was exceptional and the rooms very clean and comfortable During 5 30 7 30 the complimentary services in Club Lounge were very satisfactory Breakfast was in lovely surroundings and exceptional standard Our stay was fault less and we will be returning in the summer as a consequence having stayed at many hotels even the higher rated for facilities don t always get service right but the Montcalm had everything expected and more 
208378,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, The staff were the most attentive helpful we have ever come across They nearly made the trip for us Superb value for money as well as an excellent location only a couple of mind walk from the tube station 
208379,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nearest tube was a little further than we wanted and had to travel quite a while on the underground to get to the main attractions in London , The staff were lovely the hotel was modern and clean and they went to extra effort to make our anniversary special 
208380,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Wish I could have stayed for longer , Possibly one of the best hotels I have stayed in exceptional service friendly relaxed atmosphere comfortable rooms and beds had an exceptional nights sleep Stayed there for business but felt more like a holiday when I checked out Highly recommended 
208381,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The bed wasn t as large as we hoped , The room was very nice Staff was extremely helpful and kind English breakfast was great And the location suited us well 
208382,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing, A fantastic welcome Great service Very comfortable bed in a beautiful room with great facilities Being a Club room we had access to the Club lounge which was a real treat 
208383,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, There was an issue with my room but the staff were accommodating and upgraded me to a new room however when we got there ut was already occupied Quite embarrassing But the staff changed my room again and offered complemintary breakfast 
208384,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The room I stayed in was on the third floor and required a native guide to find We took the lift to I think the first floor walked across a bridge then took the lift to the second floor then climbed stairs to the room on the third floor Taking the main lift to the third floor did not bring me to my room which was on the third floor but in a different wing from the reception area Staff were extremely helpful and pleasant However the room had tiny recessed windows allowing no natural light in so the roof felt a bit claustrophobic ,No Positive
208385,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Having reserved 4 separate rooms for 4 separate parties in advance I was surprised to find on the day before we were due to check in that the hotel had decided to deduct the full amount from my account without advising me or asking me for authority On the day of arrival I explained this to the check in staff they said they just blocked the amount that it hadn t left my account that they would only deduct the amount for my room However 4 days after checking out my bank still shows the full amount as being deducted when I rang to query I was given some lame excuse about it being my banks fault Will not stay here again ,No Positive
208386,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The Standard double rooms were so small you couldn t move around in them There was no hotel lounge area only an adjoining pub which you could not bring a small child to in the evening so we were stuck in our room , The Club rooms were lovely and spacious The travel cot provided was clean and of a good standard and the staff were very helpful in regards to our requirements to heating up our babies food 
208387,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The hotel is a little out of the way near the north side of the Barbican Centre and north of London Walls in the City of London The area is a Brewery Conservation area and this hotel has been tastefully restored into a chic hotel however in my view it lacked atmosphere There was no communal area to relax with other guests unless you had booked a room which would give you access to a small lounge area but it was not available to all guests just a few The Jugged Hare pub next door is actually part of the hotel but operates as a normal pub with access by the general public straight from the street Our room 035 was situated directly over a set of traffic lights at quite a busy crossroads in Chiswell Street this meant we heard traffic all night long on the first night so be warned Complained the next morning and was given a room across the road in the Montcalm Suites This was better and much quieter I m sure staff knew our original room was not quiet even though I had requested a quiet room I must say I have noticed this kind of treatment from other hotels where my booking had been made via Booking com I am now convinced some hotels give Booking com customers reduced service including allocating less bookable rooms Oh and one other thing there are some tables chairs located outside the Montcalm Suites On the day when we moved rooms we noticed a number of used drinking glasses on one of the tables When we checked out 3 days later those same glasses were still there on the table Why hadn t hotel staff noticed this and removed the glasses Pretty poor in my view , The price for 4 night stay including a Friday and Saturday night stay was very good via Booking com 
208388,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, We upgraded at reception where we had free happy hour drinks and snacks which we found was excellent and good value for money Would definitely recommend
208389,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, our room faced out to a wall about 6ft away so quite dark as v little natural light But we weren t there much in daylight and it was quiet as requested On the other hand we counted 17 lights in the room you can turn on so not really a problem No room here is going to have much of a view anyway , very comfortable quiet room excellent breakfast excellent situation excellent bathroom partitioned off from room by glass screen so you have to know who you are sharing with quite well though there is a screen to pull down However this means you can watch tv from the bath or loo Uniformly charming staff Just to note you have to set the little light with the picture of the maid by the door if you want the room done we should have read the room notes Quirky layout memorise the route to your room 
208390,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We thought everything was perfect for us , From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty We had a 21 month old and could do enough for us Great location near London Liverpool Street All the staff we encountered were very pleasant 
208391,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing , Luxurious feel to the room and bathroom Bed was extremely comfortable Access to the club lounge was great for us and the inclusive breakfast was brilliant 
208392,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, I didn t like being upgraded by an officious receptionist to what was to be a very dark no windows room across the road in another building which had the benefit of a kitchen We felt obliged to accept the room as we weren t offered anything else and didn t want to make a huge fuss when our reluctance wasn t already acknowledged by the receptionist However while I was out my husband had to ask for another room he never complains he couldn t get any work done because of the noise right outside our bedroom door which was the first room on the ground floor I am happy to get the room I book and pay for and don t like being fobbed off with something else just to suit the hotel It certainly didn t appear to be any kind of an upgrade If they don t like customers paying a reasonable rate for the rooms then they shouldn t advertise on booking com , The reception area was very glamorous Some of the staff were very helpful and very pleasant especially in the bar and restaurant The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable The bathroom was lovely and the toiletries excellent 
208393,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing , The service is impeccable for the price This was my first experience with 5 star service Welcome included complimentary fresh fruit and water evening greetings of chocolates tea and coffee The king sized bed was like sleeping on clouds No hallway noise was audible I wish would could have stayed for more than just our single booked night The decor is beautiful 
208394,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, There were a couple of functions in the brewery building behind which our room faced which we could hear into the early hours It wasn t loud enough to wake you up but it was still audible , Really comfy bed Loved the technology including pushing the button that leaves a light on outside for do not disturb or house keeping Very friendly and welcoming staff 
208395,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, I found the beds a little too soft I didn t like sinking in , Top class service Staff extra attentive knowledgeable and very helpful going out of their way to make guests feel like royalty The hotel is beautifully furnished in a historical brewery building The staff looked very smart and confident and added so much to the posh ambiance The rooms were awesome and had all those extra bits that make for a luxurious personal space Loved the breakfasts at the Jugged Hare I enjoyed my time at the Montcalm very much and will certainly visit again 
208396,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Staff coming into the room while we were in the room to empty the mini bar felt like we were under suspicion that we might take something perhaps could have been done prior to us being shown to the room, Room was excellent staff excellent extremely polite and helpful
208397,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, There was nothing i didn t like The location could be better but thats just a personal thing , The service was excellent The staff were more than helpful first class I had a club room and the facilities were really good Bed really comfortable with big pillows We had the continental breakfast and it was the best continental breakfast I ve had on my travels There was lots of choice and everything was fresh and really good quality An excellent stay overall
208398,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, There were a couple of minor complaints with the room nothing major We wanted a drink in the lounge that took a long time to arrive , The rooms are lovely if a little small and the building is lovely The staff were very attentive and friendly 
208399,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Had to queue for breakfast Could not get the tv to work from the bed Bath shower tricky to operate Carried own case to reception to checkout, Case carried to room Good choice of breakfast Lots of extras in room
208400,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, It would be better if there was a bar restaurant on site but that is only a small issue we loved our stay, The rooms were lovely if a bit small staff all incredibly pleasant and helpful
208401,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The staff forgot to send me the invoice via email as promised , Excellent Location just a few minutes away from Moorgate Barbican tube station clean room comfy bed great hospitality 
208402,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Staff were excellent in the hotel itself as well as in the Jugged Hare bar and in the restaurant When they found out it was our anniversary they sent some cup cakes and chocolates as well as a bottle of wine to our room 
208403,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The toilet cistern kept on running which was irritating but it was sorted , Lovely staff particular thanks to the doorman he was really cheery helpful and informative 
208404,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, It was all good, Vlad the doorman was awesome a very happy chappy helpful and welcoming the glass window between the bedroom and the bath it was great fun
208405,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Small room described as deluxe A small very high window that you couldn t see out of Remember this is a deluxe room A duvet type cover on top of the mattress which you slept on not under Curtness of the staff Hotel is like a rabbit warren Only a couple of sachets of coffee , The free wifi
208406,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, 1 my check in I arrived at 5am to be told my room wasn t on the system and told to take a seat while the person next to me was told they got a free upgrade 2 as the hotel has many stairs that you have to take there should of been an offer atleast to bring down my luggage for checkout 3 5 star hotel not having bath robes bit rubbish 4 shower itself is terrible zero water pressure 5 bottled water is a usual also that wasn t there overall pretty disappointing, Bed was good and hotel is nice loved the bar underneath
208407,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Only one very minor quibble We were in a room directly over a restaurant where a private party was happening well into the early hours It didn t bother us in the slightest but just imagine if Bridezilla had got that room , It was my wife s 50th birthday so we d booked in for the weekend at a hotel that we d normally consider to be several points above our usual level It was well worth it Despite the fact that the staff were dealing with three different wedding parties and a particularly moody Bridezilla at the time we booked in they found the time to make us feel welcome and surprise us with a bottle of champagne and a divine chocolate brownie Later that night we returned to our room after seeing a show to find the staff has covered the bed with rose petals and arranged them to make a 50 The room was very nice luxurious without being showy The beds were perfect And the ritual of working out how the bathroom shower worked was made easy by the simple instructions next to the plumbing The hotel is in a converted brewery hidden behind the Barbican on the fringes of the City During the weekend it s a quiet oasis in the middle of the town 
208408,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We were disappointed and didn t feel it lived up to a 5 tar We were shown to our room but the eye old not open the door Porter left and came back with a master promising to return with keys Never cne back Only on leaving room for dinner I d we realise he had put us in wrong room Also remote fr tv did not or properly Very little space for makng tea coffee quite awkward Also felt that there was inadequate drawer space for clothing ,No Positive
208409,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Requested bath but only shower provided Rooms were not ready when we arrived and then were not as requested Explanation was there had been a wedding the day before and fashion show that day Breakfast too expensive to consider, Comfy bed Good location Quiet Staff tried to be helpful and were very polite
208410,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The continental breakfast could have had more variety been in a larger dining room, The staff were so so friendly and helpful The bed was super comfy and the location great and easy for getting into central london We had a fantastic weekend stay and the staff were really just so helpful and friendly The hotel feels really luxe and it was like nothing was too much trouble 
208411,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Noisy Room had to ask to move Breakfast was extremely bad was told to dine in Club room long queue no food left totally inadequate space and very little choice , A great deal of staff and very attentive and helpful
208412,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, There was no complimentary gin available in the Club Lounge at 6 45pm on Friday So no pre dinner G T Very poor and not re stocked before 7 30pm despite several requests Given we were offered complimentary use of the Lounge with our package and that it was re iterated at check in this was pretty poor from a 5 hotel Stock on the breakfast buffet in the Club Lounge wasn t replenished quickly enough given how busy it was at 9 30am on Saturday Breakfast was good though once it was filled up Overall the Club Lounge was rather disappointing the staff and there were always several didn t seem to manage the volume of customers well not what I d expect from this standard of hotel , Very comfy bed Enza was an excellent member of staff at breakfast very friendly and efficient Excellent value menu in the Chiswell Street dining rooms for Friday night dinner excellent value menu with very good service and excellent food Wine reasonable prices to for quality wines 
208413,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing to fault , The reservation team went above and beyond to create a romantic experience for me and my boyfriend This included rose petals swan shaped towels a welcome note and snacks We had a lovely Valentine s Day which we will never forget 
208414,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Only negative comment was the bed was actually very high Someone with poor mobility would struggle , Literally everything Great service incredible room 
208415,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Several of the rooms we tried had strange noisy vibrations in them coming from pipes or fans the staff on the desk didn t know about them but the people who took us around did we had asked for a quiet room and it took three tries before one was found for us also the music in the jugged hare was far too loud for breakfast we asked them to turn it down but the staff weren t too happy about it it was like a disco in there ditto in continental breakfast room background music is called that because it s background it was oppressive ,No Positive
208416,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Rooms too dark and very hot A C noisy kept us awake bed too small double with mattress topper most uncomfortable, Staff very friendly and hotel spotlessly clean Breakfast excellent quality and value
208417,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Remote control didn t work very well its the only thing we could find fault with , Really comfy bed slippers and robe were provided in the club room as were a number of other added items such as an umbrella and a fruit bowl Staff were wonderful we could not have been made to feel more welcome 
208418,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Breakfast rates were too high for us to afford so we went out for that Even with a discount was over the top , Very attentive and friendly staff Lovely atmosphere 
208419,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Breakfast was excellent chef obviously took pride in his work Beds really comfortable Reception staff from door man to management all really accommodatiing and friendly
208420,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Fabulous hotel lovely rooms fully equipped for all our needs all staff were helpful and friendly Excellent value for money especially as we were given an upgrade on our room Highly recommend 
208421,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Corridors but that s the nature of the excellent refit from brewery to hotel , Location comfortable modern rooms excellent food only ate in the Jugged Hare bar and the club bar for pre dinner drinks 
208422,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Worst breakfast you could get at that price What s even worst I was charged for the whole stay after I asked no more breakfast due to it s poor quality Salmon was low quality pain aux raisins was not fresh at all The hotel itself is a maze and it s easy to get lost , Bedding is great location was perfect
208423,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Ideal location for work restaurants entertainment Very comfortable room and fantastic facilities Doormen are fantastic curteous and immaculately turned out truly great hotel
208424,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The breakfast price was immense so we went out for it Shame would have been nice to have it at the hotel for 15 per head , Lovely staff on reception Room was modern clean and still had character Toiletries were really good 
208425,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The breakfast cost a lot more when booked through booking com than at the reception , This was a very pleasent suprise real comfort and style a stone s throw from the Barbican The staff were very focused on helping and pleasing and the room had several complimentary extras Food was very good 
208426,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing really , The staff were unfailingly polite and helpful Our club room was very acceptable with some nice luxury touches We really appreciated the canapes and drinks in the club lounge which set us up nicely for our Barbican theatre trip just one minute s walk away The hotel is very well placed for sight seeing in the City of London and is an interesting historic building in its own right If you don t fancy the dining opportunities within the hotel there is plenty of choice in Whitecross Street just across the road All in all a very nice place to stay at a decent online price We recommend it 
208427,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing, Amazing room in an amazing building Very friendly and helpful staff Breakfast was lovely had full English in the hugged hare Would definitely stay again Overall 10 10 couldn t have asked for a better stay
208428,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, On arrival we were put in a very small room which we were not happy with We were then moved to the correct club room but we thought it was still quite dull looking but more spacious than the first room The first night we placed our breakfast card on the door for breakfast to our room the next morning we woke up early expecting breakfast between 8 45am 9 15am and opened the door to see if anyone was coming and noticed nobody had even taken our breakfast card so we had to phone reception so our breakfast was late And again was late the second morning Very poor this year especially when our expectations where so high after a great time last year , The bed was very comfy had a great sleep both nights 
208429,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, I took Deluxe room and I knew it will be smaller room but they gave us room divided with fire door in the middle of room and then you fell like inside small box not in the room In so small room were doors for bathroom and that fire door and behind them wardrobe with minibar In room was space only for bed and small table nothing else You won t find photos of it on website , I asked for very soft bed and we got it It was great Breakfasts were nice 
208430,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The staff is plentiful and kind but not so experienced The minibar wasn t filled after we drank some and someone got into the room unexpectedly while I was using the bathroom , The breakfast is great and true value for money 
208431,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Absolutely nothing , Can not recommend this hotel highly enough The building is lovely the room was really nice with the comfiest bed I have ever had in a hotel Every member of staff were extremely friendly and helpful Every little touch in this hotel makes your stay so enjoyable This has become my number 1 hotel in London and I will always endeavour to stay here 
208432,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, That I had to leave so quickly , Beautiful venue in a great location with exceptional service and friendly staff One of the best hotels I ve stayed at in a long time 
208433,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We were upgraded to a different cheaper Montcalm hotel on the pretext of a power failure whereas actually there was a VIP function it would appear they didn t want us near I was promised I d be contacted to explain the different room rates Still waiting , Never got a chance to see anything 
208434,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, I am afraid that the breakfast room which was at the back of the pub it was connected to didn t live up to my expectations of the actual hotel The staff on the Sunday morning were not in correct attire for a 5 star hotel and the room was over crowded with some guests having to wait for a seat or take hot plates of food up and down the stairs to an overflow seating area It is a shame that this let my stay down , Hotel staff very polite and changed my room to one with a larger bed 
208435,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We were in room 419 and were very conscious of the fact that there was no adequate curtains at the window in the bathroom when it was dark and we had the light on , Very comfortable bed Beautiful room and hotel building Staff were extremely friendly and helpful and location was perfect for our visit 
208436,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The taps and lights were all a little too flashy and it wasn t needed and was confusing The breakfast in the trendy pub across the road was extraordinarily expensive and we went without, Nice hotel friendly staff good location and interesting historic building
208437,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Terrible room very small and incredibly hot Didn t get a wink of sleep all night which spoilt our next day We have stayed several times before and have always been delighted with our room so very disappointing to have had such a poor standard this time , Friendly staff and good location 
208438,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The bed was too soft for me the kettle didn t boil hot enough and their wasn t enough shampoo for two people , The shower was amazing the complimentary coffee tea and biscuits were great Sky sports in the room was a brilliant bonus 
208439,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, I should have requested an orthopaedic mattress as I found the bed too soft for my comfort Next time I will ask if they could provide that , Fantastic breakfast buffet Very friendly staff
208440,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Very small room Very noisy Room very difficult to find No restaurant open at the weekend most local restaurants also closed at the weekend esp Sunday Reasonable value at 118 but certainly not worth the 325 advertised rate , Very comfortable bed
208441,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The breakfast room in the jugged hare adjoining restaurant was very crowded and so on our first morning we had to sit in isolation in the basement room 2nd day was excellent though, The club bedroom was very comfortable the bed was huge and the Hermes toiletries were gorgeous The club lounge a great idea complementary snacks and drinks for guests Breakfast was very high quality 
208442,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing really some staff could have been a little more attentive happy courteous most were excellent though This is only a small criticism on a high rated stay , Very nice building and a lot of effort has gone into a very nice interior Rooms were spacious well equipped and very comfortable On site Jugged Hare gastro pub was bustling book a table is recommended and served an excellent spread of breakfast options and evening meals Would not hesitate to stay again for leisure or work 
208443,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing , We stayed for a couple of nights the staff were really very friendly almost too helpful The room was very nice breakfast was good no complaints 
208444,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Stay every year for last 3 years Last two years I have had email from Montcalm a few days before date I was booked in for offering rate at over 60 off room rate I had paid I booked thru booking Com and was advised to book direct in future My experience this year was that doing so resulted in much the same higher rate offer I would hope regular guests would be given good rate Your central reservations unit offered free breakfast which was welcomed but hopefully next years experience is better on initial booking , Friendly staff
208445,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Very noisy hotel I have stayed their 3 times and twice have had to move room Air con very noisy when you need it on 2 out of 3 rooms and outside there is a large air conditioning unit which is also loud Shame as good location and staff are nice ,No Positive
208446,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, The first evening of our stay the customers next to us were having a party and made much noise in the corridor at 1h in the morning We called the reception The staff was very helpful and tried to persuade our neighbors to go back in their own rooms And the most incredible thing is the next evening Night Manager of the hotel gave us a bottle of champagne for apologize This is a real five star hotel 
208447,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, When checking in was told breakfast wasn t included in my booking when it was had to show booking confirmation to prove it was included Room was cold black mascara stain on the white bed covers bathrobes had no ties on them , Hotel is very nice room was very nice too and a good size with a large bed staff are helpful and friendly breakfast was very nice with a good selection
208448,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We were told that afternoon tea would be delayed to 530pm A lot of staff who did not put themselves out to help but seemed to linger expecting a tip A great deal of walking along corridors with flights of steps to get from reception to our room including a covered footbridge to get from 1 part of the hotel to another Quite a long walk to the car park involving quite a walk underground 34 charge to park overnight , Bed comfortable Quiet location Well fitted out Clean
208449,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, There was a fan outside our window which was annoying to begin with but soon became unnoticeable Also no view from our window , Beds extremely comfortable Lovely treats left in our room for our anniversary Great shower 
208450,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Although the breakfast was very good it felt quite chaotic at times as there wasn t a lot of room in the restaurant and both mornings we had to wait in the bar until a table became available , The room was very comfortable only problem was there wasn t enough light The breakfast was very good with plenty of options 
208451,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, If you are not traveling alone in business mind I highly recommend to avoid this hotel We booked their double premium room as expected to have normal size bed and larger room What we get was smaller room than in description and the bed was less than 160cm wide and bumpy in center For two it was very difficult to sleep and caused backaches After two nights we got another room but there was no warm water in the shower only freezing cold In morning when we waited long for it to be fixed we lost our prebooked transportation to the airport and although they promised that manager will contact us later no contact or any compensation Never visit there again if travel as couple ,No Positive
208452,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Exceptionally poor service for a five star hotel first told that I should move to Another hotel then told that breakfast wasnt included all was wrong Eventually put in some annex building Staff didn t seem to have a clue,No Positive
208453,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The room itself was a little small , I was delighted that my husband s birthday was acknowledged with cakes balloons a card and champagne Thanks 
208454,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We chose a Montcalm Club room for the extra size and little extras the extra size was all wasted in a big cold bathroom and missing from room were a second bath robe a second wine glass and a second drinking glass Bottled water was only provided on day one no turndown service as one would expect from a 5 star was provided Breakfast was well below par and I have often had much better in 2 3 star rated hotels, Location was good but as a 5 star everything else was disappointing 
208455,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, nothing, The Staff were excellent the room was without fault and breakfast very good I would recommend it to my friends and colleagues and indeed stay there myself or at other Montcalm hotels 
208456,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, There was nothing not to like Only that we didn t stay longer , There were lots of little extras in the room from the staff Such as champers wine and cakes It was a trip for a 30th birthday and the staff did so much to make us comfortable Including balloons 
208457,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Not easy access to Heathrow Airport although Underground was only 10mins walk, Quiet setting and excellent access to city centre next door to Barbican Centre 
208458,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The extra loud woman in the lobby complaining lack of class , It s our second stay and the hotel is great perfect location underground wise to get around and super value for money if you book over a weekend Room service club sandwich is a must 
208459,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Let s face it it was not a five star hotel The rooms were small bathrooms shabby The first room we stayed in was extremely noisy even after i switched off the air conditioning The dirty window was facing the wall In the second room the tv set was not working properly After several request is was fixed though For the same value one can get a decent 4 star hotel which will be both better located and nicer , The staff was nice They gave me a birthday card and cupcakes when they find out i have a birthday To change a noisy room for a quiet one was also not a problem as well as fixing the tv set and the remote control 
208460,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, I was irritated by the level of charge for room service I know this is normal however I do not understand why a charge exists at 7 00 in the evening , Location was excellent and staff were very helpful Rooms were done out very well 
208461,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The hinge fitting of the shower screen allows minor flooding of bathroom floor if not very careful , Excellent location for Barbican Centre and London City Great bed Nice toiletries The attached restaurant hte Chiswell Street Dining Rooms is excellent 
208462,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The manager at reception asked for a holding deposit of 50 on my card after i had paid for the room and after checking he had put it through as a sale They said I didn t have breakfast included even though I had paid for it The room had a constant buzzing noise even with air con and electric off The layout of the hotel is hard to follow , The bed was comfortable Decor was quite nice a good size bath 
208463,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Fitness suite was very small but i appreciate its not the main concern of a hotel Just disappointing for me as i like a hotel with a gym , The building is beautiful the staff could not be more helpful and the room was very nice The Jugged Hare pub thats affiliated with the hotel served a delicious supper 
208464,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Everything Staff were excellent room was beautiful and extremely comfortable Location was great I couldn t fault this hotel and would say that it s by far the best hotel I have stayed in when visiting London
208465,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, The bed was extremely comfortable and the staff very helpful and professional Made to feel special and nothing was a problem for the staff I would go again for a longer stay and explore the facilities further 
208466,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Sometimes the housekeepers enter the room if you book late check out and they don t read notes on the account even with DND sign on, Alice is wonderful a great asset to the Montcalm The hubby and I have been coming to the hotel most weekends for a year and each time we receive a wonderful reception and love breakfast at the Jugged Hare A MUST 
208467,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The Club room was quite cramped and the double bed was small but comfortable The bathroom was good but no bath We overlooked the street but no noise that disturbed us , Great value wonderful stay Will be back The Jugged Hare the restaurant of the hotel is very good with great staff and excellent food both in choice and quality Breakfast was very good also Short walk to Spitalfields market which is worth a visit The Barbican is next door for cinema and theatre plus Museum of London 10 minutes away 10 taxi ride to Leicester Square or take the tube which is close by 
208468,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, If i was being picky it was only a double bed queen or king would be nice as standard , Modern feel Retained character Very clean Friendly staff feel in hotel
208469,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Too much crammed into the room , Very impressive hotel great bedroom and very comfortable bed Good location not very convenient for sightseeing enjoyed the Chiswell Dining Rooms bar
208470,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The two issues raised were immediately rectified by the staff but I would go for a bigger room than the deluxe double next time, The service was impeccable the location was perfect for our needs and the hotel itself was beautiful
208471,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The route to our room from reception is bit complicated but there is direction sign , We love the ancient building but modern decoration inside Staff are very nice The sauna is great 
208472,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, No bar in the hotel the only bar was on the steet corner open to public it was very busy so could not get anywhere to sit disappointing had to use another bar a short walk away, Staff wonderfull hotel was immaculate
208473,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, There was nothing we didn t like about this hotel , This was our fourth visit This is where we enjoy the comfort the friendliness of the staff the excellent food and a great location 
208474,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Given a really dindgy room no bath terrible lighting and a musty smell Booked in advanced any reason why i got such a terrible room I ve stayed here a few times before , Left my wallet went out of the way to contact me
208475,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The room was a good size but a double bed seemed small surely a king or super king is the norm in this price bracket Aircon also woke us up both nights at 2am for an hour but I think we were just unlucky , Great location very helpful staff and a good size room We came with our 5 year old daughter and when we realised it was a normal double bed the hotel provided us with a camp bed foc

208480,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, TV was flashing and remove control run out of charge Also everything in the room have to be paid for as you leave Even apples weren t free, Room was clean and the bed was really comfortable Food was really incredible Juggled Hire is amazing pub
208481,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Some of the bathroom fittings needed maintenance and repair but they did work , Friendly helpful staff throughout Ideal location for the Barbican Centre And only a short walk to tube station 
208482,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Dreadful hum all night from the massive vent system Sounded like a Chinook on the roof It s not the air con because it was off Even with earplugs it was very noisey Get a room facing the courtyard or just not facing Barbican way , Out of the busy tourist part of London but very close to Moorgate and Barbican 15 mins walk to St Pauls and the Jugged Hare is always buzzing 
208483,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Apparently we booked the cheapest room as we were put in a room without windows at first Hotels always seem to try to do that until you complain We ended up getting a better room but I truly dislike a hotel trying this These hotels don t get my patronage anymore So last time at the Montcalm ,No Positive
208484,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The room we had was tiny but after complaining we were moved to a larger room directly above the bar which had a squeaky sign hanging outside the window Our first room didn t have a remote for the tv and our second room we were too far away from the tv for it to work The first room had a faulty shower and lighting system and the second bathroom was so big it echoed Would I stay here again Never I would rather stay in a tent on Wimbledon Common , One of the best things about this place is when you leave the building after finding your way back to reception 
208485,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Unfortunately my bath plug didn t work and when calling down to reception it took forever for someone to come so I didn t both with a bath I ordered breakfast to my room to which it arrived with no cutlery And now having looked at my bank statement I have been charged twice for my stay , The location is great Reception were warm and friendly And the room was clean There was no bathrobe which I read I should have had as well as slippers which also I didn t have 
208486,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Staff is extremely helpful and accommodative to visitors After informing the manager of issues with noise at night she was very attentive and further improved the experience Location and facilities are great Breakfast at the Jugged Hare is a classic treat 
208487,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Staff could be friendlier I found the receptionist quite blunt and a bit rude Also the toiletries provided were extremely perfumed and I broke out in an awful rash all over my face after using them Two days later I am on antibiotics and it hasn t cleared An enjoyable stay though , It was a lovely hotel the rooms were spacious and beds very comfy Bathrooms also spacious very clean throughout Slept like a baby 
208488,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing, Club treats such as free drinks and nibbles before setting off out for the evening was amazing Beautiful room and bathroom with excellent facilities and super helpful staff 
208489,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Small rooms Not the best location almost on the border of the city london The hotel looks like a luxury motel, Helpful staff wifi is ok soft bed alot of light in the room Barbican underground station is 6 min walking Kings cross is 2 stations away Tesco express and cash machine are near
208490,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The TV remote was temperamental and the taps dials for the bath and shower were difficult to navigate due to some being worn and wonky They also ran out of tables during breakfast in the restaurant area so we were sidelined to the bar area where no waiters waitresses were available meaning we had to physically get up and walk around to get anyone s attention , The staff at the hotel were very welcoming and helpful They really went out of their way to make my birthday weekend special with wonderful unexpected surprises such as a card balloons rose petals and champagne The full English breakfast was also very tasty and filling 
208491,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, My room was on the 3rd floor in the south wing very tough to find The lifts and halls need more directions My room was small with no window but that was fine but the lighting was poor Need brighter more lights , Great Location hotel staff were very very helpful despite it being a little chaotic due to a wedding party The rate itself was brilliant especially in the run up to Xmas
208492,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Tiny room no view Maybe I had higher expectations as my stay at M by Montcalm was superb Also could not turn off the TV and the light was very annoying for sleep , Nice shower
208493,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Location is in the business district Quiet during weekends , Very nice staff They accommodated my request to change rooms as the initial one was directly on top of the kitchen and was super noisy Big rooms and bathrooms 
208494,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Only gripe was that the rooms were a bit small and the desk chair wasn t comfortable but minor gripes, Service was top class Extremely comfortable bed Anyone looking to stay in the City this is an excellent hotel location wise 
208495,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, t v was on the blink i never reported it and apparently they would have had it replaced fixed the same day had I but as we were out most of the time no real problem, excellent staff super facilities
208496,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, 3 95 for a bottle of water seemed a bit extreme especially considering what you pay for the room , Room was huge Very clean and the bed was so comfy Location was fantastic for a work Christmas function nearby Staff were very friendly and helpful and the midday checkout was an added bonus 
208497,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We arrived early around 10 30 am and understandably no room was available so we left luggage We checked in and a room was allocated we specified a quiet room on the reservation asked for it when we arrived and were assured this not a problem all we needed was to pick up the key when we came back later Spent all day and evening in London We got to the hotel at around 10 30 PM picked up the key to go to our room and found out that our room was on the first floor right on top of a wedding party that when full blast on the floor below us Nobody would have been able to sleep with that noise Fortunately the receptionist agreed and was able to assign us to another room on the fourth floor away from the ballroom It ended ok but why were we assigned probably the noisiest room in the hotel that evening when we had requested a quiet room repeatedly , Location and friendliness staff
208498,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, King size bed not normal size not so good for tall ish people , The staff were very friendly the restaurant bar had a nice atmosphere food tasted good too 
208499,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, 1 Uncomfortable bed smaller than we would have expected in a hotel of this standard and the sides very soft so hard to stay on the bed if one got it wrong 2 Shower tap came off in my hand and it was difficult to then get hot enough water , Location perfect 
208500,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, A little out of the centre but we actually liked being a little outside of the hustle bustle, We absolutely loved our stay from start to finish The staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel was amazing We stayed in the Montcalm club room which was beautiful and very clean We arrived back to our room later that evening to find a bottle of wine and cupcakes complimentry as it was a special occasion and also the travel cot had been set up with a duck for the bath and a grooming set for our child Would highly recommend and we will definitely be returning 
208501,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Shower controls seemed random needed experimentation to find desired setting Thin walls mean next room TV easily heard Restaurant is in the next building , Really comfortable bed and great location for the TV Nice bath too 
208502,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Very nice building super comfy room with an extra soft bed and enough space for London The hotel is a 5min walk to the Barbican metro station The staff was really nice always there to help There is a boutique feel about this place everything is cosy and comfy and stylish I liked it a lot 
208503,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Would have liked a bath in the room although I did not request one Bit of a draught whilst in bed from the air conditioning , Staff were friendly and helpful although when I arrived there were a lot of them in the lobby Really liked the hotel clean comfortable had a lovely evening here 
208504,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We got a small room so we complained as id booked a deluxe room Fortunately they realised their mistake and couldn t do more for us to correct it , The bed is honestly so comfortable 
208505,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The breakfast downstairs wasn t so good Order it in your room and it s so much better, Fabulous from start to finish Cannot fault this hotel Also highly recommend the jugged hare for great food 
208506,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Would have liked an internal restaurant To get to the Jugged Hare breakfast restaurant you had to go outside into the street for a few yards Although not far it s not good in poor weather , The very high level of comfort
208507,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The only gripe was in our room there was a very thin curtain in the bathroom over the window which did let a lot of light into the bathroom early morning subsequently shining into the bedroom , As always another fantastic visit the the Montcalm at Brewery Friendly staff where nothing is ever too much for them beautiful rooms with a free complimentary upgrade lovely hotel 
208508,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, The courtesy of the staff was of the highest standard with all our requests dealt with in a friendly and businesslike manner Breakfast in the Jugged Hare was one of the best we have ever experienced 
208509,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, There was a room service trolley in front of the service area door in the corridor next to my room Daily the housekeping team would leave on it used china and food It would stay there for days The key card had to be redone every few days , Good location staff are very nice and helpful Jugged hare restaurant is great
208510,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Very little to complain about The toilet could do with a bit of additional scrubbing We had to ask for belts for the bathrobes which were supplied within a matter of minutes , Well situated close to the subway although we would have preferred the Westminster area Lovely room Great pub Friendly efficient staff Really good value for money 
208511,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, nothing was bad but i would have preferred a King Bed in the Clubroom instead of a Queen The room was massive so would easily have fitted it , The staff were amazing So accommodating and really went out of their way to do everything for us I would highly recommend this hotel for people having a weekend stay in London 
208512,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Hotel looked like a maze Check in out were needlessly complicated No parking available For unloading the car had to park across the street and cross the road with the luggage room was on the small side , staff were friendly Clean hotel 
208513,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Rooms are tired and general d cor is dated checking in for breakfast is a cumbersome process with much checking of lists no IT , Excellent location adjacent to The Barbican very good buffet breakfast
208514,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, On the 2nd day they took away the used towel but didn t give us a new ones But that s just complaining on a high level , Good location nice rooms friendly staff huge beds and cosy linen All in all good value for money 
208515,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Location is excellent but London City is quite deserted after business hours We stayed there for an event at Barbican then the location is not to beat Staff forgot to refill bath tissues Minor complaint but should be mentioned for a venue of its class , Really nice staff very helpful Nice and comfortable rooms 
208516,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The shower Weak pressure Second day towels hard , Great staff lovely welcome and nothing too much to ask Even though the building is like a maze the staff were so careful to ensure I knew where I was going
208517,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, First class response to an issue with the room soon corrected Excellent night duty manager made an extra special effort to rectify 5 Stars deserved This was my second stay I would have no hesitation in returning 
208518,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, 1st floor room facing street got woken early morning by delivery lorries with reversing sensors blaring , Close to tube Comfy bed Elegantly decorated 
208519,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Everything except front of house staff they were efficient , Maintenance is a big issue our room had no grout in the bathroom floor tiles with no grout made the bathroom feel dirty The room had a small window that you couldn t open and it made it feel claustrophobic Breakfast on Sunday morning was havoc we ended up sitting in the bar area with the worst staff we have ever come across they didn t want to assist and help customers in anyway it was even a chore to move the cups and saucers that people had used we as customers pay their wages The front area of the bar is filthy and this couldn t have been a one off when the restaurant was this busy so other guests would end up sitting where we sat looking at a dirty looking pub We have travelled a lot stayed in 4 5 star hotels this is the worst ever and not worthy of the star rating it has 
208520,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, My room lock was broken and had 1cm of loosenes when it got closed Some one with a card could open it in a easy way The came to repair it but the reparation was useless , The waiters of the Breakfast were always very pleasant and hepful

208522,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We would like to have known what a comfort pack was on the minibar menu It was also not practical to run a bath through the shower head But these are very minor points , It was absolutely fine The staff were 100 The rooms clean comfortable and very well equipped for business and leisure with easy access Wi fi 
208523,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Our room was directly above the Jugged Hare pub Not good on a Saturday Loud music until 12 30am and loud people leaving until 1am , Location and facilities
208524,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We were upgraded but the room was smaller than our last two stays which was a little disappointing , The beds are wonderfully comfy The breakfast exceptional at the Jugged Hare if you have this option add it ON 
208525,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The reservation staff who even contacted booking com to tell them not to help us, Awful An error in the system showed my room was booked for the previous night it needed to be Upon arrival the hotel admitted they had taken out my money but were not willing to allow me to use that money as part of payment to stay the correct night Tried to charge be another 150 on top of 120 equalling 270 Could not care less that they took my money when we could not afford to pay the additional 150 Happy to take money and do nothing for the customer ruined the entire london weekend
208526,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The location is OK Even it s close from the tube we have to change often the lines to go to the city center The concierge was insisting too much on the hotel s restaurant when we asked for one in town , We stayed at the Montcalm at the Brewery during 3 night mid September Warm welcome from the staff at the check in We had an upgrade to a Club room which was amazing The room is very modern the bed was very comfortable We had dinner at the Jagged Hare and it was delicious We will definitely comme back 
208527,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, nothing, 1 minute away from the Barbican s theatre reason of the trip nice area pub next door has good food but quite noisy in the night Room was very nice bathroom was huge I would go back
208528,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, In the bedroom because of the way the curtain rails were laid out it was impossible to cover all the windows and there was light early, I loved the lay out of the room and the comfort of the bed Staff was extremely professional and made us feel totally at home We liked the pub that is run by the hotel a lot where we has an excellent continental breakfast
208529,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Dirty brownish stain seems like blood bed sheet Possibly not changed at all The hotel staff front office manager and receptionist only the ones who could speak English apologised saying it is a human mistake what else could be Check your bed before laying down if you are not happy don t change your mind with offered bottle of wine it is not worth , None not worth for the money we paid
208530,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, No complimentary water Have to request for toiletries to be replenished not a sign of luxury boutique but budget inn Incorrect billing, Staff was friendly n polite Location is great
208531,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Amazing 5 star hotel with a fantastic location just minutes from the underground Booked into a Montcalm Club room for my boyfriend s birthday and on check in we had been upgraded to the WOW suite Only downside was that we were only staying for one night I would definitely stay here again and would recommend to family and friends 
208532,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The location Although next to the Barbican theatre there s not a lot else around , Staff were great the building is quite spectacular and the room was clean and highly functional Dinner at the Jugged Hare was fantastic 
208533,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Our room card keys kept not working and we kept having to take them to the front desk to be reset We were told not to put them near a credit card or cell phone which when put in a wallet when going out for the day where else should we have put them In any case when we had the room serviced the cleaning staff would turn the AC unit off and close the vent when we had turned it on so it would be cool when we returned for the evening We were also not provided with a room service menu at first and when we asked for one we were told to just call and ask for what we wanted Then a menu turned up on the last night of our stay , The staff was very friendly and the location was great for hopping the Tube or catching a show at the Barbican We got the breakfast included package and it was well worth it A nice selection of hot and cold breakfast items each morning was a definite plus 
208534,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Hotel staff is very friendly courteous and professional I enjoyed my stay Hotel does have a bit of retro touch in its exterior primarily the entire building block Which I liked but interiors and the rooms are no less than any state of the art modern hotels The Hotel is at a great location a 5 minute walk to Tube stations and a 15 minute Tube ride to all the major attractions 
208535,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, No complaints , Excellent price for room Staff very helpful Very comfortable bed Bedroom facilities excellent Good breakfast I would definitely use this hotel again if I was visiting the vicinity 
208536,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, The staff were great they made us feel very special The hotel has to be one of the best hotels we ve stayed in for a long time Love our stay and our pampering from your staff 
208537,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The waiting staff in the morning for breakfast We were sat down for breakfast and waited a good 20min before we were offered a drink whilst other guest were serve at once , The Hotel its self was good the staff were very helpful
208538,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The ONLY criticism is the mood lighting in the rooms It s quite dim which makes it a little difficult to read or do other things requiring lighting But it s hardly the biggest problem in the world , Staff are fantastic There was a large queue when we arrived and they did all they could to get it down asap They could not have been more helpful 
208539,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Pleasant interior Disappointed with view could not see day light or sunshine Could not open open window Did not complain because of the price paid , Fabulous building and would stay again but would request a better room view 
208540,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Room was like cell maybe making old Scotland Yard into a hotel may be better we don t feel it was good value stayed at Horseguards for the same price and had a much better room breakfast overpriced and not all that the chain across the road did a better one for less than half the price, Hotel had a nice welcoming feeling
208541,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The prices in the attached pub restaurant were high , The location was perfect for access to London s attraction with a tube station very close by Staff were attentive and enthusiastic 
208542,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, The staff are incredibly helpful The club room is a great idea and the food and drinks offered and general amenity make this hotel a great experience 
208543,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The gym is very small and not air conditioned so probably not the hotel for you if you are a keen gym bunny , The staff were extremely friendly and helpful the room was beautifully furnished and very comfortable There are a lot of nice touches such as nice tea and coffee making facilities and mints on the pillow before bed The location is fantastic and the heritage building is beautiful 
208544,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Overall I had a very good experience but was just a bit disappointed to find out on my arrival that The Brewery actually didn t brew beer it was a conference center Also the work out facility which includes a sauna some exercise equipment and free weights is located on the lower level of a third building and is a bit cramped , Very comfortable hotel set up in multiple co located sites My room was in the building across the street from the main part of the hotel The rooms were very quiet and very clean Very good ability to control the room temperature WiFi was superb All the staff I met were excellent The hotel was also attached to a very nice restaurant and what turned out to be a very popular pub The Jugged Hare For those planning to take the tube it s a 10 minute walk to Moorgate Underground Circle H S and Northern Lines 
208545,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, A minor detail I know but the steam room sauna was out of action and there was no notification of any problem I wondered the lower floors for quite a while before I discovered that , The staff were exceptionally helpful and most pleasant to deal with 
208546,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, This was the end of our 6 weeks European holiday and a lovely way to finish From the moment we arrived Megha Singh and her team looked after us No request was too much trouble and the service was superb Great breakfasts and the Club Class was great with drinks and canap s every evening The room was serviced daily in true 5 star fashion with every item checked and replaced when used Resort style stay with true old fashioned service by far the best hotel of the 15 or so we stayed in 
208547,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Fitness room too small to be of any practical use and very hot Quirky layout a bit frustrating, Rooms small but sumptuous Public areas quite luxurious Staff and levels of service
208548,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The cost the food available and the fact that although we were apparently in the Club room we were not informed that we were right by the main road It was stuffy uncomfortable and loud Also the fact that the room service staff were rude and unhelpful really let the other members of staff down no offer of help with a selective diet and the pasta I finally decided on was almost raw , The location is fantastic very close to the Barbican centre which was the reason for our trip The staff were also very helpful 
208549,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, There wasn t anything we didn t like , There are not enough superlatives to describe how amazing this hotel is Me and my partner celebrated my 30th birthday here and when my partner emailed them they helped to make our celebrations even better We had an extremely warm welcome and the staff were second to none I would highly recommend the montcalm club room as this is excellent value for money and well worth the extra expense as you get access to the lounge with complimentary snacks and alcohol The breakfast in the Jugged Hare is also worth the extra expense Overall an excellent hotel and we will be returning in the future 
208550,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Our room was kept spotless and had everything you could possibly need for a comfortable stay The staff were all friendly and gave outstanding customer service 
208551,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Our room location was absurdly difficult to find We had to take an elevator to the third floor then walk to the end of a hallway then take another elevator back down to the second floor and walk up some more steps until we finally arrived at our room , Staff was very friendly
208552,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, It was for my wedding and they forgot that I was checking out late And cleaner barged in to our room even though we had the do not disturb light on Didnt get anything even though I had booked it for my wedding Other hotels would have given a bottle of champagne or an upgrade , Location
208553,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, It was raining and we got wet walking to the restaurant , Everything it was lovely we had a lovely stay the staff were friendly and very helpful The food in the restaurant was outstanding loved that and the cocktails too 
208554,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, They moved us to their new hotel M by Montcalm at Shoreditch cause of renovation reason and gave extra breakfasts with it M by Montcalm is a fantastic hotel tho not old styled decorated everything is good 
208555,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Room was small and dark bathroom way too small and no separate shower in a 5 hotel I would expect it Overall I would rate it a good 4 hotel not a 5 , Central location good value for money when compared to avg London prices comfortable bed kindness of staff
208556,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, I booked three rooms for my guest with my credit card I gave all informations two days before arrival by mails and callings directly but they didnt get the payment from my credit card they charged all the payment from my guests even all my warnings It was so shameful I do hundreds booking all over the world in a year I never face before like this , nothing from checkin to checkout
208557,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Whoever was responsible for tiling the bathroom should be punished for the bad job they ve done , The window bathroom was a unique experience definitely go for it Excellent breakfast selection you can ask to get the eggs done as you wish Super comfortable bed Gabriel was very nice 
208558,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Given a very small room on my arrival Probably the smallest hotel room I ve ever seen I could not turn around in the shower as it was so tight , Good atmosphere strange layout in the hotel but added to the atmosphere Bar attached was good Staff very friendly knowledgeable and helpful Concierge from Hungary was excellent 
208559,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Amazing service No matter if it is the reception breakfast room service Just fabulous Extremely friendly staff Congratulations also to the management for creating such environment to work 
208560,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The only downside to this hotel is its location it s a 10 minute walk from the nearest tube and there isn t a lot to see in the area In saying that it would be ideal if you needed to be in the City for whatever reason and if you re happy to take a cab then the proximity to the tube is irrelevant , Everything else is great Every staff member we encountered was professional friendly and helpful The former brewery setting is beautiful and while accessing your room may necessitate the negotiation of a simple maze of hallways this only adds to the character Our room was clean comfortable and equipped with everything that you would expect from a hotel of this calibre Overall we had a great experience and would certainly return 
208561,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Time taken to rectify the air con issue we had , The welcome from the staff We had an issue with the room air con that was rectified with a room upgrade and then additional assistance upon leaving and when we rebook 
208562,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The room we were in 011 had no natural light as the window backed directly onto the foundations of another building, The staff were all efficient and polite the decor is pleasant in the pets of the hotel we actually used The Jugged Hare bar restaurant is lively and a really nice place for an afternoon or evening drink 
208563,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Upgraded to one of the apartments on the opposite side of the road to the hotel and felt duped when assured we had at least been allocated the Club Double Room we had originally booked The room was small with an unwanted kitchenette hardly conducive to a romantic one night stay There was no complimentary water or fruit on our arrival the TV was not working and the promised response to the inoperative TV never materialised No promised complimentary newspaper appeared the next morning and the advertised Hermes toiletries were not provided in the bathroom Breakfast was spoilt first by the waiters hurrying customers in their breakfast choices as there were apparently insufficient menus available and secondly by one of the waiters putting his hand right across my husband s plate to help himself to one of the jam pots to add to another table without even an explanation or an excuse me totally astounding rudeness , The reception manager sensitively listening and responding to our account of the disappointment experienced during our stay at the Montcalm at the Brewery 
208564,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Breakfast on Sunday morning was problematic as it took a long time to even get a table We were told it s an issue every Sunday which raises other questions as to why it hasn t been resolved There seemed to be plenty of tables becoming available but they weren t being cleared quickly enough to allocate to new arrivals ,No Positive
208565,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The arrogant receptionist in the breakfast room The young lady has much to learn not a smile smashing the menu on the table The last morning Friday there was another professional lady welcoming us and living up to the standard of the high class of the staff in general , The club lounge offered an excellent start for an evening in London It was nice have an aperitif before the theater etc 
208566,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Location was so close to underground Breakfast buffet was beautiful We loved going across the road in the afternoon to sit outside on the leather chesterfield lounges in the sunshine enjoying some drinks
208567,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing , The hotel was very up market not what I was expecting much to my daughter s amusement It was beautiful and the staff were friendly and lovely to talk to really helpful and kind We went to see Hamlet and the location was utterly perfect for the Barbican Centre 
208568,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The room I was given was one half of an adjoining room which is off putting and I could see the light from that room all night underneath the door The room was also extremely loud I kept waking up because of the sound of the road and traffic and the other guests slamming their doors Also this is my third time staying here in as many months when I checked in this time the staff made me really uncomfortable they had notes on screen when I said my name and two members of staff were whispering about them in front of me They then took my card payment twice for reasons unknown I m a single traveller but they asked me several time if I was sure that I didn t want two cards It was a really uncomfortable check in and felt awkward and not friendly , This is my third time staying here so it obviously does have some good points The rooms are lovely and the little extras are great Hermes bath products nice fluffy robes amazing rainfall shower heads 
208569,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Room not cleaned properly Large room but lacked additional seating only a desk and chair provided Room next to main road and exposed poor sound proofing secondary glazing Curtains did not close properly so lacked privacy No information in room on availability of restaurants within the facility , Location
208570,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, privacy issues concerned me after i departed information was given to a third party without my permission, very friendly well run hotel always seeking to please
208571,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Room in 4thfloor west wing took a while to get to up stairs and a different lift Also room was a little I small side and bed sloped badly off either side ,No Positive
208572,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Air conditioning was very noisy and had to be switched of during the night Dirty dishes and some old food left outside in the corridor for greater that 36hours Noisy guests in the open spaces outside our window at 03 30 which was only addressed by hotel when I complained They should have been proactive, Location
208573,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Room a little small and a long and confusing walk to the room which is in another building across a link bridge do make sure you take the offer of assistance from the guys at reception who will guide you They obviously know this can be an issue for guests arriving, Very comfortable bed and great rainfall type shower Staff very friendly everyone smiles and greets you and guys taking you to your rooms needed top notch
208574,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Really enjoyed the visit Quiet surroundings and within walking distance of where we wanted to visit The hotel was clean the staff were very attentive and the visit was hassle free No complaints about any aspect of the hotel Would definitely go back 
208575,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, What a lovely hotel The welcome was fantastic and lovely treats left in room and upgrade as our anniversary The room was spacious and the bathroom huge The room was great with a wonderful bed v comfortable We popped out for a walk via the secret jugged pub and sneaked back in for a wonderful night sleep Will definitely return again and experience wonderfully helpful staff and top facilities Amazing Breakfest 
208576,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Nothing negative the layout is a little maze like but you get used to it , Wonderful luxury room with all the amenities We didn t have much interaction with the staff but the check in process was fluent and the welcome service was excellent 
208577,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Not as good as last time I stayed little things missing such as amenities not refreshed when room cleaned during stay , Great location nice comfortable room
208578,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Room had no window and hotel Bar Jugged Hare was uncomfortable and felt unwelcoming , Staff were fantastic and incredibly helpful Rooms were clean with a good standard of facilities 
208579,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, This was a treat for the final 2 nights of our honeymoon Room 410 was difficult to get to The LG exit was blocked by dishes from the kitchen The bath and shower were essentially useless and after a 12 hour journey it took 30 minutes to half fill a bath with lukewarm water The mechanism seemed totally impractical The room was good but cramped for two people The kettle area was particularly crowded with items but the fact that there was a kettle was a bonus The air conditioning unit outside the room made sleep very difficult The window was small and needed to be cleaned but in any case little light enters the room as it is feet away from the wall of the next building Locating the light switches for corresponding lights was a bit of a project Three requests before a second bathrobe came on evening 2 of our stay , Comfortable bed 
208580,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Although the accommodation was very good our bathroom mirror light didn t work old screw holes were visible where the toilet role holder had been moved there was the odd chip on furniture and the bathroom door stop was missing A little more attention to detail would improve the overall impression, The service was excellent and all the staff were extremely helpful and pleasant
208581,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, The hotel is new but you can feel the atmosphere of the old brewery Every member of staff is very professional The location is great especially if you want to visit The Barbican Centre 
208582,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, First room was very dark with no natural daylight and next to the air conditioning unit Avoid room 010 if you are a light sleeper, Excellent hotel with lovely staff Moved us to a better room when requested and without issue Great facilities and very good cocktails 
208583,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Extremely small room no place to move If there are two people in the room at the same time one should lie on the bed for the other to be able to move freely No view from the windows , Clean and modern with perfect WiFi Attentive staff Free coffee and tea in the room Comfortable bed 
208584,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Noise from courtyard function but swift reaction from management Club room not much bigger than standard double, Very attentive staff swift to respond and help Convenient for City Barbican
208585,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We were given a handicaped room on arrival knowing well that we are fully abled people Was very disappointed Although we were moved to another room after our complaint The bathtub wasn t cleaned very often and there was no toilet brush to clean up when necessary We experienced difficulty with the light switch plus the Lightning on the floor is unnecessary anoying The fridge was hot all the time and stunk when opened Bedroom was stuffy and windows permanently locked , The friendly staffs from reception to cleaners Location was perfect Right in between the Barbican Station Moorgate 
208586,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, rude bartender chatting away and gave an annoyed look when we ordered our drinks , Attentive staff we had a room that was situated in the old wing which gave out a stench the reception team was effective and immediately relocated us 
208587,The Montcalm At Brewery London City,No Negative, Door Staff was amazing always with a genuine welcoming smile Location is very central with choices of restaurants around Montcalm calm in buzzing London 
208588,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Tiny window in the room and you actually needed a map to find the room from reception Numerous walkways stairs and 2 lift journeys, Nicely decorated rooms Good shower
208589,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, We stayed in the club room Although the room size was decent the size of our bathroom was ridiculously large probably at the expense of a smaller bedroom The room would have benefited from a proper space balance between bedroom and bathroom as well as from a bigger wardrobe , Great breakfast lots of fresh fruit and berries Neat and tidy through and through Courteous staff Club lounge is a welcome extra
208590,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, Leaving , Staff were attentive Club Lounge was a lovely sanctuary Jugged Hare was fabulous for dinner and breakfast Room had all the facilities you could wish for
208591,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, The towels and bathroom smelt of cigarette smoke which was unpleasant , The room was ammaculately presented the bed was very comfy the cupcakes were a lovely touch as was the fresh fruit and complimentary water The bathroom was amazing Had a lovely stay 
208592,The Montcalm At Brewery London City, From entering we found the reception staff a little over bearing We were upgraded to a club room but this club room didn t even have a bath , The location was handy as we managed to see the LDN beach rugby tourneament something we wouldn t have otherwise seen
