247149,London Bridge Hotel, The facilities are average To charge 180 for an average room two singles and not include a breakfast is money grabbing and not at all classy , The hotel is in a great location great concierge on Saturday 25th February 
247150,London Bridge Hotel, noise from outside even late in the evening maybe from a construction site or the railway and tube station Probably this is not the fault of the hotel but it was disturbing Cold draught from the window , The room was nice bed comfortable and cosy The reception staff extremely polite and cheerful Thank you for this 
247151,London Bridge Hotel, Don t be put off by the buffet Breakfast offered at 17 ahead the Hotel bar does food and a breakfast menu is available at a far more reasonable price pancakes and fresh fruit at 8 for example The thought of 68 on 4 breakfasts was giving me second thoughts on booking , Location brilliant across road from Tube and train and right under the Shard Rooms decent size and best of all every single member of staff was very friendly and went out of their way to offer help No noise from the traffic etc 
247152,London Bridge Hotel, No dressing gown or slippers, Close to London Bridge Hospital Used only as a base Didn t try any of the facilities Hotel was perfect for my requirements
247153,London Bridge Hotel, To say it was badged as a quality hotel I didn t expect to see towels and bedding along the corridor all day long our room was only cleaned once and it was very very late in the day 5pm The rooms were to small and the bed even smaller sorry but I won t be stopping again , Location only

247158,London Bridge Hotel, Thought room would have been bigger n a bit more to look at one window no view at all Were a smoke room but thought it smelt of stale cigarette s when walked in instead of clean, Staff very friendly
247159,London Bridge Hotel, The room was small and although the bed was wide it was too short it wasn t a 6ft long bed I m 5ft10 and several times I woke up during the night as my feet were hanging over the bottom of the bed it was uncomfortable Mentioned it to reception but they just shrugged and said yes that s because you re too tall , Friendly staff good location 
247160,London Bridge Hotel, Breakfast Very cramped sitting too close to others No privacy Asked to sign payment agreement for breakfasts when we entered the dinning room when we had already paid Told it was normal but not normal to us who have never been asked for that in any hotel Resturant Manager did behave as if we we were the ones out of line and made us feel uncomfortable , Location excellent staff very helpful without being imposing only staff member problem in resturant 
247161,London Bridge Hotel, Room was quite small and almost all the space was taken up by the large bed only one small window which had zero view as the glass was frosted Was all right for one person spending most of my time out of the room but would not have worked for two people a larger person or someone who needed to spend more time in the room for example working Plumbing in the room seemed old bathtub was slippery even when bath mat used whole mat slipped and toilet flush box would not refill after first use had to flush toilet by pouring a bucket of water manually and then call maintenance It was repaired the same evening but did not make a good impression Bathtub lacked any sizable shower enclosure making it hard to keep shower water in tub Wi Fi did not work well was very glitchy and not very useful for anything other than Facebook or light web browsing Upon one return to the hotel a doorman actually blocked my way until I explained I was a guest although he apologized when he realized I was actually staying there , Great location near the Shard very convenient to tube and close to many nice pubs casual food places post office etc Short walk to Embankment area with Borough Market and Shakespeare s Globe Room was classic clean and very comfortable for one person short stay The front desk attendant was very personable and helpful during my stay 
247162,London Bridge Hotel, smallish room and smallish bed Concierge desk right in front of entrance so you think that were you check in but its not , nice hotel comfortable amazing location
247163,London Bridge Hotel, If I could be fussy I would complain about the continuous train traffic and general London street noise but not that you can do anything about that , I liked the modern looking rooms with good tv Great selection in minibar and breakfast buffet Comfy bed and lovely staff 
247164,London Bridge Hotel, A little pricey for one night, Excellent location with really helpful and friendly staff We were made feel very welcome from the moment of our arrival The complimentary sparkling wine that evening was a lovely touch
247165,London Bridge Hotel, Small room no WiFi no breakfast and considering it was called London Bridge Hotel i expected it to have a view of the bridge which it doesn t but it is very close It definitely wasn t worth 180 per night I won t be staying there again or recommending it We were also in the room above the entrance 112 and it was quite noisy with people coming and going Oh and there is no view at all from the hotel just another building we could barely see because there are net curtains squeezed in between the outer glass and the sliding window with Venetian blinds in front of that Really not impressed , Well located for the tube station 
247166,London Bridge Hotel, Nothing bad to say , Stayed for one night with my girlfriend Loved the bed and the shower bath had a good pressure The cocktails were also great 
247167,London Bridge Hotel, The rooms are starting to look in need of TLC Chipped paint and bedside lights easy to knock your head against Bathroom felt cramped, Staff were excellent
247168,London Bridge Hotel, The prices in the hotel bar I know you pay London prices when visiting London but found it expensive for a drink I stayed here 3 nights and had 1 drink in the bar Says it all Buy from a shop and have a drink in your room , Location was perfect with the shard next to the hotel tower bridge and Tower of London a 5 min walk away plenty of pubs and bars in the area I would stay here again

247170,London Bridge Hotel, After checking into our room later the same day another couple we given our room Much to our surprise when they let themselves in whilst we were in the room Luckily neither myself or my husband were undressed showering at this time or even out leaving our valuables in the room Therefore our basic requirements of security and privacy were not met The staff did not contact us to apologise instead we had to complain and get upset with them before they would offer any compensation ,No Positive

247174,London Bridge Hotel, The room was very warm and the air conditioning didn t really make a difference also the lack of enough natural light wasn t nice Staff kept knocking on the doors to do stuff before we had checked out which was annoying, The staff on the desk were really lovely and upgraded us to a superior room with free sparkling wine as it was my partners 21st birthday The room was cosy and the bed very comfortable
