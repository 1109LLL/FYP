104414,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, No hot water for a bath Room smelt The whole hotel needs refurbishing Carpets are thirty years old Rooms need new basins painting tiling Noisy aircon, Big room comfy bed
104415,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, I booked the hotel based on the Mecure Terminus Nord website which looked really good beautiful old foyer huge breakfast room and lovely privilege room It was expensive but what I thought would be value for money given its rather swish look After we checked in we were sent to a supposed privilege room that only had a double bed and huge stains on the carpet After I complained loudly and bitterly seeking a full refund if they could not find us more suitable accommodation we were shown to a privilege room the same as the one I booked by phone and pre paid as shown on their website HOWEVER the hotel is undergoing MAJOR renovations which I did not see any reference to on the hotel s own website nor was it mentioned during my phone calls to the hotel prior to my travel So no big breakfast room instead a small buffet breakfast on offer at the temporary first floor reception Despite us being told that demolition reconstruction works did not begin until noon every morning at around 9am or earlier loud banging and crashing woke us up Then came the power outage We were on the fifth floor and had to negotiate the ancient stairs as the elevator was not working As a result of the power outage everyone was relocated to another Mecure hotel we were taxied to Mecure Montemartre which was actually awful and then expected to make our way back to Mecure Terminus Nord under our own steam After we did return to Mecure Terminus Nord we had a further two power outages due to the renovations one with no notification no water and no elevator again after heavy rain flooded the lift well Also despite wi fi supposedly being available throughout the hotel it was only very very occasionally available in our room There were issues with the pre paid accommodation me being billed on my credit card account for accommodation already paid for Reception staff was hopeless , The location was O K The hotel is in a bit of a dodgy area if you are the nervous type The Gare du Nord Metro station line 4 was only a minute away from the hotel The privilege room room we ended up with was spacious had blackout curtains and the two side by side king single beds were extremely comfortable 
104416,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, slow lift and only 1 working , Apparently undergoing a major reconditioning so the entrance was hard to find and a little awkward but OK Room good Breakfast good 
104417,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The room we were upgraded to was really shabby , We were upgraded to a small suite on our arrival due to the renovations going on at the hotel Nice idea 
104418,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, Very friendly staff self service breakfast with an interesting choice easy access to rooms and many rooms away from the lift Nice standard room I was delighted to stay in your hotel Thank you 
104419,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, The bed was comfortable and bathroom was adequate also Room had a bit of a smell to it but nothing too bad The neighbourhood was a little sketchy at night 
104420,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The hotel is undergoing refurbishment So the entrance is not very inviting Reception area was quite small , It is right next to the train station Location is ideal and lots of food options near the hotel We were able to check in 2 hours early Also we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel for the whole day after check out as well with no extra cost 
104421,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, I stayed earlier this year Jan 17 and was delighted with the room I stayed in Hence I made a return visit However on this ocassion I was very disappointed with condition of the room Clearly the hotel is in the process of renovation The building works did not disrupt my stay However the rate I paid for the poor condition of the room was not value for money , The service from the hotel staff was excellent The reception staff were most helpful with all my requests They generously gave me an adaptor for the duration of my stay and assisted with other requests The housekeeping service did a lovely job cleaning the room despite the poor condition of the room 
104422,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, There were no toiletries other than a very small soap for hand washing and a shower gel attached to the shower wall For some reason my room did not include breakfast , The hotel was across the street from Gare du Nord a quick easy walk The entrance was challenging to locate because it was literally a small doorway nestled between two restaurants The doorman was accommodating and helped direct me to reception Once checked in I was able to store my bag for the day The Hop on Hop off bus stop was again right across the street The room was nice but no shampoo I packed very light for a two day trip and took my shampoo out at the last minut I had to wash my hair with body wash located in the shower I also like a face cloth again there wasn t one in the room 
104423,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, On this visit there were one or two inconveniences resulting from the major construction and repair works which had been under way since March Thus the usual entrance of the hotel was out of bounds and everyone had to locate the alternative way in at ground floor level a few doors further down rue de Dunkerque There was a small desk inside but Reception was on the first floor via a lift This lift was the only one in operation in the hotel for guests and staff alike and was understandably busy Because of the works being done quite a lot of the hotel rooms were out of action These were not major problems at all and I still enjoyed my stay and will certainly use the hotel again in the future I may have missed it but there seemed to be no advance notification of this state of affairs when I made the original booking or in the subsequent emails I received as my arrival date drew near The first I knew of it was when I actually arrived at the hotel when I was tired with my train journey and looking forward to settling in Keeping all this in proportion however I still thoroughly enjoyed my stay , The position of the hotel is excellent right opposite the Gare du Nord very close to Metro access and above one of my favourite Parisian restaurants namely the brasserie Terminus Nord 23 rue de Dunkerque My room was spotlessly clean well appointed and quiet The staff are very friendly and helpful particularly at Reception the bagagiste was very good in organising a taxi for me to get to CDG Airport in time for my flight home Another good point is the availability of room service 7 7 and 24 24 The choice of food and drinks was quite a wide one it arrived promptly exactly as I had ordered and it was delicious 
104424,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Breakfast too expensive , Second time I ve stayed at this hotel and would gladly stay again Perfect location just outside the Gare du Nord metro station It was my boyfriend s birthday and the hotel management got us 2 small bottles of wine and some chocolates together with a nice birthday thought written on a note We are so grateful Big rooms compared to other hotel rooms in Paris and very clean Nice view of the train station from our small balcony Great experience overall Will definitely stay here if I visit Paris in the near future 
104425,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, You should hold your head in shame sending guest to this building site , Nothing had we known that the building work was going on we would not have booked
104426,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Reception can be managed in the same property or in a better good way by having full time service reachability Was not reachable via phone , Good property with nice view 
104427,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Property was being renovated lift took awhile room on roof small with only sky lights no soap at sink couldnt get shower gel lid off only one milk for coffee expect a lot more from 4 Mercure hotel, Good staff nice bed
104428,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Sadly for us there was no electricity in the room when we woke up Apparently a specific technical problem that would be rectified However nobody apologised to us or notified us of the problem The was lots of construction going on in the building but from our room we did not hear the construction , Great location for Gare du Nord it was across the road from the station Bed the was comfy and the shower was a good one although it was over the bath Good value for money 
104429,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The hotel has changed adress because of renewing the entrance and it is not mentioned on the site and google maps brings you to the previous entrance that is closed as a result i was looking around to find the entrance with 30 kgr of baggage and while it was raining I get there and no elevator If you like adventure go for it , Nothing
104430,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The room was a bit small and stuffy , Close to Gare du Nord station and easy to get to after the train journey Excellent transport links Staff were excellent friendly and helpful 
104431,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Hotel is under a huge renovation This was not stated on booking com or communicated by the hotel My current room was old and you noticed they didnt repear anymore for a while Got a nice big room in a quiet part of the hotel with free drinks and coffee so that was great Had a good stay ,No Positive
104432,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Worn down carpets No soap in bathroom Old towels that are way past usage for that price Mercure hotels have always bern excellent in the past This was terrible in comparison My brand loyalty has been broken for sure , Location to station
104433,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, I happened to get an old room which was fine by me as i was only spending 1 night there to catch an early train however it was quite old and the carpet really needed changing , Excellent location a 1 minute walk from Gard du Nord Bathroom modern and clean Bed is comfortable Staff is helpful 
104434,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, It was dingy dark had tatty furnishings and it looked like someone had poured bleach all over the carpet There was no hot water when I tried to fill the sink to get washed so had to boil the kettle I will certainly not be staying in this hotel again and I can t believe that it was around the same price as the Mercure Gare de Lyon which was lovely , It was right next to the station so easy for our Eurostar home the next morning 
104435,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Room was a little dated and in need of a refurb , Very central and even though it was in the middle of a busy area very quiet inside Great air conditioning 
104436,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, in desperate need of making it look attractive Paint chips old toilet basin and seat even wash basin looks old worn out paper thin towels Very very basic If I knew what I would be getting I would have never booked , It s clean 
104437,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Hotel looks like it s in the middle of a renovation as some of the stairwell walls need attention as well as some of the bathrooms , Decent sized rooms bars and restaurants downstairs really close to Gare du Nord train station Staff welcoming and friendly 
104438,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, It was appallingly bad value for money Equivalent to a 3 hotel at 5 prices The hotel is clearly profiting from the proximity to the station to charge crazy prices My room was dark drab overlooking a drab apartment block Carpet was stained facilities were basic It is nothing like the photo displayed on the various web sites , Proximity to Gare du Nord
104439,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, although there were renovations everything was fine, Location was extremely good for us as we wanted to travel from the Gare Du Nord the next morning and the motel is directly opposite The concierge Mulhoud was very helpful with fixing a problem with our travelex card 
104440,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, There were works going on which didn t really affect us but made the hotel a little hard to spot as we came out of the station Only one lift which was slow at times , Perfect location and we were ask which side of the building we wanted to be on Asked for Gare du Nord side incredible view and not too noisy either Balcony so we could people watch Clean comfy room all the basics provided Really friendly staff on reception especially when we tried out our French 
104441,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Everything especially, It is a shame to booking com to introduce this hotel as a 4star hotel they were rebuilding the hotel and they didn t have even alobby there was many differnt between the picture and the hotel the beds simply move and separate we have ordered a big bed for rooms but unfortunately they have attached two single bed that separate from eachother simply
104442,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Quite cheap looking for a 4 star The room wa sa bit small the bathroom is big but the shower has almost no pressure and feels like a 1 Star hotel one , Location is grand right in front of one of the Gare Du Nord Main entrance 
104443,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The hotel was undergoing renovation so the main entrance was unavailable and there was only one lift operational which seemed a bit slow Can t be helped I suppose if there is work taking place Seemed more expensive than my last visit exacerbated by poor exchange rate for GBP I remember a comfortable bar lounge from an earlier visit this must have been in the closed off part of the hotel the bar this time was by the temporary reception desk and a lot less cosy A shame really However this was a nice time of year for sitting outside in one of the many bars lining the street outside so no great problem Overall still worth staying here and I will return in the future , Room was nice and comfy Location is great for picking up metro RER or walking to closer locations e g Montmartre is about 15 mins 
104444,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, I wouldn t stay here if I was in Paris for a few days I d go to a much nicer area of Paris The hotel is undergoing some renovations and the entry to the hotel was somewhat difficult to find , The hotel is in a fantastic location if you will be using the Gare Du Nord railway station as its directly opposite I had a room with two single beds but they were made up as a double so there was penalty of bed space The room was quite large and the bathroom was positively massive The room had tea coffee making facilities wireless internet and the desk had both a European and British power outlet Just before you arrive check your room booking you might be able to change to a slightly different room type and save a bit of money The day before I arrived I switched from a double bed to two singles and saved about 60 euros The two single beds were about the same as a double 
104445,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Property is currently under refurbishment which makes the current facilities very poor and the rooms fairly run down certainly not the 4 star rating Very old carpet 1 lift to serve both clients and servicing Unfortunately this was not clearly stated when booking the room online ,No Positive
104446,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Need renovate the rooms to modern standards and to improve the internet They just can t sell the rooms just cause of the location as for 250 300 euro there are lot of other options also available in the city , Location is good Staff was very helpful The rooms need upgradadtion renovation as the furnishings and attachments are very old fashioned or outdated Internet was bad hardly got connectivity in he room 
104447,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Have stayed at hotel previously and loved it Hotel being renovated and rate was dearer than when we stayed previously No toiletries apart from shower gel in shower Not the usual standard for a 4 star hotel Was disappointed Even the tea coffee wasn t enough for two people , Location and staff friendly 
104448,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Noise smell of old fittings Rubbish WIFI , Very very noisy outside first night until 04 15 second night until 06 15 Hotel very tired threadbare carpets needs a complete refurbishment 
104449,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, the back entrance and lack of facilities as half the hotel was being upgraded Also we had an evening and the several hours the next day with no water A pipe had been ruptured by the builders , the view of Gard du Nord from the window
104450,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Sadly being sited near a major travel hub Gare du Nord the area had an abundance of immigrants who could be quite noisy and intimidating with Hotel Staff aware and cautioning guests The hotel is undergoing some renervations and the reception is temporarily based on the first floor Not the best of restaurants in the local area but bars were vibrant and busy , Hotel staff very friendly and helpful We only stayed one night so can t comment on food Located well for station and metro 
104451,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, This property very tired urgently needs total upgrading 2nd floor commenced Just painting chipping from surfaces would be a great improvement , Location
104452,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Room was too hot room was too dark Room two lights broken Could not fix A C Room was too hot We have to open Window literally and ask for stand fan We were very very disappointed , Staff people very friendly
104453,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Undoubtedly the worst Mercure hotel in the world It was being renovated but for 267 a night was vastly over priced considering the state of the building and the dreadful lift system Much needs to be done to make it satisfactory and worth even half the room rate The Mercure brand is badly damaged by this property , The bed was comfortable 
104454,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The area around the train station is not pleasant Lots of homeless and some junkies You have to be careful anyway where ever you go , The location is great and easy to find The room is clean and have enough amenities to use The breakfast is good too 
104455,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, It was a shame there were major building works so there were difficulties with some noise and facilities , convenience of position very helpful staff especially Maloud despite renovation difficulties cheerful help with baggage and information etc 
104456,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, Very friendly staff Pleasant clean quiet hotel very central to Gare du Nord and easy to get to Eurostar Pleasant area Breakfast was of a good standard 
104457,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Was not aware that the hotel is undergoing major renovations for some time yet I arrived with the stylish main entry shown in the photos being closed off by high metal fencing and a note directing guest to the temporary entry This was around the corner through a narrow passage way and reception was on the 1st floor Only one lift to be used by guests and staff so could take quite a long time to move from floor to floor at busy times I feel that guests like me who booked well in advance last year should have been notified of these inconveniences and given the chance to choose elsewhere , Directly across the road from Gare du Nord Plenty of good restaurants and cafes around it Decor of the room was good with a comfortable lounge chair and small round table as well as a long desk 
104458,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, What didn t I like Everything Major refurb for next year which they don t tell you about so expect noise only one lift for all hotel and that seems to be guests and staff and it keeps breaking Reception is temporary on floor 1 breakfast is reduced choice and in temporary room a small room Cleaning staff will nock then enter your room despite it being Day of check out in my case at 08 15 why not wait till check out , What did I like Not a lot 
104459,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, None, We re just off from our 7 day tour and we ll be traveling back to Amsterdam early next day I actually choose this hotel because it is near the North Station But this was a great choice this hotel surrounded by restaurant and just by crossing the street you re at the North Station Staff were so accommodating and really attentive to their clients Actually upon check in I have concerned because I accidentally left my backpack with video cam and camera inside the tour bus Staff were so helpful to assist me on how to contact our tour guide to retrieve my bag To you all thank you Well then recommend this hotel to my friends 
104460,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, My complain is about my whole experience in this hotel For start it is NOT a 4 star hotel not even a 3 star I m not kidding when I say that I ve stayed in 2 star hotels better than this It is big a disappointment I feel I had been fooled No amenities at the bathroom old and small towels no fridge terrible shower outdated decoration no breakfast Mercure should be ashamed about this hotel I talked to a person who was checking out at the same time I was and his opinion is the same When a member of the staff asked about my stay I told him it is not a 4 star hotel and he said to me oh this is normal in Paris Really Is it okay to lie about the number of hotel stars in Paris Sorry but my expectations about a 4 star are higher than you can offer I was celebrating my wedding anniversary and my only desire was to be in an actual 4 star room , Localization just across the street from Gare du Nord nice staff size of the room 
104461,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The wifi was very poor in our room Room was a bit stuffy Guess the staff aired it was better the next couple of days, The location was close to the main station and the metro Good eating options nearby 
104462,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Hotel undergoing refurb that is badly needed Decor outside and in communal areas shabby and decaying Strong smell of cigarettes in stairwell staff possibly using stairwell to smoke in Had to give card and input pin for more than double the cost of hotel room Advised this would not be charged as just a guarantee but still felt uncomfortable , Lovely room with good facilities and sooo close to the station
104463,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Breakfast at hotel could have been included or information about a local place that would have been a good bet early in morning, go for external room with balcony and typical Parisien view try the bars locally and eat locally so you just get a feel for the atmosphere dont let the foreigners put you off with their begging ways
104464,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Due to renovation I couldn t locate main entrance as gated off Had to ask enter a shop and ask how to get in The hotel need to text guests prior Not very clean but understandable Hope the hotel looks good after but will see what happens to prices , Location and price 
104465,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, One lift was out of service and when we ordered room service we received the wrong salad , Very near Gare du Nord for our Eurostar journey Lots of good restaurants and cafes nearby We were upgraded to a nice room with a new of Sacre Coeur 
104466,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Staff member Aurellion may have a few letters wrong he was the rudest and unhelpful member of staff I have ever met I was left speechless with the way he treated me , Location
104467,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Reality is different from what it was shown in the pictures So we were disappointed a bit as the cost paid doesnt match the stay, location and staff were good
104468,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Room was small The hotel is old and tired need updating Facilities were cleaned but if feels dirty as it s worn , Good location very close to Gare du North
104469,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The hotel stuff they need moor training how to deal with customers and smiles bit moor Very bad hotel with very bad stuff attitude , hotel stuff was extremely rude the FOH stuff need to smile moor The house keeping was ok 
104470,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Shower head over is over a bathtub which is raised from the floor some extra centimeters coupled with a rather slippery floor without extra handles this makes getting off the bathtub a little uncomfortable Common areas could do with some renovation refurbishing as some carpet is worn out and parts of the decor seem as if they ve seen their best days already , It has a very convenient location in front of Gare du Nord station with another subway line 4 entrance right in front of the hotel door The staff was excellent and very nice Breakfast is good at the price charged with quality ingredients in a room with great views of the street scene below 
104471,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Low water pressure in shower very small rooms single beds very small almost falling over when one turns over Floor in room with stains and General fixtures and fittings a bit jaded , Location and staff were great
104472,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, 1 the spiders We spotted at least 3 spiders in the room One hanging down from the ceiling two in the bath tub 2 the water is too hot we can t adjust the temperature of the water 3 the room looked old It wasn t quite like other Mercure hotel experiences that we ve had before , Location Since we consider the Gare du Nord district a big dangerous the hotel which is just opposite the station saved us time walking along the road the district It s just right opposite the station And it s probably the only thing I liked about the hotel 
104473,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Cleanliness of the room was disgusting Drink in the room was finished while we were out Staff not helpful Asked 6 times for extra cups and didn t receive it Asked for ice to the room and never received it Plug in the bathroom didn t work Hairdryer was so slow it would be quicker to hang your head outside, Location
104474,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, The room has a balcony and of comfortable size People are very friendly There s a kettle in the room which is quite handy for a tea drinking person like me 
104475,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The hotel is very tired and dirty Reception staff were not helpful or friendly Dusty room with stained carpet and disgusting bathroom , Perfect location
104476,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, the rest of the room bathroom was old and really worn It was clean but because everything was so old and worn it felt dirty esp the carpet They have a lot of different prices for rooms so I guess we got what we paid for , easy location right next to gare du nord if you arrive late or have to leave early bed was great and new 
104477,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The rooms are well used and need a refurbishement like marks on the floor etc the bath is unite old with breaks in the tiles and also not completely clean even after room service , Very close to Gare du Norde opposite side of the street best location when coming with the train Perfect connection for pubic transportation Good free wifi with sufficient speed to stream music and videos
104478,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Rooms were small and furnishings weren t updated new especially for the price per night A higher floor room was requested but not provided despite low occupancy , Good connections with Metro and trains and helpful staff 
104479,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, I did not have hot water when I went to take a shower I was provided with a small bar of soap but no further amenities like shampoo conditioner or body lotion The TV did not work The big standing lamp did not work It got really hot in my room and I could not get the air conditioner to work One of the elevators was broken so when leaving in the morning and people decided to take the stairs if they did not have too much luggage , I enjoyed the balcony and also enjoyed the view The breakfast in morning was very good and the restaurant in the hotel was amazing 
104480,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The hotel is tired and in need of updating Carpet in our bedroom was stained and the bathroom could do with an overhaul The bar is dingy and lacks atmosphere , Location is great if you want to be near the Eurostar terminus but otherwise the area is a bit rough overall Staff were very friendly Not bad for the nightly rate cheap and cheerful 
104481,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Dirty rooms to the point you didn t want to take off shoes Paint chips and massive cracks in the tiles both floor and shower Leather on headboard and around tv was old and pealing Room was tiny Like Harry Potter under the stairs tiny , None of the bonus question answer were appropriate
104482,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, Large room compared to the Paris average close to an important station easy access from there to any other point in Paris staff extremely friendly both to us and to our dog We booked this place for two separate nights and asked to have the same room the staff were happy to oblige and this contributed very much to the comfort of our pet who could recognize his surroundings The room comes with tea and coffee facilities a great breakfast a complimentary bottle of water and an exceedingly comfortable bed 
104483,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The surrounding neighbourhood is not so safe not a place you want to be out at night For this reason when I m in Paris I only stay there the one night before I take the Eurostar , The location is excellent for access to the Gare du Nord and the Eurostar I ve stayed in this hotel twice already for the ease of catching the early morning Eurostar It s just across the street The rooms have kettles so leaving too early for breakfast won t deprive one of coffee The price of the room compared to the other equally convenient hotels is a bargain 
104484,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Could do with small fridge heater in the bathroom or dryer for the towels , Room quite nice and really big bathroom Porters nice and always ready to help 
104485,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The photo shown while booking is misleading The room was very small Bathroom shower was broken Old hotel with old carpets Not worth the money Breakfast was average , Nothing in particular 
104486,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Terrible FIRST OF ALL they asked 300EU deposit for the mini bar and the room didn t even had a mini bar It wasn t even written on the policies of the hotel or the booking For two days we had no soap in the room they totally forgot to put any The room had no view at all all I saw was pipes The wifi was weak everywhere and after all it needs improvement in all departments ,No Positive
104487,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, When we got our free upgrade we were charged an additional 66 AUD which the hotel claim would be refunded it s been almost a month and we re still waiting , The hotel is in a fantastic location directly opposite Gare du Nord This means you don t need to walk far to get away from the dodgy lowlifes who prey on tourists around the station We got a free upgrade to a nicer room so that was good Breakfast wasn t cheap but very good quality and convenient 
104488,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The room is too small it even has no table for me to work , Perfect location for train and metro And there is a lot of good restaurant by 15mins walking or 2 metro station away 
104489,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, very old worn down rooms Our room wasn t clean at all terrible smell from the toilet hair on the floor hair in the bed slow check in check out slow wifi unfriendly staff very noisy uncomfortable bed no double bed only two twin beds pushed together too expensive for what it is , good location 
104490,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Somewhat worn Needs refurbishment There was no desk in the room just a coffee table which is inconvenient if you need to work Street was a bit noisy Perhaps the rooms with a view of the interior of the building are quieter , Convenient location Spacious room Good breakfast Good wifi
104491,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The room was small in comparison to the photos online Doors looked battered and old the bathroom was also battered and in need of refurbishment Wi fi not so good Very big hotel and everything seems squeezed in Expensive for what we got , The location Not too much noise considering where we were Lots of nice cafes all around 
104492,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Fees, The most fascinating points is that Mercure Paris Terminus Nord is very close to transportation either metro or bus Another point worth mentioning is that for Muslims you will find many restaurants neXT to the hotel Breakfast is very delicious specially croissant Stuff is very helpful and friendly If they could reduce the fees it would be better 
104493,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The bath plug was stuck and we couldn t drain water from the bath so called reception Reception told us they would send someone up to help us but no one turned up so had to call again Carpet was not very clean Payment was taken twice for some reason and was a pain to sort out after the trip , The bed was comfortable The location was very convenient right across the street from Gare du Nord great if you re using Eurostar Good selection of foods for breakfast Got upgraded to a superior room Staff were friendly 
104494,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, The location couldn t have been better right opposite Gare du Nord The staff were all friendly and the room was comfortable and cosy It was good to have tea making facilities in the room 
104495,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, I got bitten by bed bugs on the bed , Great breakfast Loved their fresh squeezed orange juice I also appreciated having the opportunity to take a bath in my room 
104496,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Was a bit noisy in view of the location , Public transport train bus metro are all in front of the hotel lots of food options as well from fastfood to fine dining 
104497,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, A poor state of room dirty stained carpets broken furniture A decaying bathroom and door we got a small TV that hardly worked lots of bad signal which resulted in poor TV reception A grotty room on 2nd floor Poor view we were very disappointed with the hotel Does Booking Account Regional Managers actually visit these hotel and rooms A very different experience compared to the website pictures I did not take pictures as this would be very embarrassing to put on the web I did there stay a few times in single rooms so was ok for 1 day night stay But very disappointed in our room for 4 days and added to all costs a rather poor expensive choice of hotel , The location was fine for transport links to other areas of Paris by Train Metro and Bus Lots of official Taxis Staff were friendly and polite 
104498,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The hotel is old and would need refurbishment the carpet everywhere in the room and curtains do not give a feeling of cleanliness For the price and announced standing service is poor caf is lyophilis basic shampoo no body cream television was ridiculously old and small and all the programs apart from the French one were blurred , Location
104499,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Room possibly could benefit from redecoration But was clean , Plenty of choice at breakfast Good quality food A bit expensive though at 17 euros View from our gave us clear sight of Sacre Couer Location to Metro and Eurostar was perfect 
104500,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Two elderly towels a sink that didn t drain properly and a useless hairdryer fixed to the wall Hospitality tray mean spirited one tiny milk carton , Bed was comfortable and lobby and bar area good 
104501,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, When I saw the pictures of the rooms on line I was under the impression that there was a small fridge microwave , The Staff was excellent The breakfast was really good Thx 
104502,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, Extremely helpful staff and quiet rooms The wifi was a bit patchy but otherwise I love this place The rooms are simple with just what you need which is perfect for me

104709,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, We were initially given a smoking room and I have no idea how that happened However the staff made it right and put us in a really nice non smoking room on a higher floor after The downside of the location It feels like a dangerous high crime area Sirens all times of the day and night We saw a theft and brawl in the middle of our dinner from inside the restaurant beside the hotel with a victim being carried out by stretcher The restaurant owners were great and very calm but it was a little unnerving for us To be clear we felt very safe in the hotel , The location was ideal if you are travelling by train from Gare du Nord as it is literally across the street from the station The breakfast was the best we had during our stay in Paris Coffee fresh juices fruits pastries cheeses and meats It was really good 
104710,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Wow Finally time for some reviews 1 Really bad staff on duty Very Very unhelpful 2 Geoffroy Rumpler Front Office Manager Delphina were two of the rudest staff we ever met throughout our Europe Trip 3 Room had no bedroom slippers no fridge bathroom was practically empty with no facilities carpet was filthy Mr Rumpler our dear Front Office Manager had the audacity to claim THIS IS MERCURE S STANDARD I would like to let you know that I applaud you for being so honest with me because you are now allowing me to tell everyone how disgusting Mercure Hotels are 4 Delphina Front Desk Staff was the most unwelcoming staff there 5 Despite the bad stay I would like to give credit to the Concierge did not take down his name for being the most helpful staff at the hotel He pushed our luggages across to the station when we were leaving and was sincerely nice I guess if you really want to stay here this is the only guy that will make your day Other than that please avoid this hotel having to go through what I went through would be so sickening Overall BAD STAY ruined our mood in Paris For the price we paid I can advise you to find a better hotel avoid this MERCURE STANDARD hotel , Location Opposite Station Good for Travellers taking Eurostar To From Paris
104711,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Found the building carpet TV and bathroom a bit tiered and no gym Definitively not what I would class as a 4 star hotel compared to other hotels around the world probably more 3 star , Bed was very comfy and enjoyed the complimentary coffee machine and soft drinks
104712,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Carpet really badly needed a shampoo It was clean but very stained , Comfortable spacious room with great view of the elegant Gare du Nord Tea making facilities made life so much more enjoyable Breakfasts were delicious next door to the fab restaurant Terminus du Nord and close to the wonderfully friendly Cafe du Nord Right opposite where you arrive by Eurostar at Gare du Nord which is a beautiful building Transport links to everything you want to visit in Paris including Versailles are great very helpful and friendly staff in all areas 
104713,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Dangerous part at night as some other part in the city of Paris Room is small , Location for business and easy access to the airport being in the city
104714,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The only thing I can say was the bathroom probably needed a little more lighting Other than that the hotel is just what you need, The location near the station was great considering the train services in Paris We were able to jump on the Metro outside the front door and catch it back with great ease 
104715,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, room a bit small but that was expected in France would have liked a better view room only had one small window overlooking the rooftop , great location comfortable bed friendly staff 
104716,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The room could of been cleaner, The hotel was situated near railway station which was perfect for us on a first visit to Paris would difinately stay there again
104717,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, A bit pricy , Fantastic location right across the street from Gare du Nord Ideal for Eurostar and Thalys travellers From my room I had an impressive view ove the station Friendly staff Nice and comfy rooms 
104718,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The room was a little small but otherwise quite nice , Excellent location due to it being close to Montmartre as well as directly across the stree from Gare Du Nord train and metro station The entrance to the metro station is literally 10 steps from the front door of the hotel 
104719,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Breakfast was too expensive Didn t have it , Everything The location is just brilliant It s the first thing you see when you get out of Gare du Nord Wi Fi connection was really good Room was very spacious unlike most hotel rooms in Paris Air Condition worked good as well Perfect hotel in Paris 
104720,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The room thermostat could not be set below a certain level and did not function to cool the room even to that it was necessary to open the window to reduce the temperature to an acceptable level , This hotel is extremely conveniently located immediately opposite Gare du Nord The room was comfortable and fairly large and had a spacious bathroom with a bath There were sheets on the bed not just a duvet The booking com price was acceptable for a city location rack rents looked exhorbitant 
104721,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The bathroom was a little dated the showered head loose and needed tightening A fridge ould be nice, It s convenient for Gare du Nord and because of this I have returned there several times 
104722,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The carpet in the bedroom was quite old I realise some rooms are refurbished and probably cost more so for what I paid I am not complaining the room bathroom and the bed was very clean but it could have done with a decor face lift, The staff were very welcoming helpfull and friendly especially Jullien the place to leave baggage was excellent very safe and well organised breakfast was very good the bar area was nice although seemed more busy in the afternoon not in the evening
104723,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Hotel d cor is a little tired but acceptable No evening dining room, Good hotel perfect location Great breakfast and 10 off meal at adjacent restaurant but quite expensive

104725,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Hotel is a little tired and during our stay there was a problem with the TV reception , Well located close to the Metro RER Eurostar Good breakfast Helpful staff
104726,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Everything could have been better starting with the room that is nothing like you see in the pictures the building and the rooms are very old doesn t deserve not even 2 star hotel The location has a weird neiberhood and the taxi drivers will try to take more money from you The elevators are small if you have a baby stroller , The best thing in this hotel was the the breakfast with a lot of variety 
104727,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Nothing really just the room needed a little TLC but overall comfortable and clean and the location was excellent I would stay again , The bed was very comfortable and since we were here for 4 nights it was great Breakfast was good everything you could want for breakfast was there The location was excellent so close to the Gard de Nord station just out the door and across the street literally 3 minutes walk but it was a little noisy at night if you faced out onto the street There were so many eating places around the hotel so no problems there having to travel to eat The room did need a little TLC but overall comfortable and clean 
104728,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The area is a bit too crowded Not a quiet area for a leisure walk , In front of Gare Du Nord with a balcony to see the station and Sacre Coure very convenient for the stop over in Paris 
104729,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The hotel is not fully equipped No bath rope and slippers Iron and ironing board have to be shared , The location is convenient to move from point to point 
104730,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, nothing to say, Great breakfast buffet in a spacious room overlooking the quite beautiful front side of the Gare du Nord I will come back just for this Nice staff 
104731,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, close to gare du nord but quiet nice balcony with view It meet our needs well that was to stay one night and pick up a rental car fron the station next day Thankyou Mecure
104732,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, There no one carrying my bag in the arrival The furniture its old and not clean from inside the carpet dirty and there no small fridge in the room, It s near to a metro
104733,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Pricy as all accommodation in Paris , Perfect location for taking an early morning Thalys train literally 50 meters from the station Despite the dodgy area around the hotel the hotel itself is safe and nice looking Friendly personnel rooms are fine The bathroom needed some refurbishment but is decent for a short one night stay and this is not the hotel where you would spend much time
104734,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Very small room to begin with I asked for it to be changed The neighbouring Gare du nord is more and more unsafe and discomforting tramps everywhere dirty streets The area is going down the drain , Staff responsiveness to fix a problem broken window Security Great restaurant 
104735,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The sink was stained the shower door was too small and so you always had to keep an eye on water leaking over the side Room service was expensive as you would expect anywhere but not particularly great Breakfast is very expensive at 17 per person but can t speak as to quality of food as price out me off TV signal is still analogue and the TV itself is not great quality , Right across from the station Helpful staff UK socket in the room 
104736,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The location although convenient for various sightseeing activities the area around the hotel is a bit downmarket , Simple and elegant d cor but the best thing was the staff everyone I had contact with was friendly and amazingly helpful 
104737,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The bathroom was quite old and not as nice as the photographs The toilet is right next to door so inconvenient when going in and out of bathroom Also there was not a fan in the bathroom Also the shower was not powerful at all and the TV had poor signal Also the local restaurants were all quite expensive , Location was ideal if getting Eurostar Close to metro station 
104738,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, you charged me extra money which was not there and you said its tax per person in all hotels well i have been in alot of hotels in paris and they never charge me extra,No Positive
104739,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Not much I suppose if you re picky you ll find that the carpet may look a bit tired and you ll be annoyed that the TV channels appear to be sorted randomly If you don t have a special fare like I had you may find it a bit expensive , I had a very good experience last minute booking done very late in the evening 23 00 came with a very good price Room is comfortable and quite clean and comfy bed too You feel safe and cosy in the hotel Hotel staff very polite and nice Excellent a bit pricy restaurant Brasserie right next door stays open till 1 30 am Top location if you commute especially very early from Gare du Nord or Gare de l Est 
104740,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, There was no shower cap in my room This was the same on my last visit , The quiet solid rooms and the bar area and service the Breakfasts were excellent 
104741,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, 1 I booked the room with flexible rate but unfortunately the reception desks staff gave me the room that has no good view but my staffs were given a good view room 2 Misunderstanding of room reservation payment , room location
104742,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, This hotel exceeded expectations The room was spacious by Paris standards with comfy beds We had a room at the back and it was very quiet Full bath Tea and coffe making facilities Right across the road from Gare Du Nord so excellent location if you have an early train or if you just want good access yo the station Free wifi worked well Multinational tv channels Plenty of restauarant close by 
104743,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Staff not helpful I checked out the night before so I could get away in the morning as there are queues a reception They told me I d have the bill emailed It wasn t and I ve called 4 times since to be told the bill will be emailed I m still waiting for the bill , the bar area was comfortable
104744,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The view was awful as we were in a room looking into the centre of the hotel I have stayed here before and had a view of station which I must say was preferable, Lovely room with a massive bed which as I was sharing with my 11 Yr old son was a godsend as he does like to throw himself around a bit at night Staff were very helpful Breakfast was great and had plenty of choice
104745,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, N A, Friendly and helpful staff Very clean and comfortable rooms Easy access to Eurostar It wad great to be able to leave our luggage in the hotel sfter check outwhilst we went exploring before catching the train home
104746,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, For a four star hotel the standard of the decor in the bedrooms and bathrooms was very worn and disappointing In my bathroom the sink was cracked and there were black patches mould or missing paint around the windows Others of my party had carpets that needed cleaning and a poor standard in their bathrooms My party of 6 had paid two months ahead for four rooms 2 singles a double and a twin The twin and the double were the same price and more expensive than the 2 single rooms Yet the couple who had the double room had the smallest room with the same size small double bed as in the single rooms plus they had the sloping roof causing the room to feel even smaller and more uncomfortable There was an unsatisfactory response to their complaints , The location was very convenient being opposite the Gare du Nord It was very easy to find transport links to Giverny by train and to other parts of Paris by bus There was also a Metro station right outside The breakfast was of the expected standard but expensive at 17euros The beds were reasonably comfortable 
104747,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Would expect the express breakfast to be complimentary at least Stay was comfortable , The breakfast was hearty Access to transportation is great 
104748,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The room was a bit compact although the bathroom was huge and it s a little expensive , There was a huge selection at breakfast the room was comfortable and quiet and the location is excellent literally right outside the Gare du Nord and just a short walk to the Gare de l Est 
104749,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, There was no mattress on the bed just a piece of soft foam which caused us both to roll to the middle of the bed so we couldn t really sleep , We were given a room upgrade on arrival to a nice room with a balcony overlooking Gare Du Nord
104750,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Seventeen Euros for a sub par breakfast buffet Really , Often the big hotel right across the way from the train station is not very good Why would it be It looks OK on the web and you get there it s a total let down This is NOT the case with Mercure It s a good hotel it lives up to its billing it delivers on its promises 
104751,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Room did not gave a mini fridge but this was my only concern Everything else was brilliant , View was great from 6th floor was able to absorb the real feel of Paris life below Fantastic location if travelling on Eurostar
104752,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Despite confirmed reservation and prepayment checking in was tedious, Great location for arriving and departing Gare du Nord Also great for exploring Paris
104753,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The room it s so small and and carpet in the room very dirty and there no fridge in the room and there no service in hotel no one carry our luggage during check in and check out this hotel it s should be rated for 2 star not 4, It s near to a station
104754,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Breakfast choice and quality were good but a tad overpriced for people who want only a light breakfast , Once connected and it was a bit tricky the wifi was excellent Convenience to the Gare du Nord superb 
104755,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, A very minor negative but the shower was a bit flimsy it was all made of plastic The pipe also plastic had a kink in it When it was working it kept falling off the wall The shower was really weak too not much power , I got a really good deal on the room so my expectations were low I was very pleasantly surprised The staff were excellent I was made to feel very welcome My French isnt great but the staff were very understanding and let me have a go despite them all speaking excellent English The hotel was in a great location the hotel door is right next to a metro exit and opposite Gare du Nord which made leaving for an early flight so much easier The room was immaculate everything I could possibly need plus the room nice and warm I loved that I could adjust the heat and the bed was lovely and comfy I wish UK hotels were this standard 
104756,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The double room was so small almost like a single room but with a double bed we had to upgrade to a triple room in order to find space to place our bags and get a bigger bed Breakfast buffet was exactly the same every day , The location is very convenient just in front of the gare du nord metro station 
104757,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Shower poor Room not cleaned when we returned for a siesta at 2 30 and asking the manager to sort it out didn t work as the room was again uncleaned at 2 30 the next day Oh dear Reception got its knickers in a twist because we d paid cash for our breakfast on the last day Oh dear again , Location was perfect The room large comfortable and clean The lift prompt and the breakfast delicious Great french windows balcony and view Cleaning lady was lovely and the breakfast and bar staff very professional Grateful for the room to be located near the lift as requested 
104758,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Room was quite small didn t have a 4 feel to it, Big Shout out to Lou who was so helpful every morning Booking tickets printing tickets and offering advice on anything we needed Great location as the train station is just opposite 
104759,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The bedroom decor was tired the carpet was not acceptable as there were stains and what appeared to be bleach marks The bath had two large chips the size of a 2 euro coin and we had to ask for the bath plug , The bed and pillows were VERY comfortable The views to the Gard du Noir were superb The Metro is outside the hotel s front door and the Gard du Noir is across the road 
104760,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, A great location opposite Gard du Nord station so great for getting to either airport or eurostar also on metroline going into city centre Was on 5th floor and noise was minimal Plenty of places to eat and drink nearby too 
104761,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Sink in the bathroom was quite old and you can clearly see that it s been overused Carpets are not the nicest Noise from outside can be heard inside even though the window was closed , the bed was super comfortable It was ok to check out at 1pm instead of 12 noon 
104762,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The rest is awful Terrible room quality small thin door you hear everything No renovation in room, The hotel is located in a very comfortable place
104763,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, I have been put in to room no 643 first Room was horrible and could not turn around after putting my 2 suite cases inside aproched front desk Julia was so helpful and put me in another room which was excellent Suggest you to not to give rooms like 643 to any one as they may grade wrong on hotel My stay as exellent meet rooms and services Jay,No Positive
104764,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The room and toilet were badly in need of renovation The ink was terribly chipped and looked dirty The furnishings in the room had condensation marks on the wall The room needs to have better sound proofing as it faced the train station , Location was excellent for Eurostar Hotel staff kindly kept our bags until our departure time The concierge was excellent he knew us by sight even though we only stayed one night and helped us with our bags 
104765,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Cleanliness was not good in the bathroom dirty windows chipped bath and sink plug failed to operate Trays left in corridor and they began to smell Carpets in corridors were worn Breakfast bacon very greasy and scrambled egg very watery Nespresso machine broke down and was inadequate to supply the number of guests ,No Positive
104766,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Nothing springs to mind , Room very spacious and overlooking rear courtyard so very quiet Great position opposite Gare du Nord Price as expected for city centre Quick check in and check out very efficient staff very helpful in recommending a restaurant and gave us a 10 off voucher Did not have breakfast so cannot comment 
104767,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Lighting in the room was very poor and we could have wished for things like body lotion and other toiletries , The location was very easy The room was clean and the bed comfortable 
104768,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Check in was poor as check in lady ignored me completely for a good 2 minutes as she tried in vain to make a phone call All you need is some acknowledgement that you are there and not invisible Dreadful Place needs re carpeting and freshening up , By contrast The Check out was quick friendly and efficient 
104769,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Paid fast wifi Low shower pressure 6th floor Could here neighbour s TV, Free slow wifi Cosy comfortable room Nice staff Close by restaurants and caf for quick but rather expensive and good breakfast lunch dinner

104771,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, According to the photos the room was not that spaces it s little compact but if you see the pictures it s look very spacious, Overoll good everything ok breakfast very good
104772,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Facilities are starting to show wear some touch up is needed Towels felt cheap and worn WiFi needs to be faster to be really useful , Excellent location for someone taking Eurostar as hotel sits right across from station Comfortable rooms ask for larger room worth little bit extra money friendliness of staff and wonderful breakfast 
104773,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The bathroom was somewhat worne out, Right oppositie of the entrance of Gare Du Nord Beautiful balcony and view Comfy bed Good size room for Paris Clean hotel with very friendly staff Breakfast was very tasty and extensive 
104774,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, entrance was hard to find late at night bathroom a little dated and marked having to re log into Wi Fi every 24 hours was annoying, hotel is showing its age but rooms were nice and clean tea and coffee good addition loved the crazy corridors staff helpful great position out the front door of train station 
104775,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, The location of Paris Terminus Nord made it easy to find upon arrival at the North train station When I left the East station was also within walking distance The bus to go sightseeing in Paris was also closeby The staff were friendly I would definitely stay again at this hotel 
104776,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The counter staff could learn to smile and pay better attention to you I found them totally disinterested in my questions , The location suited me the price was reasonable for a capital city 
104777,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Some parts of the furniture in my room were very dirty see a picture Looks like those surfaces were treated with some solution and then dust sticked to them , I asked for late check out and was given two extra hours which was very nice of them 
104778,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, extra comfy bed with lots of space Clean room and bathroom soaps shower gels provided Tea and coffee provided in the room and water Staff very helpful if needed

104780,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The bathroom looked a bit shabby, Perfect location for seeing the city Nice comfortable bed Super view Excellent staff Right next to the Eurostar Terminal and the Paris Metro
104781,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Condescending rude unfriendly unhelpful and unwelcoming staff They make you feel like they were doing you a favour They deliberately gave me their worst room and were unwilling to change it the first night They are happy to toss you around until you get frustrated and quit , Proximity to the station and Ann at the restaurant and Serth at the reception were helpful when approached 
104782,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, In the bathroom I killed two very tiny creatures that looked like limax slugs They appeared in the middle of the night and I guess they are a consequences of some humidity in the walls Anyway i didn t mind them much , Very nice staff Excellent location just across the railway station 
104783,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Desperatly in need of a complete refurb Carpet in room was disgusting Light features not working or hanging off the wall Bathroom with mold Breakfast average, Close to Gare du Nord
104784,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Not easy to connect to WiFi Surprisingly mould in tiles and around bath, Extra large comfy bed in a good sized bedroom and hotel perfectly situated across from the station
104785,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, bathroom needs refreshing I wanted myself to buy a 5 euro box of grout and do it myself , good location rooms are good for the price category Lovely bar area 
104786,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, I found the carpet in our room was in desperate need of a clean i felt i always had to have some sort of footwear always on The furniture in the bar was very poor and well worn I couldnt get the aircon to work and had to have the windows open to get some air which made it VERY noisy from the street , Rooms were of a nice size as were the bathrooms and the location near to the station was very good 
104787,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Not a 4 star hotel maybe a 3 Its a little run down and needs a refurbishment No fridge in the room which was annoying I asked about this and they said only the premier rooms had a fridge The hotel has a lot of potential , Staff were friendly and great location
104788,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, It smelled something when we first got into the room Maybe it s the old carpet But I got used to the smell very soon , The location was so good that we could get Eurostar so easily 
104789,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, Great location for Eurostar I got a good price I suspect that at other times it would have been too expensive for me I am not sure why others are negative 
104790,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The hotel is showing signs of wear Our sink was very unpleasant the window nets too We were disappointed to have no toiletries this time and believe they were there on our last visit , Breakfast and coffee are excellent as are the staff Proximity to Gare du Nord Quiet 
104791,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, After check in went to my room to find it open with the latch on and the door had marks by the lock looking as if someone tried to pry it open Went back to reception to mention it and they went up to the room with me and then informed me that the cleaner had forgotten to lock the door and that the damage to the door did not affect the door from locking All very reassuring Having said that the room appeared to have been prepared correctly and unaffected by the door having left open The bathtub had black stains on it from previous repairs not dirt , Opposite the Gare du Nord station so convinient for the Eurostar
104792,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Room 341 the carpet was filthy with dark spotted stains around the table area It looked as if there had been an attempt to remove the stains but to no avail We were due to stay for 4 nights but I did not feel well and we tried to change our Eurostar tickets for the next day to return home This was not possible so we checked out after 2 nights Had I felt well and we stayed longer we would have asked to change rooms After all the room was described as superior but the carpet was disgusting , The location for The Eurostar 
104793,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Not walking distance to main attractions , Very clean and bed was extremely comfortable and lovely having a proper coffee machine in the room Convenient location to train station which very helpful with little kids 
104794,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Very bad internet For visitors from other countries internet is the only way to stay in touch with your loved ones and the signal was inttermintent and poor , I got lucky for getting a room in floor 6 with a great view to sacre cour church
104795,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Bad facilities especially the bed make us sleepless We live in a dirty room with old carpet and furnutures Not the standart of Mercury Never live in here , The location
104796,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, 20 minutes for checking in at midninght and even more for the check out the next morning at 8 00 AM The room doesn t even provide a tooth brush not talking about a minibar for refreshing When complaining about the HUGE waiting time for everything the staff explained back that they have to train trainees and asked for patience while customers were going to miss trains and planes Avoid if you are on a hurry for a train or a plane there are other options nearby, Directly opposite to the Eurostar terminal it is theoritically ideal for the late arrival of the last Eurostar from London or for a stepover between a train and a plane at Roissy Charles de Gaulle
104797,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Facilities are tired bathroom in particular , I love staying at Mecure Gard du Nord it is so convenient to all The hotel is clean and comfortable but tired 
104798,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Room was in very poor condition Not unclean but stained old carpet broken tiles in very old bathroom Saggy uncomfortable bed No powerpoints to charge phone or laptop had to unplug lamps Urgently needs a refurb Rude staff in bar in the AM who insisted we had to purchase a drink to sit and work after having paid 17 for breakfast minutes before Reception were excellent but had to argue with bar staff to convince them we could stay , Not much
104799,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, I asked via booking com if I could have a late checkout at 4pm I received a reply that the hotel would oblige at no extra cost Once at the hotel I was told by Reception that there would be a charge This was not consistent with the information I had been given before my stay , The location is ideal with cafes and the metro on hand Comfortable stay the d cor a shabby in some areas like the bathrooms but clean Friendly staff Might not get what you want but at least they smile when they say no 
104800,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Bathroom was dated and a bit grubby Very dark inside room Inadequate lighting inside Water pressure of shower was week Plug socket could be pulled out of wall Only 1 large towel originally supplied to the double room , Ease of location Staff were very nice 
104801,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Everything Grubby hotel with stains on carpets and walls cracked bathroom tiles stained sink broken furniture Not at all the standard I was expecting from the Mercure chain Very disappointing Renovation is urgently needed , Location as just opposite the Gare du Nord Station
104802,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, carpets are old and need replacement lighting could be improved its a bit dim, staff friendly and helpful very good location being close to the metro and bus station
104803,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, small problem with lights in the room kindly they gave me another room but it all took almost one hour , so easy when you need to get up early to catch an early train 
104804,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, No complaints whatsoever Everything as you would expect and hope from a good hotel , I have stayed at this hotel a few times and will definitely do it again Outstanding service politeness friendliness calmness and helpfulness in staff Very accommodating They helped effectively in everything including an extra printout of a lost train ticket Easy to chat with at all times of day all of the staff I am French though and don t know how they speak other languages Very correct and clear handling of the reservations explaining every transaction I had several reservations for what turned out to be one stay for myself Excellent luggage handling when leaving a suitcase for later retrieval you get a ticket and only staff is allowed to enter the luggage room to get the luggage with the counter ticket This may be a detail but makes me feel secure Rooms have a bath tub a must for me and are very tidy Location is really excellent 
104805,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Carpet in bedroom could do with replacing , Breakfast was superb Location was excellent Staff very helpful Wish I had looked more carefully at my booking as I thought breakfast was included but turned out not to be and cost us 68 euros for two mornings 
104806,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Dripping tap in the bathroom was like water torture Wash basin chipped and should have been replaced a long time ago Dirty well worn carpet in the room , Breakfast was excellent Bed was excellent
104807,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, the room configuration really unpractical to open my luggage and to move around the room the hair dryer was really old and really poor not really helpful , the room very close to the station the staff was very nice and kind especially the concierge 
104808,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Long walk to any of the sights in Paris Bathroom was old and the shower barely worked Water dripped out and was difficult to take a shower Elevators nor the breakfast were up to 4 star standards ,No Positive
104809,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The rooms are completely worn out It is dirty it smells in my room none of the lights were working Only the lamp on the ceiling It took 40 minutes before a technician came and this was just an older reception man with no idea how to solve the problem So no suggestion to give me another room I had to work without light The badroom floor is broke the sink was painted to hide all the damages And at the reception there are some people who hate customers I have to tell also that I saw a young woman who was very friendly to the customers and really dis her best but both employees who helped me ware blunt even rude Both my colleague and I were often surprised about the attitude of this receptionist I will NEVER go back to this hotel, Location is just opposite the treinstation Paris Nord Perfect You have a big choice of restaurants and bars in the street
104810,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Given the end room in the corridor the room was very small not bright enough closely facing other hotels and have stinky smell absolutely uncomfortable at all Returned to the concierge to request changing room but the staff keep question the reason after I expressed my feeling about the room seems not helpful At the end I was given another room facing the station which was so much better bigger brighter have street view at least The hotel is old rooms need renovation Dirty and damp carpet old fashion telly not very helpful concierge staff etc Didnt expect this standard for Mercure branded hotels Apparently over priced , Great location for travelling by Eurostar its right opposite to the station 
104811,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Our Room 218 was like a shoe box the room was built around the bed so small the carpet was threadbare and needed replacing, Location was perfect for the Gar du Nord
104812,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Double edged sword it was close to the train station but it was also noisy Kind of a lousy TV but then again You re in Pairs Don t watch TV , It was very clean and awesomely nice staff Close to the train station 
104813,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Breakfast is expensive and very average at 17 so eating in a cafe by the hotel Is much better and just as convenient , Well located for eurostar Rooms ok but could benefit from an upgrade Good size bathroom Pleasent staff 
104814,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The carpet in the room was full of stains The shower too short for a tall person The TV was too small No fridge in the room , Enough place in the room Direct connection with Gare du Nord 
104815,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Room lightings is not bright enough Can see the stains on thei old floor carpet Not enough towel holder or towel rail in the bathroom Shower screen is a bit small so water will splash out during shower Long maze like walk to the room , Location is just right in front of Terminal Gare Du Nord Room is big and the bed is big and comfortable too They provides Nespresso coffee maker and instant coffee sachet too 
104816,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, one staff does not have good manner While I was talking about payment at my checkout the staff accepted another customer s credit card and finished to pay for him please keep the order , good location clean room
104817,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Staff were not very polite during check in Bathroom was small and dirty and the carpet in the room was filthy so much so you couldn t walk on it barefoot , Good location for a short trip arriving at Gare du Nord 
104818,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Small room for 2 people to move around but the bed was comfortable and the staff nice , Location and excellent breakfast helpful staff who all spoke english 
104819,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, The gentleman whom checked us in was efficient and super polite i have forgotten his name it did however begin with an L WE WAS UPGRADED ON CHECK IN which made the start of our stay superb the room was beautiful the cleaners were very kind and friendly unfortunately i cannot comment on the breakfast as we ventured out for breakfast every morning however i was totally happy with my stay thank you for making it very special and look forward to returning when we are next in paris 
104820,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Staff Staff attitude What I experienced in Paris I have never seen in my life Experienced staff superiors Heads of department Managers have no idea what hospitality attitude means From my entry to the hotel which was around 21 after a long day traveling the head receptionist working on the shift on the 11th January hardly said a hello while he was attending another guest After a long wait he decided to call another receptionist for my check in It was done The room I was checked in was at the last floor with no proper window or balcony whatsoever ceiling window On booking the room online I had also the option of seeing the actual room I was not what I had booked Nether the room nor the view Also as an addition to the booking I opted for breakfast No one knew anything about it I did not bother to take it into consideration after the welcoming attitude on check in I phoned immediately the reception asking for a different room with a window and the answer from the same pleasant person was Come down at reception with a tone no one should be allowed to use in such a position Returning to reception he again delegated another younger receptionist Said who was the only person nice and polite from all staff that works in Mercure Terminus Nord Even on his efforts of choosing another room and behaving as pleasant as possible his superior kept directing him in most unwelcoming way The second room had windows was on a lower floor and the view again did not exist as it was facing an inside yard and the opposite wing so the view was towards some staircase and other room windows The room was intensely worn out with repairing needed in the bathroom tiles walls sink Lamps not functioning carpet looking too damaged and the door was not in good shape Every single time I walked in the hotel and passed by the reception all members there were watching like a thief had walked in , I liked Paris The hotel is just opposite the Gare du Nord which makes is hard to miss Unfortunately the Paris escape was not as beautiful as I had expected from the Mercure Accord hotels Housekeeping did their job and very attentively The young Said in reception was the only person capable to smile and behave like a receptionist working in hospitality should The bed was comfortable 
104821,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Its a nice Hotel but not a 4 star as promoted with plastic glasses which are usually broken, Staff where fantastic I checked in at 9 AM which is not common and on top of that I was upgraded to a higher room Location Location Location Gard du nord is a cool place lively where U will find everything around the Hotel
104822,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, We went to Paris early January so it was pretty cold Our room tended to be cold at nighttime You do get complimentary robes in your room so I would recommend using them to their full advantage If visiting Paris in colder months and staying at this hotel take warm pjammas and bed socks to warm up quicker In the morning the room was nice and warm The hotel is great however the location does let it down we had a protest right outside gard du nord at 9am on a Saturday a lot of pick pockets tend to hang around exactly this area and work in teams so be sure to hide any expensive jewellery engagement rings etc with gloves or keep your hands in your pockets keep your bag under your jacket Avoid eye contact with anyone and walk with purpose Ignore anybody who speaks to you There were also a couple of fights Always walk together close with your partner to avoid people walking inbetween you It is very Central for moving around Paris in this area which is great however there are other mercure hotels in better areas for example near sacre coure pigalle champs elyses etc where you can walk about a little more freely without the fear of so many pick pockets If your doing Paris on a budget this will do without a doubt Just keep your eyes and ears alert when walking around and you will be fine , This hotel had lovely interior the rooms were clean and comfortable we also had a small balcony which was lovely The hotel gave us a complimentary upgrade which also included two free alcoholic drinks at the bar a free mini bar in our room and use of the espresso machine for the entire stay Staff were friendly at check out and we had overall a really positive pleasant stay 
104823,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, Efficient distantly friendly staff quiet room excellent location especially if you are traveling by Eurostar good underground connections room was very comfortable but had only the basic toiletery amenities which was just fine I will deffinitely stay there again
104824,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, We paid extra for a better room but it was very dated and one reading light switch was broken the light above the desk did not work and the coffee machine did not work Disappointing When we complained we were told could not get an electrician over the weekend , good location for trains and easy to walk to see the sites of Paris 
104825,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Bathroom was not good and u can hear all noises from corridor inside your room , I stayed there only one night to catch the train from gare du nord Perfect for that purpose because it is right in front of it 
104826,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, While I am a client of Hotel Mercure Paris Terminus Nord I used the bar inside the hotel purchasing a coffee and a juice A member of staff called JONAS told me to leave the bar if I finished my drinks I told him that I was a client of the hotel and there were empty chairs and tables in the bar and it was no point to behave like that we told me he did not care about it I found this approach very very rude ,No Positive
104827,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The first room we were offered having confirmed a reservation was not ready when we opened the door Second time around was fine and dandy , Location Opposite Gare du Nord 
104828,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The front desk staff Julie was arrogant and unprofessional The room was jaded basin and toilet seat were all scratched no fridge A horrible hotel to stay , Location The concierge was very helpful 
104829,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The hotel looks tired and may need renovation but if so the price will go up a lot The current condition is OK and frankly I like it un renovated so that I don t pay more , Relatively spacious rooms and good valued for Paris 
104830,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The ONLY negative thing I have to say about the experience here was that occasionally we heard some outside traffic noise but we brought a noise maker with us so problem solved , Since this was our first time to Paris we didn t know what to expect especially during New Years but upon arriving at this hotel we knew it was going to be an amazing experience The friendly helpful staff at the front could speak English and went out of their way to make us feel welcomed The room was clean spacious and very very comfortable Our 5 year old daughter slept very well on the pull out couch and we loved the size of the tub We had a beautiful city view from our window and it is very easy to walk from the hotel to many delicious cafes and bakeries for meals Also being so close to Gare du Nord was wonderful for traveling anywhere in the city We would love to stay here again thank you so much 
104831,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Bastille is definitely not the most pleasant neighbourhood Consistent honking and beggars right in front of the hotel yelling at you aren t fun, Really good location I had a train ride from the gare du nord and the hotel was just across the street Many restaurants nearby open late and the metro station is just in front of the entrance Very very convenient Bedding and bathroom are not at its best but considering how cheap it was I don t think it was too bad 
104832,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, I reserve this hotel for my aunty booking com shows price was 59 for one night But I need to paid 62 including tax hopefully show all additional fees same time When i complain something i got respond week laster , clean and nice 
104833,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Unusual very small size bed for a 4 starhotel standard room We did not sleep well fortunatelly we did not have long time to stay sleeping , Best place to be if you like to eat at Terminus Nord Brasserie A top of welcoming 
104834,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Very very tired hotel desperately in need of some repair Tiles cracked carpet stained Although well located to train station the location is in a very unsafe area , Close proximity to the station Large room comfortable beds 
104835,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Stairs and moquette don t look that clean and hygienic The toilet forniture is a little old and damaged , Wide room large windows nice reception 
104836,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Night shift staff team Delay cooperation Unfriendly Lack of service mind Dirty toilet Wash basin was blocked by housekeeping and we got very delay solution so much trouble to our rest time Room wallpaper and furniture should be maintenanced, Location only
104837,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Bathroom door didn t close properly sink was in need of repair not enough towels, The location is perfect except for the surrounding area staff and as very helpful
104838,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Rather shabby tiny room Broken tiles in bathroom Worn sink No shower curtain Few cosmetic products that are provided by most other hotels in my experience , Its location for Gare du Nord and Eurostar Very easy access Close to some interesting retail and dining opportunities Great dining especially breakfast Little balcony on 6th floor 
104839,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The staff were professional but could have been friendlier I had to pay a deposit to cover any spending on the mini bar but I didn t have a mini bar in the room so found that a little strange although the deposit was returned , The location was great and there were plenty of nice cafes and restaurants around the area The hotel was very clean and had a nice atmosphere 
104840,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, A lil bit noisy if staying lower floor but it s manageable Can opt to stay at highest floor for best view and quietness, I love this hotel Convenient just in front of gare du nord easy to catch uber taxi too Easy access to halal restaurant just next to hotel s entrance Unlimited device for wifi Child friendly too
104841,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Two negative things 1 The room was incredibly noisy because it was right next to the lift shaft I was very thankful that I had brought ear plugs with me 2 Poor customer service in the first floor bar I needed the light a little brighter to finish some work however the bar man was insistent at sticking to policy that at 6pm they changed the ambience and dimmed the light I only needed it brighter for 10 minutes but no he put policy over customer service , The staff on reception were excellent and were very happy to help with last minute photocopying etc Very friendly and professional This hotel is in a great location for the train station and very good value for money
104842,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, I stayed 2 separate nights each time was charged 50 euros on my Visa Debit card I was told that this was only a deposit in case of incidental expenses I have not been reimbursed the 100 00 euros owed to me and frankly find this very irritating I will now have to report it to my bank for them to pursue I did speak to reception and all they kept on saying was that it was a hold however my account clearly shows 2 transactions of 50 euros taken from my account I really despise surprise costs at billing Really poor form , The location is perfect for Eurostar The Baggage manager is excellent 
104843,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Old elevator small and slow , Great location right facing Gare du Nord Staff were all extremely polite and helpful given that it was in Paris impressive Room was small and basic but well met my two essential needs very warm and very quiet Also an interesting view from the small baloney on the top floor 
104844,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, Great place to stay for any Eurostar Traveller opposite Gard Du Nord Very convenient easy for Metro Trains and Buses around Paris Also taxis Ideal for Business and Tourist traveller 
104845,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Equipment was not quite up to what you would expect from a 4 facility no shower towels no mini bar only 10 or so tv channels no vod Also the room though tidy had seen the last renovation probably 20 years ago , Rather large room by Paris standards The matress was firm Noise level very low I slept well 
104846,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Slow check out due to Staff chatting when the main reason for staying there was to get early morning Eurostar, Room surprisingly nice and great view on to gare du Nord Fantastic location for Eurostar Great that there s a metro entrance right outside so that you don t have to wander round the area which isn t nice Metro takes you directly to left bank including Saint German and other nice areas
104847,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Hygiene and cleanliness not acceptable old carpet full of stains bathroom was not clean and very old toilet The whole hotel gives a worn out impression, Ideal location if you have to be near the Train station Paris Nord 1 min walk and friendly staff
104848,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Shower without enough water pressure Poor internet connection, Good room and bed clean and comfortable Good breakfast Quiet despite the proximity of the station 
104849,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, A great loction literally across the road from Gare du Nord so ideal for Eurostar travellers The staff were friendly and while the rooms were somewhat dated they were clean and spacious enough for a short stay 
104850,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The first nights I was woken up by sound of cying howling by a girl voice coming from the street I thought it was a homeless little girl crying but it could be a grown woman The howling last till 04am, It s just infront of main international train station
104851,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Area outside hotel not great at night Just need to be on your guard Fine during the day Number of people sleeping rough in the Gare du Nord underground saw 2 young guys urinating at the foot of the underground entrance stairway number of people loitering near the hotel with beer cans etc just be on your guard that s all , Bang opposite Gare du Nord Station Comfortable room Absolutely fine for a business trip weekend stay Lots of bars restaurants etc nearby if you don t want hotel breakfast
104852,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, In room comforts tea soaps could be better quality and more plentiful , Great location right next to gare du nord comfortable room and friendly staff 
104853,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, I didn t take breakfast because of the price But in all fairness I didn t see what they offered for it because I do not eat much in the morning I was sure that just walking to a bakery for a croissant would be much cheaper , Very clean hospitable staff so friendly I wondered if I actually was in Paris France location is really directly opposite the main exit of the Gare de Nord so you arrive by train check in drop the luggage in the room and you are ready to roam around Paris TOP 
104854,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The area around the Gare du Nord is not among the most pleasant of Paris drunks homeless Always a bit dodgy at night , Basically if you need to be near the Gare du Nord then this is a decent if not cheap Otherwise go somewhere else 
104855,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, While checking out staff the counter refused to extend late check at 3 pm and charged us for 1 hour Euro 15 it was not question of money but his ego , Initially the reception counter staff were very accommodative when we checked in the hotel and agreed to our request for breakfast inclusive in the price we booked as it was Euro 800 higher then the spot price for your hotel
104856,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Booked room with standart double bed for me and my partner ended up sleeping on two single beds with two very thin single mattresses put together Did not sleep well for three nights ,No Positive
104857,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Location might seem dodgy at night times but safer than it seems , Location cleanliness breakfast staff wi fi Gare du Nord is in front of the hotel You can access anywhere in Paris without any problem 
104858,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Very bad reception I arrived at the hotel at 9 am very tired from a very long trip Cambodia Thailand Paris I asked if I could have a room available for early check in Amandine at the reception said to me no room is available yet I told her that I have no choice than waiting at the lobby for the room and to be so kind to let me know if a room would be available before normal check in time She answerd me I can t inform you you just come back at 2 pm and that s it This way to answer is not acceptable In regards to the room it is acceptable but there is not enough light , Good Location just in front of Gare du Nord
104859,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, Ideal for a one night two day walk about Paris Right by the station by the airport so that I could leave my gear there and walk about and pick it up before returning Handy restaurants next to it too 
104860,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, room 340 in desperate need of renovation painting carpet bathroom no double glassing so very noisy no refill of coffee cups at second day, location of hotel as such perfect in case of room a the back and not street 
104861,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The Hotel has to be renovated as soon as possible No facilities for fitness , Location close to Gare du Nord railway Station and Metro Staff is very friendly Breakfast is one of the best 
104862,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, Great location for Travelling with Eurostar Just outside Gare du Nord station but not noisy Problem with electricity with plugs was fixed within few minutes 
104863,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The Gare du Nord neighbourhood is not the best but the hotel is right by the metro entrance so that I didn t feel too uneasy coming back late at night , I was going to take the Eurostar very early in the morning so the location was excellent for that I really only needed to cross the road and the entrance not only to the station but to the Eurostar boarding was right there The hotel is very good without being exceptional more than adequate for my needs 
104864,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, Great location good restaurant next to entrance and comfortable room The buffet breakfast offers a wide choice I have stayed in different parts of Paris and this is currently my favourite hotel 
104865,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Bad staff services I have troubled for opening my room door for 3 times and i have ran from 4th floor to 1st floor 3 times to inform the staff at the reception Why is the door handle should push up and enter Why not push down and enter If require push up and enter why didn t it shown any instruction , Comfort of the bed 
104866,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The only negative which wasn t even too big a deal was a delay in checking out as we ordered room service but no one had made note of it just the amount outstanding Which confused me as I thought it had already been added to my payment card , Friendly helpful staff We arrived very early but fortunately our room was ready so we were able to check in 
104867,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The room was very hot and had a funny smell air conditioning wasn t working There was no fridge and the mattress was sagging, Close to restaurants and transport 
104868,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, TV reception wasn t great , Right opposite the train station easy to find comfortable room a good breakfast in line with the E17 price 
104869,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The reception area gets crowded quickly when guests are checking in and out , Good location close to Gare du Nord Decent clean and spacious rooms for Paris where most hotels are a rip off if you can get a good deal 
104870,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, The hotel is a few steps away from Gare du Nord but it is still possible to get a quiet room facing the courtyard Very comfortable bed and pillow nice bathroom tea making facilities I did not have time to take the breakfast so cannot comment on that Staff pleasant and helpful 
104871,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Very poor room extremely small dirty carpets no safe no mini bar scratched broken door handles basin tap very very hard to operate and all of this for 350 per night scandalous price for a hotel that should be one star Normally the hotel chain is fairly good but this one is a disgrace , The location is convenient and reception average
104872,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Your hotel is yet to refund the 50 Euro s debited for Room Service for me and my collague a week after checking out even after sending remidners IT IS BAD, Easy access to town and the metro
104873,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The bathroom looked slightly tired with a cracked time However this did not spoil our stay , The location near the Gare du Nord How relatively quiet it was during the night 
104874,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The first room they gave me when I arrived looked into a service chute that they called a courtyard there was barely enough room to walk around the bed and it was claustrophobic The standard room I had before I upgraded was small falling apart in many places and not very clean , The privilege room was excellent I only recommend booking this room type 
104875,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, I have used a company credit card for the reservation but the payment for the stay could not be proceeded from it The late check out fee of EUR 30 hour was too much Old looking and unreconstructed look in the lobby and corridors , Location was very convenient for me Check out till 1pm for free 
104876,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The fact that the hotel blocks an amount roughly more than the rate per diem other than the required amount for your stay So basically I paid twice the amount I expected, Staff are friendly rooms are tidy and clean Overall experience is good
104877,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, when I returned to the hotel n Friday night the fire alarm was blaring out the staff told us there was no problem that there was no fire but unable to switch off the alarm we were thoroughly inconvenienced , PROXIMITY to GARE DU NORD STATION JUST 2 MINUTES
104878,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Almost everything was perfect but the only problem was that there were always a lot of people waiting for check in check out , Very close to Gare du Nord Inexpensive but the room was nice and clean Will use again when I visit Paris next time 
104879,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, I didn t like the malfunction of the fire alarm which caused the hotel to be evacuated out into the street for 2hours at midnight There was no apology There was no one to help with my bags and consequently I had a nasty fall and have a badly bruised back and shoulder When I reported this no one said sorry or anything to me , The position 
104880,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Understaffed The reception doesnt give satisfactory answers to your queries Daily house keeping in not timely and at times incomplete , The location is right outside the Paris nord station 
104881,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The room needs refurbishment Very outdated bed and furnitures and the lightings are also very dim Carpets and bathroom are old , The hotel only scores on its location which is directly opposite Gare de Nord
104882,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The treatment was not at all good We got the room very late in the afternoon Service not at all good No water in the room No mini bar but still the staff insisted on a cover charge of 50 Euros for no reason The room was fully paid in advance, Good location
104883,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Be alert on the surrounding area since there a lot of bystanders , It is just across the Gare du Nord Station and is very convenient Hop on hop off buses also stop near the hotel 
104884,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Checkout took a very long time they should ensure tone appropriately staffed in the morning The rooms are not as the advertised pictures , Location and the breakfast was nice the images of rooms are a bit deceiving but we re ok 
104885,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Nothing, Location was superb right opposite the main train and tube station hotel was lovely with plenty of bars and restaurants outside so easy to get to all the sights from there 
104886,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Broken kettle plug and light Tatty bathroom Can t charge things overnight as electricity cuts out when you switch lights off , Great location and really comfortable bed 
104887,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Did not fix faults in room when reported and overall the decor in my room was looking tired , Great location if travelling by Eurostar or Thalys Staff friendly enough 
104888,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, This hotel is always clean comfortable and accommodating They have a lot of different room options and are in a good location if you don t want to go far after getting in from England
104889,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, We were in Paris for four days and the hotel was ideally located opposite the Gare du Nord with Metro and good restaurants directly outside We had a very busy itinerary so the location was ideal for us to quickly and easily travel around Paris Our room was comfortable spacious and had a great view overlooking the Gare du Nord We also enjoyed the breakfast at the hotel restaurant Most importantly the hotel employees were very helpful courteous and knowledgeable In our opinion the hotel was a great place to stay and therefore good value for money We would definitely book this hotel again 
104890,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Water pressure and temperature intermittent wifi connection lack of English language tv stations, Great transport location efficient check in comfortable room helpful staff reasonable restaurants in the immediate vicinity
104891,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Area around Gare du Nord Paris is not very salubrious Noisy and not many pleasant places to eat , Convenience of proximity to Gare du Nord and Eurostar 
104892,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, You should see the black mold in the bathroom in the room where I stayed Yikes I had to photograph for them to give me another room Should be a heath sanitation violation , Location the only and only good thing about this place 
104893,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, While the staff at the counter was friendly the bell hop was reasonably rude when asked any question The pictures online made the hotel seem a bit more updated but the room wasn t even close to new It was banged up at best and is in dire need of a renovation The hairdryer was a box on the wall with a nozzle The amenities were minimal and it was really worn like a time warp but not a good one , The location of this hotel was conveniently located across from the train station and easily accessible to other train stations as well 
104894,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The inner city environment e g homeless people others loitering concern about pick pockets would not appeal to some people eg families with children The breakfast is overpriced although nearby restaurants provide a cheaper alternative , The location is excellent for travellers arriving and leaving from Gare du Nord 
104895,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Our safe kettle and hairdryer were all faulty and couldn t be repaired I also don t know why I had to provide a credit card inprint on check in when we had paid in full on booking , The view and the comfy bed The room also had a good sized bath as well as a shower 
104896,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, A little dated but all materialistic , Location location Close to Nord and la Fayette for the shoppers out there Great room on 6 th floor Attentive staff
104897,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, No fridge in room lights only worked on main switch disagreement on agreed price between checkin and checkout , Location price and good quality of facilities 
104898,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Closed at 11pm You should inform in advance if u r checking in late hours Else is OK , Small rooms but great experience Nice place to stay walking distance to station Helpful staff Recommended to 1st timer 
104899,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The bathroom fittings were a little tired , The location right opposite Paris Nord railway station was perfect for our purposes There is a facility to leave luggage for the day after checking out The breakfast room overlooks the station We got a four star experience at the price of a two star hotel The room was spacious and comfortable 
104900,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The bathroom was a little dated , The location is excellent for the gare du nord and the friendly bar next door The room was spacious and clean The staff were very helpful 
104901,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, Very nice hotel it was surprisingly quiet I was bit afraid to have some noise from the station but it was very quiet Great big rooms all very clean and relatively new we really loved our room Very close to the station and to the metro
104902,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, the check in formalities the rates of property is high compared to full 4 star service hotel, I liked nothing also Though I have done single beds due to unavailability at property online when I checked in I requested to a king bed due to our baby sleeping with us but the staff rejected
104903,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Our room wasn t cleaned after our first night we did ask reception to make sure it was cleaned when we left the hotel on our third day and it had been cleaned when we returned to the room later that day , Location to Gard de Nord station was perfect straight off the train to check in The breakfast buffet offered by the hotel was good too 
104904,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Stayed twice first room was very good and quiet Second stay the room was so small I actually could not walk the bathroom was very nice , Room was available upon a mid morning arrival 
104905,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The room had a hole in the ceiling It was a old room and is requiring some maintenance The bathroom was old it was not poss vel to close the door and it was making ventilation noise during all night , The location and the large bed 
104906,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, That the bed wasn t that comfortable and felt lob sided My other half was not able to sleep through the night , It was opposite the station which was great and the staff were accommodating and friendly 
104907,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Noisy guests in the next room Two nights of loud arguments and slamming doors but this was not the fault of the hotel just inconsiderate guests , Very convenient being so close to Gare du Nord Metro and buses A good choice for a solo traveller 
104908,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Filty dirty creatures in bath wardrobe sink Staines everywhere bed floors Sickening, The hotel shouldn t be on booking com Absolutely crawling filty dirty safes not fixed in rooms wood missing everywhere Pain work non existent
104909,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Room Service food looked and tasted like cheap pub food at hotel prices Room d cor and carpets are looking worn and tired , Perfect location for Gare de Nord train station with easy access on the metro and RER to the heart of Paris Nice Balcony access as well on the 2nd floor Staff friendly and welcoming Comfortable beds and nice dark room at night Had a great sleep 
104910,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Bathroom needs attention it was clean but lots of black stains in grout etc made it look drab More towels needed, Room very nice super view window covers both blocked noise and light very well
104911,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Bad rooms Bad staff A shame that this hotel has the Mercure name Way overpriced for what it is If this hotel gets to close which should happen the owners will only have what they deserve , Almost nothing
104912,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, A light breakfast should have been included for the money we paid especially for travellers that need to keep going on their journey to connecting cities 
104913,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The front desk staff were not friendly When we checked in it took almost an hour just to check in And everytime I wanted something from front desk They just kept bouncing my phone calls around The last starw was when I requested a taxi and within 30 seconds from that call I get a call back saying the taxis were on strike and it would be better if I hailed a taxi myself outside the hotel Really The front desk staff were utterly useless , The location was perfect Right across from the train station and the metro it was very easy to travel along even from the airport 
104914,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Room was at the end of a rabbit warren Bathroom was large but needed some tlc and a refit , Staff were friendly and helpful at 3 o clock in the morning when I arrived 
104915,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, It was just a day staying My wife chose this hotel s group due to be accostumed to staying at it in her business trips throughout Brazil It is a half way to CDG airport so we decided to book there But the staff is not trustfull Before booking a room I called up for the reservation sector and asked about late check out due to my wife s flight time different from mine was late tonight and she would leave the hotel at 8PM The attendant a woman answered it would be 15 euros because the late check out would be in a weekend day saturday She completed by saying any further information I should book it first to have all the answers So I did it and after booking I called again and the conversation changed a lot She told it was 15 euros per hour after 12 PM and after asking to her manager she told that the room should be set free at least at 5 PM or another daily hotel of 129 euros would be charged At the check in Serth told it would be given a tolerance until 2 PM and after that time 15 euros per hour would be charged but no matter what time it would be the check out it would cost 15 euros an hour At night asking another attendant for information I was told that instead of paying any further fee for additional hours a complete daily fee would be 89 euros possibiliting a check out until sunday 12PM I wonder how can a staff be so unprepared to give such different informations The hotel is rated as a 4 star I really don t know how can it be possible The sink of the bathroom is too scratched the carpet is dirty and there is no fridge in the room The neighbourhood is not exactly a good place due to be right beside Gare du Nord It is not an appropriate place for women s staying especially those who are alone , The entrance is impressive and impresses at first sight It is half way to CDG airport The mattress is comfortable 
104916,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, We did not appreciate the attitude from the staff when there was a problem with our room key We were made to feel that we were a nuisance in their day Very unprofessional and rude They obviously forgot that they are in the hospitality industry Also the bathroom had a foul smell , The Convenience of being close to international train station as we travelled from London for just 3 days On check in the staff were good
104917,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, View from room was on inside so this wasn t so good Anyway this is a minor point , We missed our flight so we wanted to book a 1 night in any good hotel We were lucky to find we a secret offer from booking com so we were able to get it for a very good price The hotel is very good and in front of Gare due Nord where you can take metro RER train to literally any where you want Room size is very good Nice bathroom with a bath tub Very comfortable bed pillows 
104918,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The check in was 1 5 late due to customers late checking out which the hotel gets money for it so this should not have been a inconvenience for us as a paying customers too The delete resulted in us missing a event we have booked previously Staff was very rude and unsympathetic about the whole issue , Value for money good location hotel nice and clean but carpet needs changing in some places 
104919,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Small old room Bathroom was not very clean broken tiles broken shower equipment Carpet was old and not very tidy Very old small TV Maybe there was wireless internet but this was in no way clear I used the wireless connection of the neighbor , The location is excellent 
104920,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, The staff were super friendly The booking was actually a gift for my parents birthday and they were so kind and generous with them Much appreciated 
104921,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The room had a very bad smell when we entered The passage area to the room was very narrow and finding the lift from the floor was very difficult Its an old dirty hotel The staff was very rude The room was very dark and dull , Nothing we liked breakfast was ok 
104922,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, A small but annoying problem was that the cleaning staff failed to provide a shower cap for the first night and failed to make up the room the following day , Quiet and well ordered and providing excellent breakfasts I was pleased that the bar is now again able to offer food 
104923,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, I didn t like the fact that I asked the bar man to change the TV station to a football channel and he refused even when I was the only one at the bar at that time He was really unfriendly , I like the location because it is close to the train station 
104924,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Rude front desk made me go back to the car park for booking papers because he was too lazy to look up my name Then told me I was wrong when he found my name as given ,No Positive
104925,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Nor the staff un atentive unfriendly didn t quite express themselves in English nor the room broken door bathroom in need of a major overhaul nor the corridor leading to the room dirty nor the service nothing but a glass in the room nor the air conditioning un existant nor the wi fi impossible to connect to Honestly one of my worst hotel experiences in my entire life , The only really good thing is the location just in front of the Gare du Nord 
104926,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, Excellent location if using rail system to move onwards Also for CDG airport Old building but my single room was well updated and reasonable size for money bathroom good Breakfast good also 
104927,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, small rooms did not feel rooms were squeaky clean and attitude of staff non chalant , Good value for money and locations close to Gare du Nord
104928,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Fixtures and fittings are in need of replacement Room had the appearance of being fitted out on the cheap about ten years ago Bath shower arrangement hazardous for an older person , Ideal for an overnight when taking a train from Gare du Nord 
104929,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The room was a little too small and there was not even a table to put the PC , The location was perfect for a short stay just in front of Gare du Nord where there is a very important transport center
104930,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Spacious and comfy bathroom but tiny sleeping space door was a bit twisted and hard to open no fridge or minibar in the room breakfast was not included and expensive standalone , Great location next to Gare du Nord station close to the centre and tourist attractions very easy transport to CDG airport nice atmosphere of classical style building

104933,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The room seemed poorly kept The carpet was dirty and stained The fan in the bathroom was on all night there was no way to turn it off It was really loud even with the door closed which made it difficult to get any sleep , Location

104935,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Basic bathroom with old fixtures and fittings No shampoo foam bath conditioner which other Mercure 4 stars provide as standard , Location needed something close to Gare du Nord and RER B Line Quiet bedroom considering this is in a very busy area
104936,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, They come daily to clean the room but they don t change the bed sheets and they keep it for more than a day I have reported the same hotel many times When they come in the morning to check the mini bar they knock the door and open directly without waiting even for 1 second which is veryyyyyyy bad , Location only
104937,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The staff was ok and the hotel rooms were not clean at all and size was really small Only after complaining and asking for changing the room they gave a decent room ,No Positive
104938,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, Location to station was great It was only a one night stay for us to connect with a train to the UK The location would be a long way from all the things most people would want to see in Paris The room we had was the top floor and was well used It could have done with a coat of paint and a tidy up it felt like it was in need of a good clean 
104939,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Room had an unusual smell and everything was a bit dated but the positives outweigh the negatives , Proximity to Gare du Nord station is the obvious answer 
104940,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, dirty carpet no slipper provided Noisy at night facing the station and many many loitering at station, Good location right infront of Gare du nord train and bus station

104949,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord,No Negative, It was a travel day and I was not feeling well The hotel was right across the street from the train station The staff was friendly room was clean comfortable and quiet Just what I needed 
104950,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, We didn t have anything bad to report , We stayed one night on route and left very early the next morning What we experienced was of a high standard helpful staff at the desk room and facilities excellent 
104951,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The room that they give me 308 hope I am right I don t want to remember that room the carpet is dirty because it s old otherwise it s clean but they should change it and I should not be charge, The location which is near the train station cleanliness the staffs especially the one assigned in baggage area
104952,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Two minus points for hotel breakfast is not included in the price and the price was not advertised anywhere I noticed Bathroom needed some repairs to the tub and the floor tiles Made it seem shabby and uncaredfor One minus for location but not hotel s fault most of the restaurants are overpriced with mediocre quality food typical vacation spot fare , Staff was very friendly and capable Location directly at Gard du Nord with excellent access to public transportation e g Tour Eiffel Louvre with a direct bus connection there was a lovely bakery around the corner with brilliant eclairs and an organic bakery closeby too 
104953,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, On our first night we discovered that we only had one plug socket working and none of the others were connected up or working There were light fittings with exposed wires Our room was changed the next day but the hotel were not prepared to give us a discount Because we had to change rooms we missed a group organised breakfast as the hotel kept us waiting , Location is fantastic
104954,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Bathroom and the sticky spray on the leather furniture, The bathroom needs a lot of updating the bin in the bathroom won t open The leather furniture was sprayed with some sticky stuff which was very bad 
104955,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, reception staff were not very clear and unhelpful to bother to explain Attitude problem they did not feel it necessary to be polite We would not go to that hotel again on our next visit to Paris , location good room ok but tired and a bit of grubby 
104956,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Room lighting was inadequate even by modern standards , This was extremely convenient for Gare du Nord where I arrived by Eurostar It was very easy to find opposite one of the main exits from the railway station Check in was straightforward I arrived late evening but there was time to visit the bar on the first floor This was a very pleasant experience I was able to have a nice relaxing drink in a quiet surround and I recommend it for other travellers staying here 
104957,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, The room was a lot smaller than we expected as on the pictures it looks larger and contained a sofa ours didn t There was no main light within the room such a a ceiling light There s was just a stand lamp which didn t produce that much light in within the evenings The location on the hotel is quite a bit away from main landmarks etc so have to get some from of transport , The hotel was just across the road from Gare Du Nord train station Even thought the room was lot smaller than we had expected it was a lovely fresh clean room We did have an issue with the wardrobe which on reporting to reception was fixed within 20mins 
104958,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, Passage to the rooms were like maze and we lost track of the route to the elevator Water used to cloggee at bathroom basin and they didn t care to fix it during our stay Safe in the room did not work Coffee maker was broken , The only positive thing about the hotel was its location which was just opposite to Gare du Nord 
104959,Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, I arrived early so I didn t expect to be checked in immediately however at least 8 other guests were checked in in the 2 hours I had to wait They were quite rude , Great location right across the road from Gare du Nord Lots of places nearby to eat Hop on off bus right outside also
