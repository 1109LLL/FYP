324417,Mercure Wien Zentrum, The internet wasn t very fast For a 4 star hotel we would have expected better , It was properly cleaned The stuff is friendly and open for questions The Hotel is in the centre so the location is really great The breakfast buffet is also very good good coffee and a big range of food and fresh fruits My girlfriend and I would recommand this hotel for a short trip 
324418,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Air conditioning did not warm the room It was cold in the apartment , The hotel is perfectly located Most of the places of interest are in walking distance Airport is 20 minutes away by bus Breakfast is quite good and personnel is polite 
324419,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Found the hotel to be excellent having stayed in many mercure hotels in europe , I liked the clean room and comfy bed The staff were really helpful The location of the hotel was really good 
324420,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Everything else Wi fi sucks They took me to the adjacent Mercure First where the internet speed was far better Nobody is bothered about your breakfast Crowd management during rush hour really bad Staff just go through their motion Rooms are really TINY I stumbled on my suitcase multiple times Staff at the reception are least bothered about your stay never enquired about our experience while checking out Steer clear of this hotel Period , Location 
324421,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Although the brochure said room service until 10pm I asked to have a sandwhich delivered to my room at 9 44 and they said the kitchen was closed , Good location in the center but on a quiet street
324422,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Bed is not firm , Your reception people are very helpful and accommodating They provided me with packaging tape which I badly needed that I could not find from any store in the area The staff was truly a blessing at the time I needed help I did not expect them to provide the tape I needed I like taking the shower because of its strong pressure 
324423,Mercure Wien Zentrum, noise the hotel is not sound proof if they allow pets there should be a different wing of the hotel room is too small, the beds were confy the hotel was clean staff was helpful
324424,Mercure Wien Zentrum, We thought that the breakfast price was expensive at 16 euros each but I guess it would be good value if you weren t planning to eat at restaurants in the evening or sample all of those amazing cakes on offer in Vienna , Clean comfortable rooms in a great location The front desk staff were helpful in organising taxis for us and recommending a nice restaurant We thought the free walking tour on Saturday morning was really great the guide showed us places off the usual tourist paths and really brought the city to life for us 
324425,Mercure Wien Zentrum, internet speed, in the middle of city attractions close to metro stations 2 3 min Danube river and boat trip is a short walk 7 minutes walk to the hop on hop off bus station all kind of restaurants around the area taxi stop is just few steps away
324426,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Price is high but Vienna s hotels expensive The hotel on the middle of center on weekends its so noisy outside there is nothing to do people who prefer calm can be bothered , The location of hotel awesome We walk everywhere Also transportation is so easy The bed and pillow extremely soft I feel like at home room size is ok not spending time at room just for sleeping 
324427,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Elevators too slow you have to wait and the reception staff a bit slow , I like the room it was not too large but perfectly equipped and the bed was extremely comfortable The bed was wonderful The position next to Schewdenplatz metro make the location perfect to explore Wien and to reach any destination in Wien including the CAT station train to the airport in Wien mitte Breakfast excellent and relatively cheap 
324428,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Room was very tiny and noisy because it was at 1st floor Lobby is really small for a four star hotel , Situation is near to cathedral restaurants and some other amusements 
324429,Mercure Wien Zentrum, As mentioned by other reviews we weren t wild about the bathroom door sliding frosted glass partition with a hole in place of a handle, Got the Airport bus 8 Eur each one way to Morzinplatz Schwedenplatz a 2 3 min walk to the hotel Location was great 5 min walk to Stephansdom right in the centre We didn t eat in the hotel so can t comment on the food We stayed three nights and were out and about most of the time so didn t make use of all the hotel facilities Our room 5th floor was good with an excellent shower We liked the mini fridge useful for keeping milk etc in There is a Spar supermarket very near the hotel The staff were very helpful with directions info they reserved concert tickets for us as well On the last day we checked out early to go and watch Morning Training at the Spanish Riding School and were able to leave our bags securely at the hotel until we returned at about 6pm to go to the airport 
324430,Mercure Wien Zentrum, The food in the restaurant was poor My worst club sandwich in years I ve traveled to many Mercure Hotels this has nothing to do with the rest The room was small the aisle seemed claustrophobic ,No Positive
324431,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Carpet covered rooms are not healthy and unfortunately dusty and not perfectly clean, Convenient location Moderate service and personnell but price value balance is satisfactory
324432,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Old and very expensive for a Mercure Amenities are not to required standard especially for this price In addition it is right next to a very big building site that starts work at 6am I do not recommend ,No Positive
324433,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Although for one person my room had two single beds and two single blankets Free internet in the room was very slow and as basic as it gets For better speed you should pay for premium internet Even if you are a smoker avoid smoking rooms because they are quite smelly , The personnel was very polite the breakfast was nice and the location is fantastic 
324434,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Wifi was not great I advise having a 4G dongle instead , Great location and breakfast Helpful staff helped me find my passport which I dropped accidentally 
324435,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Housekeeping woke me up at 8AM not sure why they must disturb the guests that early furthermore during breakfast the service was very slow when I ordered an EARL GREY tea I had to follow up with 2 different staff members and then they brought me an Engl Breakfast tea when I asked the male waiter if this is Earl grey he literally said No this is black tea but its also tasty definitely room to improve with the staff , the room was nice the hostess in the restaurant was very nice and welcoming 
324436,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Room is not that spacious and there is no gymnasium to work out No porter service can be inconvenience for family with small children and a lot of luggages, The staff were very helpful The location is very close to the shopping places and restaurants Breakfast spread was good 
324437,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Wifi in our room was almost non existent No fitness centre although listed in the fitness centre category in the search engine, Helpful staff Great breakfast No noise at night Excellent location close to city centre and offices
324438,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Absolutely nothing, The location of the hotel was brilliant as it is so close to the major attractions You can walk everywhere and there are also quite a few good restaurants and cafes nearby The staff were wonderful and so helpful since it was my first time visiting Vienna They organised transport to pick me up from the airport The room was clean and tidy I would definitely recommend this hotel 
324439,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Hotel looks much better on pictures than in real Looks pretty cheap in real Small rooms and trash under bed , Great location Few steps from City centre 
324440,Mercure Wien Zentrum, The room was small and there was no view Breakfast not included , We were able to check in earlier without problem Staff were friendly The room and bathroom were clean The location was not bad 
324441,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Room a wee bit small but wasnt a problem Maybe nice to have bigger reception and bar area, Design and fittings in room were great Loved the big shower and trendy bathroom fittings
324442,Mercure Wien Zentrum, The rooms are small but clean and cosy The cleaning staff is very noisy No parking available pricy if needed a garage The parking service is even more expensive 37 euros day and every time you need the car it will charge an extra 12 euros way basicaly more than renting a car , Great location just 2 min walk to Stephan s Dome restaurants and main attractions Available rooms for smokers 
324443,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Nothing not to like, Everything was perfect Small but very cosy rooms designed for great comfort Breakfast was plentyfull Great free tour of Vienna on saturdays 
324444,Mercure Wien Zentrum,No Negative, Good location near bus hoponhopoff and taxi Place completely new with all needed comforts for a short city trip For cakes dinner or whatever go to Castelletto nearby you would be really satisfied 
324445,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Bathroom door didn t close properly modern funky design with sliding glass door and big hole in and internet was a bit slow, Location room facilities were good
324446,Mercure Wien Zentrum, It did get a bit noisy outside particularly during the early hours with bin lorries emptying bottle banks however this wasn t the hotel s fault and you have to expect this in a city centre hotel , Staff very helpful and friendly room very comfortable location outstanding All the inner city tourist sites were walkable as was the station for the City Train to and from the airport 
324447,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Room smelt of smoke air conditioning was poor woke up in the middle of the night nearly choking my thiroatwas that drug rooms did not look like photos advertised God only knows what the solarium advertised online is staff knew nothing about it , Location 
324448,Mercure Wien Zentrum,No Negative, I stayed one night in the Italian inspired room on the 8th floor Lukas checked me He was very helpful in showing me where the hotel was located on a map as well as where the landmarks of the city are The room was quiet and had all the amenities I needed The hotel is right in the centre of all tourist attractions and easy to get to by underground Would recommend this hotel 
324449,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Glass doors to bathroom would make difficulties for a romantic weekend Challenging when sharing with my daughter Directions to bus stop for airport bus could be clearer, Convenient and everything needed Breakfast good value
324450,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Bathroom very cramped with sliding door that didn t fit properly and had a big hole in it so not too much privacy Too noisy outside to have the window open at night and ventilation inside the room not very effective on coolest setting I wouldn t have liked to be there on a very warm night in the summer Major roadworks going on right outside bit of an eyesore One double duvet preferred on a double bed rather than two single ones , Breakfast was adequate if expensive at EUR16
324451,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Construction work outside could be annoying if the window was left open The double glazing kept out the noise if the window was kept shut I would have preferred a firmer mattress on the bed , Just a short walk to the cathedral but a bit longer to get to the Hofburg Palace The hotel was close to the metro and also the airport bus stop The breakfast was good value The staff were very helpful 
324452,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Nothing to mention, Overall everything was very suitable for a 2 3 day stay including breakfast and the location was very good for a tourist The room and facilities were good and we would suggest it to any friends 
324453,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Cost of parking in the city is high but the hotel has an agreement with an underground carpark nearby but still expensive approx 40 euros a day, Staff were very accommodating and friendly all main sights are within 30mins walking distance in the town centre
324454,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Unreliable WiFi Had to change room after first night as original room was too small had cracked wash basin and a hole in place of handle in bathroom door Unreliable early morning calls , Staff were very pleasant and attentive to our needs Bed and pillows exceptionally comfortable
324455,Mercure Wien Zentrum, The room was smaller than I expected with only one chair The lighting was very dim The free wifi was very slow perhaps it was to get us to buy the premium version since the one setup in the lobby was really very fast , The location was ideal for exploring the center of Vienna by foot
324456,Mercure Wien Zentrum, When checking in we found the reception staff dismissive and unhelpful Every day around 8am we were rudely woken with one knock followed by a cleaner barging through the door I found this very unacceptable not only was this rude I felt like i had no privacy , Very central close to the metro Clean Quiet location 
324457,Mercure Wien Zentrum, When I checked it I was told that I booked two rooms for two people each where in fact I had just booked one room for two people The problem was quickly resolved but since I booked through a hotel booking website and not directly through the hotel I suspect something wasn t properly communicated , price room and location
324458,Mercure Wien Zentrum, only the variety of food for the breakfast was fair it could be better, I liked everything in the hotel the staff are friendly the room are big and very comfortable and very clean
324459,Mercure Wien Zentrum,No Negative, Location was good only 15 20 mins walk to CAT line from airport 5 mins to Danube canal for a boat trip 10 15 mins to hop on and hop off bus Plenty of reasonable restaurants in area too Staff friendly 
324460,Mercure Wien Zentrum, air condition was very hot small rooms bathroom need to look after because win have a shower the water come out of the bathrrom, good and near market 
324461,Mercure Wien Zentrum, The bathroom door was a modern sliding glass door which didn t make the bathroom as private as it could have been , The hotel was very modern and the location was great The staff was very friendly and the breakfast was awesome 
324462,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Rooms could be more isolated one can hear people walking through the corridor at night , Location is perfect in the heart of the old city center at the edge of very vivid tourist area It s a modernly decorated and comfortable hotel unlike most of others in that area Standard service for 4 star hotel not more not less It s right in the old centre of the town sightseeing shops and restaurants are just a few steps away but the hotel itself is in a very quiet street I liked complimentary coffee and tee in the room Great for people who do not have much free time to spend in Vienna but would like to make maximum out of it 
324463,Mercure Wien Zentrum, The bathroom was a little small and the glass sliding door didn t give you much privacy , The hotel is in a great location being very close to stefanplatz The room was generally comfortable and there was very little street noise We went with the recommendation of other reviews on here and didn t include breakfast in our rate That turned out to be a great decision as there are lots of great breakfast options nearby Joma is particularly recommended 
324464,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Free Wifi in room too weak not supporting live broadcasts High speed available at extra cost , Good location 5mins walk from St Stephans 5 mins from Schwedenplatz transport hub incl airport bus Lots of restaurants nearby Quiet rooms Ok breakfast although a little pricey 
324465,Mercure Wien Zentrum, All good , The central location was perfect The room was perfect with tons of hot water in the cascade shower On Saturday the hotel also provided a FREE guided tour of the hidden places of Vienna one with an English guide and one with a German guide Services like this made our stay memorable Perfect Thanks p s make sure to visit the Hunterwasser Houses 
324466,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Breakfast was average , Central very comfortable bed nicely arranged facilities Was upgraded on arrival to extras i e Nespresso machine bathrobe and slippers free mini bar 
324467,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Breakfast was very expensive for what you get Some lovely cafes around the hotel though , The location of this hotel is great Everything is walking distance The hotel is clean and comfortable Bus to the airport is just around the corner 
324468,Mercure Wien Zentrum, These are just tiny little details We had a twin bed instead of double as requested but we also asked for a quiet room so the hotel might have focused on this criteria first and it was really appreciated Room cleaning around lunch time while we were expecting to have some break in the room but apart from this the hotel is really excellent , The room was really quiet and the hotel is clean and nicely decorated Lots of nice attentions from the staff on our arrival day Nice view on Vienne roofs and really central location closed from transports touristic sites shops and restaurants 
324469,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Glass door between the bathroom and the room does not provide enough privacy I didn t like this concept , Very helpful staff great location nice room clean and comfortable 
324470,Mercure Wien Zentrum, The bathroom had a sliding glass door which I thought wasn t great, The staff where really helpful and polite I found the rooms were quite clean there was some dirt on the shelf in the wardrobe but other then that really happy overall would recommend as really close to the city centre and transport links
324471,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Room layout was a little cramped No mirror in the main bedroom so bathroom had to be shared when getting ready Breakfast over priced and not really that good , The location was excellent walking distance to lots of the attractions bars and restaurants Nice big comfortable bed Room clean and warm 
324472,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Door keys didn t work initially Room too hot and air conditioning not great Window wouldn t open more than a small amount , Staff were great Free tour Clean 
324473,Mercure Wien Zentrum, A bit noisy given the location Breakfast was definitely not worth the money very poor selection and had to go and personally ask for coffee after no one came for 10 minutes The waiter didn t really care much either , Absolutely great location it s 5 minutes walk to Stephanplatz Very welcoming reception staff Clean and modern 
324474,Mercure Wien Zentrum, wi fi signal could be stronger, very good location quiet area close to metro clean room helpful staff i ll stay here for sure next time when in Wien 
324475,Mercure Wien Zentrum, The Wifi was really poor and disappointing The design of the bathroom door affords no privacy it is made of frosted glass and has a large hole as it s handle which made it uncomfortable while travelling with my daughter , The location 
324476,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Not a luxury one but without any issues and basically very good for the price , Perfect location very close to Saint Stefan cathedral Silent street Breakfast is very good as well 
324477,Mercure Wien Zentrum, The bathroom door was a glass sliding door Would prefer a normal door , The hotel staff we friendly The rooms were clean and very comfortable We stayed in a double room Not very spacious but enough for the two of us The breakfast was very tasty 
324478,Mercure Wien Zentrum, I was on the fifth floor and there was a strong odor of food in the hallway The air conditioning really wasn t air conditioning The bathroom had no ventilation , Location Option of having my room cleaned every day or not Convenience of breakfast in the hotel 
324479,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Rooms are really close to cramped , Reception staff were great very helpful and efficient Breakfast staff quiet and inattentive just what one needs after a night out 
324480,Mercure Wien Zentrum, Would have liked wine in the bar fridge The young man serving on the terrace needs a little more training , Great people Most comfortable beds in Vienna Coffee station in room was super All in all a fantastic experience Well done all at Mercure Wien Zentrum 
324481,Mercure Wien Zentrum, The rooms are too small The mini bar is free in privilege rooms but the concerned staff does not take proper care to refill it , Location of hotel is good Lady at the reception namely Ms Amina is very professional and responsible 
324482,Mercure Wien Zentrum, A c was there but lacking we hit the time when it was very hot Would have been nice to have fans available , The staff was very helpful and the facilities were clean Including a light breakfast would be nice
