160702,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The view over the railways from my room The pool closed early , The bar open late and serving food that made a perfect little meal Quick service good choice Location next to the Battersea park just across the road Very easy to reach the hotel by bus good to know if you are actually living in hotel and going there for a city break for instance 
160703,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Unfortunate experience with lunch upon our arrival Attention to detail would have saved a lot of unnecessary bad feeling and lack of confidence in the ability of staff involved , Restaurant food exceptional service and attention very good Room very comfortable and spacious 
160704,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa,No Negative, Second time I have used for business My room was really clean and well presented I was on the quiet side of the hotel so really lovely Facilities good nice pool not huge but there was no one else in when I went for early morning laps Also sauna and stream Breakfast offers really good selection They were busy good service when I first sat down I asked for fried eggs which are cooked to order which were a bit slow coming out Overall really good quality hotel close to central London and Chelsea Really nice to have Battersea Park just across the road great park really nice feature lots to see 
160705,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Even at the coolest setting the room was too hot at night This was not during a spell of hot weather which in any case does not bother me The breakfast room was also too warm in places near the aircon outflows although the staff could not have been more helpful in trying to move me to a cooler part of the area , The bathroom was wonderful with a great shower Bed very comfortable and room spacious 
160706,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Lack of nearby public transportation distance for places of tourist interest , Room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable Location near the park and the Thames is good and pleasant for walks 
160707,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The photographs of the hotel make the public areas look much bigger than they actually are consequently the bar area can get very full While there a large group moved into have drinks which made it impossible for individuals to sit anywhere or order anything so we had to leave to find refreshments elsewhere The location is poor Battersea is a pretty dead part of London over the bridge on the north side is Pimlico also a dead area and the bottom part of Chelsea it s a hike to find some life Air conditioning in rooms is poor avoid sleeping here on hot summer days , Beds are comfortable and the rooms and bathrooms quite big for a city hotel 
160708,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Mattress needs to be replaced Poor selection of breakfast and expensive for value of money morning coffee was tasteless location is a bit far from all the attractions in London minimum fare to the nearest attraction is about 10 Pounds no close public transportation to the hotel only buses which don t accept cash , Extra bed was very comfortable Staff very helpful from checkin till checkout room was relaxing and spacious A C works perfectly small bathrooms but no problem taxis always available hotel is well know to taxi drivers over all value for money is 7 10
160709,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa,No Negative, Helpful staff some other visitors at this hotel were a bit pretentious rude But nice hotels attract that sort A man just stepped in front of me to get some attention no manners The reception staff did apologise to me which was good it did not go unnoticed Rooms comfortable and a safe nice place to sleep 
160710,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The air conditioning machine in both of the rooms we were in after having been moved because of this were very poor They barely cooled he room down and were noisy so I was kept awake by the clinking noise , The pool and steam room were excellent 
160711,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, No complaints, The hotel staff were all well trained in customer service and wanted to help in any way they could Rooms were a decent size and had everything needed with large comfy beds Breakfast was good value given the quality of food and selection offered Loved the fact it isn t a massive hotel which makes having breakfast there a much more civilised experience 
160712,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Rooms on the back side too noisy because of trains Blind shields donot stop the light in the room Restaurant for diner need some improvement in terms of food variety and also for atmosphere Very poor, Breakfast was nice Size of room is nice and confortable
160713,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Breakfast could have been warmer though service was excellent, About a 25 minute strolling from Sloane Square tube really impressed close to Batteries Park excellent room modern clean
160714,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Room was not ready on arrival which forced us to have lunch in the restaurant It looked like they had staff shortages as many people were being asked to wait to access their rooms They offered complimentary tea or coffee for the inconvenience Hotel seemed a bit unorganised and was not as good as when we stayed there two years ago Leather sofa in room needed a really good clean , Location was excellent for us attending Chelsea FC Award Dinner Excellent parking facilities 
160715,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Pool was great as noted below but could have done without the 3 snogging couples strategically placed one at either end and one n middle I think I ll have to take a fella next time I go , Helpful staff in reception floodlit pool and sauna steam were great loved the candles and the chilled out atmosphere in the pool area Kid free zone until 1130am 
160716,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Bedroom beverage tray was limited No Green Tea or alternative available Breakfast was good but avocado and halloumi would have been a bonus and gluten free on display although it was available ,No Positive
160717,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Would be nice to have a wider variety on the bar menu for food , The accessible wet room for a wheelchair user looked good initially but found the flip down seat for disabled person to sit on and shower was extremely stiff to pull down We informed the hotel Regular maintenance of the facility was needed otherwise a disabled person could not use it Also plug sockets need to be available near the bed to charge a phone or wheelchair Although hotels are improving for the disabled they don t realise the needs of a person in a wheelchair 
160718,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, No shops or restaurants close to the hotel The white pvc sofa in front of the window in the room , Being close to the river and Battersea Park Easy walking distance to Chelsea and Sloane Square 
160719,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, We didn t have breakfast as it was way overpriced 20 50 Usually we have this included in the price of the room Not very impressed We wanted a drink in the bar were told it was waiter service we sat down and waited but no one came so we had to go to the bar again Eventually we got our drink They weren t even busy , We picked it because it was close to our meeting place 
160720,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, I was told I was able to check out at 14 00 and pay additional 20 for each hour after I m taking this as an option to leAve later as I wanted to use the spa then at 13 00 someone knocked the door and told me I had to leave , The food was amazing
160721,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Some of the staff where not welcoming some were really good So as usual bad leave u with bad impression Anyhow I didn t get to deal with staff all the time so I enjoyed my time the room I booked was really good compare to other hotels in London mine was one bed room suite and it was comfy , I loved the hotel and the location

160727,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The room I was in was very tired big stains on the wallpaper the first room I was put in was dark and smelt of damp I was moved from there but second room was only marginally better it had an exercise bike in the room very random and was in the way ,No Positive
160728,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The buffet breakfast didn t offer great selection English breakfast without mushrooms or black pudding Scramble eggs did not resemble the taste of an egg Some freshly fried and boiled eggs would definitely add to the experience , Rooms were spacious with great ambient Lovely pool SPA area 
160729,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Mushrooms at breakfast, Room was spacious lovely bathroom trowels changed daily staff helpful and friendly trains didn t spoil our stay we would all stay again and recommend to friends and family breakfast was divine one of my party would have liked mushrooms at breakfast 
160730,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The train station is a tad further than I thought but really not a big deal , Got upgraded to a suite so had a great experience The room was very comfortable and in a nice style staff really helpful and there is a handy little shop nearby for essentials snacks etc 
160731,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Price of breakfast , Room extremely clean all staff so friendly efficient and professional King size bed v comfortable Cooked breakfast fresh and not at all greasy

160733,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Difficult to find and by the time i got there the spa had closed The receptionist gave out incorrect information to me once by giving me the wrong postcode to find the place when i phoned as i was a bit lost and then the opening times of the spa Not enough coffee and milk in the room for one let alone two double room but i rang housekeeping and they bought more , Very lovely room and comfortable bed Would make a nice break for a couple

160737,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Waited a long time for afternoon tea apparently it had been dropped by a member of staff Feel they should have explained the reason for the delay which we would have understood Instead we had to keep chasing it up , Location excellent rooms comfortable and quirky The Portuguese staff are all very friendly and welcoming The barman Fredrico took the trouble to make the cocktails we requested although not on the list Very convenient having use of car park 
160738,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The curtains could have blocked the light out a bit better in the morning but this is a very minor grumble about what is a fantastic hotel , Very spacious room great value good facilities friendly staff comfortable bed and good quality bed linen and towels We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely return 
160739,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Lack of restaurants and pubs around TV in the room and the multimedia system are outdated and require an upgrade , Room size and bed were excellent especially for London Good wifi in the room to browse and watch Netflix Peaceful hotel just the way I like it The BBQ ribs at the hotel s restaurant must be tried by everyone 
160740,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The meal in the restaurant was average we opted for the tapas as main course and it was greasy and repetitive I saw a small selection of dishes already laid out at 5pm in the heat of the restaurant the staff said there would be more out later The menu card was dirty and we couldn t understand why anyone would serve turkey as the roast of the day Unfortunately the beds were of poor quality and cheap so we got little sleep on both nights I put my duvet under me to not feel the springs Most hotels of this calibre all have pillow top mattresses Despite friendly staff and great location we will not stay again which is a pity ,No Positive
160741,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The rooms were so hot we opened the window but the train lines were so busy and noisy we had to shut it again the aircon took ages to cool the room down and we don t like using it as it drys the air , The breakfast was lovely plentiful and fresh

160744,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Genuinely finding it difficult to think of anything Very minor point no car park but not really an issue in Central London , Lovely modern room which had a lovely big sofa for us both to sit on and watch TV much better than having to sit on the bed Rooms were also much more generous in size than other hotels we have stayed in in London Great having Battersea Park Chelsea shops so close Staff very friendly and helpful Large desk which we noted would be good if staying on business Would have used spa if we had been staying for longer 
160745,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, My tv did not have the option for movies on demand however the staff offered me a free drink as a good will i was very happy, Vefy comfortablea and modern

160750,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa,No Negative, Very friendly pleasant and responsive staff The spa area was small but well kept and we really enjoyed the sauna The robes were very comfortable and a nice extra It was a little inconvenient in terms of location since most of the sightseeing we did was along the Thames but it was a beautiful location nonetheless and in very close proximity to the lovely Chelsea Bridge Really good experience overall 
160751,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, I had to attend a quick meeting after breakfast but before checkout time and wanted to return to my room until 11am However the cleaners were already in my room thinking that I had checked out A pity , Good breakfast extra and funky lighting in rooms bathroom

160757,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, TV set needs an update and the gym fitness room was way too small and poorly equipped , Very well managed hotel with large clean rooms I liked the location very much only minutes from Sloan Square Very good value for the money 
160758,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, T V was not great hand control quite old The vanetian blind between bedroom and bathtoom was a little odd , Size of room Window actually opened Comfort nice swimming pool Was not too expensive Car park next door 25 per day but free car parking in surrounding streets at week end Near Battersea Pk Great cafe there for breakfast too Good cocktails in bar Great housekeeping They changed our room when we had heating problem

160763,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Coffee provided in room was only decaf although regular was provided promptly after we called to request it The only real problem was that the air was not moving or turning over in the room overnight and we could not find the switch to turn on a fan or A C Therefore the night s sleep was not especially good since the resulting atmosphere in the room was stale and stuffy , Bedroom is well appointed with good bedding and everything needed for a comfortable stay Reception staff very helpful and friendly Good parking available next door in NCP although not provided by the hotel

160783,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, PARKING It is NOT 23 per day It s 25 per day BUT the day you check in is counted as a full day so arriving at 3pm Thurs and leaving at 9am Sat cost us 60 THIS IS NOT CLEAR on Booking com and the hotel say is out of their hands however they conveniently didn t mention it when we checked in As far as I m concerned a two night stay in a hotel where it states so much per day should cost you twice that figure Also our room wasn t serviced despite us being out all day We had to ring Reception when we got back and it was then done at 5pm and to top it all the shower was broken boiling water pouring from the top of the over sized showerhead so needed replacing and meant we couldn t shower on the first morning All in all very disappointing and the first of many stays via Booking com that didn t live up to expectations I ve had better experiences booking Premier Inn direct ,No Positive

160786,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Train station was slightly further than reviews suggested but it was on a good route to London Victoria were the underground was easy accessed , Reception staff couldn t have accommodated us anymore When we returned to the hotel to collect our bags after checking out I asked would it be possible to use the shower facilities at the spa to freshen up as we were meeting up with friends before travelling home When we discovered the shower was an open shower beside the pool the management at reception were more than happy to give us an access key so we could use the private shower in the gym Also arrived at the hotel to beautiful scattering of rose petals on the bed in the shape of a 21 to celebrate my boyfriends birthday the hotel went above what they were required to do to accommodate us at such a great price 
160787,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The bed was 2 doubles together It s very common in Europe but this place felt like they could have gone for a single queen or king , Very large room with a huge bathroom including tub They have robes in the room and every amenity that makes you want to stay in the room 
160788,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Having stayed at this hotel chain in Berlin we felt that the London hotel was just a little less to our liking , The pool is a lovely facility We really enjoyed the view of Battersea power station from our window The staff were helpful and friendly The breakfast was a wide choice from fruit to continental to full English Good location for central London 
160789,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, We wanted to have massage treatments but couldnt as the price list was so high and too much to pay afterthe high room charge and other expenses we made to be there The view is not what I requested and the room is not what I paid for This was upsetting as the description said something else I am waiting to hear why this was the case The spa was small and steam room didnt have cole water taps as nearly every place I been to does Shame we had to ask for an iron slippers which we never got X2 coffee sachets when I alone use 2 and x1 shampoo when we both have very long hair even the one wasn t enough for just me alone There was black likes marks on our white squared cushion next to the desk , The bed was comfortable the room was warm and welcoming The staff that attended to us while we was there were polite The decor was nice and unique and over all the place and room looked good

160792,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Noise from the trains constantly rumbling past the rear of the hotel Views of the tower block building site Car parking on site is very expensive 35 for a 1 night stay TV in the room was small and temprental to operate Large double bed No two singles joined together , This place is clean and modern the rooms are bright and of good size
160793,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, I thought the staff were rude and unattentive We had a light supper in the bar and the staff were too busy talking amongst themselves to notice the guests The food was very very mediocre and very expensive I ordered a bowl of olives that came in a bowl swimming with oil but nothing to get them out with There were no napkins The table was wet where the drinks were put straight onto the glass table Breakfast was only as good as a Holiday Inn and yet again the staff were awful This experience cost 221 definitely not worth that price , The location was good for where we needed to be and the room was not too bad but not worth 22 very disappointed 
160794,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, I think hotel is over priced n the beds were very uncomfortable didnt have hood sleep also joined to singles bed mattresses together would go here next time, Swmming and spa was good 
160795,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, No free wifi in the rooms The shower cubicle feels very small compared to other hotels that have nice walk in showers The tap did fall off in the bath tub , It feels comfortable and luxurious 
160796,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Bathroom was a massive disappointment for a higher rated room Very SMALL awful shower for a 4 hotel far too crammed, Breakfast was great value for London 13 50 if you ordered from reception the day before SPA was very good 
160797,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Staff on reception new and a little confused so gave inaccurate information about cost of parking but all forgiveable, Everything Loved it and wanted to move in
160798,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Pool area needs atmospheric music a little louder to really top off a beautiful area , The hotel is beautifully decorated with a fantastic pool and sauna area 
160799,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The bed was actually two halves one hard and one very hard Real milk for our tea would have been nice , Convenient location overlooking Battersea Park Big rooms and bathrooms with both bath and shower Enormous bed with beautiful feather pillows Very quiet There is an excellent mini mart just inside the next door flats for snacks milk etc Hotel staff were very helpful and polite Taxis always available at hotel entrance and busstop was very close too

160803,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Our sheets for the bed were not clean and had snot on the pillowcase and sheets we called reception to have it replaced and when we came back 6 hours later nothing was done we called again and the member of staff that turned up did not apolygise once and seemed fustrating that they had to provide us with clean sheets and did not care hoe much it would bother someone who paid alot of money this was our second time staying here based on how much we loved it here before and unfortunately this is be our last based on this experience,No Positive
160804,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Can t think of anything that I could criticise , The food in the bar area was excellent enjoyed a Greek salad one day and a Greek platter on another both very good 
160805,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, the hotel is very conveniently accessible by public transport but you have to know this take metro to Sloane Square and take from there bus 452 or 137 for about 5 minutes Bus stops almost in front of the hotel It would have been convenient if I would have known that before my arrival , friendly staff new hotel nice decoration and furniture cosy wellness
160806,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa,No Negative, Lovely hotel staff were fantastic We arrived at 8am as I was on a course and they kindly made our room a priority so my husband could could check in about 10 30am staff very friendly highly recommend 
160807,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, On this occasion they put me in a rear facing room which had continuous train noise as it is close to the tracks, I stay here regularly because of the location cleanliness and comfortable beds
160808,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, They pre charged 3 nights 100 No impact however they could make it clear at booking , It s convenient no fuss The staff are very helpfull nice and polite
160809,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Bar staff were clueless about the drinks we ordered There was a Leffe White Beer on the menu we were given a Leffe Brown Beer with no explanation They didn t even know it wasn t the correct beer The also serviced us 2 old fashioned cocktails with soda water in them When this was queried we were asked what shoudl be in an old fashioned so they could re make it for us The 2nd attempt after us explaining how to make one was full of undissolved sugar grains Have stayed in better 4 star hotels Bit of a walk to Victoria the nearest tube About 10 mins , Spacious room Modern decor Comfortable king sized bed 
160810,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Cannot find one fault with the hotel My boyfriend and I absolutely loved the experience Would go again in a heartbeat if we could , The bed was incredibly comfortable and large enough for me to almost lose my boyfriend in it The pillows were amazing I want some for home Staff were absoutely fantastic Really on it My boyfriend can t eat wheat at the moment and we queried whether he could eat a specific main the restaurant staff checked with the chef and came back to us and told my boyfriend what starters he could and couldn t have as well as the information about the mains Same happened when we ate at the bar too they came back to tell us that he was unable to have a specific ingredient as it contained wheat and asked him what alternative he would like instead Honestly couldn t fault the hotel everything was spectacular We didn t want to come home 
160811,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The staff rudely disputed my booking when I was given a double bed rather than a twin room which was on my booking and a particular member of staff held this against me On top of this the breakfasts hot food cost 25 Each Rip off for what you get , The location and design of the hotel were fantastic Mostly friendly staff and a lovely bar The rooms were well equipped and very nicely decorated 
160812,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Even in central London I expect breakfast to be included for over 100 a night not that it mattered on this occasion I had to check out too early The spa is pleasant but rather small and basic with half a dozen people present it felt crowded The location is nice enough between the Thames and Battersea Park but getting there by public transport involved a long walk ironic when the train line runs right by the hotel , The room was brilliant and quite luxurious comfortable clean and with very good facilities The bathroom in particular was very nice and the bed was huge The food at the bar also came as a nice surprise I normally make a habit of avoiding hotel meals I usually find them overpriced and unimaginative but the Pestana Burger was excellent big tasty and very good value for money 
160813,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, It s a long walk from the tube but there is a bus stop right opposite Getting back after the tube closes can be difficult A good breakfast spoiled by terrible coffee , Good standard of finish in the rooms An excellent bed and the communal areas were pleasant Staff were professional and helpful Nice to be close to the park for a stroll by the river after doing lots of hectic city stuff 0

160817,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Some of the fittings were getting a bit worn and the bathroom design was slightly awkward The nearest pub is ten minutes away which seemed odd for central London , The room which I got at half price was enormous and there was a terrific view across Battersea Park 
160818,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Lack of sockets in bedroom to charge wheelchair so necessary Fold down rails in wet room didn t all come down due to lime scale , The wet room for wheelchair user was very good Good night lights in wet room small Fridge provided excellent Beds comfy pillows and duvet great Air conditioning very effective Light bright room Lovely sofa and foot stool Kettle and some tea bags etc provided Staff helpful when asked 
160819,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, On this trip I arrived booking a deluxe double but got to single beds made as singles and pushed together also the TVs did not work and reception had to come up and reboot it also I needed to iron for some cloths for a meeting and was told no iron was possible because they had been all given out and not returned so had to go to a important meeting with unironed cloths not the best stay I have had Sorry prestana your normally great , Firstly let me say I stay hear a lot it a great hotel by friendly proffesional staff and has always been clean and a goods night sleep in the past

160822,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Ordered food and had to go and collect but staff were very rude and it was late at night and the location , Loved everything apart from the location and if you order food to your room I had to get changed out of my pj s and go and collect but then anyone can enter the hotel without permission and the staff were quiet rude about it
160823,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Could hear the trains at night Not very noisy but aware they were running , Great facilities pool and spa Lovely room and friendly staff Comfortable and felt safe My 11 year old loved it 
160824,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Not much maybe some paper hankies in the room unless they were there already and I missed them , Liked the separate shower in the bathroom The good quality toilet rolls
160825,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Nothing, The bed was enormous and so comfy The staff were so attentive There was a beautiful park opposite with little peddle boats on a lake It was a lovely hotel and room service was cheap and tasty This was our favourite hotel that we have stayed in Will definitely be visiting again

160827,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The check in staff weren t as polite as expected Trying to sort a query out with another member of staff in the middle of checking me in Took so much time that I had to interrupt and ask him to check me in first as I had a baby past his bedtime due to Chelsea bridge Road closure Also baby cot I asked for was appalling the Mattress didn t even fit so I had to pad the bottom part out with the bath towels and put extra blankets over the whole thing for some comfort , Bathroom was beautiful Loved the lighting and the shape of the bath Very relaxing 
160828,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Disappointed with fitness Centre It s just a converted bedroom on the second floor with a few pieces of equipment in , Good location Comfortable and clean
160829,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Location far from The Tube They restrict the hours children can use the pool Inconvenient to the level of useless , We enjoyed our stay Very nicely decorated and clean The only criticism is location to The Tube is quite far Next time I will book a hotel close to The Tube Second thing I specifically booked this hotel because I wanted a swimming pool for my 10 year old boy The hours for children were so limited we were only able to use the pool once for 45 mins 
160830,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The service left a bit to be desired For example we ordered room service with a soda that required an opener They didn t provide us with an opener and when I requested one it was never delivered We needed an iron which was brought to us quickly However it didn t work Cleanliness was pretty good but the couch was dirty and there were spots on the blanket on the bed , The room was a good size The hotel was quiet in general 
160831,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Restaurant and spa open till later especially on weekends, Very clean room Comfortable and large double bed Breakfast service very good and efficient Room service good also delicious

160836,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Shower temperature control was already broken in bathroom and didn t know until time of using it flung off on my girlfriends foot If more central would be more ideal but was very quiet and relaxing Bed was of a poor quality I expected better for the amount I paid Hotel menu was very pricey even by London standards , Hotel was spotless credit to all cleaning staff Room was very smart with a modern finish Parking right next to hotel was ideal 40 for 2 nights 
160837,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa,No Negative, Great location for Chelsea Flower Show Very reasonable weekend parking Super friendly staff Loved that it was in London but not central making it easy to drive to Good public transport connections to central London 
160838,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, We didn t have breakfast in the hotel as we felt that it was expensive There is an excellent local shop just metres from the hotel , Friendly competent staff A broken lamp was soon fixed Our room was very clean and comfortable The whole hotel had a nice feel to it and everywhere was tastefully decorated Good bus links to the shops and entertainment areas 
160839,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The staff at the desk and bar could have been friendlier They were not rude however they could make a little more effort in welcoming guests Also it was a little out of the way However that was down to myself in not doing enough research in to location , The rooms were fantastic Modern and clean The Spa facilities and staff in the Spa were exceptional 
160840,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Nothing, A well run well equipped well located hotel within easy reach of Sloane Square etc but not charging crazy prices Nice staff Our home from home in London

160844,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Very noisy from train line next door no slippers for spa but they brought us some A variety of teas would have been good very odd shaped bath exercise bike in room was broken spa needs a Jacuzzi, They went out to buy us a newspaper and delivered it to our room when we forgot to order one great 
160845,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Fitness Centre is misleading and doesn t adequately illustrate the reality which is effectively a small hotel room with a few cardio machines and 1 free weights bench Disappointing and not suitable for the scale of the hotel No restaurants close by a few within 10 15 min walk , Lovely room relaxing spa facilities nice location close to river and battersea park Good mini market within complex which allowed us to buy coffee and pastries for breakfast each day 
160846,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Location a 15 min walk from a tube station if that s important to you , Spacious huge for London rooms with seating and large bathrooms Lovely location right by the river and opposite one of the best parks in London 
160847,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Transport links are okay but not ideal Not a lot of good restaurants on your doorstep , Spacious rooms Next to Battersea Park Very quiet room Easy access to the City by bus 
160848,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Taxis often park in the one drop off pick up space Makes arriving and leaving quite stressful if you need to park to check in out , Staff were unfailingly helpful and efficient Lovely room and easy access to pool and spa Good food good service in every area 
160849,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, I woke at 5 30 to the sound huge thump thump thumps I looked outside to see if it was construction A half hour later I figured out it was the guy running on the treadmill next door They gave me a bedroom next to the gym It is unbelievable to me that they actually give this room to clients and expect them to pay over 200 per room, the staff were helpful after see problem 
160850,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Nothing, Location near the Chelsea Bridge was ideal for exploring Chelsea Battersea Great for visiting the Chelsea Flower Show The Hotel rooms had crisp clean and very comfortable bed and bedding We would definitely recommend this hotel and will be going back 
160851,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The food in the restaurant was not value for money but then it is in a London hotel , Location for Chelsea Flower Show was excellent just across the bridge The bed was large and very comfortable The bathroom had a walk in shower and a bath Our room had a lovely view towards Battersea Park 
160852,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, I understand taking your own towels to the spa but then if you swim in the morning you don t have dry ones for a shower afterwards , The room was well appointed and comfortable The swimming pool and spa is lovely and the lady in charge there really helpful We hadn t booked with that in mind and it was almost a flue that we went to have a look We then went straight back to use it in the afternoon and again in the morning Lovely 
160853,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Staff didn t seem too attentive but nothing that would put me off visiting again The radio in the room had a very old iPod dock on it so we couldn t use that which was a shame , Bed was really comfy and bathroom was gorgeous
160854,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The shower leaked a lot so we had to use all our towels mopping it up and breakfast was very expensive , There was a mini fridge which is always a plus Bed was comfortable even though it was 2 singles together 
160855,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Gym facilities were very average Requested a double bed but was given two single beds joined together I find this uncomfortable Location was a lot further to Sloane Square underground station than anticipated from reading other reviews up to 20 mins walk Ended up using the bus service more than I would ve liked Porridge was burnt for one breakfast , Pleasant room Decent breakfast
160856,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Caught my case in the revolving door at reception and had walked to get there would have been nice to have been rescued or had a member of staff outside on the look out , Room service breakfast made earlier at short notice Tapas in Restaurant really good 
160857,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The room beverages could have had a better selection of teas The bacon at breakfast was quit tough abs chewy and selection could have been better too Not a negative really but wold have been nice if the spa area had a Jacuzzi and soft drinks available The exercise bike in the room also didn t work I m guessing the batteries had run out and not checked , The bed was comfy and the room very spacious The shower was powerful and big and I liked the view from my room 
160858,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Unfriendly staff They never liked to help Every day there must be something is missing no shower gel or no coffee or no body lotion or no face towels or no water bottles This happened daily through the 9 nights I stayed there Also staff are unfriendly and unhelpful at all One time when I needed some help in calling international call the receptionist was too rude I was also surprised to see booking com modifying my previous review on this hotel and gave 10 while I gave negative comments This shows un honestly from booking com when it comes to the reviews Very surprising, Location is excellent although it s not close to central London Room is nice and big
160859,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The tv in the bathroom didn t work The pop up plug in the cloak room basin didn t work so we couldn t empty the waste water The tap on the sink in the mini bar only gave out hot water The hair wash shower over the bath spewed out black gunge where it hadn t been run in ages Keys stopped working 3 times so had to keep going to reception I was asked on checkout if everything was OK I said no that there were maintenance issues with our room The reply was then here is the invoice for your drinks and food Never even asked what they were , Beds and linen are lovely 
160860,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Serious 15 min walking distance to tube station However buses are running to station and a bus stop is located close to the hotel , Well organized breakfast Battersea Park provides excellent space for a run in the morning 
160861,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, There was nothing I didn t like at all about this hotel, I liked everything about this hotel good value for money and everything you would want very clean staff very friendly
160862,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The only criticism i have I would have liked something else to be included in my package maybe a massage or something for the price I payed for the hotel and it was only one night I think something else for the price could have been included , I loved the hotel it s self it was beautiful our room was amazing the pool the sauna was lovely and I loved the variety there was for breakfast so much to choose from
160863,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, One side of the hotel has the Battersea Power Station development being built which is not a particularly attractive view , Bedroom bathroom very generous for a London hotel 
160864,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The staff were not friendly We were initially shown into a room for people with disabilities where the sink in the bathroom was blocked We did not request accessible room We asked to be moved The room we were then offered was on the third floor facing the train trucks so we could hear the trains passing every few minutes almost through the night We couldn t us the pool because children were only allowed from 11 30 am till 3 30 pm and we checked in at 5 pm and had to check out the next day at 11 am Unfortunately the pool was a key reason for us to book the hotel in the first place Overall I felt the hotel was a really bad value for money Won t be going there again , The bed was comfortable 
160865,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, NA, The front of house and dining staff were extremely helpful and courteous I was very impressed seeing their dedication and attitude towards hotel guest s etc I ll surely book some more time in the future to stay at the hotel again Thanks 
160866,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Service in the bar area was slow we waited over 40 minutes for a bowl of soup It took over 15 mins for someone to even take our order and there was hardly anyone else there , Breakfast was delicious plenty of hot and cold options including amazing pastries Loved the mini pain au chocolates which were always fresh baked The room was spacious with comfy bed and great bathroom Didn t get to try the spa unfortunately but heard others saying it was lovely Right by Chelsea Bridge so we took a lovely 30 minute walk to Knightsbridge In the sun 
160867,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Would have like to pool to open earlier in the morning and stayed open slightly later, The room was one of the nicest I ve stayed in real luxury with a lovely leather sofa comfy beds great shower and lovely modern decor
160868,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, I forgot the card I booked with for check in I understand the policy but I had photographic proof I booked the room on more than one ID but the staff weren t helpful and refunded the card and then charged me again with the card I had with me I booked the hotel 3 months ago I wasn t very happy with the stress it caused at check in If it had been booked as a present I wouldn t of had the card to check in with I really felt like complaining to a manager but I don t see my boyfriend for a month at a time so I didn t want to start our weekend off arguing with the staff late on a Friday night Working in customer service myself I feel as if the staff could of done more to help me in this situation I understand companies have policies but I had more than one ID to prove it was me , The location was perfect with a station into London round the corner Beautiful along the river Plenty of shops and places to eat The rooms were very clean comfy and spa was peaceful and had everything it needed I would like to stay again in the hope that there be no problems at check in next time It was only thing that let it down 
160869,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The cleanliness was horrible They just prepare the beds they don t change the towels and don t put new shampoos and shower gels We found 2 cockroaches in our room When we spoke to the manager he said maybe u it s u who brought to the hotel He said it came with u from ur country He didn t even apologized , The room is modern and nice Bathroom is nice Room size is good

160872,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The children were disappointed they could not use the pool The time restrictions didn t work for us and I think we would have felt very awkward anyway , The room was lovely so comfy and child friendly 
160873,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Pestana charge your card twice and whilst they don t fully receive both amounts both are taken from your account I think this could leave people in difficult situations I pointed out to the reception that this had happened and rather than saying that they charge twice they just advised it was in a holding state Irrespective it does leave your account twice Poorly explained and put a dampner on the visit , Decor was nice water in room shower was good also 
160874,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa,No Negative, Lovely would have expected to pay 2 3x as much for value received Beautiful room and bath Staff very helpful facilities spotless definitely will stay there next time in London

160879,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The trains behind the hotel were noisy from 5 30 am despite the triple glazing The nearest tube station was about 15 minutes walk away We ended up taking a bus to the tube station and back The buses were always full and the average wait time was about 20 minutes We spent about 90 in three days just getting backwards and forwards to London , The rooms were big and comfortable 
160880,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Check in staff not helpful as was my first time Didnt get to use gym as totolly impossible to find Spent 5 mins or more trying to find pool changing area not in keeping with the hotel, Check out staff helpful pleasant Loved the room and ambience of the hotel room service top marks

160884,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Hard to book in for massage without paying by card ahead of time despite hotel having room details already To do this would have meant coming out of meetings etc which wasn t ideal , Spa is fab super massage bedrooms v comfy Decent price for a room w last minute booking

160897,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, There was a gym byc in the room which i dont need it and took large place the manager refused to remove it as i need this space and there was a gym in the hotel so if i dont like they must remove it, The location helpful staff wide room nice spa easy transportation to the most important places
160898,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, We thought the price for the breakfast good as it was was expensive and it may be better to have an all inclusive option when booking , The size of our room was great We ve stayed in hotels were the rooms including en suite were no bigger than rabbit hutches Love comfy beds Breakfast was very comprehensive and all looked fresh 
160899,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Staff a little offhand and condescending Lack of hotel parking Parking in adjacent car park 25 for 24 hrs No view, room comfortable Great pillows Very clean

160907,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, NIL, We had a king room it was spacious very pleasant interior great bed great bathroom with both bath and separate rainfall shower just like on the pictures We stayed one night only but would have been comfortable for longer period We didn t have breakfast unable to comment on that We didn t have time to try the spa facilities either Very satisfied well recommended 
160908,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Only complaint is the hotels car parking Although it is advertised as available the car park does not actually belong to the hotel and is expensive some sort of discount offered by the hotel would not go amiss, Once again staying here was a pleasure
160909,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Nothing as did not check out the other facilities or had the breakfast there maybe will do next time , Location parking close by blue bathroom light gave a nice ambience when having a relaxing bath 
160910,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Although limited by space swimming pool small , Superb easy location of hotel walking distance to most places of interest Overall Spa experience was great with sauna and steam room Staff were experienced professional and knew what to do Dining was good food was well prepared with variety Although busy during our stay an effort was made to make us feel at home we had a great time 
160911,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, bed was very uncomfortable both me and partna had lil sleep only for this reason I would not return , Everything was great as we are young parents a night away is just what we needed great staff great spa and great food lovely room only down full was bed was very uncomfortable both me and partner had lil sleep only for this reason I would not return 
160912,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa,No Negative, Great Hotel Nice Location The early check in was brilliant and the 1 hr extra late check out was good Nice rooms lovely large bed great rain shower and deep bath 
160913,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Very slow room cleaning staff Probably understaffed We had two occasions when we got home in the evening to change for dinner and the room still was not cleaned , Location Large rooms for London standards Friendly and efficient check in staff and bar staff 
160914,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Only one changing room in the pool There was someone in the female one so I ended up getting undressed on a mat in front of the lockers , Polite friendly staff Lovely decorated room with a comfortable bed Loved the power shower bath the blue lights were fantastic The leisure facilities especially the pool were very clean and relaxing Good location
160915,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Poor housekeeping they don t clean your room very well and the room service as well wasn t very good , Spacious rooms with a nice view and big bathrooms And I would like to THANK Joe the receptionist for his good service 
160916,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The location can be a bit of a pain after a few days walking but if you catch the bus up to the tube station it s not so bad , The comfort side was brilliant
160917,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Overpriced breakfast very very hard bed, Was a nice hotel the mattress was not very comfortable and breakfast very overpriced we got a better deal once there 15 50 each instead of 20 50 the staff where nice and we used the pool the steam room was working but sauna wants witch was disappointing
160918,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Did not know taxis from underground would only take cash so had to walk from Pimlico to hotel Would help if web site gave best method of transportation to hotel , Lovely room with wonderful bathroom amenities 
160919,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Disgusting attitude told them about my brother having serious car accident and begged for postponing my reservation although they had many free rooms they happily charged me not caring one bit Thats all I need to know about this hotel not to ever book again As for being there in the past its in a bad location its dark depressive the swimming pool is little like few bathtabs together and the water smelly you perhaps only get some disease from it ,No Positive
160920,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, My only negative was that we were charged 20 per head for breakfast for what was effectively some scrambled eggs on toast , The staff spa rooms and location are all amazing and really made the experience 
160921,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The batteries were dead in the remote control in the bedroom Hadn t booked breakfast and then found I had to pay separately It wasn t a problem but was about to pay my overall bill and thought it could be added , Nice bedroom Clean
160922,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, My husband had a massage which was poor The spa area was not very relaxing or clean , Very pleasant helpful staff Good sized bedroom with bath and shower Nice view over Battersea Park 
160923,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Staff were not particularly helpful during busy periods and the overall cost did not reflect the standard of room or service , Location was good and parking was cheap and easily accessible
160924,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The housekeeping was poor and the reception staff were perfunctory rather than friendly , The best part of the stay was the breakfast which was excellent
160925,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Before booking this hotel it was not brought to my attention that the Spa was also used by children for swimming lessons Unfortunately this compromised what should be a relaxing atmosphere and made the pool nearly unusable due to it s small size ,No Positive
160926,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, We went out in the evening to see what the local restaurants had to offer but ended up on very busy roads with only fast foods on offer so we ate in the hotel restaurant It would be helpful to have a sign showing the direction of Chelsea The next morning we clearly saw Chelsea Bridge , Spotlessly clean large bed great shower Battersea Park was lovely 
160927,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, disappointed in the gym there It s a converted room and is a lot smaller with only three pieces of equipment in it The Spa is lovely with a great range of treatments but the shower and changing facilities are disappointing , Beautiful hotel in good location Contemporary style and good value bar menu
160928,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Reception lobby was very cold because people were using the fire exit instead of the revolving door Drinks and meals too expensive bar staff upselling gin to most expensive brands , Quality of rooms 
160929,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Swimming pool out of order An arrogant hotel manager with side kick front of house male staff member with perpetual smirk on his face whilst I complained that the hotel was not up to standard , The location
160930,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, nothing I liked everything about the hotel, The hotel is conveniently situated closer to the bus station Rooms are spacious with a modern stylish d cor Spa facilities were the best I would definitely recommend this hotel 
160931,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Location is not very convenient for those who doesn t have a car Breakfast is not worth the price, Room is clean and comfort Staff was also very friendly Talk a walk to Chelsea bridge at night the view is amazing 
160932,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa,No Negative, Not in the centre of the West End but the trade off is that it is close to the shops other facilities offered by Chelsea s King s Rd A smart elegant interior with well drilled conscientious staff I would certainly stay again 
160933,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa,No Negative, Attentive and helpful staff and manager who p likes to greet guests and check that all is satisfactory The buffet breakfast is both extensive and imaginative Super swimming pool Perfect setting for West End or Battersea Park events 
160934,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Business centre poor one printer did not work staff could not fix it Other one took over 45 minutes to get working Breakfast not included in room rate should be inclusive and standard , Great location loved the spa staff great pool a treat and massage amazing
160935,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, No bad experience location for our requirements a little of centre, Fab room following up grade lovely spa facilities helpful staff modern and clean Decent food
160936,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, They could have noticed I been a few times The hotel taxi is twice the price of a normal taxi, I have been 3 or 4 times in 18 months as it just out of the centre
160937,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The bath in the room was terrible There was no way you could relax in it even my wife who is 5ft 7in found it uncomfortable, Excellent helpful staff and superb evening meal
160938,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, it s not the same staff that I use to see in this hotel They don t speak kindly I don t know why they are dealing like this I got the feeling that they don t want to work Not all of them ofcourse but you can easily note it Sadly I ding think I will come to pestana,No Positive
160939,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa,No Negative, Lovely lovely staff especially in the spa The rooms are very comfy and even if the spa is on the small sida it is really nice and excellent treatments 
160940,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The cost of breakfast was very expensive compared to the cost of having dinner at the hotel , The hotel was immaculate and the staff were friendly The spa was brilliant and so nice to be able to chill in after shopping 
160941,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The attitude of hotel staff became to bad as i am a very loyal customer to this hotel since 4 years but this time will be my last visit as the staff became so not friendly services became very bad , Location and room space only 
160942,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Bar service slow and unfriendly, Location is perfect walking distance to Kings Road contemporary design and five star facilities Reception staff efficient and helpful upgraded our rooms Wonderful breakfast Suites are beautiful with stunning views across Battersea Park
160943,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The gym is nothing more than a small guest bedroom which has a couple of machines this was a let down and we would not have booked had we known these facilities were so poor , The standard is very good this is a quality establishment
160944,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Location was ok if enjoy walking as 20 mins from nearest tube station , Comfortable room with good facilities Battersea park across the road was lovely for walks and running 
160945,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Parking house which the hotel uses are rude and expensive They were the first time we stayed and nothing has changed although we complained to both parties There is no hotel rate and although 24 hours Monday to Friday is 24 if you enter at 8pm Sunday and exit at 9am Monday they charge you 30 and every time you pop out it starts again Unbelievable that there is still no concession for the hotel guests like other hotels Young kids can only use the swimming pool between 11 30am and 3pm which we understand but it is a ridiculously short time particularly for families who may book because of the pool Spa did not pick up the phone so we went to ask and they said no even though there was another girl in the pool which caused our daughter to cry They need to sort out their policy , Location is fantastic right on the Thames next to Battersea Park Very spacious comfortable rooms and friendly staff Breakfast was very good with faultless friendly service Second stay will be back 
160946,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, No breakfast included and no information on this Reception says it differs with the price so pls state this clearly in confirmation and booking Not what you expect from this kind of hotel ,No Positive
160947,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, I found this time some of the female stay on main reception quite hostile and cold , I stayed her last weekend with a group of friends for my birthday I have stayed at the hotel twice before on business so I know it well As always the rooms were spotless and bed very comfy The spa was quiet and relaxing 
160948,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, There are expresso cups only in the room how do you make a cup of tea also A sink that did not work next to the kettle No ironing board The toiletries could have been more luxurious, The spa is lovely Good location The size of the room is great with a nice sofa 
160949,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The swimming pool in the spa has a viewing window for those relaxing in the lounge I felt a little self conscious Window in the rooms between the bathroom and the beds A blind covered it but not that well Not sure what the use for it was , Edgy and distinctive decour If not particularity father and daughter appropriate Food at the hotel was literally delicious Well worth the money Large clean rooms and comfortable beds Really nice spa if not a tad small 
160950,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, paying to park at hotel that paid stay at email from hotel telling me i could not eat there Spa did not come as package no massage included no jacuzzi, not alot really
160951,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Taxis are few and none were on the stand Difficult to hail a cab on the road as few use that route Theatres were a 25 taxi ride away but the pricing of the hotel compensates, We liked the comfortable bed the well organised bathroom and the generous breakfast The location was good
160952,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa,No Negative, Fantastic hotel in a great location Myself and my partner have stayed there twice now on business but I ve also booked rooms for my birthday weekend in October Very comfy beds and lovely spa 
160953,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, No bad experience just a little idea maybe you could offer a bigger selection of dairy free products at the breakfast buffet to accommodate your vegan guests or just dairy intolerant guests , beautiful bathroom lovely pool bar open till late sound proof windows towards the train track lots of choices for breakfast
160954,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Awful food and terrible policy where you have to pay as you go on your first visit Spa Overpriced treatments Noisy spa full of kids , Clean gorgeous rooms 
160955,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Thought the check ot te was a bit early due to the lateness of my transport back to Aberdeen, Loved the whole stay was just one of the best places I have stayed in London
160956,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Location for transportation And because of that you might need to rent a car Which it s handy and convenient during your stay but then no free parking available at the hotel It will cost 24 a night also nice rich breakfast but mainly pork and some don t eat pork , Nicely located nice area very convenient Cozy sized hotel 
160957,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Parking was 30 for 24hrs we were told it was 24 but got charged more despite being in car park for less than 24hrs Breakfast 15 50 and not that great buffet style No draught lagers beers, Railway and building site a bit noisy think our room was on park side last time 
160958,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Our bed consisted of two twins pushed together but I didnt complain because of the atmosphere how you are treated by the staff and the fact we had a great nights sleep, We loved how our room was decorated with red rose petals a bottle of proseco and a box of chocolates Thank you to the lovely staff who are all very friendly and extremely helpful

160960,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, I don t like the idea of food been left in the corridors of hotel special next to my door and Hoover s to and please tell the people that they will not get the riverside view because the simple reason of the hotel location and the service charge that you get when you are in the restaurant nothing to do with the money other thinkis I have to pay for the tv please , the Service
160961,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, No water glasses in room packet of tissues rather than an obvious box , Friendliness of service staff willing to help me at all times as I am disabled and walk with a stick Particularly good in the spa where I had an excellent facial 
160962,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Cleaning staff need to do a better job with the vacuuming Breakfast buffet is good but the omelette should be included in the buffet price not at extra charge of 5 50 That s just not classy , Location is great it s close to Bus 137 that takes you to both Knightsbridge and Oxford Circus Free wifi is a major plus International TV channels also good 
160963,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Some members of staffs service lack of ingredients for cocktails at bar poor quality nachos in bar and length of time I waited for service , We liked the deluxe twin room the beds the location was nice 
160964,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, The Room cleanning is not good They just vhange the towels and arrange the bed nothing more the breakfast is too baisc No egg no pan cakes the cappuccino was not good , The location is near the chelsea bridge 5 mins by Taxi to the knights bridge 
160965,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Nothing special nothing of good quality not worthy for this price , This is just a soso hotel in a good location But everything in the room does not match a four star hotel 
160966,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Confusion regarding one of two rooms we booked was supposed to be 3 person occupancy But was resolved in the end by adding a day bed advice would be to confirm requirements with the hotel directly Nearest Tube Rail station was a 10 minute walk but buses were on the main street outside the hotel slower option to get to the city center , Location good facilities contemporary 
160967,Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel Spa, Not friendly staff, Clean room location was good but not the best in London
