430476,Le Meridien Vienna, Service at breakfast was rather haphazard We asked to book a taxi to the airport and ended up with a limousine Although comfortable with a very pleasant driver not sure if it was worth the extra 15 euros , Breakfast was very good Pool and spa facilities were good Although small it tended not to be too busy The pool has water jets which meanyou can swim against he jet while staying in the same place Plenty of clean towels in the spa Reception were very good atbooking the rooms we needed We liked the free mini bar even if it was mainly soft drinks Also plenty of free bottled water in the rooms 
430477,Le Meridien Vienna, The room s pictures on booking com look so nice but in reality it is old rooms and old furniture of the rooms we booked on line and very old carpet etc and AC wasn t working well But when we complained the staff were so kind and upgraded our room to much better and new refurbished styled room which is real good 5 stars hotel room But again the staff really so great and they deserve all compliments, The Staff are supper kind and helpful and friendly
430478,Le Meridien Vienna, Nothing at all Everything was exceptional , Everything about this hotel is amazing and ALL of the staff exceptional Treat you like royalty and completely concerned you are satisfied 
430479,Le Meridien Vienna, The pool was small and not heated and the fitness area was too small and crowded We had a banner covering the window and the music at the hotel s bar was too loud till late in the night , The location of the hotel is perfect right in the center of Vienna I liked the breakfast especially the pancakes and the salmon The minibar was daily refilled with free beverages 
430480,Le Meridien Vienna, Rooms are small The mattress is too soft and uncomfortable The bed side is sticking out I have numerous black spots and scratches because it was difficult to navigate around the bed without hitting the bottom sides Breakfast is overpriced Overall the property is a bit shabby and does not live up to a 5 star hotel, The location
430481,Le Meridien Vienna,No Negative, After recent refurbishment the hotel looks great and has a new entrance facing the small park behind the building they also opened a new restaurant where in the evening you can find a live dj

430484,Le Meridien Vienna, The cleanliness of the rooms worsened Foreign black hair on the floor of our room The best lobby in Vienna has been replaced by a new one in bahnhoff style We did not enjoy breakfast in new restaurant because buffet is very narrow and almost still crowded , Le Meridien was our favourite hotel in Vienna We were here many times But 
430485,Le Meridien Vienna, I ve booked executive suit with city view but received very tiny and very old room under the roof with NO view at all we were just unable to reach those small windows At first staff tried to persuade me that it is an executive suite and that they don t have any other rooms available Once I almost started screaming they found another old room on a lower floor at least with windows We ve checked SPA area and it is not appealing as well Breakfast is very busy to many people I would not recommend anyone this hotel This is the worst 5 star hotel I ve ever seen and it doesn t worth the money you have to pay for it , Location is nice Room service was fast and food was ok 
430486,Le Meridien Vienna, Mmmmmm Might be walls and interior colours such like this hotel in such city I think that colours are better to be darker , The location is perfect the staff is friendly and professional the facilities are highly managed 
430487,Le Meridien Vienna, The breakfast room is far to small for the dimensions of the hotel There is only one chef preparing the eggs and this means waiting in line with a plate in your hands , Fantastic position minutes from opera parks museums Very big rooms considering we didn t booked a suite Perfect the champagne bar 
430488,Le Meridien Vienna, The bathroom could have more shelving counter space for personal items which is essential for me if I am staying longer than a day , The staff was exceptional The best

430490,Le Meridien Vienna, small room size, We were looking for a place near Vienna Opera and it was perfect Rooms are a little small but we did not spend much time there Renovation is still going but we had not had any knowledge of it Hotel is very quiet though it is right on the Ring and a walking distance to everywhere in the center city Rooms and hallways are brand new The gym and pool were all for myself around 8 a m Everything is small but was perfect for us for a very short stay It is very modern comfortable and clean 
430491,Le Meridien Vienna, Autoapark was small in the parkinghouse and also in outside area parking wasn t much then any car parkingarea my car was towing at the policeman go to Towingarea and i had charged about that , Yes the bed was comfortly showereoom also too quite a bigroom

430493,Le Meridien Vienna, The hotel misrepresented two things 1 Booking com said that there was a airport shuttle but when we arrived at the airport the hotel said that they would not provide a shuttle I had to pay a significant amount to hire a taxi I exchanged correspondence with the hotel afterwards about this situation and they said they were not interested in addressing the situation 2 When we checked in the hotel offered us a discount for the typical breakfast charge which I gratefully accepted When I returned home the hotel sent me a letter rescinding the discount and billed my credit card without permission for the amount of the discount I am considering contesting the charge on my credit card I selected Le Meridian for a combination of location and cost If they are so desperate for income then they should increase their room rates Needless to say I am not impressed with the hotel especially since they declined to address my concerns after the fact , good location in downtown Vienna
430494,Le Meridien Vienna, Housekeeping was SLOPPY AND SLOW No evening turndown Arrived to full wastebasket and used soap 3pm room wasn t clean had to call , Restaurant was UNBELIEVABLE Location was FANTASTIC close to all museums Bathrooms were cool Daniel and Naomi at front desk were terrific Good beds 
430495,Le Meridien Vienna, They allow smoking in the Champagne bar which is located directly next to the elevators Smoke drifts into the elevators leaving you in a smoke filled trap while you are trying to get to your room We were told to be quiet in the pool because someone was getting a massage in the Gym area and our daughter s laughing was interrupting their relaxation I felt it completely unnecessary for the massage therapist to come suuush a child who is having fun playing in the pool due to poor placement and sound proofing of the massage room Our enjoyment should not have been valued lesser than that of the individual getting a massage Had she been ridiculously loud or obnoxious we would have told her to be quiet but a child laughing splashing in a room full of tile glass is bound to create some noise , Overall we enjoyed our stay here while in Vienna Location is great Within walking distance to all of the museums Spanish Riding School shopping Opera House etc Plenty of food options nearby as well as inside the hotel itself Breakfast was great although expensive Dinner in the restaurant was good Staff was friendly 
430496,Le Meridien Vienna, Staff too robotic as stressed from overtrained to be personal not just professional but result asian smile but no solution While check in luggage taken by staff to be delivered to room than lost because room changed as check in after 3 pm only and new receptionist on duty did not know Stressing when arriving with young Mistress Insisting to get my luggage NOW and not waiting got APPROVaL to enter receptinist room and take luggage finally by myself UUFF, Location Opera splendid Brandauer as King Lear in Burgtheater Hofburg in walking distance TOP Breakfast till 11 weekend seating chair in room massage shower and bathroom Soundproof

430499,Le Meridien Vienna, Nothing, The staff were absolutely brilliant they couldn t do more to help Everyone was friendly and well worth a visit We will certainly go back 
430500,Le Meridien Vienna, The fact that for such a great hotel the Moet champagne bar cafe was not a non smoking area As a non smoker it put me off returning there and sampling the champagne breakfast , The property was in a excellent central location for all the tourist sights and the staff were extremely helpful I would definately stay at Le Meridien again if I was to re visit Vienna
430501,Le Meridien Vienna, Breakfast Bacon burn No shower cap Not everyone is six foot tall or want to wash his hair day as shower with jets and outomaticly water your hair , Location very good Very clean hotel Friendly staff Gym open early do you can do your work out and enjoy your day 
430502,Le Meridien Vienna, Air conditioning in my room had not been adjusted for winter so the thermostat made no difference when set to hot so was freezing my first night however they swiftly dealt with the heating when I did ask Room service cleaning staff did not replace a dirty cup I left from soup I had in it appeared to be just cleaned in the sink and wiped dry as traces of my soup were still in the cup So I wonder if the drinking glasses are replaced either , Reception staff always friendly and professional
430503,Le Meridien Vienna, One day the whirlpool was not operating for some unknown reasons I had really intended to relax in the wellness after work and this is one of the reasons I chose this hotel but I couldn t My room wasn t made up one day when I returned at 14 30 It was a mess I informed the reception and the problem was dealt with quickly My room had been forgotten by room service Room 601 in winter was incredibly warm The air conditioning which I set at a minimum didn t work Opening the window one can only wedge open then didn t help I sweat in the room at night Very uncomfortable Although the curtains allow to darken the room a lot of light enters through the bathroom window there s a glass door So it was very bright in the room at 6 00 Service was polite but slightly overwhelmed All in all none of this caused a major discomfort still considering the room rate I d expect more , Le Meridien is in general a guarantee for a good hotel This specific hotel has a very pleasant bar and it s location is unbeatable
430504,Le Meridien Vienna, The houskeeping was not always up to scratch both days failing to re stock mini bar and leaving dirty cups in the room However the staff dealt with this very quickly when advised , The staff were extremely helpful and welcoming at all times in the hotel Large rooms with comfortable beds The Moet bar is really good had a great variety of drinks and was tasteful And of course having a free mini bar was a great little extra 
430505,Le Meridien Vienna, The general quality of the rooms are not at the level of the price we paid It was impossible to change room temperature and although we said to the staff nobody came to fix it The poor quality 1Mb s of free WiFi connection is unacceptable in 2017, The hotel is near the city s center The breakfast is very very good and aboundant

430508,Le Meridien Vienna, When i threw the old dirty slipper in the garbage the cleaning lady took them out for me to re use them Some front desk staff ladies especially act like they are doing u a favor by doing their job Light in the room is very low Impossible to read Booked coutyard room saw the pics on line the one i got had a view of the next building Kept it bcz it was quiet You should provide some items in the bathroom without having to ask for it Q tips sewing kit etc The front door is extermly heavy sometimes the doormen ignore helping u with it even though its thier job , Location cleaness comfy bed nice size rooms free bar 
430509,Le Meridien Vienna, The rooms were a bit small , We were there with my husband for the new year The hotel has an amazing location Rooms are always clean Staffs are very welcoming

430511,Le Meridien Vienna, Could have been a little cheaper or offered a special weekend or 3 night rate but overall still good value , Location in Vienna was perfect opposite the palace and opera house 5 mins walk to the centre point of the city and easily accessible by road and from the airport Special mention for the concierge Dominic excellent recommendations for the day and saved us time and money for excellent dinner venues

430518,Le Meridien Vienna, No place to stop the car to load or unload the luggage No hotel staff outside the hotel to help with the luggage or open the large and heavy doors Small room To expensive for what the hotel offers, Great location very close to the Opera and the city center
430519,Le Meridien Vienna, I know this is downtown Vienna but it was a little more than we wanted to spend That said we re glad we stayed there , Loved the modern look and the great central location Had a great coffee shop around the corner as well as a trolley stop and underground metro station only a block away We arrived from the airport before 10 am and were able to get into our rooms by about 11 Took hotel s car service to the airport at 4 30 am was worth every penny 
430520,Le Meridien Vienna, Door men were not always on hand to open very heavy entrance doors esp was challenging with heavy luggage Room service was very mediocre housekeeping staff surprisingly overlooked a very big trolley lunch table brought in the day before They cleaned the rest of the room but somehow ignored the trolley despite it clearly having empty dishes and old food on it I called reception to have it removed ,No Positive
430521,Le Meridien Vienna, The bed was a little small Construction noises could be heard from room during the day but I m not sure if they were coming from inside the hotel As a Brit not used to these sorts of things I don t like that they let people smoke inside Le Moet Bar , Vienna is an amazing city Free refreshments were useful decent sized rooms nice pool and facilities rooms have good bathrooms with separate bath and shower fantastic location with everything within walking distance Bar is relatively lively 
430522,Le Meridien Vienna, We chose a city view and an upper floor hoping to get a bit more of a city view but it was fine as we got enough of a view not to feel closed in Very little to complain about with this hotel , We liked the contemporary decor the bed was comfortable mini bar and in room coffee complementary Especially liked that room had both a shower and deep soaking tub The location was perfect The breakfast though an additional cost to room was extensive allowing us to not need lunch We walked nearly everywhere as the hotel is so centrally located 
430523,Le Meridien Vienna, Layout of breakfast challenging to reach the food OJ kept running out Wifi a little weak and you had to pay for extra bandwidth Garage parking expensive , Check in great bar cool with DJ breakfast selection good Great shower and bathroom products

430525,Le Meridien Vienna,No Negative, The hotel was absolutely excellent The facilities were great and the standard of breakfast was first class However what made the hotel stand out above others we ve previously stayed in was the staff They were warm friendly courteous and nothing was too much trouble I even had a cake delivered to the room in recognition of my birthday without any mention to the hotel staff which I thought was a lovely touch We would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Vienna 
430526,Le Meridien Vienna, The junior suite I stayed in was run down and the decoration and furnishing didn t really come together Things were broken for example the bath tub plug was broken none of the internet radio stations work There was wooden waxed laminated floor and there was a huge black mark on the floor next to the sofa There was also a wet looking red mark on the side table which I found in the middle of the night when I woke up for a drink of water and it scared me because I thought it was a drop of fresh blood , It s in a central location near an underground station The free minibar was also a nice touch 
430527,Le Meridien Vienna,No Negative, Can t beet the location Across the street from Opera and 2 block to City Centre and 2 blocks to Museum Quarter in th other direction Great bar and great breakfast buffet We ll be back Could walk to 4 Christmas markets easily

430529,Le Meridien Vienna,No Negative, Extremely helpful staff who will do everything they can to make sure you get to see all the sights The bedrooms are amazing as is the refreshment fridge which gets topped up daily beautiful bathrooms and great leisure facilities Close to the majority of sights and within walking distance of some lovely cafes 
430530,Le Meridien Vienna, During the check in I was briefed entirely in German The hall area has a strong tobacco smell The room itself is lacking all basic bathroom amenities douche gel shampoo etc you should book them ahead The design of the room in general is fairly basic Overall not a very good 5 star choice, The location is quite good a brief walk to the Opera and to the Inner city
430531,Le Meridien Vienna, If you ask for something expect to have to ask again , Would normally be out of our price range but as it was our honeymoon we felt it was well worth splashing out The breakfast was brilliant 
430532,Le Meridien Vienna, The hotel is very big and we had to walk a fair way to our room from the hotels however that s not the end of the world , Good location close to the museum quarter Staff were excellent and we were quickly shown to our room well before check in time The room was a strange layout with space around the bed a bit cramped however the bathroom was very big and a nice addition of having the chairs to sit at to enjoy the free minibar
430533,Le Meridien Vienna, 233 a night was a little excessive but all in all I d say it s worth it, Friendly proactive helpful staff Amazing food and incredible room service Location was excellent with everything in Vienna being a 10 minute walk away
430534,Le Meridien Vienna, We would have liked to have been able to turn all the lights off in the room by a central switc by the door , The staff were always cheerful and exceptionally helpful Inspite of the hotel being exceptionally busy they always had the time to answer out queries For location and comfort the hotel is unbeatable

430536,Le Meridien Vienna,No Negative, Fabulous facility and location Terrific staff I have traveled over 75 000 miles per year for the last 35 years and would be hard pressed to find a better hotel in this price range 
430537,Le Meridien Vienna, the room internet connection terrible we arrived late at night no one helped us bring our bags into the hotel room staff checked us on the second floor felt like we were going down a rabbit hole in alice in the wonderland door after door corridor after another turn left after another then up a flight of stairs still no lift in sight couldnt believe my eyes when we finally got to the room felt like the house help in downtown abby up the loft and exiled would really rank the hotel 4 stars dont get me started about the room service and quality of the food dont even think about ordering the food was worse than the airplane meals , Jozeph our room service assistant made our day and our stay pleasant and bearable wish I could say the same about the rest of the hotel employees 
430538,Le Meridien Vienna, The gym is so small as to make you claustrophobic Room was cleaned late after 1pm on several days Room service seemed expensive for the value The room itself was designed nicely but needs refurbishing a lot of dirt and scuffs on the walls mildew in the shower and bathroom , Frontline staff were courteous and helpful The restaurant bar were nice and well designed 
430539,Le Meridien Vienna, interior is poor i prefer bigger and taller bed , location of hotel is great and nice spa and swimming area only sunday works until 19h it is not suitable
430540,Le Meridien Vienna, The staff was not friendly or welcoming Benedict in the front desk should be hidden somewhere in the back of the hotel For someone in the business of hotel and guest comfort he was downright unfriendly and uncooperative , The location was great
430541,Le Meridien Vienna, Hotel has wery big problem with cleaning Breakfast is not included in the price MIni bar is free but is generally empty with 2 Coke one beer and wather Simply the ratio of price and quality is not good , Location of hotelis good breakfast is ok 
430542,Le Meridien Vienna, New entrance not good for Taxi or Uber Poor service and not enough people Rooms aged and need to be totaly redone soon Breakfast in the Hall like an airport Long corridor to the room if you are unlucky Was much better 10 years ago , Location
430543,Le Meridien Vienna, The gym spa is a bit lame for a hotel in that level especially since one of the saunas did not work I think that when something is not working in a hotel spa it should be fixed quickly as people are paying for it as well , the room is amazing especially the shower stuff is very nice 
430544,Le Meridien Vienna, Any extras were extremely prices 30 euros each for breakfast was quoted Didn t take it up so don t know if it was worth it Very modern and staff did their job but nothing welcoming about our treatment , Location good Comfortable room Quiet 
430545,Le Meridien Vienna, The housekeeping needs to be improved i e tissue boxes and toilet paper not replaced when empty and towels too only some replaced though all taken for washing Toiletries such as bath caps etc not available , The room was very nice and clean and spacious and the staff very polite and helpful 
430546,Le Meridien Vienna, Obviously as the bar was being re built the champagne bar on its own was a bit limited in what you could get but this will be much improved when main bar is finished , Very nice hotel and staff very friendly helpful and knew who you were from the get go Don t agree with the few negative reviews at all and we are fussy 
430547,Le Meridien Vienna, Corridors were green and carpets dull brown reminding me of a 1950 s sanatorium there were several short flights of stairs in the corridors which made handling luggage awkward Emergency exit doors were not marked on my floor The swimming pool was very small with cold water and an annoying fountain spa that gushed up intermittently spoiling any attempt at swimming The free Wi fi kept dropping out in my room The TV was too far away from the bed to allow the remote to signal it , The room that I occupied was excellent very quiet spacious and with all modern facilities Unusually the minibar contents were free including beer Bathroom with a large bath and modern shower could not be faulted The bed was large and comfortable 
430548,Le Meridien Vienna, nothing, The staff are well trained and helpful in all departments The rooms are comfy and neat Just one tip stay away from the restaurant around the corner called Tricolori The staff are very rude and even started shouting at me because I ordered sparkling water and he brought me sparkling champagne When I told him that I did not order the champs he told me he is sick and tired to walk up and down We paid for our drinks and left It is a pity because it is so close to the hotel I hope the hotel management read my comments so that they don t send there clients there 
430549,Le Meridien Vienna, Housekeeping could have been a little better Forgot bottled water one day towels next day shampoo next day tea coffee creamer next day Minor irritation but always fixed with a smile, Great location and very friendly staff

430555,Le Meridien Vienna, I was in a room on the 8th floor and the sealing was slanting in the room so I had to be careful not to walk or stand straight in that of the room to avoid hitting my head , Staff was pleasant and helpful 
430556,Le Meridien Vienna, The interior design is a tragedy New lobby looks really dull and cheap Like a cheap 4 star hotel in developing country The old rooms are not only old fashioned 90ties style but also ridiculously designed shower with no handle washbasin tap so high that a 6 year old cant reach it It needs a serious refurbishment Overall experience is definitely not reflecting an European 5 star quality , The location is perfect In the very center still quiet and calm The checkin was a bit slow and we had to change the room but the support of the hotel service guy was excellent Most dedicated man i have ever met He saved the good opinion about the hotel The value for money is very nice 
430557,Le Meridien Vienna, Found drink stains over the walls and also looked like the cleaner had forgot to clean the toilet and the pole next to the bath we found pubic hairs on the toilet and long brown hairs wrapped around the pole We were shocked for the star rating and the amount we paid , The bed was very comfy had a lovely sleep and the breakfast gave a large selection
430558,Le Meridien Vienna, Slow check in the guy at the reception was more of a trainee than a professional receptionest He had to ask his colleagues for every question we asked Surfaces at the bathroom were not clean The bed was small and not comfortable , The location is excellent Close to the metro station and most of the attractions and most importantly the city center however poor value for money not a 5 star hotel
430559,Le Meridien Vienna, A C was a bit noisy one of the rooms had bad curtain style with too much light entering the room, Excellent location friendly staff TV with many international channels
430560,Le Meridien Vienna, Parking price was high about 40EUR 24h, Location was perfect right near all important things to see in Vienna breakfast was very good large choice of everything Room was clean and beds were extremely comfortable 
430561,Le Meridien Vienna, I did not like the cleanses of the rooms and bathrooms the shower door was broken and all the water leaked out of the door No shower cap not enough shower gel and shampoo , The breakfast verity of food and service is really good The staff very friendly and helpful The location of the hotel is excellent for museum lovers 
430562,Le Meridien Vienna, The room was on its way to being run down the cream leather chaise longue was grubby the expensive shower had mouldy tiles which was a shame For EUR200 a night you expect better Bathroom was big but poorly ventilated the windows onto the courtyard hadn t been cleaned in a year and were dusty with cobwebs Please note that the swimming pool is uncomfortably cool for kids and not suitable for paddling with children , The polite staff fabulous lobby excellent central location Minibar refilled everyday which was fabulous on a hot day Free mineral water daily and a coffee area in a Deluxe room Big bathrooms Beautiful bathtub Quiet courtyard room as requested They even brought up a kids mattress upon request 
430563,Le Meridien Vienna, alot the staff the facilties the room didnt look like a 5 star room i checked out 2 days early that tells u everything you need to know, the location was the only positive thing i liked
430564,Le Meridien Vienna, As an SPG member was initially allocated a very badly located room on a non SPG floor If they want to promote SPG should treat you accordingly Arrived early in morning not allocated room until 3PM, Great Pillows and bedding Very good location
430565,Le Meridien Vienna,No Negative, The staff were exceptional Nothing was too much trouble One person can t be signalled out because they were all so welcoming and helpful The breakfast at first glance might appear expensive but what a choice of foods There was something for everyone 
430566,Le Meridien Vienna, Hotel restaurant was under construction which we didn t know at the time of the booking Alternative breakfast was served in a conference room that was decorated as temporary breakfast room Luckily we didn t book a room including breakfast so we had breakfast in a nearby cafe Aida where you get excellent breakfast for less than 7 euros , Bicycle rent from the hotel good concierge services excellent location
430567,Le Meridien Vienna, I have explicitly asked two members of the staff to send someone in the room to clean something and 4 days it was not done Thats why I can not rate this place as cleaneast I have been to ,No Positive
430568,Le Meridien Vienna, I didn t like the bed as it was too tough for a 5 star hotel The bed wasn t as comfy as I expected I didn t like the hot chocolate I didnt like the shower too , I liked the GYM as it was accessible 
430569,Le Meridien Vienna, Nothing that I could think of, Very supportive team including making me comfortable and feel at home Property located at city centre makes it easy access for all touring locations within the city
430570,Le Meridien Vienna, Thursday night there was a happy hour or some sort of party that took over the entire lobby bar all the way to the street It was quite uncomfortable for us guests, Its location is perfect 
430571,Le Meridien Vienna, The bed was pretty low to the ground hard for my knees to get up Disappointed that the good wifi cost extra after what we paid for the room , The air conditioning was powerful unlike other places we ve stayed The shower was amazing three faucets 
430572,Le Meridien Vienna, Very complicated entrance area and corridor structure , It is a nicely decorated hotel with many interesting components There are art exhibits at the entrance a nice pink tub in the bathroom and it is very close to all that matters 
430573,Le Meridien Vienna, Booking was incorrect We had requested TWIN beds and the room we had reserved Classic overlooking the courtyard had room only for one very small double bed This Classic room was very small so as we read on revues that these are big rooms perhaps this was the only small one We had to have a lengthy row to get another room for which originally there was to be a 50 euro a night extra charge this came down to 25 euros a night and finally we paid only the original agreed price The room we were allocated 331 overlooking the side road was very large but sparsely furnished with detached mobile furniture The cupboard was attached to the staged safe coffee refrigerator units so when the cupboard door was open then one could not get at any of the other three The door of the room did not lock from the inside the bolt was misaligned so we had to shift a heavy metal coat rack in front of it each night The night we were going to a concert the room had not been done by 3 45pm when we returned to the hotel for a rest so we straightened it ourselves The next day when we went out we asked if the room could be done by 2pm it would seem that the maid took this to heart as on the next our final morning she rang our door bell at 8 15am The TV was set to Arabic and although we could get some programmes in English others were dubbed in Arabic eg we saw MP Kenneth Clarke in the House of Commons speaking in Arabic All the service details were in Arabic so because there was no Hotel service book in the room we had to ask at Reception the times of breakfast etc When we go to Vienna again it will be unlikely that we stay again in this hotel , Location
430574,Le Meridien Vienna, The breakfast food buffet can be improved Esp the pastry section And the variety from day to day , The location was very good for us It was near the museums and the main shopping street the St Stephensdom and the train station
430575,Le Meridien Vienna, Check in was very slow And check out was not great either Mistakes were made The manager had to come over and deal with things More of an annoyance than a problem , Location was perfect Close to everything Old Town shopping Stefansdom Hofburg palace art gallery Kunsthistorisches old city hall Karlskirche etc etc We loved the executive king room Lots of room Best shower ever Also we had an excellent experience with the concierge Dominic was his name He really made the experience of staying in your hotel extra special Also the Museum Cafe around the corner was excellent 
430576,Le Meridien Vienna, We had requested two connecting rooms because we were bringing our two granddaughters and we didn t want to keep them in separate rooms We found them very unaccomidating and I would never recommend this property to any of my friends or corporate employees I also found that their staff was rude and I had a very poor experience , Nothing
430577,Le Meridien Vienna, The Receptionist lady was absolutely not helpful gave wrong information regarding the car parking possibility and we get a fine The check in was incredibly complicated I didn t understand why we had to pay 100Eur warranty 50 room for the minibar in advance but surely we paid it I get an unofficial invoice which doesn t contained any details about the rooms and the nights and it was addressed only with my name without my address all my data were given via booking com I visit 10 12 hotels per a year because of my business trips all over the world although this time it was a holiday with my American friends but I have never had such a bad experience regarding administration before , The room and the bath was really nice 
430578,Le Meridien Vienna, Staff responded very slow I was assigned to a twin bed room which I requested to be moved to king bed room I was asked to wait in the room I waited for 40 minutes and in the end I went to the concierge To my surprise the staff indeed has done nothing to my request and only made effort to change my room after I approached the concierge One could imagine how long I would wait if I stayed patiently in the rol Facilites are okay not really a 5 star hotel in my opinion , Location is very close to historical sites of Vienna
430579,Le Meridien Vienna, Spa water in pool is too cold whirpool was out of order for whole one day Lift to the spa was also out of order for one day Restaurant some changes were done from our last stay eg paintings were replaced by LCD monitors but the way of realization was horrible many holes in walls lot of cables around Breakfast we came 30 min before the end of breakfast expecting full servise but staff approached like breakfast has just finished , Location lobby bar
430580,Le Meridien Vienna,No Negative, The staff were of the highest quality extremely friendly accommodating and enthusiastic We have never stayed somewhere so clean and relaxed This hotel really made our stay extra special the staff found out my fianc e was going to propose and arranged the room with rose petals etc for our return after the opera I said yes of course 
430581,Le Meridien Vienna, I would have liked more BBC entertainment channels All the TV in English was news Not all the staff spoke English well, The room was huge and had everything one could possibly require The bed was the most comfortable I have ever had in a hotel Very central to all the sights 
430582,Le Meridien Vienna, To improve cleaness and find a way to avoid light in the early morning, The location near Opera is excellent the romos are confortable and the staff very kind Breakfast excellent and a free minibar in the room
430583,Le Meridien Vienna,No Negative, The manager was very responsive by email leading up to the trip Also when we were in Vienna my toddler son unfortunately had an accident and needed medical attention The staff was incredible in helping up to deal with the situation The staff is really what sets this hotel apart 
430584,Le Meridien Vienna, the breakfast room was very noisy and because there were lots of residents so couldn t enjoy your breakfast Also we had a problem with the heating in our room so one night we slept using electric heating instead of changing us room, the breakfast was very rich with lots of varieties of almost everything
430585,Le Meridien Vienna, The front office was understaffed on our check in at 8 00 PM We had to wait for 30 minutes with only a few people in front of us We were given the wrong room which also had to be sorted out We were missing a few items from the room for which we had to relay multiple messages to fix so the communication can be improved Given above we did not have a 5 star feeling and felt that the accommodation was overpriced , The location is excellent with the museum quarter on your doorstep The sound isolation from the street is pretty good We had some issues at the night of checking in and Thomas from the front office was kind enough to provide us with a surprise bottle of champagne on ice as amends 
430586,Le Meridien Vienna, I asked for high level room and I got one in 3rd floor with no view And corridor floor not clean It is not 5 stars hotel and not le meridian that I expect and I know ,No Positive
430587,Le Meridien Vienna, Dirty hallways and dirty rooms were a minor issue More importantly very unhelpful staff Didn t seem to care how inconvenienced I was Screwed up my laundry screwed up my car service Zero attention to detail or customer service Quite shocking actually , Great Location 
430588,Le Meridien Vienna, The room service food is really terrible for a hotel chain such as Meridien Each time we ordered room service the proper change was not given back to us consider there is also a good service charge attached to it At checkout we were given a nice bill for phone calls which we did not make We were connected through the hotel to another local shop but they could at least inform us before connecting that the call will be charged an insane rate My data plan in the entire month costs less than that We did not end up paying this but when you are hungry in the morning and the first thing you have to do is check out this is not a pleasant way to start the day The shampoos and shower gels are not replaced either they way you would expect , The check in was decent and the lady who checked us in was quite kind The hotel left us a nice generic letter in the room and gave us some cute little desserts for our celebration They provide complimentary water and some drinks too which is nice The room size is good and spacious with a lot of light the location of the hotel is good very close to the Opera house I have stayed at the Imperial Hotel too with my family which was far more fantastic completely different league but a little further away So if location is very important this is a somewhat okay place to stay as long as you do not expect anything beyond basic service 
430589,Le Meridien Vienna, It felt like The staff on the front desk was a bit overworked I am used to a more available reception desk But it was nt a biggy, The room was modern and comfortable The location was central walking distance to all our destinations 
430590,Le Meridien Vienna, Were waiting 25 minutes to check it and 20 minutes to check out only two members of staff instead of five the number of computers at the reception were working despite the fact that check in was 15 00 on Friday and check out at 12 00 on Saturday There were about 7 different people in the queue but the staff paid no attention to this fact and was very slow and unprofessional to check in the guests Absolutely tiny bed in the room despite the fact that queen bed was announced , The location is excellent
430591,Le Meridien Vienna, The lifts are too dark More lighting required The music was rather loud for my taste, Room larger than expected Bed very comfortable Shower good although I prefer a flexible rather than fixed shower unit Breakfast excellent
430592,Le Meridien Vienna, We did not like the dim lights in the lift or the continuous music in the lift and bar area It was not Viennese but modern music with a deep bass One of the party did not like the glass partition between the bedroom and bathroom as she felt it did not provide sufficient privacy, The position was excellent Within walking distance of the Opera Hofburg Palace etc The room was big and the bed really comfortable Bottled water was provided every day and there was fresh fruit in the reception area Breakfast was varied and enjoyable
430593,Le Meridien Vienna, The main restaurant was closed on the Sunday night and the menu in the bar restaurant is limited and so we ate out But that was fine as there are many nice restaurants near by , The location is fantastic right beside the museums and parks and with easy access to the tube and the rest of Vienna The hotel is very modern with modern art dotted around The rooms are stylish with glass divides separating the sleeping area from the wardrobe and bathroom The breakfast was good with a wide selection of hot breakfast sausage etc alongside fresh made omelettes cereals cheese ham fruit etc 
430594,Le Meridien Vienna, On the negative the bars restaurants nor the lounges areas are not places where you want to stick around They have no atmosphere and they re not cosy Plus it is allowed to smoke in the champagne bar Also the restaurant staff charged me by mistake 45 for a single glass of wine luckily I spotted it I was also attending the 2 day conference downstairs and my partner company paid for the cocktail reception At the end of the evening I asked a waiter for an extra glass of wine which he was just taking away and he refused to give it to me saying that the time is the time I found his attitude rude Also one of the participants had her laptop stolen during the conference clearly some security issues there , I found the room itself and the bathroom excellent as well as the reception and luggage handlers staff very good Special mention to staff called Africa 
430595,Le Meridien Vienna, Toiletries in room no replenished daily and free mini bar only had soft drinks but had been touted as both, Modern room albeit a little small Lovey bathroom
430596,Le Meridien Vienna, At 3 15 my room was not ready I booked a studio however I was given a rooftop room very different than the one I booked and the windows were without a curtain I called them asking if this the studio I booked They called me again and said they are nearly the same and you can see the other room if you like to change I saw the studio it was really different with two bathrooms and a dinner table The size was 55 m2 and the other one was only 40 m2 I got really angry and wondering why they did this Another thing about this hotel is the flooring carpets and chairs are worn and torn for a 5 star hotel When you get in the loby you will notice an old worn and torn sofa which will give a miserable feeling , Staff at the buffet were good and welcoming The shower facilities at the studio were good 
430597,Le Meridien Vienna,No Negative, Great location and base when exploring Vienna Lovely breakfast with an amazing choice of finest quality food Really impressive room with a quality bath and shower Couldn t fault any aspect of this hotel 
430598,Le Meridien Vienna, My room was good but on the corridor the floor was sometimes warn and the water is running on the bathroom , The security man was very helpful He told me that we must be very careful because my car is parking a wrong place and the traffic walden is very strict He recommended a good parking place 
430599,Le Meridien Vienna, Nothing we had a great experience , Excellent location Central to everything we wanted to see Very friendly staff very helpful and gave great advice 
430600,Le Meridien Vienna, One glitsch with the housekeeping the minibar and water were not restocked one day Lighting in the elevators was too dim, Superb waiting staff efficient reception excellent meals
430601,Le Meridien Vienna,No Negative, Friendly staff great breakfast each morning with a variety of selections The rooms are contemporary and beautifully furnished Large bath closet relaxing areas Location was ideal for walking to major sites and close to UBahn for ease of getting further out 
430602,Le Meridien Vienna,No Negative, All staff were polite and friendly at all times not a single bad experience in the week we stayed here When we had a problem with the TV the technician was with us in minutes to resolve the issue and when we ordered room service the food was delivered in an incredibly short time and was absolutely delicious The hotel room was amazing the pictures on the website don t quite show how lovely it is and the massage shower was incredible Overall outstanding service at a lovely hotel 
430603,Le Meridien Vienna, There was a disco business party at 6 30 in the morning for three hours in the champagne room that could be heard from our room they need to make it clearer what type of tourist they are trying to cater for you as you don t expect this from a 5 star hotel not impressed, Location
430604,Le Meridien Vienna, We were told that our room was down free Just before we settled down to sleep my 9 year old pointed out some feathers in her pillow which saved me My next day in Vienna would have been miserable had I slept on it The staff addressed the issue and promptly replaced them The towels each day smelled like chlorine suggesting that perhaps the towel sheets are not washed as well as they could be , The larger room sizes were very spacious and comfortable Had all we needed Breakfast was delicious and a good atmosphere in the hotel bar Showers were awesome 
430605,Le Meridien Vienna, Staff are not competent They don t have much knowledge After I left I realized there was a mistake on my credit card charges After they rectified it due to currency fluctuation I lost some money for no reason just because they made a mistake , A warm welcome
430606,Le Meridien Vienna, horrible tv channels and the room was a little too hot or cold, amazing location and helpful staff The room is super modern and the bars downstairs are hip and fun
430607,Le Meridien Vienna, Very very expensive breakfast with poor quality of products viennoiseries bread Bathroom nor very clean especially the sewer of the shower, Very good bed Good insonorisation of the room Very good location Nice jacuzzi Minibar and water offered 
430608,Le Meridien Vienna, The service is poor cleaning need to be bather for one room wher you pay 890 eu for one night shut be clean its whose dust every weer , The location it nice Restaurant is nice
430609,Le Meridien Vienna, Nothing, The breakfast was fantastic the hotel was in a fantastic location just 500 meters away from all the attraction and main sholping area amd amazing restaurants 
430610,Le Meridien Vienna, The mattress needed replacing and the bed was only a standard double not a king size , Great location easy to walk to the sites and shops of the city centre The room was a good size and nicely decorated 
430611,Le Meridien Vienna, It s a fairly simple set up so someone looking for fancy classical decor won t like it , The room is nice artsy and clean The shower is very spacious 
430612,Le Meridien Vienna, Not a 5 star A 3 star at best On arrival front desk girl was efficient and kept asking how our ride to Vienna was Then the bell boy kept asking the same thing while with us in the elevator Real strange Were initially given a bad room at the 7th floor The room smelled like strong chemicals to the point one could not breath inside Had to have it changed right away Already off to very bad start Bathrooms are poor There are very few amenities we had to call reception to get shower caps The refill of the free minibar is not happening unless you call them Very poorly lit elevators Although a non smokinh hotel there is a smoking bar right next to elevators Free Internet means one device per room at relatively low speed After having complained to manager on duty Dorothy about the short commings during our stay she has not been able to offer any compensation such as a later check out which we asked for We even had to pay 7 Euro for the high speed Internet after paying just over 250 Euro per room per night The hotel is cutting costs which means customer service does not really matter and we are thinking about a refund as it has not provided the quality they promised Not going back and not recommending it , Breakfast is real good in the sense of variety and quality Although dishes are not all cleaned properly and the coffee is totally watery The coffee machine is not working but if you ask they will bring you Illy espresso coffee much better They did not have us on the list on the last day for breakfast Hotel has a good location but so are others in the same area 
430613,Le Meridien Vienna, room temperature almost unbearable at night way too hot needs better air conditioning or lighter doonas hairdryer location setup is ridiculous , good location
430614,Le Meridien Vienna, No smoking room Room was very small The room is very cold in winter I did early checkout before one day and they didn t return my money I told them dew to family reason but they didn t accept even , Swimming pool Location
430615,Le Meridien Vienna, The corridors are dated and smell of smoke , They could not have done anything more for us We arrived for a three night stay and were able to check in early The staff were extremely friendly and offered us a free upgrade upon arrival I mentioned before arriving that we were on holiday for my husband s 40th birthday To our surprise the hotel arranged a bottle of champagne on our first night with a thoughtful note The location of the hotel is absolutely perfect especially for the opera which is a 2 minute dash across the road on a winter s evening The hotel is very modern and beautifully decorated Thank you to all the staff at Le Meridian for making our stay so special 
430616,Le Meridien Vienna, I had booked the 3 rooms in advance and when we arrived in the evening of our first night the hotel had given our rooms away so we had to be shunted to another hotel We were not happy ,No Positive
430617,Le Meridien Vienna,No Negative, What a wonderful hotel The rooms were great such a great use of space A free mini bar Where do you see that And the location was perfect Central to everything Friendly staff A great experience 
430618,Le Meridien Vienna, Nothing Perfect hotel , Amazing hotel Amazing staff especially Naomi on front desk Made my girlfriends birthday extra special Best hotel I ve stayed in 
430619,Le Meridien Vienna, Inside was showing signs of needing refurbishment tattered and tired Bathroom floors were similar Carpets in the hall looked stained Definitely not 5 star in my experience , Location was great and staff were extremely friendly and helpful
430620,Le Meridien Vienna, We are experienced travellers and have done extensive travelling around Europe on many occasions In our opinion Le Meridien Vienna is not a 4 star hotel by any stretch of the imagination It is far from it We all know Vienna is relatively expensive but this hotel is a rip off at anything more than 200 euros a night we paid double that regardless of the season The location is good and if you book an executive room the rooms are large However that is about it The furniture in the rooms is below what you would expect from IKEA and the termination decor is of poor standard Furthermore the rooms are not it is properly cleaned and the toiletries which you take for granted in far cheaper hotels are supplied are almost non existent The corridors are grotty with dirty carpets and stained walls The lobby area is extremely basic and far below what the price of this hotel or the photos may lead you to believe There is very limited and at times no staff at all in the the absence reception lobby area and we noted with concern that anybody could walk in and out and access any floor without being a guest at the hotel so notable that it makes for a very poor reception Some staff inform us that Apparently this hotel is in the management is cutting down on cost and had reduced staff and this is patently obvious to those unfortunate enough to have fallen for the deceiving photos issued by the hotel Also we can only assume that any favourable ratings and comments originate from naive travellers whose point of comparison is youth hostel type accommodation or from dummy fake sources If this hotel does not get sold which is apparently being negotiated it should close This hotel as currently advertised and priced must rank as the number one accommodation scam in Vienna For the same money you can do much much better in nearby true four and five stars properties Do yourself a favour Avoid this hotel , Location
430621,Le Meridien Vienna, unfortunately the services are very bad I had to go directly to the reception because I couldn t find the number form the reception in the room I didn t have enough shampoo shower gel no shower cap no sticks basically very dissapointed because it costs a lot of money per night and accordingly to 5 stars hotel expectations now I rate the hotel very very low comparing with 2 years back The cleaning ladies are very rude and they were speaking Romanian and I m Romanian too and understood everything from what they were saying I stayed at 4th floor and when I asked in English please could you bring me some shower gel they were talking between them in Romanian what the f ck do she want more So I have to say that would be indicated not to hire anymore these kind of people with this attitude and language or at least to invest more training in them I m not sure if I want to visit again your hotel Regards, I like the bar of the hotel the entire hotel and its history the building also the rooms are very beautiful especially the ones with balcony 
430622,Le Meridien Vienna, Too bad that complimentary minibar was not replenished every day Illumination in the hotel was poor Lack of signage toward restaurant and bar and even the lift Housekeeping staff seemed overwhelmed with work on Christmas Eve and as a result we did not have our room cleaned that day they showed up about 4PM when we were just back in the room from a day out We had a very early check out and we were unpleasantly surprised to find that the total bill was about 400 Euro higher than we have expected due to a dinner charge to our room dinner that we did not have in the hotel It eventually got sorted however in our time travelling this is the first time we are not presented with the detailed bill before making the payment , Great Location Clean and modern hotel Very competent staff at check in with attention to details attention that led to a complimentary bottle of Prosecco as we were celebrating our joint birthday Great to see a complimentary minibar
430623,Le Meridien Vienna, Decor of room very modern but not practical Frosted glass door wall separated bedroom from bathroom which meant person using bathroom at night woke up person sleeping in bedroom Also lobby smelled like cigarettes , Great location spacious room 
430624,Le Meridien Vienna, Room key would not for the second night the booking com process somehow made the key invalid Reception took ages to sort it out, Great location Breakfast good 
430625,Le Meridien Vienna, The restaurant is not at 5 star level We had there our end of the year dinner and quality of cooking is medium Even the breakfast has a coffee machine that is not the kind of service for a 5 star hotel , Staff was very kind and available to offer support help and assistance responding to every needs
430626,Le Meridien Vienna, Spa needed maintenance In room tea coffee milk not replenished without us hassling them Spa opening hours too short TV channels nearly useless Indifferent Hollywood movies cost 19 euros each to watch Poor room size for the extra price that we paid , Good location 
430627,Le Meridien Vienna, We found our room a bit too hot despite turning the thermostat down to 16 degrees and left the windows open all night I am sure we can be more green , Very professional helpful staff Excellent service 
430628,Le Meridien Vienna, Old hotel the worst bed i ever had in a 5 star hotel Rooms were dirty and the bathroom too Hotel needs to be renovated as soon as possible In the end they invented a way to charge us extra for the breakfast Overall bad experience with this hotel and i wouldnt recommend it, Only the location
430629,Le Meridien Vienna, I ve had much better experiences in 15 hostels I paid for a suite for my partners christmas present and our stay was an absolute disaster The hotel froze over 750 in my bank account when I d already paid for the hotel half of the money was without getting my authorisation They needed a guarentee for the room and said I d receive the money back in 2 days 2 days later I went back to the reception and asked when I d receive the money back and they said 2 weeks Given that it was on christmas eve a time when most of us are a little short of cash to agree to a pre authorisation amount of 370 was a frozen another 370 without authorisation was pretty outrageous The hotel needed to take the second figure in order to refund a card I d previously paid on this also led to me being charged foreign transaction fees by the bank We spent 2 hours sat in the hotel on the final day with the hotel offering no compensation for the fact that I d be charged transaction fees or had to wait over a week and a half longer for 750 to be returned to my account They wouldn t even offer us a taxi to the station even though they had made us wait The hotel staff even said that the procedures were insufficient and to credit the reception they were clearly unable to do anything due to a front of house manager with little customer facing skills We are not people who require everything to be perfect and often stay in much cheaper accommodation but having money frozen in my bank account without authorisation and having to pay extra for a hotel due to their negligence ruined our holiday This will definitely happen again so I strongly advise everyone to AVOID THIS HOTEL ,No Positive
430630,Le Meridien Vienna, They charge me for late check out but they did not clean the room my check out day they did not charge mini bar and they disconnect my room wifi If i paid for late check out why they did not their duty , Very good location 
430631,Le Meridien Vienna, unwilling staff hotel room were cold heating doesnt work during whole stay personal didnt make anything nevertheless we were asking them several times and all time they promise to fix the problem people on recepcion without any responsibility or willingness to help , great location no problem with parking lovely bar
430632,Le Meridien Vienna, Note that even if the rooms are large the double bed in the standard rooms is ridiculously small You need to get a deluxe room before you even have a queen bed Rooms are cold in winter heating hardly works For the price the rooms simply don t justify it , Well situated close to all central districts Opera etc 
430633,Le Meridien Vienna,No Negative, The staff were friendly and extremely helpful particularly with local knowledge and helpful suggestions Large spacious comfortable room for 3 of us 
430634,Le Meridien Vienna, breakfast too expensive booking indicate 13 euro they asked for 30 so I decided to go outside where you can have coffee and croissant for 4 euro , great design art everywhere spg floor great
430635,Le Meridien Vienna,No Negative, Professional lovely staff Restaurant and bar great with good atmosphere Excellent location Rooms were large comfy and had lots of extra little amenities 
430636,Le Meridien Vienna, The atmosphere of the breakfast area was very uninviting given the fact that it is used as a bar restaurant in the evening The unlimited minibar offer is a joke Not that it was our motivation to stay here but the unlimited minibar consisted 1 bottle of water a coke a diet coke a fruit juice and a beer This is all ridiculous only because they used this as an extra value promotion It has everything but still no good feel of the hotel , Location is good
430637,Le Meridien Vienna, The front desk staff were not customer oriented especially one staff called Jenine When we were checking out we were treated with respect , Location was excellent Concierge staff was helpful and friendly 
430638,Le Meridien Vienna, We like to have a drink in the bar but we can t do so as guests were allowed to smoke in the bar , Staff were friendly and helpful great location 
430639,Le Meridien Vienna, the bathroom was too dark and we had only only bathrobe for 2 No breakfast included , the location is perfect the spa is amazing the free mini bar is very convenient 
430640,Le Meridien Vienna, The bed is uncomfortable small and narrow It is practically a single bed not a duble bed what we reserved Mattress for bed is uncomfortable and soft The price is high for that , Breakfast is ok 
430641,Le Meridien Vienna, Bed was small not comfortable matrasse was awfull terrible view from the window to the wall room 328 , Location was good breakfast was also good but a little bit pricey
430642,Le Meridien Vienna, There was only one set of towels in a double room Help was not available by phone always busy than we asked for additional towel sets at the reception desk personally went to walk to the city after two hours towels were still missing We had to ask again at the reception desk After asking for three times we received the towels , Well equipped hotel at a good location Nice breakfast 
430643,Le Meridien Vienna, Very long waiting time to check in also very long waiting time with the concierge to get my car and luggage at check out Not comfortable to pay parking separately from the hotel bill , Greta location Rooms are comfortable Nice touch with a free refreshments in the room 
430644,Le Meridien Vienna, The bed in the offered room was too small for two queen size We asked for another room which at first was offered by paying an extra charge At the end after ca 2 hours we got a room with a king size bed without an extra charge , The hotel is in the city center the rooms are still very quiet Our room was on the 6th floor 
430645,Le Meridien Vienna, The front desk had a little big line every time I was there and needed something Also I asked a bellman due to the long line at the desk to have a do not disturb sign out on our door When I returned several hours later this had not been done The smell of cigarettes in the hallways was irritating , The staff was nice the decor was artistic and interesting The guest room was lovely 
430646,Le Meridien Vienna, Room facilities very poor example it doesn t information about the tv Chanel bath room it doesn t good if I took shower leaked the water to leaving room and a lot of problems in the room and , Good location good staf cleans 
430647,Le Meridien Vienna, Ridiculously high price for breakfast , Excellent location if you are going to make city sighting on foot Extremely lot of breath taking spectecularity in max 20 25 minutes walking distance Also the hotel is wonderful and has a special relaxing atmosphere Nice 
430648,Le Meridien Vienna, Since we did satisfy with the service I still believe that the offered breakfast price per person which is charged as an extra is quiet high , This was not our first time and I would again rate the Location cleanliness bed comfort and breakfast service as excellent 
430649,Le Meridien Vienna, Nothing, The location is excellent Very close to the metro station shopping area resturants and historical places and opera house and all the tours buses and connections starts from the opera house The staff were very helpful We arrived at night and the hotel was hosting a fashion event and the place was very crowded with people and music The next day we received a message from the management on the room offering us free breakfast for the whole stay as a way of compensation for the inconvient although we didnt complaint about it This was very kind of them I highly recommend this hotel for Vienna visitors
430650,Le Meridien Vienna, One day during our stay there was a big business event at the hotel So as guest and a paying customers we re now not allowed too visit the hotel bar anymore After we complained and said this is not acceptable we re allowed too visit the bar again When I booked the hotel I requested single beds But when I arrived they had not arranged this But the nice evening staff fixed that problem rather fast , Very good location 
430651,Le Meridien Vienna, When you showered the entire room got wet street noise was bad ugly decor went down to computer room to print boarding passes they turned out the lights on us Ad said they had transport to airport we had to pay 50 , Person at desk
430652,Le Meridien Vienna, I felt like the room was equipped and styled like a Comfort Inn or a Holiday Inn It was sparsely furnished with minimalistic styled furniture It was modern and not very comfortable It was our most expensive room out of our 6 hotel 21 day trip and had the worst lobby and facilities We paid 406 00 night for 5 nights If I had booked earlier in the month I would have gotten a room at another classic 5 star traditional hotel for 350 00 night but this was last minute and the only 5 star hotel that was available It was convenient to the opera and on the inner ring but there were many other hotels in that area that would have been better suited for us , The room had a great shower however at the expense of having any counter area to apply cosmetics brushes or hair styling etc 
430653,Le Meridien Vienna, Only minor negative was the Internet wifi didn t allow emails to be sent had to change to the local telco to do that , Staff were excellent The young lady at check in was warm welcoming professional very helpful Same standard at checkout 24 hour well fitted out gym was great Artwork in the foyer and surrounds made for a funky atmosphere 
430654,Le Meridien Vienna, The staff is very inexperienced Our luggages were brought very late They couldn t even answer the basic questions about the facility like the location of the hairdryer in the room it was hidden very well in the room We had to ask for basic things like shower cap and q tips each time , the location is perfect
430655,Le Meridien Vienna, Its not worth to pay for a Suite in Vienna that doesn t have a view from the window because my view was another windows which was really bad since I paid for a suit I expected to have at least a view which regular rooms I am very disappointed, the location was amazing the Suite was good on the interior decoration
430656,Le Meridien Vienna, In the bathroom the belt of the bath robe was blood stained Our room we asked for a quiet one was looking to an inner lichthof The corridor was fairly clean , Location Room and bathroom was clean 
430657,Le Meridien Vienna,No Negative, Location splendid just 7 minutes from the main shopping street Close enough to be on the spot but avoiding the bustle and noise of the centre The swimming pool a real bonus 
430658,Le Meridien Vienna, Too much money for value As a preferred customer they would not extend the stay for an additional half hour and the response was not nice , The Conceirge was excellent I think her name was Melinda Front staff best average Location is very good
430659,Le Meridien Vienna, Tired and tatty are the two best words to describe this hotel No where near normal standard that you d expect from Le Meridien brand The hotel hallways were more reminiscent of student digs than 5 star hotel Disappointing , Great staff excellent location 
430660,Le Meridien Vienna, Reception clerk was trainee and gave us a standard room when we had a paid reservation for a superior room The price is high for the room BAthroom does not have natural light Bed is too low One night there was a party in the first floor and we could hear the noise in the room, Location next to city center is excellent
430661,Le Meridien Vienna, Room floor was not clean arrived with toilet brush still in toilet room width poor so twice knocked things off the bedside table paid extra for breakfast and on last day food was cold trying to be a W but lacks style, Location front desk staff were good
430662,Le Meridien Vienna, i wanted to stay longer but had to go back to Sydney to work , Everything was excellent Staff were so helpful and nothing was too much to ask Would highly recommend to anyone wanting a relaxing and enjoyable stay One you will never forget as Vienna also is the best place we have been to in our whole Europe trip I would recommend at least 1 week here as Vienna overall is the friendliest and value for money you will get in Europe 
430663,Le Meridien Vienna, Double bed was too small would have expected a king for our superior double room the AC temperature did not change despite changing the controls the bathroom was flooded each time we showered due to the nature or lack of the shower screen , Location was absolutely perfect could not ask for better Was within a short walking distance of most major tourist sites Staff always friendly and very helpful Quirky decor loved the hot pink bathtub and art in the lobby 
430664,Le Meridien Vienna, Bed was extremely small It is not the size for 2 adults Comfort was compromised as a result of this Shower has no door so bathroom floods Design may be aesthetically trendy but not practical at all Staff were also not cooperative and as hospitable as other Starwood properties, The location
430665,Le Meridien Vienna, The music in one of the bars is a bit overbearing the Mo t bar s prices for champagne are exaggerated The restaurant lacks a soul , The bed was very good indeed and the pillows excellent The room decoration was modern and welcoming and the room size was good The breakfast was excellent cooked order as well as self service The staff are young hip and welcoming do they use models or resting actors like at least one hip hotel in London 
430666,Le Meridien Vienna, Our hotel room floor was absolutely full of long dark hairs Very distressing and off putting We should have complained at the time but as we were only staying one night we thought it wasn t worth it It has made me think twice about staying there in the future even though everything else about the hotel was great , Excellent location Very friendly staff beautiful d cor lovely champagne bar Free soft drink mini bar
430667,Le Meridien Vienna, Initially I got an old not a clean room on the roof with windows impossible to open receptionist pretending I wanted a quite one and saying it was the best one That wasn t true After I rejected this offer another person offered a nicer room It looks like 5 star hotel doesn t guarantee you the best treatment May be it was a bad luck in my long experience of travelling , Location
430668,Le Meridien Vienna, Check in and out was very slow Staff in general reception housekeeping breakfast waiters seemed not to have been trained properly and it showed Quite expensive even for Vienna , Excellent location near the Opera The room with a small lounge area was very comfortable The bathroom had a magnificent walk in shower with massage and an old fashioned bathtub Free minibar stocked up every day Breakfast was a nice full spread although with limited healthy options 
430669,Le Meridien Vienna, I didnt like when they charged 20 eur for two little bottles of water also in the bathroom there was no place to put the towel near the sink Eventhough the room was not dark and claustrophoble at all the room view started after a bery hight wall It gave it an unique look though , Great location interesting unique interior design helpful staff big good breakfast 
430670,Le Meridien Vienna, Didn t have the option of a paid minibar with more choices the bathroom toiletries were lacking a few items like tooth brush tooth paste shower cap cotton tips etc didn t feel like a 5 star hotel , Excellent location staff very friendly clean
430671,Le Meridien Vienna, When we arrived our rooms where mixed They changed them both rooms were supposed to be double rooms but one was prepared as a single room We asked for second pillous and towels but it took the staff about 6 hours to get those to the room I had to ask them twice to do it ,No Positive
