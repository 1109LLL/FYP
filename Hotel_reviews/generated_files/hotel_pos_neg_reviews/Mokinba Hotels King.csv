304804,Mokinba Hotels King, I had to go to the birthday the same day I arrived and needed to iron my shirt Pretty common problem Receptionist told me they don t have irons and they only provide laundry service in the morning and they can t help me with my problem I was surprised they failed to solve such a common problem and didn t even try to find a solution , Location is great easy access to Cadorna and walking distance from Duomo
304805,Mokinba Hotels King, The beds are very uncomfortable I barely could sleep because of this , Very well located very clean great internet connection and very friendly and great staff They were very helpful and provided us great experience 
304806,Mokinba Hotels King, The breakfast could be served for a longer period of time It ends at 9 30am which for me is kind of early since I m spending time vacationing , Not sure about the breakfast because I missed it but the staff was really nice helped me print a ticket for the concert I was going too Also the hotel itself is VERY convenient close to Cadorna s station that can take you pretty much everywhere in the Lombardy area there s nice places to eat like having breakfast at Panini Durini or an amazing gelato at Massimo The bed was good for one night the bathroom was very clean and the decor was ok Overall that s gonna be THE SPOT to stay at Milan next time I m going for a short trip on a budget 
304807,Mokinba Hotels King, The staff very rude and unwelcoming No WiFi they just promise things that don t exist and there is no one to talk to we were told that it is our problem They just write everywere around the hotel how important the customers are for them wich is very far from reality Never received such a terrible treatment The only good thing was the location but it is definitely not worth it,No Positive
304808,Mokinba Hotels King, There are no kiosks open at night around however that s the case for the central area of Milano , The location was brilliant the staff extra friendly and speaking multiple languages The room was spacious and very nicely furnited The beds were very comfortable 
304809,Mokinba Hotels King, The room and room facilities were awful and well below a 4 star standard The room was about 3 metres square with a very small desk no suitcase stand and no space to store suitcases out of the way and a TV bolted to the wall in one corner The single chair in the room was rocky and about to fall apart The lock on the sliding shutters did not work so the shutters could not be held shut The minibar was not restocked daily and there was no customer record sheet to help account for items consumed No tea or coffee making facilities No English language TV for news etc Bathroom 2 3 metres square with a 800mm square shower that could only be reached by squeezing past the bidet and was too small to allow a tall slim male to access his feet to wash them properly The basin drain plug was disconnected from its operating linkage and the basin had a cigarette burn on it There were no instructions fro the air conditioning which we could not get to work so the room was unbearably hot unless we kept the window open and lived with the traffic noise and fumes One of the two lifts was out of action and the other lift was very slow and very small barely room for two people with a suitcase Because the lift was so slow we used the fire escape stairway on multiple occasions On every occasion there was laundry or maintenance materials partially obstructing the staircase landings The carpet in the public area was dirty and worn through torn on one of the stairs leading to the lift area The only breakfast available was a continental one there was no cooked food Sadly the hotel failed to live up to its espoused ethos , The location was good 10 mins walk from the city centre The hotel reception staff were cheerful and helpful The double bed was a proper double bed not two singles pushed together The wardrobes were good and well stocked with hangers There was a notice on the wall by the lifts espousing an ethos of providing an excellent customer experience 
304810,Mokinba Hotels King, Reception staff pretentious and self important Rather than feeling welcome it was an imposition on them Location not ideal for access to sights or restaurants , The hotel is a hotel Nothing exceptional unfortunately 
304811,Mokinba Hotels King, Smells bad from the entrance At our arrival a man as completely drunk and faded out in the entrance lobby Old non maintained furnitures Our room s door wasn t closing opening properly you can hear people talking from other rooms so uncomfortable,No Positive
304812,Mokinba Hotels King, Most important the reception cocky unfriendly impolite unwilling to help As we arrived the accommodation does not have any parking facilities and we knew it There is a modern parking house about 500m from the hotel What we did not know was that the price for the guests was reduced at 25 euros per night which was already very expensive and normal price 28 euros As we asked the reception were to park he did not tell us that the hotel offers entrance bons so in the end we had to pay 15 euros more The rooms dont have any sound isolation at all We did not book breakfast there and i think it was a good decision because italians are nit famous for their breakfast There are plenty of Caf s right next to the hotel however The rooms have tv but you can see only italian programms There is not even one programm in english or other language Internet is so slow like in the stone age Alltogether avoid this hotel it will ruin your stay in this beautiful city , The location of the hotel is good so as the neighborhood The rooms were clean Unfortunately the negative aspects were more important and alltogether we do not recommend by all means this hotel 
304813,Mokinba Hotels King, If you take a taxi from the airport go with a metered taxi from Linate it is about 40 euros cheaper than the taxi that you can arrange from the hotel, I loved the decor of the rooms it s very Italian and very cosy with all amenities you would require as a traveler
304814,Mokinba Hotels King, We asked for a taxi to the airport and they arranged transportation with a local driver and toke the money at the lobby which started at 110Euro that they demanded in cash taxi fair is 95 the driver tried to brake the sound barrier on the way at 160KpH it was scary,No Positive
304815,Mokinba Hotels King, On arrival staff Couldn t find our booking Questioned if we had a booking or is it under another name Cold water for 24 hrs No communication re this, Good location
304816,Mokinba Hotels King, The hotel s building is small but other than that it s great , Perfect location 10 min by foot to Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II and Duomo cathedral 10 min to the castle Sforzesco 6 min to Leonardo s Last supper and vineyard the metro station Cadorna is just a few min away as well Very polite and helpful staff nice hotel interior 
304817,Mokinba Hotels King, The shower was really small and the bed wasn t comfortable enough for 4 star hotel Also the AC wasn t cooling the room it felt like a fan , The location was good and the shutters were really useful to isolate the noise from the street 
304818,Mokinba Hotels King,No Negative, Not to bad But guy at checkin was very rude Clearly doesn t know what customer service is Other members of stuff were nice Overall all not bad 
304819,Mokinba Hotels King, Booking was made with breakfast included however they billed separately too and said booking com made a misstake Others had the same problem while checking out , The place where it is is excellent for weekend travellers Everything on a walking distance 
304820,Mokinba Hotels King, Worst staff I have ever seen in any hotel Parking is too far from hotel and there is no one to assist you for your luggage , Location of this hotel was good 
304821,Mokinba Hotels King, Sometimes a receptionist was a bit inappropriate they call me for check out despite I m genius member and could have the right to late checkout furnitures of the hotel are a bit old, Location they allowed me to keep the luggages there
304822,Mokinba Hotels King, The hotel staff at reception desk was very rude I requested info on exchange rate from USD to EUR and the reply literally was we are not a bank not a nice reply , Well located nice and clean 
304823,Mokinba Hotels King, One of the staff from Front desk was very indifferent to all of our needs There were several situations when on our questions he was just responding with different body gestures like arms shaking Plus his personal problems with Vodafone were much more important than our questions at front desk But for this price I did not had no right to say something , Location Is good Not bad value for money
304824,Mokinba Hotels King, The so called 4 star hotel is shubby very old style and not kept well The reception area is small one staff does everything bar reception The room was small with ugly old furniture with wall paper coming off the walls cracked toilet and noisy old style aircondtion Tv which was 22 inch and cannot be seen properly with an old lift which only takes 3 people if they are without luggage and which was last serviced 6 months ago The towels were harsh to touch and the one sofa chair has not been cleaned for ages The worse is that we got very scracy over the night and got red spots on our backs and necks probably of some bed bugs The staff had an arrogant attitude and when asked to speak to the manager he she was not available and never even tried to make contact with us after The hotel blocked twice the payment even though it was booked with free cancellation The hotel is rated as 4 star but should be a 2 star They overcharged our stay and for the service they offer I feel robbed The photos on the net does not reflect the hotel , Location
304825,Mokinba Hotels King, small and outdated rooms but ok for a few nights Breakfast is nice but not until late , location is perfect walking distance from city center and very close to metro
304826,Mokinba Hotels King, Service breakfast no air conditioning small elevators dated furniture noise from the street , The staff was rude The receptionists were giving different facts about parking and in the end we were charged 25 eur car Breakfast is horrible 9 eur and you have to order decent coffe because the americano that is served for breakfast tastes like bad water Just walk to a caffeteria nearby and spare youre nerves The ONLY thing ok about the hotel is the proximity to Duomo I do not recomnend the hotel to anyone You can probably find a place that correspondes to quality and price ratio 
304827,Mokinba Hotels King, One of the staff during checkin wasn t very friendly however the others were fine Overall felt more like a 3 star hotel than 4 , Location is pretty good Minutes away from metro 
304828,Mokinba Hotels King, Rooms were awfully small No luggage rack and only 1 could be opened on the floor I had to put my luggage on the bed Although 2 pax only 1 big bath towel was in the room My colleague had a single room so small she can t even open her luggage Furthermore there was no window , Location was near to where we wanted to go 
304829,Mokinba Hotels King, The staff was very stiff and impersonal They give the impression that they do you a favor because they service you Avoid the room behind the elevator if you want quiet , Clean comfortable room with nice bathroom and pleasant back view Nice location 
304830,Mokinba Hotels King, Breakfast was rather disappointing for a 4 hotel fresh orange juice cereal fruit good variety of cold meats and cheese but nothing freshly cooked and the coffee was absolutely disgusting My husband has mobility problems and there were lots of stairs and no lift down to the breakfast room The two lifts were tiny and not very reliable There is no restaurant as such only breakfast but there s a super little cafe next door caffe Litta and a tabacchi bar where coffe was only 1 20 , Our room was on the small side but had a balcony overlooking the street Bed comfortable and room clean Reception staff at first were unfriendly but after the first day were very helpful even recommending an excellent restaurant for Sunday evening when many places were closed and arranging taxis for us Tram stop outside the hotel to connect with metro was great although no stop nearby on the way back obviously not the hotel s fault Hotel s taxi to Bergamo for our return flight was excellent 
304831,Mokinba Hotels King, Very low standard for a 4 stars The total low score spoils the staff very dry service Perfunctory response lack of willingness to help Minimum service , Great location
304832,Mokinba Hotels King, The staff in general was rude both in the reception as in the buffet It was too expensive for such a poor room Awful terrace No views at all Not fully clean the room , The location was OK
304833,Mokinba Hotels King, It took more than a while to get 2 seperated bills Pre ceckout was not possible before 2400 hrs due to accounting reasons No proprer handling of our laggage after check out No name tag no seperated room was offered FINALY WE BRAOGHT IT TO CENTRAL STATION Skip the breakfast , Reception friendly 
304834,Mokinba Hotels King, Receptionists were very problematic especially one who was responsible at nights He was sulking all the time not helpful and reacting irritatively Hope to see next time a smiling receptionist , I have many times stayed at this hotel It has a perfect location I may say its a nice and clean hotel in effordable price in an authentic atmosphere 
304835,Mokinba Hotels King, The room felt dark and glum with windows covered letting in very little daylight Decoration looked old and dated The hotel was however situated next to the tramline Bed had a very firm mattress which is not my preference Breakfast was quite basic options no variety day to day Very small shower unit less than 1m2 Hotel required us to leave the room card at reception No validation required to collect it when returning so theoretically it could be possible for others to take your card I found this very insecure Wifi codes are given but can only be used for one device Other devices require further codes However the first night the connection was very poor and needed to use my phone hotspot Overall I was left just a bit underwhelmed and didn t feel I had great value for money , The location was good 15 minutes from the Duomo Milane and 15 minutes total from the Centrale station by metro The staff were helpful too printed off a bus ticket for me and pleasant 
304836,Mokinba Hotels King, the staff was very unpolite and they made us pay the city tax twice on arrival and on the day we left because they did not believe that we had already paid it on the day of our arrival and the receptionist did not give us a receipt ,No Positive
304837,Mokinba Hotels King, the staff were quite rude and not interested to welcome us in a proper way so any information that we asked for they just didnt want to answer the room was really small but clean not worth of money that we paid and even you have to pay for parking , just location of the hotel was quite good
304838,Mokinba Hotels King, No sound proofing in the room Close to the road and could hear every tram passing and also people in the other rooms No parking only very expensive garage close by Breakfast was horible , Location is good 
304839,Mokinba Hotels King, I came to Milan for two nights for business and leisure i stayed for one night at Makinba with a colleague The Staff werent very pleasant they appeared almost annoyed when I asked questions about tranport or museums They didn t have a international plug as I forgot mine but they didnt even mention where i could get one eventhou i said it was my first time in Milan They didnt provide information on wifi when checked in no control for air conditioning in either room when we enquired about the control the staff mentioned that the air conditioning is switch on throughout the building without possibility to control it After asking for directions a map was only provided when we asked if they had one it appears the staff only do what they have to the minimum no initiative is taken to make you feel welcomed i wouldnt recommend the hotel as i prefer to give business to hotels that make an effect to make your stay pleasant , The driver shuttle who took me to the airport was friendly and professional 
304840,Mokinba Hotels King, When we first arrived the staff member at the desk was rude and arrogant , The location was fantastic and so close to the shops The view from our room was gorgeous

304845,Mokinba Hotels King, The bathroom shower is extremely small The young guy at the reception is very nice friendly and helpful The older staff is unpleasant and not helpful The Internet needs to be renewed with new log ins very often There is no notification when the old one expires so you need to keep logging in constantly which gets annoying , The location is good For walking as well as for the public transport
304846,Mokinba Hotels King, The room was very small the staff not so welcoming Walls were really thin you could hear the bathroom of another room quite clearly Also room smelled strongly of old cigar , Location is okay around ten minutes away from the Duomo Air con worked well Reserved parking in front of the hotel to unload and reserved parking spaces in an underground parking of the area
