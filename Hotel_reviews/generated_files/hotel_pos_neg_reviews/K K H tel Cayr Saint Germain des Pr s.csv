174563,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Hotel wardrobe and bathroom toilet could have been cleaner A little bleach required , Reception staff were excellent Hotel is just opposite the Metro Rue Du Bac A great bar cafe just opposite the hotel for breakfast and other meals as well 
174564,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, Nice hotel with friendly stuff and lovely rooms We had a room with a street view and a french balcony It was cozy stylish and smart equipped The location is another advantage of the hotel it is situated literary in the center of Paris with Musee d Orcee Jardin Tuilrie Louvre Notre Dame and Jardin Luxemburg in a walking distance We will possibly stay in this hotel during our next visit to Paris 
174565,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Poor communication from staff We were not told when we checked in that breakfast was not included So overpriced for just a room Then we had breakfast not knowing we were going to get charged Breakfast was 17 euros each and was poor ,No Positive
174566,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, I asked for a view and received a room looking out at the courtyard from below Internet was inconsistent More than once staff entered my room when they knew I was in it or once should have heard me respond to their knock rather than waiting for me to open the door, Large room Front desk was so friendly and accommodating and helpful Location is excellent to explore Paris on foot Access to printer was handy
174567,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, BUT in terms of value for money it was very pricy considering that the room was so small and the bathroom was also tiny Other than that it is a good hotel and I suppose all hotels in Paris are slightly overpriced , The beds were really comfy and the location was great close to many famous sights Furthermore we were upgraded upon arrival to a top floor room which had a great view of the Eiffel tower 
174568,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, The rooms does not correspond to the expected quality pictures in booking are much more better then the reality , The location is perfect very helpfull frontdesk
174569,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, The furniture is a bit old They only give you one key per room , The breakfast is very good the rooms are very large by Parisian standard the location is great with a Metro Station right across the street
174570,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, I guess we could have had a room with a view next time The room we were is was slightly dark but then again it was on the 1st floor so can t expect much , This hotel s location is absolutely amazing super central to everything in Paris I wouldn t stay anywhere else Its walking distance to the Louvre Notre Dame and Eiffel tower The staff speaks good english and are very helpful Housekeeping also did a great job 
174571,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Well when I checked in I thought the receptionist was curt and rude trying to check me in quickly and telling me I had to pay before giving me the room card However the rest of the staff Receptionists porters housekeeping staff were Super Just one observation and am unsure if it is for all rooms I could hear very clearly my Neighbours leaving and entering their rooms in the morning I was just Glad I am not a light sleeper , Bed was comfortable modern bathroom and room s overall cleanliness Location was excellent close to monpartness and the louvre Staff overall very polite and accommodating
174572,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, I thought that the lack of water in the room was a shame given the star rating and the heat The staff kindly gave us water in reception after our concert as we were exhausted and everywhere was closed This was much appreciated It took me a day to find the kettle tucked away in a drawer but when I did this helped to keep up the fluid intake , We found the staff friendly and helpful We liked the area but it involved a lot of walking as we tended not to use transport unless we had to It was our choice It would be good if the hotel highlighted the attractions close to it such as the Mus e Rodin and had some guidance for good local places to eat such as Ralph s and the place for brunch round the corner for those late risers missing the 11 am breakfast on Sunday 
174573,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, We were surprised how friendly and caring the team at the reception was They helped us so much with our little daughter 1 year Everything was already organized they gave us a quiet and more spacious room including a baby bed At breakfast they had a baby stool For the taxi they organized one with a baby seat This was really a perfect stay for us Thank you so much We will for sure come back and recommend this hotel to friends who are traveling with little children to Paris 
174574,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Couldn t check in earlier as in to the room but other than that all fine , The fact that albeit I couldn t check in early into the room I checked in but they let me store the luggage and use the fitness area to change shower etc before heading out to the days activities But the room was lovely and clean the hotel well positioned to the metro and some lovely Bistros etc Staff we very helpful and allowed me to print some tickets off the internet and on leaving helped with getting to the railway station in time 
174575,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Our particular classic room bathroom was quite small and there was mold in the bathroom tiles Staff was nice enough I would say confirm if they have air conditioning We didn t use it because it was cooler on the days we were there but I didn t see a themostat ,No Positive
174576,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, All of it In spite of refreshing the facade they need to change the atadd, Nothing This was my third stay and something has happened wrong in managements Our toilet broke so for one Ight and day we had to take the lift to the cellar
174577,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Had to ask for room service menu and could not figure out how to get English and pay tv Would benefit from having details in the room , Clean modern and professional
174578,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, Food at the restaurant was mediocre at best Most of the staff was nice but wait staff left a lot to be desired Location is great Metro across the street Good restaurants in easy walking distance Small markets also 
174579,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, Alex is the best He was very polite and answer all my questions Very helpful There is a Lady I don t remember her name but she works with him in the latest shift too she was very nice
174580,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, We arrived and they gave us a room that had not been cleaned I never felt assured that they actually changed the bed sheets or just tidied the room, The breakfasts in the hotel were good Staff was friendly and helpful Close to a subway stop
174581,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, The expresso machine was broken the 1st couple days of our stay When I complained the Front Desk revealed it had been broken for a few days prior to my arrival Just go buy a Nespresso Machine but no real coffee is not a way to start one s day The bar was extremely expensive I get it s Paris but for the Hotel s Holiday Inn type set up did not warrant such a mark up I think a double gin and tonic was 27 Euro s , The room was a nice size 
174582,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Staff was pretty mediocre to rude depending who you got The simplest requests became monumental efforts like requesting a corkscrew for the room The shower and sink alternated being stopped up constantly we had them fix it several time Overall it certainly didn t feel like a 400 night hotel , Hotel was nice and quiet linens were clean bed was comfortable 
174583,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Pricey hotel for what was a small room but paris in summer in this location is very pricey generally , Amazing location Lovely foyer area to hotel and the rooms were modern and very clean Great service at reception and housekeeping 
174584,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Breakfast was a little pricey but good but it gave us a chance to explore the cafes in the neighborhood , Very comfy very French a little balcony with a view to Sacre Coeur The staff was wonderful helpful and gave great recommendations 
174585,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, The rooms and the bathrooms seemed a bit older not antique or obsolete than the reception area which was new and modern , Good location nice old Parisian building good size rooms for a European inner city hotel small bar open until late fair breakfast buffet fitness club generally friendly and helpful staff The metro station is just in front sadly only 1 line to choose from but St German on line 4 is 3 blocks away the location is perfect it is close enough to St Germain to be able to walk there for food drinks and entertainment yet it s 2 blocks away from the main bar area so that it is not noisy at night 
174586,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, Quiet comfortable and with an always smiling and helpful staff From bed to breakfast everything held good quality and we d love to stay here again 
174587,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, They did not have made for order eggs The French are a bit tight on using air conditioning This was observed throughout out the city , The staff Facility was nice 
174588,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, No stable wifi you should never go there on business Hot water not stable Late check out after 4 days was billed 30 euro extra chocolate was partly eaten up before we came disgusting They tried to charge us when we checked out Tv remote suddenly disappeared Very small room no luxury , location
174589,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Not much, The staff were VERY friendly night front desk man gave me tips on how to spend my only day in Paris which fit what I told him I would like to get out of the day the bar for being small has a nice top selection of booze and it was VERY nice to just sit and people watch from the windows LOVED the view from the lobby as I just wanted to feel what Paris was like 
174590,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, I specifically requested an early check in and but no indication was given that would not be possible until I arrived, The hotel is in a great location to explore Paris with Spa facilities to aid relaxation at the end of the day 
174591,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, The hot water was off for a time in the morning I didn t have to rush off so it was no problem but it could have been Breakfast buffet a little pricey 32 euros compared to a 4 star in Paris that cost half as much , The property was modern chic and close to the train station Very comfortable with warm and friendly staff I selected it for proximity to the train station because I had to go to Paris the next day and it is a cut above most of the nearby hotels 
174592,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Bathroom was a little small and a bit inconvenient CNN channel did not work and was not fixed the other 100 channels were OK , Very nice rooms we had a junior suite with partial view of the Eiffel Tower Very very nice breakfast 
174593,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, All good , The property is central to many national monuments and buildings and the buzzing area of Saint Germain Had a large double room with large bathroom not always the case in Paris Room was very quiet No road noise Very friendly and efficient desk staff 
174594,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, The hotel is on a busy loud street The A C didn t work well in our room it worked fine in our son s room though and while the outside temp was cool enough to compensate we had to close the window because the noise was relentless , The staff was very hospitable and the breakfast was excellent Really appreciated the electric kettle and refrigerator in our room 
174595,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, We already planning a trip for next and will stay at K K just that the breakfast is a little weak at least by American standards Again not a reason not to stay there great hotel great staff great location etc just be advised as to the breakfast 
174596,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, This hotel could not be better located You can walk to the Rodin Louvre and Orsay museums and Luxembourg Gardens Bus 69 in both directions is a one minute walk Also within a minute s walk is the Rue de Bac metro and a taxi stand If you are lucky enough to be on the 7th floor with a view of Sacre Coeur and you are over 6 feet tall you might hit your head in the shower This was not a problem for us The people at the front desk are most pleasant and helpful I would definitely choose this hotel again 
174597,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, The room was a bit smaller than I expected with the 20 sq m but maybe just the layout of the building that makes it seems so small The metro line 12 Rue du bac station is not quite a popular line we have to transit to other stops to our destination , The bed was very comfortable the bathroom is super clean with the towels changed everyday The staff is friendly and helpful The location is near Des Gateaux et Du Pain my favorite pastry shop It locates right next to Rue du Bac Station so it is very convenient 
174598,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, The bed frame cracked on our last night so my husband ended up sleeping on the floor There were no other rooms available It was unfortunate The manager apologized and offered a discount when we are next in Paris As it turns out we were returning 4 days later The discount was not really a discount Cheaper rates on line so we stuck with our other reservation, Superb location friendly and helpful staff
174599,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, The bathroom is small and the room equipment is acceptable, The location is excellent for museums visits and shopping area The hotel is quiet good and the personal is very friendly 
174600,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Again we had an attic room so it was a little cramped The room carpets were old they warranted being replaced Inconsistent attitude from reception staff Mostly good service at the end of the day though , It was great to have a breakfast available on site as well as room service and a wee bar Great lobby and welcoming atmosphere authentic staff not in your face Quiet room calm hotel 
174601,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Room was small as per most affordable rooms in Europe Could not regulateA C temperature to our liking Bed was adequate but not overly spacious or comfortable , Hotel staff were friendly and very attentitve to all requests They made an average hotel better 
174602,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Huge let down on the rooms Felt like a hostel Rooms smelled a bit and heating didn t work Beds were too soft almost sinking in Two singles instead of one double Interior architecture poor as could hardly stand up on one side of the bed , Beautiful exterior and lovely staff
174603,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Rooms are dated and don t resemble pictures asked if we could check out 30 mins after time to which the manager appeared unsatisfied with the request and said that would be 25 euros extra Breakfast was quite good I wouldnt say amazing but was satisfying , Rainfall style shower was refreshing
174604,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, The area around the bar was understandably small cramp , I had the Executive Room which by Paris standards was good size with a full length couch in the sitting area 
174605,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Internet was unusable it s either very slow or not working at all There s no room service menu you have to go down to the reception to order room service The rooms are clean but the cleaning could be better , Excellent location Metro and bus stops are less than a minute away Nice big rooms Very helpful staff 
174606,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, I was hoping for a room on a higher floor preferably with a view of the city I requested this and was told I had already been allocated an executive room upgrade as I have stayed at K K hotels on a number of occasions The room did have a balcony and well appointed Although the breakfast choice was good it was not to the same high standard of other K K hotels I have stayed at , Comfortable quiet room on the 2nd floor with a balcony The breakfast selection was good 
174607,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, When ordering a drink at the bar there are no staff to serve you We had to wait nearly 1 hour passed our check in time to get the keys to our room So you have to wait and keep checking with the reception to see when your room is ready Not a good start to your holiday ,No Positive
174608,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, There could have been complimentary bottled water provided in the room 3 for a tiny mini bar bottle of water is a little much especially on Easter Sunday when no shops were open , The view of the Paris rooftops was lovely bed was comfy and the breakfast was delicious The staff were also extremely polite and helpful 
174609,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, Lovely hotel in a beautiful district of Paris close to wonderful museums and metro very comfortable beds and very quiet despite being on a busy road Helpful friendly staff 
174610,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Nothing really too bothering everything was really standard Paris 4 star Go for the Deluxe room if you can since it was ok size others are smaller A bit of morning traffic noise coming from the street 2nd floor facing Boulevard Raspail , Great location clean rooms Perfectly situated to explore the most popular of Paris sights 
174611,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Could do with better quality shampoos in the bathroom , Beds pillows were very comfy so slept well We stayed on the 4th floor and booked 2 double rooms rooms which were next to each other Reasonably quiet even though we were at the front of the hotel facing the road Loved being able to open the windows to let the fresh air in Reception staff were very helpful with any tourist information Excellent location near to all the major sites which we walked to or used the Batobus to get up down the Seine Only the Sacre Coeur needed a taxi journey Location is one of the most important points for me and this hotel scores highly for that Nice clean characterful neighbourhood with lots of cafes bakeries small shops etc Travelled around quite a lot and were very happy with this area on our 1st trip to Paris Would stay here again 
174612,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, Staff were very polite and freindly That s as far as it goes I was made to wait 35 minutes for an iron for me to then call back to reception and for them to tell me they didn t have one spare not call to advise me very bad service 
174613,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, The beds were itchy the hot water for the shower was limited and kept changing hot cold Elevator takes ages to reach Hotel is dated and to us it was a 3 stars , The staff was nice
174614,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, The staff forgot to give us a wake up call Could ve beeen a disaster but luckily I set up my own alarm , Hotel was fantastic and everything was great the staff was very helpful as well in terms of guiding us where to find the right restaurant for what we were looking for 
174615,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, The room for 3 was a bit cramped and the extra bed was uncomfortably hard It could be the location of our room corner with a triangular bath Fitness center had a few excerpt de machines which would be adequate but there was no additional ventilation which made it quite warm quickly , The hotel was centrally located with easy access to all major sites The metro Rue du Bac stop is across the street which made travel from CDG navigatable although 2changed are required Hotel amenities included bathrobes and slippers Appreciated the late hours for the cafe which offered excellent crepes 
174616,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Access from the airport or Quartier Latin direction with public transport requires multiple subway changes or 500 m walk from St Germain de Pres station There was quite a lot of noise from the street in wee hours of Saturday but not other days There was a strange smell in the room which turned out to originate from minibar fridge the door of which was left ajar There was no credit card sized key card instead a 15 x 5 x 1 cm slab which was left at the reception Room cleaning does not take place during single pass so do not disturb sign outside is a must if you re inside , Efficient service at reception desk Room okay but nothing fancy probably OK for business traveller Location very good for walking 
174617,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Although they say this is a prime area and you find yourself in the middle of trendy shops and buildings I would suggest stay in an arr closer to the tourist spots especially if you re short on time I would probably pick Opera side next time unless I am doing a longer leisure trip Internet was a little inconsistent in the rooms No complains with the Hotel though overall , The staff was extremely friendly and helpful Accommodating and courteous at all times Pretty clinical with their laundry service as well 
174618,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Room was a bit small but completely functional , The breakfast is delicious and excellent service Glad we included it in our room purchase Great value and makes traveling much easier 
174619,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, The location was perfect basically 20 min walking distance from every sight in Paris Staff is friendly and helpful all speak English Great stay id definitely book again
174620,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, The second day of our stay the room wasn t cleaned I was very surprised due to the hotel value the room get cleaned after calling the reception the team who clean was not very competent, The Hotel location very close from all attraction as Louvre museum Orsay Museum Eiffel tower Cathedral Notre Dame Seine river Hotel access and staff helpful
174621,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, Perfect location just in centre of Saint Germain de Pres one of my favourite districts in Paris Metro station and also Velib bike rental station were right in the front of the hotel but basically you can walk from this location almost everywhere Hotel room was very classical but everything was nice and really clean 
174622,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Nothing, Staff were friendly and Very helpful Refered us to a fabulous restaurant nearby You leave your room key at reception when you leave the hotel on our return staff recognise us immediately without us having to say which room we were in Take sometime to look for restaurants that the local business men use Much better than the hundreds of generic cafes that serve the same everywhere We found great food and the waiters more than happy to help us with the menu 
174623,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Very slow wi fi at time non existent Even after I complained and they put a router in my room it was still rather poor Average room cleaning there was dust left on the furniture etc , Location is superb otherwise the hotel is ok but not outstanding 
174624,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, We had a few issues with the cleaning staff but resolved in the end , I liked the warm staff and calm feeling of the hotel It was a great location for setting out on our days adventures walking or metro 
174625,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, All was ok, The staff is good hotel has very good standards cleaning and location Location walking distance to many museums less than 1km from the saint germain market I got a room with internal view and was very quiet nothing to complain Very good cost bennefit
174626,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Asked for late checkout and didnt get an answer then got a yes but had to pay 25 euros by noon they called to say sorry you have to leave in 1h knowing that i had a sick dog and an appointment next to the hotel , Location staff 
174627,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Nothing, When I arrived early in the morning from a very long series of flights from Zimbabwe I was bone tired and dirty I had a 24 hour layover in Paris before I had to board my final leg to the US At first they said they had no rooms available and I would have to wait five hours before I could get my reserved room Needless to say I was upset However those lovely people managed to find me a room within a half hour allowing me the sleep and shower I craved I am very grateful and would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for great service and polite and kind staff I can t thank them enough 
174628,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, the bathroom was a bit small though corresponding to the picture deluxe room , the position is nice not far from the Seine and several bistrots Facing rue de bac underground station 
174629,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, We had a quiet room with a fantastic view in the side street Room size very pleasing especially for Paris standards Deluxe room Very good quality breakfast buffet with a lot of choice great service Friendly staff very accommodating Walking distance to Louvre Musee Rodin St Germain des Pres etc Highly recommended

174633,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Room too hot Didn t clean our room by our return first day so had to sit in lounge for half hour Go, Staff very helpful Clean and modern Very close to Metro
174634,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, The hotel just didn t wow us Everything about it is fine but it just wasn t special Rooms are small which you do expect in a capital city The staff were hit and miss in terms of service Some the man who took our bags for example were friendly and welcoming others seemed like they didn t want to be there It was quite inconsistent The water in the sink didn t drain well which was a bit unpleasant when cleaning our teeth We couldn t check in on time which wasn t a big issue but there was no apology It felt like certain things had been really well thought through e g nice looking showers however bad drainage and low pressure just meant the execution wasn t quite there Nothing majorly wrong just lots of little things that could be easily improved Reasonable for the price , The location is fantastic and it s a short walk to the centre of St Germain and also to the river You can walk down the river to the Eiffel Tower It felt like a nice area at all times of the day The hotel itself had a good breakfast with a good selection and felt fresh It had a great selection of healthy options Breakfast staff were good Nice interior decor in the reception area with magazines The mattress was comfy and the room was fine

174653,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, One of the electricians who the hotel hired to fix or just generally maintain the elevator deliberately attempted to run me over with his car several times just a few steps outside the hotel front entrance while walking onto the sidewalk the electrician swerved into me and I was forced to literally jump out of the sidewalk and into the street to avoid being run over by him He then reversed for a second before trying to swerve directly into me causing me to have to jump even further in the road All while he still stares directly into my eyes with a grin on his face he continues to swerve into me for a THIRD time however this time I was more agile and managed to jump back onto the sidewalk so my mother who was forced to stand by and watch her son dodge several murderous attempts on her son and I could surround his car like vultures so we could confront him He then stepped out of my car and my mother asked him why he just tried to run me over he responded with a laugh followed by Sorry I don t speak English with no accent whatsoever He then nonchalantly strolled into this hotel to check in with the front desk to work on the elevator He did not except that we were guests at this hotel because when we followed behind him into the hotel the grin he was so proudly wearing seemed to disappear My mother and I then went to the front desk and asked him yet again why he made an attempt on my life he responded by telling us once again he did not speak English Both my mother and I were so aghast as to what had just happened we wanted to simply go into our room to collect our thoughts before talking to the hotel staff about what just happened so before going up to our room my mother said to one of the front desk members Don t worry we ll let you know how he just tried to run over my son shortly We then continued up to our room , This hotel is beautiful and the location even more so located in the 7th arr it is around a 7 minute walk to The Louvre a quick 9 taxi ride to the Latin quarter as well as accompanied by many quaint boutiques and cafes which surround the hotel The hotel staff including the cleaning personal who were always sure to warmly welcome my mother and I are incredibly polite and attentive minus one front desk staff member 
174654,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, The staff were very efficient but very friendly especially helpful when my daughter sprained an ankle providing an ice pack and support bandage at 10pm The breakfast service was good with a varied choice of food representing good value for money 
174655,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Our room was a little small and slightly dated for the price we paid Said this it was really clean and still comfy , Amazing location nearby the main Paris life 
174656,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, at closing time breakfast they were so fast taking out the food they could have waited for the 2 3 persons in the room to at least finish taking their breakfast, great location good area on the bedroom
174657,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, The front staff were absolutely horrible they should really learn customer service and smile more often Nobody smiled or was helpful , Location was very good the people in the breakfast are we re really helpful and friendly

174659,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Everything was perfect, The hotel offers great service and we found it to be value for money It is clean comfortable and the rooms are a decent size for a city hotel The location is excellent and the restaurants around it are first class Walking distance to the Seine and a metro station Rue du Bac outside 
174660,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Location was great but also on a noisy street Teapot for tea coffee lacking in room Could hear people walking about upstairs from my room , Metro stop right out the front door Shops restaurants right outside and a short walk to Museum d Orsay Comfortable bed Very helpful and friendly staff Nice breakfast 
174661,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Room was a little too small and when we first arrived we were put in a room in another building with an elevator that was used for housekeeping They kept stopping the elevator and it was awful as was the view It felt like we were stuck in an awful room especially for the money , The staff was wonderful and when we were not happy with our room they were very accommodating 
174662,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, The doors to the hotel rooms slam shut so it can get pretty noisy in the morning if you try to sleep in , We had a great stay The hotel room was modern and cozy with nicely designed spaces The room had everything we needed including an extremely comfortable bed a refrigerator and hot water boiler Though we didn t spent too much time in our hotel room given the fantastic location we enjoyed having a very comfortable room to come back to at the end of the day 
174663,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Booking charged me like 2 days before and hotel charged me the second time after check out They said that money would be returned however 1week later still no money returned So be careful significant amount would be blocked for a long time Hope that they will return them at least over next 30 days, Location is really good I arrived late so it was really good that nearby restoran was still open 
174664,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, The staff was disorganised during check in and at times even rude Request for rooms on the same floor was met with a flat non without even offering to look at whether this could be facilitated during part of the stay The double rooms are too small and are too expensive for their size especially as breakfast is not included in the price , The rooms and bathrooms were clean One of staff was helpful during check out Location is good 
174665,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Nothing to complain about A very good city hotel , Very central location close to the main sights of Paris and just across the road from the Metro Good level of comfort very good breakfast buffet friendly staff 
174666,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, The conciergerie has been extremely unpleasant and upon arrival had denied to have agreed upon early access to the room They have been in general unhelpful and rather unpolite in their tones The room was small the furniture old and overall very different from the pictures on booking com, The position is the plus of this hotel The fa ade is well maintained and it gives a good impression 
174667,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, A bit of an issue with the cab we ordered Several folks traveling to train station together I had arranged for the cab the day before I feel the morning staff the day of our departure forgot to order the cab made the connection a bit tight , Very Nice Place well decorated very attractive Bar a bit small but the breakfast dining area very nice and comfortable Breakfast just average for the compared to others we have experienced 
174668,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Front staff manager was rude we were put in a room on the top floor without a view which is fine however they knew there wasn t air conditioning on the top floor and of course didn t mention that Our room was also next to a very noisy elevator shaft that sounded like the building was collapsing everytime someone used it , The location was great 
174669,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Lack of an apology from the receptionist who gave me an occupied room Lack of large plates for a decent sized breakfast and lack of minibar contents , Good room 
174670,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, The wifi was truly terrible The pillows were so flat they were useless The bar is also useless because there wasn t anyone there I guess finding the bartender is your exercise amuse bouche Just be prepared to find him each step of the way in between drinks if you need anything else if you want the check We were put in room 708 first and had to request a move from a very irritated and put out guy at the reception desk because it was right next to the service elevator and the constant ker thunk noise was unbearable Avoid room 708 The second room they put us in had a spider the size of a man s fist in the bathroom sink and a couple of small bugs I found on the bed cover So Yay for that We stayed two nights and while we were out the second day after we came back at 4 pm the room wasn t cleaned at all Overall the service and facilities are pretty bad for what was supposed to be a good hotel , The location is pretty good There are some adorable shopping streets nearby 
174671,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Breakfast was great but a bit expensive , Excellent location in the most beautiful part of Paris Virtually next to the metro station A 5 min walk to the Seine just across the Louvre 
174672,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Staff at check in unfriendly and not apologetic when our room wasn t ready well passed check in time Ricardo at the bar was never there We had to get reception to find him when we wanted more drinks When he did come slowly back he was very unfriendly , Great location decent sized rooms Lacks character but has everything you need 
174673,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, ROOM 220 NICE LARGE ROOM LARGE BATHROOM BUT SHOWER NOT PROPERLY DESIGNED INSTEAD OF SHOWER CURTAIN SHOULD HAVE GLASS DOOR DURING SHOWERS ALL THE FLOOR IN THE BATHROOM WAS FLOODED , NICE LARGE ROOM QUIET CLOSE TO LIFT

174676,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Would have liked a special shuttle deal for the airport grouping guests rather than pay individual taxis , Room wasn t too small comfy and breakfast was of good quality Great location 
174677,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, The wifi in the bedroom was impossibly slow to the point of being non existent It worked better downstairs in the reception area , The staff were helpful and cheerful Our bedroom was on the back overlooking a small but well maintained courtyard It was perfectly silent at night 
174678,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Note Must hand in keys when leaving the hotel but there is always someone at the desk 24 7 Make sure you put the Do not disturb sign or else the cleaning staff will come in Limited outlet plugs Not sure why there s a small desk but no outlets Internet Connection Lan is right beside the bed , Manual chain lock on door made me feel safer as a solo female traveler Internet speed generally very good Good enough for internet calling but some connectivity breakups for video conferencing Free internet computer printing services Soundproof rooms Metro Station Rue de Bac is literally across the street
174679,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, The room was really small for my taste the bathroom also very very small the good part was that I had balcony but the furniture is oldish some spidernet on the ceiling the elevator really really tired the carpet was full of dust the sink clogged the bathtub was also old and oldfashioned i wouldn t call it a 4 star hotel but maybe in France the standards are different and the TV selection was very poor not even one music chanel i didn t feel comfortable but the beauty of Paris compensates , Pretty close to the city center comfy bed very nice staff 
174680,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, the bed was too soft for my ailing back I would also have like a more comfortable chair to watch TV but the room was rather small , the location was perfect for us close to a metro giving access to all parts of Paris The room was well noise insulated and generally quite comfortable 
174681,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, Perfect location walking distance to fmaous places in the centre of Paris We had a very nice room in the 7th floor which was with great window view including Mont Martre Georgeous breakfast 
174682,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, My only bedroom window was opening on a tiny courtyard without view somewhat claustrophobic The breakfast was OK but no more Some of the staff was really helpful some of the staff was definitely unconcerned, Good location and sufficient comfort 
174683,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, room a little on the small side but to be expected in Paris Decor still ok but starting to look tired and could do with an update, value for money central location but not noisy friendly staff clean

174688,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, For a 4 star hotel the bed could be more comfortable Also for the most sensitive person the vibration and sound coming from the subway train may be an issue It s very low and stops during the night until early morning but it s still noticeable , Perfect location friendly staff 
174689,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Mini bar had been used before our arrival pointed this out to reception who sent someone to check was half replenished 3 days into our trip mini bar was emptied without comment or consultation with us again onus was on us to contact reception so as not to be charged , Lovely friendly staff right beside metro nice restaurants close by comfortable beds

174691,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, Each of the front desk staff were amazingly polite and helpful Two gentlemen Messieurs Dennis One worked in the AM the other PM were especially so Each day they added value to our stay or with their advice as concierges 
174692,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, The breakfast was a bit chaotic various food kept running out and was not always replaced eg fruit salad eggs bacon However it was a busy holiday weekend The bathroom was tiny and the bath difficult to get out of very slippery Also a bit confused by the charge for the accommodation which seemed to vary from night to night when we were billed , The location is superb really close to the rue de bac metro station numerous restaurants shops and attractions close by The beds are very comfortable and our room was relatively spacious Reception staff were friendly and helpful 
174693,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, In our room we noticed that the smoke alarm detector looked a bit funny but nothing out of the ordainary may have just been because we was in France We didn t let the maid in for the first couple of days and after the one day we did ask for our room to be made up our smoke detector was REMOVED and not replaced just left empty this is concerning for a young couple in a hotel room and on top of this if there was a fire we was have had no smoke fire detector in our room putting us at a much higher risk of damage risk NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PLEASE CONTACT THE HOTEL ON MY BEHALF AND GET BACK TO ME WHY THIS HAPPENED , Hotel was in a fantastic location staff were friendly and helpful and spoke English which was very handy however they were understanding when I tried to speak French and helped me with the language 
174694,K K H tel Cayr Saint Germain des Pr s, Nothing We d go back , This hotel is in a good location for great restaurants and if you don t mind a walk everything you might want to see on a short stay is reachable on foot The rooms are well appointed and although small who needs a big room when you are out and about all day The staff are helpful it s and bright and the breakfasts are very good
