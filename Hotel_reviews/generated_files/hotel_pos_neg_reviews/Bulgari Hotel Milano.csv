485940,Bulgari Hotel Milano, One of the pillow stint Though the bed pillow and blanket are extremely comfortable The modern design is excellent but the material is too cheap to last and show ages The restaurant serve ok food but not to grommet level Better go marches in the main shopping street or four season for food Local small shop euro 1 4 coffee will do The breakfast tea was served in a large kitchen style steel pot very cheap The tea is way not as good as it s London hotel Though the free ice fruit tea in lobby and Asian tea in spa are very good This shows the restaurant do not match the quality of its lounge and spa The porter is too lazy to take two trip for large number of luggages and they don t use cart This is semi exceptable but do not match the level of hotel is supposed to be Of course I am comparing with top level hotels Even for average 5 star this is an excellent hotel I am just grading this with the real top hotel , Friendly and helpful staff design facility location The soap and shower gel are way much better than other hotels serving their brand of shampoo The shower facility is very comfortable The spa is small but functional Tranquil The pool is comfortable if less than three people using it Nice design and coloring The jacuzzi has three type of jet Even it s a home grade plastic pool it s extremely comfortable than many marble pool with steel bench The water may not be as clean as commercial grade jacuzzi
