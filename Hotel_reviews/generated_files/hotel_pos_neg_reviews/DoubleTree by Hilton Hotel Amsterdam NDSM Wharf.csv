383713,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Cleaning wasn t as good as usual Blood stain left on the bathroom floor from somewhere Server at restaurant was uninformed about menu , Extra attention when calling front desk Check in Check out very efficient and friendly 
383714,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf,No Negative, Nice personal touches great Hilton honours room great for business very professional staff only minor criticism would be for more urgency from the waiting staff in the restaurant
383715,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Nothing adverse in the location or the facilities The hotel facilities were superb , The croissants were indeed very flaky The breakfast was excellent with a great variety and lots of choice We didn t dine in the restaurant but the menu looked quite good The location took a little getting used to but the ferry to and from Amsterdam centre was a pleasure to use We would certainly use this hotel again when I n Amsterdam 
383716,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf,No Negative, We had a really nice time The hotel is clean the staff is really friendly and the view is amazing Really easy to get to the city centre just 10 mins with the ferry There is nice bars around and we would be happy to come back again on our next visit to Amsterdam 
383717,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Rooms are a bit small and walls a bit thin Washbasin design looks chic but isn t very practical , Great location Very friendly and helpful staff Excellent breakfast buffet Good lunch and dinner offers Functional rooms Convenient parking 
383718,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, I ve booked a room without a view 3rd floor and you have to take that literally There were two big windows which overlook a black roof and take away the whole light In the corner there s a smaller window with a good view So I would never book a room on this floor anymore , Nice upcoming area a lot of parking space in the surroundings Easy to get to the city center by free ferry bicycles and pedestrians Spacious rooms with breakfast buffet 
383719,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Ceiling unfinished not painted Tv too high for comfortable viewing Location poor Cannot compare to the other Doubletree hotel in Amsterdam central, Big windows
383720,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Our room took seemingly forever to be ready for us We arrived at about 0830 due to a flight that arrived at 0600 and were told that our room was not ready but would be given a priority for us to check in However it wasn t ready when we returned to the hotel at about 1445 and it took until 1620 for us to finally get into the room more than one hour past normal check in time of 1500 , Traditional European and English breakfast with made to order omelettes 
383721,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, There are 2 hotels with the same name fairly close to each other which caused some confusion , Lovely room beautiful bathroom comfortable bed and awesome aircon perfect for the heatwave 
383722,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, check in check out took some time we made a reservation for 3 rooms under 1 name and was confusing for checking in and billing , Great view over the city Nice modern rooms Bathroom experience was great looking over the city when taken a shower Great vibrant location NDSM wharf is great in summer Baby sitter service was great
383723,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The sink the the bathroom so difficult to put water into the kettle Also if i can borrow a phone charger it will be great , The breakfast was really good So many locally sourced food 
383724,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, It s not that I didn t like it but unfortunately from the outside is not easy to find the entrance because I believe they re doing some construction work I hope it will look beautiful outside as the inside is soon , The staff was super friendly It was also motherday and we found a rose on the bed It was very sweet Enormous comfy mattress and amazing view I ll defenitely go back soon
383725,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf,No Negative, Nice hotel at the other side of the centre but easy to cross by ferry I preferred this hotel because I know from experience that this side of Amsterdam is more quiet than the other side where the train station is located 
383726,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf,No Negative, The floor to ceiling wall to wall window gives a view to the river you can t believe The stuff is especially truly kind and helpful It seemed like natural kindness and that was very surprising to me 
383727,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The loud rave held less than 200m from my room until 2am venue pictured I could hear the music over my headphones it was that loud Almost all the rooms face the venue and all have minimal soundproofing Dont believe their lies about it being a one off a full schedule of events takes place regularly , Not much
383728,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The room I was in was like a prison cell Room 103 A little horizontal window at the top of the wall which you only get a little bit of natural light through The room was very dark lights were too dull , Brooklyn restaurant was great Build your own burgers Top marks for that 
383729,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Significant shortage of English breakfast tea , Unbelievable views across the river The ferry ride The quiet laid back location Pllet Good breakfast 
383730,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Firstly only booked this hotel because I thought it was the DoubleTree at Amsterdam Central Next I had to take a 15 minute ferry ride to this place it should be renamed to avoid this error that many other tourists have fell prey to It is not up to the Hilton standards that is for sure Lucky they kicked in a free breakfast as this place sits in an abandoned shipping yard The surroundings are not the nicest by any standard ,No Positive
383731,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Pretty much everything Room was hot and bright Sound proof was bad The design for room is totally wrong for a hotel Air condition not working properly Lights are bad Name it all , the ONLY thing I like bout this hotel was Kevin at the front desk He s amazing Made my day Friendly welcoming and very helpful After a long day travelling plus journey to the hotel was exhausting but Kevin was so attentive and approachable it helps a lot Thank you Keep it up 
383732,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The staff was just plain and didn t welcome us properly We arrived before of the check in and I ve emailed before to ask if it was possible to keep our bags they said yes but for my surprise they didn t take it to our bedroom not that I am old or I can t take my own bags but for the price of 539euros I would expect that since I had paid much less and the hotel have done it The staff didn t take us to the room didn t show how the facilities work besides of the elevator we had to call reception to ask what was the wifi password The bathroom was too hot the room had a tv but the remote were nowhere the bed was bad and the breakfast was plain lack of options and the room was not properly clean since we found some papers from the previous guest in the closet I think for the price I ve paid I was expecting something better I won t return there , It had free wifi
383733,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Nothing really I had a wonderful experience in this hotel , The hotel lobby was welcoming and calming after a flight and taxi ride that s always welcoming The sign in at the front desk was simple and rewarding I was rewarded for presenting my Hilton Honours membership which was a lovely addition The room was very clean and had lovely glass floor to ceiling walls nice touch There is wifi in the room and all necessary facilities available nothing missing and everything very clean There is a restaurant which is lovely food smells and tastes amazing and a bar I didn t venture in as I was pretty tired which looks fantastic In the morning the breakfast is welcoming and tasty the members of staff are very helpful and can help you with what to have there s a large choice of quality food Great hotel and members of staff will certainly be returning 
383734,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, If there is on thing then it is the price which was quite high but I paid and didn t regret, The location of the hotel is super cool wonderful view across the harbor towards downtown Central Station etc nice bathroom perfect bed I slept really well 
383735,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Bathroom was not so clean The access to city center is via ferry which is frequent and free however ferries work until 12 00 pm, Silent comfortable good designed room
383736,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The ferry times The last one was at 11 45pm and getting to the hotel after that would be difficult because you have to take a ferry to another stop and call a taxi from there However I didn t have a data plan so I wouldn t have been able to call a taxi to the hotel , The free cookie upon check in 
383737,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, We were confused by two hotels double tree by Hilton central and double tree by Hilton NDSM WARF They run separate hotels even though it s the same name We wanted them to transfer our booking but they said no which was disappointing , View
383738,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Housekeeping was terrible not fixing issues even after it was reported Cleaning was poor Access by ferry was not very convenient , Front office was great and comped us breakfast as an apology for housekeeping failure
383739,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, There was no dinner menu on Saturday as the Chef apparently had a busy lunch service and was not able to prep for the evening menu pathetic for a major hotel chain only light snacks were available Breakfasts were busy but a lack of staff and one morning running out of simple things such as butter The sink in our bathroom was some quirky sloping modern affair totally impractical for normal use such as having a wet shave etc No bath just a walk in shower with low water pressure The car park has no security cameras and no warning your vehicle could be at risk and is simply an area with a 25cm high fence and a barrier which is basically pointless My car was broken into during my stay causing hundreds of pounds worth of damage , Bed was comfortable and the room was clean
383740,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Totally in unfinished and unwelcome precence Some of the staff have unprofessional attitude , Very mis leading information about location of hotel Had to stand in the rain waiting for ferry boat to go to hotel People should know this prior to booking I would never recommend or return to this hotel
383741,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, breakfast was a mess tables not cleaned no enough plates clear lack of staff Cleaning team did not clean the room even with clean up sign on , the design the view
383742,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Nothing exceeded expectations, This hotel was amazing Excellent location free boat and view in the room was gorgeous Warm cookie on arrival was to die for 
383743,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, We were there at time of techno music festival Room was overlooking site and quite unpleasant level of noise Was provided with earplugs at checkin Would have chosen different hotel if advised when booking ,No Positive
383744,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, A lack of amenities shops in the immediate area although there are a couple of bars a restaurant which looked good and a coffee shop one that sells coffee that is , The hotel has a quirky feel The location in itself is a little industrial but easy access to Central Station on a free ferry means it s an oasis of calm in a mad city Breakfast was good 
383745,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Too far from attractions Had to use ferry to travel to city centre Very noisy due to music festival taking place outside the hotel Hotel actually supplied us with ear plugs Didn t know about the festival at time of booking A lot of noise from adjoining rooms Had to call reception about the party in the room next door at 1 o clock in the morning eventually quietened down , Staff were very helpful Good breakfast 
383746,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The price went up because the weekend was busy , Nice beds quiet rooms great showers loved in room refrigerators coffee makers Very great hotel will come back Food was great too Nice breakfast buffet Close to ferry Helpful hotel staff They held our luggage 
383747,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, There was a pile of dirty plates and glasses by the lift when we arrived at 16 00 and they were still there when we left at 10 00 the next day That was not good The run down industrial location was not the best especially for the price of the hotel , Room was very comfortable and we were given a free upgrade Superb views Good position for what we wanted Quiet Breakfast was good and staff helpful They made us feel welcome 
383748,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Unfortunately our room was poorly heated we did not bothered to check if this was a circumstantial problem , The hotel and the room were really impeccable In addition to that we immensely enjoyed the glass walls with the view to the wharf
383749,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, As a regular Hilton hotel user there was no lounge and very limited facilities as the hotel was small but it wasn t a massive downside , Great view from the room over the dock area Easy access into central Amsterdam
383750,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, I don t think it was made clear that you had to get a ferry to and from the hotel Although the ferry was free it made you restricted to certain times and you had to plan more Also I thought the room was a bit too dark even with lights on , The room felt luxurious and the shower was great Enjoyed the restaurant joined on to the hotel as well 
383751,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Check in was not fast We waited till almost 4 45pm 5pm before our room was ready Check in was supposed to be 3pm Kind of wasted half a day sitting at e lobby since we reach there around 1pm , Good breakfast
383752,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Giving people a cookie when they check in does not equal good customer service The check in staff weren t particularly friendly or helpful for example they watched me struggle a luggage trolley through a ridiculous revolving door without offering to help they never offered to help with the luggage either To describe the surroundings diagonally opposite the hotel was Sexyland and kids on scooters were messing about in the car park They mistakenly wanted to charge us for breakfast but dealt with this okay when shown the booking reservation which included breakfast , The room was spacious and well designed with helpful gadgets The breakfast was great In room coffee was lovely 
383753,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Upon arrival you have to pay a 100 euro holding fee on a debit or credit card which I was aware of before we arrived I handed over the card and when we left I was given a receipt to say that I would be getting the money back When I arrived home I found out that they also taken another 3 payments from my card for 85 96 each Luckily I contacted the bank and they refunded me for the transactions as I had not agreed for this money to be taken These payments were taken by a Brooklyn Hotel which I found out was the name of the hotel before it went to being a Hilton So beware when handing over your card that they aren t actually taking more money than what they should be I paid the balance for the room in cash so they had no reason to take additional money other than the deposit , Lovely hotel 
383754,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Room was extremely cold inside You need to safe money but it took 1 hour to warm up to 21 C Bathroom was big and nice but extremely cold Surrandings is not pleasing me much empty big parking constructions but next to ferry station club sexyland and marina with fency restaurant , Nice design Big glass windows I got extraoridanery corner room with splendid view on Amsterdam Good bad this is good standard in Hilton s hotels Room sims to be quiet although there waren t many guests Restaurant was okay as well as free wifi Nice design of interior Good price to compare with double tree by Hilton in the center free ferry from Central Station every half Of hour except between 11 pm and 6 am 
383755,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The hotel was directly next to a questionable building called Sexyland which was our immediate view and every night we could faintly hear club music , The staff were extremely friendly and helpful from the moment we were greeted with a warm chocolate cookie they couldn t do enough for us The room was very smart and cosy The shower was amazing The bed was comfy The television also had a good range of channels including English channels but subtitles were available for others The use of windows instead of walls made the room feel slightly bigger and provided a few different views for us Every day staff cleaned the room and provided fresh water bottles and towels The hotel was extremely close to the ferry stop which was very handy for visiting Amsterdam Central and close by to a lovely cafe 
383756,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, the metal grille over the window ruined the view totally, amazing bed stylish rooms and hotel location is not in city centre Centrum and is actually acoss the river from the main shopping tourist and other attractions A free ferry across is just 3 minutes walk from the hotel and the ferry is about 10 minutes so Centrum is easily accessible The ferry runs all night So location was not really a problem and also being in an area with no other buildings meant you can get a very very quiet night s sleep 
383757,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, I was a bit bothered that the wall panel touch screen for the lights could never really turn off and so there was always light in the room , The rooms were lovely and the place has fabulous decor Very pleased and would certainly visit again 
383758,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Only downside was that my room was not cleaned on my second day I had been out from 10am and returned around 5pm Excuse was it was busy After complainting 3 staff members tried to clean but I was in for a few hours could only get towels, Staff were extremely friendly and helpful Location was fantastic ferry had beautiful views of the harbour 
383759,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, I was booking 20 m2 deluxe room but they didn t give us the room They give us normal room it was not nice Hotel room and picture was different I never ever go again DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam ndsm Wharf Very bad and laid to us , Nothing to like 
383760,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The location was not what i expected Right outside multiple carparks staff were rubbish room service crap had to ask for toilet paper was charged for an adaptor Was told guranteed river view but all i could see was a carpark , Nothing
383761,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, the location only 1 mile from city centre by ferry twice an hour no bus only expensive taxis the restaurant very very limited menu the cleaning not done at all one day the room size and design rabbits do better in a hutch The attitude of some staff and the fact that it is not made clear there is another Double Tree hotel which is far more convenient near the Railway Station , not much the view 
383762,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, We stayed in this hotel a couple of times before it was owned or at least branded by Hilton when it was less than half the price it is now I know Amsterdam is expensive but this hotel is not good value for money Beware if you re trying to impress a new partner with a fancy hotel there is no soundproofing between the toilet and bedroom , I do like the concrete ceiling and the views 
383763,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Room was on 1st floor in back by a parking lot Had to keep curtains closed By employee exit door which closed hard and woke us up Could hear carts entering door slamming and people talking during the night hours Unfortunately the hotel was booked so even though staying two nights they were unable to move to another room , The hotel location enjoyable to ride the ferry and see a different part of town The room was large well decorated and restaurant restaurant staff where pleasant and service good Warm cookie at check in 
383764,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Breakfast could have been on longer and bar open longer , Staff were extremely friendly and helpful Free warm cookies on arrival and exit Excellent food at resteraunt Good facilities and prime location only a short ferry ride free directly to and from centre 
383765,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf,No Negative, The hotel was clean and modern with great views from floor to ceiling Free ferry crossing was a bonus local markets nearby selling hot chocolate and mulled wine Hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating to our group in particular to cater for about allergy Fresh warm cookies baked fresh on site were given in the morning and evenings Would definitely return to this hotel 
383766,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, lack of drinking water in the room there were 2 bottles upon arrival , very clean hotel amazing atmosphere very kind staff excellent tea coffee facilities in the room we have loved the bathroom and the view But there was one person that made our stay special Her name is Santana and she was working in the restaurant Her warmth made us feel like home That is your real diamond 
383767,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, It s a little out if town but team gets you into town in 20 mins, The place was quite enough to get a solid night sleep Room is soooo clean n lovely Breakfast is amazing esp the omelettes
383768,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The ceiling I feel it needs to be papered or painted made the room feel unfinished and cold The last ferry being at 11 45 we felt we had a curfew on our night because taxis were expensive Needed to plan what time we left to make sure that we made the ferry or there was a half an hour wait in the rain , The room was very comfortable and staff were very helpful and friendly 
383769,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, We went to the other Double Tree Hilton hotel by Central station by mistake we were directed to the correct location Advised to get the ferry and then it was a hop and a jump away We were not told that there are two ferries running so we got the wrong one it took us 1hr 30 mins to find and get to the hotel this involved walking through industrial sites and building sites I was not impressed especially when we got to the hotel and right outside is the ferry terminal Other than that we had a great time , Breakfast was very good The room was comfortable and clean 
383770,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Price in bar 8 50 for a pint having to wait and get ferry to main city centre in the cold Rooms dark with poor lighting after dark , Extra comfy bed good shower 
383771,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, A sheltered outdoor smoking area would have been nice, Great rooms especially shower room en suite very comfortable lounge and bar Excellent location 1 stop on the ferry from Central Station 10 min ride which actually improved the whole experience Would definitely revisit 
383772,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Two single mattress instead of a double Not a big variety breakfast for the price Prices of the hotel and location No sky lounge Everything close after 22 00 Very noisy in the mornings,No Positive
383773,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The location could be better but it s obviously not the hotel s fault Would get tired of taking a ferry to city and back But overall it s not too bad about 10 15 min ferry ride Ferry rides every 30 mins , The hotel is pretty clean they also let us check in a little bit earlier which is nice The sheets and bed were good staff is helpful 
383774,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The hotel is so isolated with no other facilities for eating and drinking and coming across on the ferry late was not an option for me The restaurant menu was rather limited A, The staff were extremely friendly and the room comfy The breakfast was very good 
383775,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf,No Negative, I have rarely encountered such friendly cheerful and helpful reception staff They were all so nice Great location for Amsterdam Marina and just by the ferry landing Ferry ride from Amsterdam Central Station every half hour 10 minute journey and no ticket needed it s free Nice restaurant good breakfast brasserie type lunch and dinner 
383776,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Nothing everything was perfect, Great central location big room quiet excellent staff and was able to leave our bags till we got back awesome would stay here again
383777,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, No signposting from the ferry terminal but to be fair you can see the hotel away to the right when you get Off the boat , The location could be a little offputting for some people a 15 minute ferry ride from the central station and plonked in a sort of post industrial landscape but we liked it Away from the crowds of central amsterdam and very easy to get to on the free ferry 
383778,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The triple room was too small for three people It was converted from a double room with an additional bed The third bad was small and uncomfortable ,No Positive
383779,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The area hotel lacked atmosphere The smell of food in reception area off putting No cigarette machine told that we could buy cigarettes at central station seriously We went to the Double tree near the central station and were told we were not booked there and they were very nice they told us that we could get a taxi it cost 27 euro We discovered that all we had to do was go back to central station and take the ferry communication , The ferry trip
383780,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, I didn t like the policy of the hotel charging your accommodation We stayed for 3 nights and a terrible amount of money is pending for days in my account The hotel held 3 times more the cost of the initial booking causing me problems with the back account , The location is fantastic because to take the ferry every day to Central station is a highlight of the day 
383781,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Didn t like the location on the edge of an industrial area We only stayed here due to the unveiling of the sea shepherd vessel Ocean Warrior on 26th September at N D S M The room was smaller than most hotel rooms Breakfast price was really expensive so eat out Was not a fan of the glass door to bathroom area , The bed was really comfy The shower head was really powerful 
383782,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, It was a bit noisy in the night because of the party outside, Good location although not directly in the centre easy accessible by free ferry Very comfortable bed helpful staff
383783,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, It is located across the canal from city center so you need to take a ferry to go to the actual city and it comes about every half hour Also not enough lighting in room in the evening , Comfy bed great staff Hotel is modern and clean Room is nicely decorated and had fridge and nespresso machine Shower is great also 
383784,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf,No Negative, Great location 2min walk from the Ferry Nice views from our room Great breakfast good beds Nice relaxed area near a great bar restaurant Noorderlicht 
383785,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Two Negatives to report the blue lights which are on the control panels lights fans temp control inside the room are very bright when trying to sleep a clear glass door to the bathroom is not something we re into as a couple We re incredibly close but there should always be some privacy when it comes to using the toilet, Beautiful property up and coming area friendly staff and while it s small touch having a great chocolate cookie upon arrival esp after being so tired upon arrival was a great way to welcome us Would recommend this hotel to others 
383786,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, I was expecting a better view from Amsterdam but in the lower floors there are some buildings next to it , A boat takes you to the center of Amsterdam in just 15m so it s pretty easy to enjoy the city The staff is very friendly 
383787,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Firstly it says over 1 km from Centre that s across water Second it said 445 when I got there it was 488 for a room with concrete ceiling wires everywhere and toilet paper like you get in asda 1 for 6 Rolls then they tried to fine us for smoking in room when we never and the fine is 175 also they went into the room and took pictures clearly an invasion of privacy this was worse hotel experience iv had for years,No Positive
383788,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf,No Negative, The location is great you catch a free ferry over to the city centre which only takes 10mintues also very easy to get to and from the airport by train which only cost 10 for two people each way The hotel from the outside isn t the best looking but inside definitely makes up for it The room was luxurious with a comfort bed a lovely view cosy dressing gowns spacious walk in shower large flat screen TV coffee tea making facilities and electronic system to request clean up service or do not disturb also one to control lights The staff were very helpful and polite the cookies we got given was a nice touch 100 the hotel is worth the money the stay was excellent would definitely recommend 
383789,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf,No Negative, Love being back in NDSM especially in the warm sunshine Thank you for the super warm welcome at DoubleTree both at check in and check out Enjoyed every experience Lots of happy people around Thank you 
383790,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, It is a pity that Hilton have two hotels in the same city both on the water with the same name The location is a little inconvenient but there is free and frequent ferry to the city about 15 mins The room itself was fairly small and contained only 1 chair , The staff were very obliging and it was a bonus to have a restaurant as part of the hotel 
383791,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, the environment surrounding the hotel is not good there is no stores or restaurants or scenery or anything , the hotel itself is great only a free ferry ride away from the central station 
383792,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, I didn t get my cookie the complimentary early breakfast was missing only coffee and juice was there i had booked a room with two double beds and only got one, The free ferry was great and it was quick to get to the city center awesome juice nice modern rooms great view
383793,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Room was too small Maid didn t clean our dirty coffee cups or used wine glasses Also didn t restock our coffee Not up to standards of regular Doubleetree , Restraurant and desk staff were great After finding out I had to take a ferry I was surprised how often and fast it left 
383794,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The location poor is an understatement You have to get a ferry from central station that takes 15 minutes and last ferry was 23 45 A taxi cost 45 the hotel should take this into account and not charge a centre location price for the room , Bed was comfy Front of house staff was polite 
383795,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, A bit far in the taxi later in the evening not too far but taxis aren t cheap so budget for the taxi fair Although the price of taxis is not the hotels fault I would stay here again , Loved the ferry ride into the city each morning Lovely view across the water seeing all the different boats and ferries Staff were very efficient friendly and helpful in the hotel I couldn t believe when I got on the ferry the first time and part way across there was an old submarine just parked in the water A few locals had clear been out and decorated it Definitely something different
383796,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Located in the north the hotel is not ideal for travelers wanting to be in the middle of the action However it is conveniently located just steps from the ferry and moments from central station It is in the up and coming neighborhood of Amsterdam Noord and was conveniently located for our meeting , The hotel staff was friendly and helpful the hotel was uniquely decorated and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud 
383797,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Rooms and bed are small Bed is so soft that you roll towards each other while sleeping so your lying in a pit Its noisy To expensive for what you get , Location is beautiful and great view Hotel and restaurant looks nice Breakfast is good 
383798,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, There is not supermarket near hotel If you want to buy small things you need to take the ferry That s a one thing i feel a little inconvenient , I like the comfortable bed and nice view When you go to the central you can by ferry for free It is really convenient but you need to check the ferry schedule 
383799,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The hotel is somewhat isolated from the town center and accessible primarily by ferry , The hotel is very modern and clean and the staff provides excellent service 
383800,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Although our room was comfortable if you looked up at the ceiling you could see the room was not quite finished concrete ceiling showing , The staff were very friendly and helpful The room was comfortable
383801,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, We had loads of little niggles which added up really put a dampener on our time there We were put in a room 101 avoid which was next to the constantly slamming service door , The location is fun and having to get the ferry there made no difference The breakfast was pretty decent The bed was comfortable 
383802,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Room service only available until 10pm, Loved everything from the moment we walked in The location is out of the hustle and bustle of the city centre but only a short ferry ride away Our room had an amazing view of the wharf Bedroom was tidy and bed was super comfy The staff are only more than willing to help with any enquiry Absolutely loved our stay here and will definitely be back again 
383803,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, needed to leave for airport at 6 15am we were assured there would be coffee tea and croissants in reception at 6am Unfortunately that didn t happen and as there wasn t any breakfast tea left in our room we didn t get a drink We were very disappointed especially as we had paid for breakfast for the 3 days of our stay , Bed was comfy although room very small Location different as its in what was an industrial area but it grew on us and we liked it Ferry very prompt 
383804,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Upon booking we were told of a 100 charge that would be put on your card was fine with this and had budgeted for this I had the balance including the extra for accommodation on a debit card but kept only the balance available on it due to a previous experience of having a card swiped and money taken When I tried to pay found there was insufficient funds The hotel took the 100 multiple times yet the hotel claimed this wasn t the case I showed them on my banking system online and then was spoken to like I hadn t read the t cs as it does state the 100 It states the charge once not multiple times Much confusion I was able to move more money to accommodate but not the point , Location cleanliness facilities all great 
383805,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, To expensive I asked to upgrade my room and they charged me an extra 70 euros per night on top of wat I paid for a view of the river Not good, Nice clean rooms and good location

383807,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Did not appear to be a lot to see or do in the immediate NDSM Wharf area , Quiet location a free 13 minute ferry ride from Amsterdam central railway station Staff very helpful and friendly Room was very comfortable and very good value for being so close to the centre of Amsterdam 
383808,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Not great location , Booked this hotel by mistake meant to have booked the central one we ve now stopped at both and can say was worth stopping even though got to get ferry across all time

383810,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf,No Negative, Surprisingly good location right by the free ferry service that takes you right to the central station area Nice restaurant on site and really friendly staff 
383811,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The location meant that we had to catch the ferry that takes us to the centre of Amsterdam and vice versa The ferry crossing takes about 15 minutes each way but the ferry crosses every half an hour only , The amenities were very stylish The staff were accommodating and friendly Any inconvenience is looked into and compensated to make ones stay still memorable

383816,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Additional means of public transport to the city center was missing Just depending on the shuttle boats were a bit stressful , Double tree Cookies Awesome way of welcoming Staff were very courteous and helpful Rooms were clean and comfortable 
383817,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Direct environment of the hotel is only sprakling during daytime but nice place to be when the sun is shining, Location with a view Easy access to the city by ferry
383818,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Pay attention this is not the Double tree in the city centre of Amsterdam This one is at a horrible location City centre is at least 20 minutes drive by car Unorganized breakfast Small bathroom Bed plastic tarp under the fitted sheets Never come back again , nothing
383819,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, booked the wrong hotel thought this hilton was at the station It is 28 euros each way in a cab from central amsterdam or you can get a free ferry which is every half hour and takes 15minutes ,No Positive
383820,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The only thing that could have been better but unfortunately you could not help in that matter was the weather was very cold but hotel and room were lovely and warm and cosy, I had a lovely meal I didn t eat breakfast the beds we re very comfortable the staff were first class and the rooms were kept clean and tidy
383821,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Breakfast was relatively expensive 23 euros per person A guy in the staff sounded sarcastic when I mentioned amenities in the room were only set for 2 The rest of the staff was generally good , Booked a room for 3 The hotel was generally clean though small
383822,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, We thought it would have been more central But quite enjoyed the ferry and local amenities , Room was compact but very comfy bed and good bathroom Great staff and lovely bar eating area Very helpful staff all round 
383823,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Location It is located in the north side of Amsterda You will need to get a free boat to reach the hotel But it do not work during the night If you are going out at night you will need taxi , Nice staff good and efficient check in 
383824,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Despite having breakfast included in the package when we reach restaurant to have it in the morning reception people didn t inform the restaurant staff It becomes embarrassing that you are waiting so that you can have breakfast Thanks to staff in restaurant they covered it nicely Next day again same thing happened Reception people are not bother about it and the amount of money hotel charged the room size was very unexpected It was too small that it s very hard to walk inside room Being the most expensive hotel of our trip the experience was not good ,No Positive
383825,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, There was no Sofa in the room We were given a room meant for guests with special needs and there too much sound because of a festival next door I would have liked that the hotel inform me of this before hand ,No Positive
383826,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The location was great however the ferry was sometimes an inconvenience due to time schedules every 30 mins and ends at 11 45pm so if you like the night life you have to rely on a taxi and the costs may vary , This was a fantastic hotel I was so impressed It s exactly as the picture shows The staff were great and greeted us with fresh warm cookies The bed sofa pillows and cushions were the best comfort and quality The bathroom was to die for 
383827,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Our room was behind reception on the ground floor We were kept awake by constant banging of external fire door from early hours of the morning , The bed was very comfortable and breakfast room service was delicious
383828,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The location was a free 10 minute ferry ride from Amsterdam central As much as it didn t ruin the weekend it was just a pain sometimes being so far out of the centre , Hotel was amazing Lovely friendly staff and the room was clean and very comfortable 
383829,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Parking is not secure Not the easiest hotel to find , Really friendly staff felt really welcome after a Long journey there Nothing was too much trouble even finding me a UK plug adapter at 2am 
383830,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The need to take a ferry to go into the city gets tiresome after the first couple of trips the location let s itry down, All the staff are extremely helpful and make you feel very welcome
383831,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Free parking would be nice but it was much much cheaper than else where , The view from the room was amazing Could have watched the boats pass for hours The ferry to the centre is easy to use and very regular 
383832,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Room was really small and it was noisy outside and inside We could only sleep with earplugs as it sounded in our room as if someone showered all night Glad we were only there for 1 night Book the right view otherwise you will regret it The information the Intern gave us when we arrived was poor and she was unfriendly in my opinion A blanket was missing in our room and the shelf in the wardrobe was very unstable , Staff was amazing except for the Intern that welcomed us It was nice to be welcomed with a cookie Coffee machine and kettle in the room Wifi was good 
383833,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Wharf setting obviously work in progress Cooked breakfast not too good , The outlook from the hotel is tremendous when you book a river view Strongest point of hotel was the staff They were without exception very pleasant and helpful 
383834,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Treble superior room was a little too small for 3 adults extra bed was a camp style not really substantial enough Otherwise it was a well appointed room with contemporary design , Friendly welcome efficient well informed staff 
383835,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Limited evening menu choice don t want burgers every night , The warm cookie on arrival and service The waterfront location escapes the hurly burly of Amsterdam and the free Ferry service from the station 
383836,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Full breakfast was not worth the money better off with continental , Nice calm atmosphere handy for arrivals to central train station free ferry unless you need to depart early ferry doesn t start until 7 AM
383837,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf,No Negative, Rooms spacious and clean bed extremely comfy Warm cookie on arrival was an excellent bonus Staff amazing Only 10 min free ferry ride to city centre 
383838,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf,No Negative, Staff were friendly and very helpful The room was lovely and stylish and the free ferry to and from the town was great running until 2 30am There is a deli place opposite that does organic food the burger and fries was one of the best I ve ever eaten 
383839,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, First room we were in was small but very nice we were originally on the top floor and it was windy outside There was a noise in our room from the wind resulting in us not being able to sleep We moved rooms at 1am and we managed to have a great nights sleep The hotel staff were excellent Ferry journey was 10 mins from amsterdam central station , Nice hotel very modern with friendly and helpful colleagues Breakfast was good 
383840,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Not much food or transport options around the area A supermarket nearby will be perfect , The hotel is clean and the staff is friendly and helpful The hotel restaurant serves good food too 
383841,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The hotel is far away from the city center The best option to get there is to take a free boat from central station which is cute the first time but annoying after it The rooms are way too small And management is very poor I forgot a jacket in my room when I left and although I contacted the hotel within the next 24h they were extremely un cooperative and never find it I was really surprised when they ask me to contact the police wth In a hotel this category price this in unacceptable , Rooms were very modern
383842,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf,No Negative, The cookies from Hilton were amazing Absolute loved them the staff really nice and amazing a specially the man the duty manager he s lovely good link to the centre of Amsterdam Procesco and a lovely card for my boyfriends birthday was lovely Worth staying at the Hilton because they treat you like loyalty Thank you very much for my lovely stay I enjoyed it very much
383843,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, A swimming pool and sauna would have made it perfect , The staff were always very friendly and most helpful The breakfast was delicious and the warm cookie on arrival is a welcome pleasure Robert the barman was happy to make delicious and reasonably priced off menu cocktails for us The bar is a great place to chill out 
383844,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The location although cool was a little awkward had to factor in ferry times travel into day plans The room was nice as was the bathroom but the door to the bathroom was not sound steam proof which could be off putting to some The room was quite small with minimal space for suitcases etc although fine for a weekend visit , The cookies from reception the location was cool the rooms had a great feel urban style the staff were so friendly and helpful and gave us a free drink as our room was 5minutes late in being ready bed comfortable and cool view 
383845,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Our major criticism of this hotel is their booking and check in policy Payment for your room is deducted from your credit card soon after making your booking which in our case was several weeks before we arrived Then on top of this at check in we were asked to pay an extra 100 deposit that we felt was inappropriate We have never encountered this kind of policy before despite staying in many very fine hotels throughout Europe It seems that Double Tree Hilton doesn t have much faith in you as a guest Unfortunately this experience soured our trip and we ll be avoiding this outfit in the future , The hotel itself is fine the location is good with impressive views across the river through large picture windows The room was quite well equipped although a touch small The breakfast was very good 
383846,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, I arrived with my mom as I was checking into the hotel was asked for a deposit of 100 even though I already payed for the 2 night stay previously I was quite surprised about it my trip was spoiled entirely Can you please explain more in detail about it I haven t noticed any warning upon booking the hotel that it will be required please redirect me to the information which states about deposit did I miss it Please inform me about it cause it is a first time that I got such an unwelcome reception at the hotel You can email me all the info pertaining to my inquiry Thank you in advance , Complimentary cookies upon arrival departure

383848,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Even though the staff were more than happy to help the hotel could be a little bit more disabled friendly , Impeccable customer service ridiculously tasty food amazing river view 2 minutes walk to the free ferry which goes to central station 
383849,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, From the website images the rooms had lovely views was a little disappointed to find ours had metal fencing across them meaning we couldn t see much at all , The bar staff morning staff member lady didn t catch her name are extremely helpful and attentive 
383850,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Does not apply as it was very good did not find anything wrong here , The location was perfect close enough to Amsterdam centre without the noise and the crowds there is a free ferry which takes you back and forward all day long the journey took only 12 mins and it is right outside the train station The hotel was fantastic we got a great deal through booking com The staff were really nice friendly etc couldn t ask for better Will stay here again and have already recommended it to family and friends There is a large eaterie called Pllek which we visited on the last day it is only a couple of minutes walk from the hotel which was well worth a visit the burger here was delicious so was the wild boar sausage 
383851,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Location and relying on ferry , Gegin very friendly lady Along with reception guys Night duty manager very warm and welcoming Arrived 15th left 17th jan 2016 group of friends all agreed had a ball Enjoyed ferry trip too Only thing is cabs will rip you off when ferry stops as the hotel middle of no where Apart from that food on hotel was amazing too Fresh and scrumptious Really would recommend hotel

383854,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, I booked 2 rooms the same When we arrived they said it was both with views I asked for the better one as we had just got engaged so I wanted it to be special which was a sea view They gave us the wrong room we complained got told it would get sorted none of the staff communicated with each other so it didn t happen complained again and got told to come down at 12 to get upgraded Was without a room until 4pm then to just get the first room we had booked so it wasn t an upgrade and we wouldn t have bothered changing if we new this was the case but they had promised us the best room in the hotel to compensate We got locked out of our room the one night and the guy working had no idea what to do just kept saying it had never happened before We had to tell him to phone a Manager or somebody to sort it as we were not happy about the situation It was totally unprofessional how he handled it considering the Hilton is a big chain and should be able to sort that out immediately Got no apologies for this incident , Hotel was nice 
383855,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The ferry is every half an hour but it is free, The views of the fireworks on NYE were amazing Room and wet room stunning and they had my favourite coffee machine nespresso Try the fish and chips from the take out shop just by where you board the ferry by hotel They were delicious and cooked to order 
383856,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf,No Negative, Location contemporary design free parking and much more hotel is located in an interesting area of the old docs and the city centre can be reached with a free ferry transportation which run every half an hour I highly recommend this hotel

383860,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, We were there for 4 nights and I d only say maybe change up the breakfast a bit just one or two things that change daily it was the same every day and that can be a bit boring when you say longer than two nights at a hotel , The Staff were Fantastic When we arrived in our room the air conditioning wasn t working properly they tried to get it fixed but we re unsuccessful and within the hour had us a new room in which they made sure the air conditioning was working properly before they let us move Also they have these wicked warm cookies at the reception and they don t seem to mind giving out 
383861,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The view from the top floor 8th Floor is AMAZING but unfortunately we had grills outside the windows so could not see Amsterdam at all from the room Please get the grills removed , The hotel s ambience staff room size services location of course and even the bed that I slept on was fabulous

383865,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Room service finished at 10pm The rooms were a bit narrow in that two people could not walk past each other in the entrance way at the same time, Great location friendly staff clean and comfy rooms Modern amenities Located just across the river from Amsterdam central free ferry service run every 15 30minutes between 7am midnight
383866,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf,No Negative, Excellent Can t fault it amazing cookies too Ideal location if you want something away from the hustle and bustle of Dam Square but still easily accessible Friendly staff and overall Great value for money Would recommend and stay here again

383870,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Don t let the taxi driver get confused to which Double Tree you are wanting to go to Happened a few times When you drive into the area it does look as if you are driving into the rough part of Amsterdam with lots of warehouses graffiti Entrance to hotel wasn t too obvious either, Staff were more than helpful very kind Breakfast was lovely Room hotel was very nice Short ferry trip to city centre which was great on a sunny day Will certainly come back 
383871,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Price asked for the breakfast was too high so we didn t book it, Nice trendy interior Very clean everything new Good connection to Central station 10 minutes by free ferry door to door 
383872,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Late night arrival home concierge couldn t be bothered to get out of his seat Noise from concert Bar were dreadful at making drinks, The breakfast was good
383873,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Altough I asked for an upgrade or gift as it was our honeymoon no reply to that was given The cleaning lady cleans so much that maybe your own things might be gone , We choose the hotel for our little honeymoon Good location nice view to the canals comfortable room maybe a bit small for having booked a bigger room 
383874,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, I hadn t realised you had to get on a ferry to and from hotel It wasn t bad as they ran every 30 mins but if I d of realised maybe wouldn t have chosen the hotel on location did feel that it did make it more of an experience though, The hotel was fantastic great deco and fab staff Would stay here agai as was great value for money 
383875,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, I strictly advised at my booking that I needed twin room and need speedy check in due to my pricise visit to the city for my business But first of all at out arrival around 12am we were given wrong room then we were told to go to another room where there were no lights working Then we had to wait without keys and going all around the hotel with the staff member wasting time being so tired and needing sleep We were straight away refused to be offered any kind of help even when the management being wrong Then we were told by the member that there was no staff or no manager available and nothing can be done then I called other branch and the lady over the phone tried to explain the receptionist how to operate the system to check availability of other empty rooms Taking the height of disappointment we had to accept the offer to sleep in the different room without full facilities and the room was handed over to us around nearly 4am This had wasted the entire trip for which we travelled all the way to Holland We had to wake up 7am to go for the conference which we missed due to all this drama going on around I totally am disappointed that my entire trip went to waste just because of a hotel so unprofessional and the staff being totally disrespectful , NOTHING AT ALL 
383876,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Difficult to get to by car due to massive road works But easy to get into central Amsterdam on foot from the hotel using the free ferry , We loved the stylish decor and the hip waterfront neighbourhood Plus the parking nearby was convenient and the staff were very friendly 
383877,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Extremely small and same facility with double price This was the only hotel which cancel our booking twice during our visit in Europe and they charge the part of deposit before living in and when you check in they will charge more than the actual cost the remaining will be returned at the day you leave Plus the WIFI was awful Plus plus our neighbor was too naughty and noise the whole night we ha ego catch the early flight the other day You can imagine that , quite 10mins ferry to the noise downtown
383878,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, If you want to be IN Amsterdam then the location is less convenient You get a great comfort room not so big but you need to travel a bit, Super lokatie voor sales Mooi beachclub om de hoek Easy acces via pond naar CS
383879,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Wi Fi very limited in its provision Kept telling me I had too many cookies It worked perfectly on trains and elsewhere in the city , Quirky location friendly staff small hotel
383880,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, I liked everything about this hotel so the only set back is the price we got a huge discount but with the regular price we would probably never decided to stay there and we would never know how great this hotel is , This hotel is great located in an interesting area of up and coming district of former ship yard You have to take a free ferry to the Central station but it only takes 10 minutes and actually is an atraction itself The room was really nice with great view of the city The staff at the reception was great very helpful especially Melissa went out of her way to make us feel at home At the best part they keep warm chocolate cookies at the reception and You can help yourself whenever You want 
383881,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, The room was a bit small The high price for this hotel without breakfast was suprisingly negative When i booked it thru Booking com i toght it was with breakfast, Nice vue Frendly staff clen and silent
383882,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, If I missed the mention of the 100e security deposit in my email then Ok but that was unexpected and we were young people on a budget Make that more clear Also the location the free ferry was fair enough but the facilities actually around the hotel were terrible I personally wandered around for over half an hour with absolutely no place to get what I needed cigarettes The hotel need a machine even one the staff can use for customers in case of emergencies because this was an actual issue for me and my friend We did not realize the level of isolation there the dark and quiet area is a little intimidating at night The bathroom door in our room wouldn t shut fully either I m not sure if that was how it was meant to be but between that and the fact that it was made of pure glass meant myself and my friend had literally no privacy what so ever , Beautiful hotel beautiful bedrooms lovely and helpful staff Cascading shower head and wet room bathroom were such a treat The hotel was warm room was comfortable the pillows were to die for pure heaven And the facilities were exactly to what we needed the hairdryer and iron were something that made our holiday a little bit easier The robes in the rooms were our favourite part And we absolutely adored the art all over the hotel Such a fantastic and welcoming place well done 
383883,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, bed was narrow for a double and needs replacement slept in a crater sound proofing of room was lacking inside hotel noise no noise from outside , great location friendly staff clean room with good amenities
383884,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, We payed for Queen room and cot standard the view was awful and had cages round the window cookie and champagne on arrival didn t happen either also when we complained they said they will do something about it and promised a special trest free from the hotel the following day which was never seen either, The rooms are modern
383885,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf, Maybe a good idea to open the bar and restaurant a little later at night , We had a great deal 175 euros for 2 nights Everything was perfect staff location 
383886,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam NDSM Wharf,No Negative, The location was really nice Calm outside the city center on an interesting location the old ship wharf The city center was easaly accesible using the free ferry service
