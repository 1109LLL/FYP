391144,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, It is extremely frustrating the long waiting line at the entrance to the breakfast room They have to find a more simply way to check the identity of the guests and to know which one has the breakfast included or not In addition if you are unlucky to have one or two persons who have to pay for the breakfast on spot it is a nightmare it takes several minutes for the bills to be printed and signed , The hotel is very well positioned for a city trip to Amsterdam very close to city centre and very convenient access to the Central Station The breakfast is amazing huge variety and everything very fresh Very easy to park underground 
391145,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The hotel is right next to the train station so it was very noisy on the balcony The executive club was not worth spending extra money on Not a huge range of food or beverages not quite big enough to cater for the amount of guests staying at the hotel A very busy hotel , The room was a great size with huge balcony views of the Canal 
391146,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Double bed was too small The in room service menu lacked a lot , The cookie at the reception Well location and facilities as wel as service were great The Starbucks is def a plus point

391149,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, the staff were great 99 of the time our bags weren t carried to our room for us which I think is a downfall, The shower was amazing rooms were slightly basic however we had a lovely view aircon was also an added bonus 
391150,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Reception staff not friendly and no services mind their face to ready to serve customer keep busy with their computer screen , The location very convenient for traveler by train just walk few step from Amsterdam Central Station
391151,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Everything was good There was a noisy group in the above suit But hotel warned them and stopped , Location was perfect and They serve drinking water and apples all the time View from Sky Lounge is fascinating You can view the whole city 
391152,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The room did not get clean after the first night stay even though we asked for service , The warm cookies you get upon check in were fantastic The customer services was awesome The view on the 7th floor facing the water and the city was breathtaking We were very close to everything great restaurants attractions transportation The price was a little high but would stay again for sure Very spacious and suitable for children The apple TV set up was so innovative and they had plenty to watch for kids even though it was in Dutch 
391153,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, We were next to the lift and linen closets I thought we could have been given a better room considering I had booked at least six months in advance , The air conditioning was not adequate and the bathroom was old 
391154,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The fridge was not clean I had a room in the back of hotel not the best view through window Food varieties is poor Pillow was not comfortable, The location The hospitality of the staff The building style The quietness
391155,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Our room was incredibly small There wasn t even anywhere to put your bag I thought the whole experience of this hotel was expensive and clearly the price is only warranted because of the close location to the station , The location is the winner here by a long shot Bed was comfortable Bathroom was also clean and amenities in the bathroom were good Staff were pleasant and helpful when asked questions 
391156,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Breakfast served a little on the cold side and eggs over cooked We paid a lot for our room service breakfast so you expect a little more , The room was tidy and nice The Sky Lounge on the top floor Staff were lovely 
391157,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Food and drinks very expensive No vending machines , Room and bathroom clean Free small water bottles but not always available and cost 6 from room service Helpful staff at checkin

391160,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Room did not have a dresser so for a longer stay there was no place to unpack clothes , Reception staff very friendly and assisted with tram train tickets restaurant recommendations Room had great view of harbour 
391161,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Services could be better Not quite meet our expectation , Great location A few minutes walk to Amsterdam Central station Good varieties of breakfast choice Provide free bottle of water for guests at the lobby which show good care 
391162,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, the house cleaning was not good We had to complain to get the room cleaned well Towels were not replaced There was a blood spot on my bed sheet as i had cut my shin that sheet was never replaced The bath room did not have a towel rail for a hand towel Most inconvenient , the staff at the front desk and the restaurant were very helpful 
391163,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Lack of view brick wall 2M from window For the price paid the room was very disappointing Cups breakfast tea bags and milk not replaced in room We had to go to breakfast area and ask for replacements staff willingingly obliged Shower floor very slippery Inadequate wardrobe for two people no shelves to put sweaters shirts etc Only a couple of small drawers for clothes , Comfortable bed and wonderful choice at breakfast 
391164,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, I checked in then returned a few hours later which my keys were not ready Room was far too noisy which was situated on floor 10 floor below the sky lounge Strange noises throughout the night of moving furniture rolling things around inserting plugs and random banging kept awake for most of the two nights I stayed completely ruined my break as it I didn t get one Room was freezing cold the whole time even after having the heating on full and the toilet I don t think has ever seen a decent cleaning product it was black I complained was given a complimentary taxi to the airport and offered a breakfast which I turned down Expected far more better standard from a Hilton that s why I booked it , Location and presentation of hotel is great
391165,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, A little too expensive and it seems to be a party hotel A little confusing even for the staff , Great breakfast great room and wifi It is a good location if what you need is to stay close to the central station for trains Otherwise it is a little outside the city center 
391166,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Some light got through the window blinds staff could be a bit nicer A little nose from the train, Clean and cofortable Close to city center and central station goog connection with the airport
391167,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, They didn t clean our room one of the days until 6 30pm and that did not suit us The view from our room was supposed to be harbor view instead it was of a small patch of grass and other hotel rooms It was a very expensive hotel , I liked the fact when you check inn you get cookies and staff where very friendly It was a fantastic location for Amsterdam itself 
391168,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Sky lounge was very very busy at night we could see why but even as guests of the hotel we were unable to get a seat anywhere to enjoy more drinks Rooms were quite basic and plain for price paid but bed very comfortable , Location was perfect very close to central station and the overall city Hotel room view was amazing and was lovely to be able to watch the sunsets each night Staff were very helpful and friendly and would do anything for you to ensure your stay was up to standard 
391169,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The only problem I had was my intense dislike of nuts The welcoming cookies have nuts in them so I couldn t eat mine An alternative like chocolate chip or oatmeal raisin would be cool I don t really need to be stuffing my face on cookies though so it was probably for the best , I loved everything about this hotel From the moment I arrived the front desk staff was welcoming and professional I requested a room with a view as I was staying for 7 nights Well they did not let me down I had a nice spacious executive queen room with floor to ceiling windows with a great view of the harbor and the city The room was a perfect size not cramped at all The Apple computers were nice to use as well I travelled solo and did order room service often The food was excellent I ate upstairs at the Sky Lounge and that was awesome too I loved this hotel so much that I stayed a second time after visiting the UK during my Amsterdam trip When I came back they reserved the previous room I stayed in so it felt like I was coming home I found that to be very thoughtful I will definitely stay here again when visiting Amsterdam The proximity to the Train station was great for visiting other cities for the day The surrounding neighborhood is great too and felt very safe 
391170,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Could hear music from the sky lounge in our room on the 8th floor which was very annoying Got moved to the 4th floor for our 3rd night but could still hear it so don t go for a courtyard room if you want to relax They held 150 on my credit card at check in while telling us the card would not be charged at that time Breakfast is ridiculously expensive The sky lounge is very expensive and had loud music playing so hard to talk to each other Very busy and impersonal , Location great right beside centraal station Food from room service was tasty and reasonably priced Very comfy bed 
391171,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Room was not made available quickly even after alerting staff well in advance and having explained it was because of being unwell after a long trip ,No Positive

391173,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Poor room location not worth the money, Convenient location hotel nothing special our room not very large and overlooked by aerial walkway had we been staying longer would have asked to move rooms 
391174,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, I have slightly impaired vision and I found the room lighting to be lacking a bit Also I m a PC person not Apple so the computer which also serves as the room s TV was a bit difficult for me to deal with but I survived There was no easily visble clock in the room and the room s telephone was for me difficult to read , The Guest services staff was super helpful They sent aspirin to my room in the middle of the night also a quart of milk and even programmed the throw away cellphone I bought to use in Holland because the instructions were in Dutch and Chinese In terms of staffing the front desk had some of the friendliest people I ve met The hotel location is literally next door to Central Station which is also the terminus for both streetcars and the subway Metro Several bus routes also start in the plaza You can get day passes which provide access to all three transport modes from the Guest services desk which charges your room account for the cost They even sent someone to kill a mosquito that had entered through the window I had opened I carry an Epipen for my allegies 
391175,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, In Sky lounge it was just one girl that took the orders and everything came so late they need mote people there, The personal were so good am politie and friendly
391176,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, We stayed in a King Deluxe room which was tiny compared to the NH Collection Barbizon we moved from both 4 hotels Furniture rather dated bathroom small but clean and well equipped The thing with carpeted rooms is that if the carpet isn t perfect it cheapens the entire room and makes it seem dirty though it might not be the carpet in this room was not great Overall a 3 superior rather than a 4 The reedeming quality of the room was the view of the river and city , Perfect location excellent breakfast Staff very friendly and great view from the river facing rooms Despite the cons we had an enjoyable stay once we got used to the rather cramped quarters 
391177,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Would have liked a cooler room temperature We turned the air conditioner down to the maximum coolest temperature along with maximum fan speed but it was not cool enough , Wonderful breakfast buffet and really enjoyed the Sky Lounge in the evening Location could not be beat within walking distance to Centraal station close to everything Only 10 15 minute ride to and from the airport Nice clean modern room overlooking the river was a nice treat after travelling all day by plane The warm cookies at arrival were a nice treat Concierge very helpful in recommending a very nice restaurant 
391178,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Nothing springs to mind , Location is brilliant for the city centre and many of the tourist attractions are either within easy walking distance or the tram bus and boat system all depart from the square in front of the station five minutes walk from the hotel We were lucky with the weather our stay was comfortable the staff were friendly helpful and knowledgeable 
391179,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, quite costly rooms are not really Hilton like , a 3 minutes walk from the central station starbucks in the ground floor free water and apples at reception free wifi perfect location to start sightseeing in the city mac in the room
391180,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The staff on the front desk were a little rude our room was not ready for 3 hours having already confirmed I could have an early check in through booking com I was not pleased when I arrived We had to wait in the lobby Then after requesting a late check out as our flight was not until 8pm I was charged an extra amount to stay in the room Not only this there was a complete mix up on the payment I had requested to pay for 2 rooms however the front desk messed this up and had to refund my friend There was a few complications The rooms are very basic no design element at all the cupboard was tiny and there wasn t that much room to leave your things Not only this we had a room facing the train tracks Every morning we got woken up by the trains passing through Not ideal if you want a relaxing stay A basic hotel for the price , The roof top bar the sky Lounge is worth the visit The Bathroom was clean and compact 
391181,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The receptionist abused my mother because the charges to the credit card was declined Later a different receptionist managed to put the charges into the same credit card with no problem No apology whatsoever from the front office manager My mother is still in shock with the rude treatment she received Very disappointed , Nothing
391182,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, We got a room on the 9th floor The Hilton Honors floor but unfortunately it was close to the rooftop bar and we can hear the music However since we were only staying for 2 nights we didn t change although the duty manager was helpful and ready to do it , Excellent location near the central station Staff and duty manager friendly and helpful Breakfast buffet delicious and a lot of variety
391183,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The room was not cleaned on the second day we had to request it but than only towels were replaced Due to the hour we requested he clean There were cigarette filters on the balcony when we arrived , Great location Great staff Great lounge service with complementary breakfast and happy hour 
391184,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, When my two bookings are still under free cancellation period the hotel tested my credit card and charged Euro2 twices I emailed the hotel to check the nature of that charges and the hotel did reply that is for testing my credit card under booking Never have such experience in online hotel booking before , I need to store my lugguages for 3 nights after check out and the hotel is very helpful with no additional charge for this service I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights under two bookings the first booking is with mobility and second booking with access to executive lounge The breakfast served at Executive lounge is not as good as breakfast for general hotel guests but we can always choose to have breakfast at the place that serves general hotel guests The hotel Executive lounge serves snack and drinks during 6 8pm 
391185,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights the first night settled at a room facing train station tv did not work noisy when the train passed by but the front desk staff were just ok my booking is with Mobility but no introduction of such service at all , Breakfast is very good and the staff at the breakfast restaurant are quite nice and helpful 
391186,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, This has got to be the most expensive doubletree I have stayed at among many but again we enjoyed our stay so what s the big deal One note is that bike rental would be better if it lasts 24hr instead of only until the evening of rental , Bike rental is great very Amsterdam Friendly staff helpful and informative Stayed on 7th floor view is beautiful possibly even better on upper executive floors Perfect location esp for travelling by train to central station
391187,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Overall the hotel was nice Good location by central station and the rooms were clean and large by European standards However the hotel outdoor bar stays open on the weekends until 2 am If you have a room facing the bar the music is loud in your room until closing I may expect this to occur at a budget hotel but given the price of the hotel my expectation was that I would not be kept awake by loud music Additionally the electricity went off on my floor around 11pm and was not turned back on until 7am While this may not be the hotels fault it was not pleasant in the morning trying to get ready with no electricity ,No Positive
391188,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Rooms for 300EUR are a joke Coming from a 1000EUR Night resort in Greece I was utterly shocked what 300EUR a night buys you in amsterdam a prison cell But wait prison cells actually have more sunlight view and window , Friendly staff

391194,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Nothing that we didn t like, The friendly service and the cleanliness of the hotel The location was excellent because it was a minute away from all the trams stops and a few minutes to the main shopping centre 
391195,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The bed was so uncomfortable and only 1 pillow was on the bed when we arrived but the staff then gave us another one which wasn t a problem The room I booked online looked very different to the one we received very basic room which was a little bit disappointing as we paid a lot for the room , Staff was really helpful and professional and the location was great to go into central dam the breakfast provided was beautiful lots of variety and choice

391204,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The beds could be better , If you are going on a river cruise from Amsterdam this location is perfect for a 1 2 night stay If you are staying longer and really want to explore Amsterdam there are quieter locations For my needs this trip this was 5 star I would give the staff a 6 They were exceptional

391207,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The hotel is EXTREMELY busy Hard to get a table at breakfast Very small rooms borderline uncomfortable Very basic decor you d expect this of Holiday Inn perhaps Other DoubleTreeHiltons I ve stayed in were much better , Great location
391208,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, My wife s parents tried to pay for our holiday upfront it took them 4 days to get the payment accepted and sorted with them making 6 7 calls to both the hotel direct and also to booking com This was more than a bit annoying for them when all they wanted to do was pay for our wedding anniversary stay at the hotel , The position and location of the hotel and the staff were friendly and very obliging
391209,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Mixed experience with the reception staff First couple of people we dealt with weren t particularly attentive and as we needed support with a question on our booking made us feel like we were an inconvenience which wasn t a pleasant start Also we had three room travelling as a family and were given three rooms each on completely different floors creating challenges during the stay Finally one room had a very strong smell of cigarette Luckily when raising this last point we dealt with a very nice and attentive receptionist who helped immediately and gave us another room This was appreciated and went some way to make up for the earlier issues , Nice comfortable and clean Convenient location next to the station Breakfast was nice and breakfast staff attentive but still found it overpriced Luckily there is a Starbucks within the hotel building giving a good alternative 
391210,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Layout of room 964 handicapped room could be better especially the bathroom Water from shower goes all over floor there must be a way to contain it to the designated area Hooks are too high up for a person in a wheelchair There should be some towel racks next to the sink The only place to put toiletries was on a high pedestal behind the toilet not convenient for a person who is handicapped , Breakfast buffet was excellent Staff was very friendly and helpful 
391211,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, After paying 900 for a 3 night stay in an executive suite WITH VIEW I have come away very disappointed We were put in a room overlooking the train tracks and could see nothing else it was awful As well as this the windows were dirty and the bed was very uncomfortable In a good location but staff and the woman who dealt with my complaint were very rude I would advise to book a hotel in the same area but not the hilton Absolute waste of money I will never stay here again , Location
391212,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Mini bar was empty Wasn t made aware of free water in reception Room wasn t cleaned until after 4pm Stayed in much better luxury hotels for much less money , Sky Lounge although those with rooms should be a priority and the bed

391216,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, we stay in 10th floor and 11th floor is a night club named sky lounge First you can hear loud music and people screaming all the time untill 3 00 am Then if you called the staff to solve this problem they would offer you some ear plugs Sounds interesting because I spend 240 euros for one night stay with ear plugs on why don t I stay on a cheap hotel which is really on top of a club for 80 euro Finally the view of 10th floor is blocked by another building hence we could only see some grass on top of another building If this night only cost 80 euro I would give it a 9 0 but unfortunately they did not provide me the service that I think worth the money Bad experience especially for 240 euro per night , location is good
391217,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Front office had an issue with the payment as my card didn t work but actually it should we tried it several times wasn t working just in the hotel The hotel is great just our balcony terrace was too dirty and not cleaned at all , We really enjoyed that great location and the hotel Breakfast is amazing and huge I have booked an executive room at the executive floor and we had a terrace with an amazing view all over the city for really good price Staff is very helpful and friendly

391223,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Room size no breakfast included even though I ticked it no smoking room even though I requested Putting 176 on my card incase is outrageous , I requested a queen suite and got a small double room I booked online and when I got to receiption the asked for an extra 176 euro incase I use room service or sky lounge I advised they have my card and can pay after but they refused I needed an adapter and had to pay 20 euro deposit Very unfair I ticked when booking a smoking room and breakfast but I got neither

391246,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, As Amsterdam is clearly a weekend hotspot for many travellers the price per night is definitely above what a normal 4 or 5 star accommodation charges elsewhere , A great place to stay which is close to the station and within walking distance to public transportation and the old city district Very enthusiastic staff clean and has a great sky bar within the same building 
391247,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station,No Negative, A very clean and modern hotel with great facilities and in a fantastic location Staff were very friendly and helpful Would use again when I revisit Amsterdam if the price is right

391252,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, When we arrived we were told that we had to pay an extra 100 deposit if we used anything like the mini bar the price would come out of that thankfully we received the full deposit at the end of the stay However this was not stated during the confirmation of the booking so be careful , The location of the hotel was good and the bed was comfy and extra dressing gowns were an added bonus
391253,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, I wanted to stay near the top of the hotel for the view however during the night between 1 5am there was always a lot of noise coming from above us like dragging tables chairs etc that s the only fault I had with the stay and would just stay a few floors lower , After walking around for hours every day the bed was so comfy to chill in
391254,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Quite impersonel long reaction time of the staff when an issue is reported no TV available one of the nights I spent there , The view and location 
391255,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The rooms and halls were quite bare they could have been decorated more nicely, Been was extremely comfortable and I loved the warm welcome cookie we revived when checking in
391256,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, This is a huge hotel with hundreds if not thousands of rooms which has natural consequences and should be taken into account by people desiring a more intimate experience While I loved it some may be put off by the sheer scale of the establishment , Basically everything is great about this hotel The location is extremely convenient within a short walk from the Central Station and a number of sights with great public transport The rooms are spacious and clean and the staff unfaillingly courteous and helpful All in all a great stay

391260,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station,No Negative, What a beautiful location the walk through to dam square from hotel was luvly lots of shops and places to eat it was light festival while we was ther so as our hotel was faces the canal we got to see all the gorjes lights as we would stroll in and out

391262,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Room view could have been better My partner told staff we had planned to get engaged did nothing special for us No upgrade offered which he was going to pay for , Handy to city centre
391263,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Cost of breakfast rooms are a bit small for the price not thrilled about the 20 inch television that doubles as a computer a larger flat panel Television in the room would have made the trip more enjoyable, Breakfast fitness center general location nice Starbucks attached to hotel
391264,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The lotion shampoo etc is in hopeless botles difficult to empty and there were missing parts e g shampoo which I did not realise before I needed it It is really difficult to get the sink to empty I learned how from the reception but had to open it again after every cleaning Leave it open , The view over the harbour The snacks at the conference Coffe Tea at the room Breakfast is lovely
391265,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station,No Negative, Incredible That s how I feel about that city when it lays right here in a view from my window Simply clever interior of apartments but pretty feel about architecture breakfasts and smiles everywhere 
391266,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The hotel room is functional not luxurious type Toilet is also hostel like My room view is great facing the city I was asking some question to the front office staff and after 5 min this lady staff kinda raised her voice which is unexpected , You can t beat the location 5 min to the central station and walking through the Starbucks will save you from the cold winter The sky lounge is good place to chill 
391267,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Room too small nearly Japanese standard We couldn t find The Kettle as it was in a drawer of the desk Fridge was empty Ice dispenser located in the corridor in Amsterdam is useless Breakfast at 25 is too much expensive, Starbucks in the building where we could have breakfast

391270,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, One thing I didn t like was that when I arrived the price I paid was more than what stayed on booking com Also the price I thought I was meant to pay said it included state tax on checkout I was then asked to pay another 36 for state tax Was really not impressed and just felt they were asking for more and more money than what I assumed I was paying , Loved the location of the hotel staff and cleanliness off hotel

391273,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Not being told upon checking in that breakfast was included rental bikes were available etc would have been more useful to us to have been given a small overview , Bed was super comfy views were incredible didn t get chance to sample breakfast but we will be booking again so I ll be sure to get in on the act then 
391274,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Nothing not to like, I thought we booked with Breakfast however it wasn t so we ate out at 25 euros for breakfast is pricey especially for Amsterdam The rooms are a good size great shower and perfect location

391278,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, I wish it had a pool The beakfast was less than our expectations but still good , There was a two hour free drink snd snack time in the evening which was great and generous The room size was good 
391279,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, I had purchased a room which wasn t the basic yet it felt very basic It was not worth the money the view was amazing but the windows very dirty , View was amazing
391280,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station,No Negative, The staff really worked hard at making my stay pleasant and they are always cheerful Where the room is concerned I particularly enjoyed the super strong shower and they have one of the most comfortable beds 
391281,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Had to pay a deposit that we knew nothing about this then cut into our budget for our holiday therefore having to change plans, Location staff were fairly helpful
391282,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Found the room hugely uncomfotable very small bed was worst we have ever slept on quilt too small for the size of the bed literally room does not have a television meaning you cannot actually spend any relaxing time in the room instead you are supplied with a mac computer with around 5 English channels and internet access which does not support any video format like Netflix etc which would of been a understanding consolation room was not supplied with any water bottles and hotel charged 17 00 for two SMALL bottles we chose this hotel as we expected to be able to spend some time in the room relaxing so was very disappointed hotel also charges an additional 150 00 on arrival without warning will definatly be finding another place to stay when we visit amsterdam again , Location determines the price Amsterdam beautiful place brilliant friendly people 
391283,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The reservation price through Booking com was not honored by the hotel After extensive discussions between Booking com and the hotel management I gave up and paid the higher rate I paid an extra 300euro ,No Positive
391284,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Our experience at the sky lounge was awful we were made to feel unwelcome waited over 30 minutes for one drink which I had to resolve myself by going to the bar supervisor we were dealt with in am offhand manner by a female member if staff whilst other customers around us were served quickly very disappointed as this was why we chose the hotel on recommendations from friends and family, The reception staff were exemplary
391285,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, We stored our bags in the hotel after check out as we had a few hours before flying then when we come to collect them we had to wait nearly half an hour for them to find them, Location was perfect
391286,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Far too expensive for a small room with a small and uncomfortable bed Did not get a good nights sleep Room not cleaned properly before our stay and so previous guest s receipt was left behind Found that previous guest had paid 85 euro a night and we were paying 329 euros a night for the same room on the same day they had checked out ,No Positive
391287,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Hope the room will be cleaned and the shampoo conditioner soap be replenished we stayed for 3 days and not once the room was cleaned and supplies replaced , The location is nice very close to the train station and tourist areas The breakfast buffet is also good Just a little pricey if not included in the room 
391288,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, I asked for a quiet room which was great and really quiet However the view from my room wasn t great That didn t matter I d rather have a good nights sleep The view from the sky lounge more than made up for it , Warm cookie on arrival free apples and water in reception Apple Mac in room staff always happy to help good location clean I ve included a pic looking at the hotel over the bridge at night It really is lovely 
391289,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, the views window wasn t very good i expected a lot better the 11th floor sky lounge in the evening was a horrible place to be basically all the reasons i booked the hotel for dissapointed me but it was clean and friendly enough , the staff where very polite which to me is the most important thing the travelling the last thing i want after flying is to be faced with someone that doesnt want to help all the staff where very helpful
391290,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Breakfast buffet was over priced at 25 50pp However there are alternatives available , Rooms were warm decent size and very clean with comfy beds Staff friendly and attentive Wide variety of restaurants within the hotel itself and great location in the city Free bottles of water and cookies cakes at reception every day 
391291,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, We were staying during New Year and were not aware of the amount of people who would be in the hotel We were awake until 4am due to music in the SkyLounge, When we arrived we received fresh hot cookies which was an added bonus The staff were very helpful The location cannot be faulted
391292,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, I wasn t advised that the payment for 2 rooms would automatically come from my card I had withdrawn the cash and changed into euros to make this payment in advance I was extremely displeased that what booking com advised and what the hotel were claiming were completely different, The sky bar location on the rooftop was truly amazing I would recommend this hotel purely based on that alone 
391293,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, CROWDED BREAKFAST DIFFICULT TO SETTLE , FANTASTIC LOCATION FEW STEPS NEXT TO CENTRAL STATION SITUATED ON THE RIVER ROOMS WITH FRONT VIEW ARE AMAZING BE CAREFUL OF UPGRADE CHARGE ITS PER ROOM AND NOT PER PERSON FRIENDLY STAFF

391304,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, We ordered room service on the first night and was told it would be half an hour An hour later it still hasn t come so I phoned back up and was told it was on its way Another hour passed and I was about to fall asleep so I phoned up to cancel it I was then told by a polite female we could get breakfast free of charge due to it being late at night we woke up and it was to late to take advantage of this offer Also on the first night we went up to sky lounger in which I was told to take a seat and we would get table service again we waited half an hour before someone took our order and waited another half hour before the drinks came out in which we was also short changed by a couple Of euros I always leave a tip but don t expect someone to take it before we give it We then left and didn t wish to spend time in the hotel other than to sleep at night This morning someone entered our room at 9am whilst we was sleeping so I asked for them to leave and didn t appreciate being woken up when we didn t have to leave until 12noon So to conclude I chose your hotel to make our time away more special but was not made to feel welcome due to all of the above , The room was very nice and location was great 
391305,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, room is very small i expected a more spacius room and shower when we arrived the room was dusty and looked unclean balcony was much worse with tons of cigarete buds that wasnts cleaned also during our 2 nights stay we had our coffee on the balcony and left the cups on the table when we came back to the room later after it has been cleaned the coffee cups were still there so probably they are not cleaning the balcony at all we collected some garbage and put it on the floor next to the door in a bag and it also remained there after the room has been cleaned also the water pressure in the shower was very poor expected so much more from a hiltom operated hotel , view from executive room with balcony was amazing sky lounge although expensive is a must executive lounge was also very nice place to come and relax 
391306,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, We stayed in room 746 and the lift was far away from our room on our last day we could hardly walk the corridor because we had walked that much around Amsterdam our legs were hurting, The view out of our bedroom window the hotel was very modern with djs as you walk in and the sky lounge was good too 
391307,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Room was on 10th floor under the sky bar We could constantly hear music and high heels walking up and down This went on until 2 3am in the morning The heating didn t work into our room and the lock on the door was hanging off , Staff were nice and rooms were clean 
391308,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Cost of drinks in the skylounge, Location Cleanliness and good breakfast choices Also attention to detail like the little signs advising where things were located 
391309,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Weather was cold however wasn t the hotel s fault , Welcomed with warm chocolate cookies my 11 year old son loved it Great location about 400m from the train station Easy access to trams so getting around was a breeze

391311,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, the room for what we payed was very small over looked and was cold unsure I the heating was working, the hotel and staff was amazing very polite and helpful
391312,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The bedroom was a bit cool at night and the heating system did nothing to help Would have loved a spare blanket However this did nothing to dampen our enthusiasm we loved the place and will be back , The staff were exceptional nothing was too much to ask of them
391313,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, It was perfect , Arrived at 7 30am had previously emailed to ask if poa Sible to have earlier check in time which they did Lovely warm copley upon arrival Location was perfect walk to every where and right beside trams and trains too 
391314,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The only slight negative for me was that the view out of the window was of train tracks , The staff were extremely helpful if you needed anything from a bottle of water to toothpaste mouthwash it was there within minutes without any extra cost 
391315,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, they do not take into consideration your notes on booking com forms such as you ask for double bed or room that looks trough sea you get the opposite , away from city rush but very close to every where
391316,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Could have done with a hairdryer in the room But it wasn t too much of a bad hair day , lucky to get a room on the 11th floor with a view on the IJ Wonderful Bed was also extremely comfortable The sky lounge is amazing the staff brilliant and the bloody Marys and lunch salads fantastic Photos of view from the sky lounge and the Ij have been included I have put the Sky Lounge on my list of where to lunch and have a breather when spending a day in Amsterdam 
391317,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Only good for buisness gusts Not for families Next to the rail tracks from north side Furnitur can be improved Relatively samel rooms Forced daily to keep all my personal items in the safe box because Hotel can not find my lost medical pillow , Close to central train station shopping areas Starbux next door Good breakfast food and place Building clear from any jamed areas
391318,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Can be expensive to stay at certain times of the year, Staff very pleasant asked for 2 extra pillows and they were sent up and at your room within 10mins Great location
391319,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, A bit expensive for service provided Heating was not enough , Great Location Perfect breakfast with s variety of choice Good coffee Internet was very quick
391320,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, At check in we got a bit of fuss for booking with booking com I am a Hilton Honors member Gold level My spouse was attending an academic conference so when he had to book it made the most sense for his needs When I decided to go along I did not go expecting to collect a bunch of points or anything but being recognized as a loyal customer would have been nice and not calling so much attention to fact we were really missing out on a lot of points as a result of not using hilton com , When we asked staff something 9 out of 10 went out of their way to answer or assist We asked for a lot of help when we arrived and they really were nice about it I normally check in and never ask for much We had connectivity issues with the wifi and it was a wild goose chase but they persisted and came back when things still were not resolved They were all helpful and cheerful and I was quite flustered trying to get online to attend a meeting with my office We asked for some advice on restaurants or asked them to make a reservation for one we wanted to try They were very helpful The food and beverage we had were very good Also we had access to the Executive Lounge This was a great option for us because we stayed for 9 nights We could have a nice place to sit and relax and at other times enjoy refreshments The hotel location was optimal we arrived at Centraal Station and easily made the walk over to the hotel with our luggage The Sky Lounge has a gorgeous view it is worth going up for a look it does get quite crowded up there Enjoyed food and drink and looking out the window there 
391321,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Didn t take breakfast because of the expensive cost , Room was very comfortable and the location of the hotel was very good as it was within walking distance of Amsterdam Centraal Train station and other transport links such as canal boat trips Sky Bar gave a spectacular view of city lovely place to have a late drink 
391322,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, That they reserve 150 00 Euro deposit extra from the rate and till now i don t get them back from 14 10 2016 please inform me about it when i will receive it back thanks Salem Hanania, the location

391324,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The rooms were quite ordinary we thought During our last stay at Double Tree in London we felt the rooms were more spacious and stylish , The staff were excellent helpful polite and proactive The facilities and location were also good 
391325,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, TVs reception kept failing on the Apple computer Only paper cups provided for tea and coffee , Beds were comfy linen was good and the Skylounge food and atmosphere were fantastic 
391326,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, See above , We liked the location and the surrounding environment We could compare for instance the badroom facilities with other much cheaper 3 4 stars hotels in Tokyo HongKong etc and we were disappointed We expected better from Hilton 
391327,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Nothing this hotel will be my first choice next time i am in Amsterdam , Everything about our stay at this hotel was tip top its just around the corner from the central station the reception staff were very kind the room was just great and the roof top bar was excellent 
391328,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Storage of bags and reclaim luggage 3 different locations to find bags need more supervised staff for the price hotel unsatisfactory i wouldn t call this a 5 star , Position to city breakfast good 
391329,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, toilet did t flush well breakfast was ok but not great for 25 euro each It was very busy and we cleaned our own table after a while also the coffee mashine was asking for maintenance but passing staff didn t care have seen better considering the pricing of the hotel , the location is perfect if you want to be in the centre of Amsterdam but also the rest of the country considering the railway station is very close 
391330,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Room 967 has a toilet that s difficult to flush and I was disturbed by bumping and dragging during the night , Staff were all super friendly check in guest services breakfast Keen to help even on small issues 
391331,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, We asked for room With nice view but receptionist didn t even listen to us and just put us at the back of the hotel If she had just acknowledged the fact that maybe there was no rooms available at the front we would have totally understood, Lovely breakfast

391421,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, At check in I was informed that booking com had charged my credit card despite I clearly asked for cash payment I do not believe it anyhow The hotel charged my card previous to my arrival on schedule I got a handicapped equipped room as this was the last they had The minibar was empty and no water in the room No value for money sorry I will look next time for another hotel , I was disappointed 
391422,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, When we arrived our booking was not in the system We had booked a suite as it was a special occasion The receptionist was difficult about the situation and really did not treat us with much courtesy Instead offering us a basic room for a nominal discount We stood our ground and eventually got sorted out but I really would have liked for it to be dealt with in a more professional manner The rooms were very basic which I suppose I am used to with Amsterdam hotels However I do expect a certain standard with the housekeeping on both occasions the maid had been it looked like half a job I don t think I would stay here again In comparison to the other Double Trees we have stayed at it really was a little bit disappointing a shame really when it promised so much , The location was very good easy access to the city center and only a short walk from the train station We also had access to the Executive Lounge which was ideal for breakfast and for pre dinner drinks The Sky Lounge is also worth a visit to see the wonderful views over the city 
391423,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The smell in the room was bad since the windows can t open at all The same and even worst smell to the corridor of the hotel , Perfect location excellent breakfast wonderful view if your room is not looking to the railway station like ours

391429,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The fact that on check in the staff didn t say the rate included breakfast when it did and not having had breakfast in the hotel they would refund the 120 IE 2 x 3 days Instead they tried to blame me for not checking the confimation but the booking com on my iPhone did not confirm either so I paid twice each day for breakfast I will not stay at a Hilton again I use hotels a lot and on check in they normally tell you the breakfast times and location but this Hilton did not do that , The location
391430,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Never ending banging of doors by cleaning staff on the floor going in and out of rooms been cleaned really very frustrating, Overall everything was good as usual from location to breakfasts all good

391434,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station,No Negative, Staff were very friendly and helpful throughout the hotel reception concierge bar and restaurant made you relax instantly knowing they were clearly committed to being there to help Rooms were very nicely furnished and spacious and very clean and surprisingly quiet for the location Great views from the bar on floor 11 and good food in the restaurant
391435,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, towels old and thin bathmat very shabby Tv kept turning on3 times during night while asleep Not value for money for the price Luggage had to be handled by ourselves, Bed fine but hot doona could have done with a blanket
391436,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, the rooms are pretty small and anonymous no color The mini bar was empty Our view was towards the trains and not towards the city , excellent location 100 meters from the Central station and walking distance from sightseeing Nice rooftop bar 
391437,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Some loud music at night Price little expensive , Modern very central og good facilities Especially the sky lounge with open air area and great view across the city 
391438,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, We prefer porcelain mugs in the room but were too lazy to get the staff to change it , We loved the apples and water available at front desk The guest service staff were very helpful and knowledgeable
391439,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, I stayed for two nights one very late the other i came back after a long day and no housekeeping done I also got a room that i had to walk a lot to Poor, The location only 
391440,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Expensive but I guess due to location it was ok but the price did not include breakfast which would have made the room price overly expensive There are better priced central places to stay but for a cruise this was a better choice pricewise than the Movenpick , We chose this hotel due to the closeness to the terminal for a cruise It was an easy 10 minute walk with the suitcases to board our cruise ship Also we had rented a car from Sixt and their office is right beside the hotel lobby so made it easy to collect and drop off car 
391441,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, They tried to charge us more than the agreed price and at this stage i do not know if I have been refunded with the extra charge , Location close to railway station
391442,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, AC not strong enough The windows only open a couple of inches they claimed that it s for safety reasons which is a very stupid and insulting excuse The shower head was loose and required readjustment every minute , Great pillows and nice firm bed Great views from the window city view

391445,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Nowhere to put clothes TV and iMac system that didn t work There was no guide to features of the room and how to work them most good hotels have one , Position Views over Amsterdam Helpful staff 
391446,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Price of breakfast was prohibitive Geared towards business travellers rather than leisure , Excellent location by Amsterdam Central Very helpful staff
391447,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Waited until 4pm to check in as the housekeeping were very slow at cleaning all of the rooms They didn t seem to care much about providing us with this delay either Balcony room is very small For the price you would get a more impressive room at the Kraznopolsky Empty mini bar fridge and no bath You d expect a bath at these costs , Fantastic views from balcony room Great breakfast SkyLounge is beautiful yet overpriced 
391448,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Rooms with river and city views have no window ventilation inner courtyard windows do have Pillows and quilt too thin Breakfasts too expensive , Staff very courteous and efficient Hotel spotlessly clean Room facilities with iron and hairdryer very useful Warm cookie on arrival and complimentary free water at desk 
391449,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Staff was lacking genuine interest to assist and help We were endlessly waiting to get into our room Needless to say that this was the first time in my life where room booked at the executive floor was not prepared and available in a timely manner I understand the challenges of serving a large number of guests but it should not be excuse for nonchalant attitude , Location was perfect
391450,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Nothing I can think of , The staff were wonderful They all were friendly helpful and welcoming The atmosphere contributed to our holiday as did the location of the hotel and the wonderful views in both directions 
391451,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The price I m usually more of a budget hotel or B B sort of person but I have to say it was worth splashing the cash for a special ocassion , Free warm cookie on check in 
391452,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The room was not clean dusty no vacuum for the carpet little far from the market if you need to go to supermarket or pharmacy or to do shopping, Near the central station the view love the decoration of the room and all the facilities you need you can find it in The soundproof of the room 
391453,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Didn t dislike anything it was great sometimes had to wait a bit at reception to get seen to but other than that perfect , The breakfast was absolutely brilliant Very good and nice range of food and always topped up The staff were so lovely and were happy to help whenever we needed assistance or directions The sky lounge is such a gem amazing cocktails and amazing view

391455,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, It was super over priced For 210 a night you are aloud to expect a lot more The corridors were not very nice and up to scratch Room was comfortable but again for that sort of price it could be a lot more luxurious and a bit bigger There is paper cups instead of mugs for coffee and plastic cups instead of glasses in the bathroom I mean thats not really a problem but it s what you would expect from a MotelOne not from a hotel that is more than double the price per night Restaurant looked nice but also very packed There were some problems connecting to the wifi but it worked after a call to the lobby and a short conversation with the IT company Again nice hotel and everything is fine but maybe for a MotelOne type price My max for this hotel would be 120 per night For the price we payed the room needs to be more up to scratch , Very nice skylounge bar Very good staff there drinks were pricy but still fair Good value for money there and its really a cool bar with lots of people and music and a great view of the city Location of this property is really great just next to the Centraal Station in Amsterdam Mac instead of TV is really practical as you can watch TV and use it to research places to go etc Rooms comfortable and nice lobby We got free cookies on check in which was quite cool 
391456,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, I would have loved a bath in my room but hey can t have it all , I had just cycled from the ferry and was pretty cold when I got there and was greeted with a huge smile and a warm cookie Staff were absolutely excellent providing a safe place or my bike a map of the city and some friendly chat Room was perfect and right in the heart of the city couldn t recommend this place enough 
391457,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Despite allowing dogs this is not a particularly pet friendly hotel making you sign a somewhat restrictive waiver room allocated was in a very busy and noisy part of the property which is disrupting for animals staff will accommodate a change if you ask room was small and furnishings not clean stained chair and marked carpet expensive by comparison lifts were ridiculously busy and unpleasant at peak hours no close toileting spot for animals lit light switch on the wall is VERY bright at night , Staff are lovely and check in was super and welcoming Location is very central 
391458,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The Executive lounge was disappointing We ate breakfast in the regular restaurant much better selection The evening snacks were just that snacks were the same every day Would have preferred a regular tv screen in the room instead of the Apple monitor on the desk It was difficult for 2 person to watch because you had to turn on your side to see the screen , The location was perfect Next door to central train station Easy access for walking We had a excellent view from our room 
391459,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Breakfast was expensive so we went to nearby cafes Deposit of 50 Euros per person is required as damage waiver for room, Great service from staff Free bottled water and fruit available in reception Comfortable room felt brand new All mod cons Had a great view of the city Excellent location close to all public transport and easy walking distance to city centre Room was available when we checked in early at 10am Bikes were available to hire for 15 Euros per day Sky Lounge is impressive

391462,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Hotel bike hire a bit pricey You can rent bikes in MacBikes for less , Excellent location Right beside Central Station Great Staff who where always very helpful Would come back again 
391463,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Rooms overlooking the central station can be disturbing for light sleepers We had to pay extra to move to another room on the canal side which was more quiet Booking com should indicate this fact on their list for hotels , This centrally located hotel is only 5 years old everything is modern comfortable and clean Breakfast and dinner at hotel s rest was fine Best of all was the hospitable attentive and smiling service from all of the hotel personnel 
391464,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The foods served at the Executive Lounge during the 6pm 8pm Too crowded and foods are quite limited For 2 days we didn t get to enjoy the snacks because too many people in the lounge and foods served and gone within minutes D Not a major problem for us though We enjoyed the view at the lounge and the drinks P, It was our first time staying with this hotel as well as our first time in Amsterdam We were delighted to be upgraded to the Executive Queen room which we were allowed the excess of the executive lounge as well Rooms are clean spacious Staffs are very helpful Fast check ins The location is perfect for us Convenient public transports within walking distance from the hotel

391474,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Nothing at all, can t say a bad word about this hotel If its your first trip stay here right next to the train station and a 5 minute walk from most places you will want to go for example the dam square 
391475,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, If you could provide some sort of transport cycle for people with more than 3 4 big bags to drop off till the Amsterdam Centraal Station that would be utterly wonderful , The smiling nature of the staff be it the front desk to the concierge to the people serving the breakfast buffet Me and my wife travelled for our honeymoon to Europe and we stayed in Double Tree Hilton in Mar 16 The breakfast buffet has a huge spread with decent quantity offerings in vegetarian and non vegetarian food The front desk staff gave us a complimentary bottle of wine as a gesture for spending our honeymoon at their hotel The rooms were graciously adorned with pretty good views of the city and the waterfront The hotel is a 5 min walk from the Amsterdam Centraal Station which is the main station connecting Amsterdam with major cities in Europe All the people were wonderfully friendly and I would definitely recommend this is as the best place to stay in Amsterdam You are bound to walk away with a broad smile on your face once you have stayed at this hotel

391480,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Initial reception started well with towel arrived during a storm and warm biscuit then the hard sell started First was to have access to executive lounge which we did not want Once refused we were told that there was still a great room available it turned out that this was on the 10th floor and when I noted that others had commented that this was noisy from the bar above the receptionist agreed that we were unlikely to have undisturbed sleep The only other option was a courtyard view room which considering I had already paid for a deluxe room we were disappointed with Eventually I paid an upgrade to get a room with a city view and the unwanted executive lounge was thrown in The manner of this young lady was pushy and very unpleasant a shame as other hotel staff were friendly and helpful I would not recommend this hotel on our reception experience and the eventual high price of the room, The rooms were clean and adequately equipped The room we eventually got after being forced to pay for an upgrade was quiet with a good view
391481,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, my room was charged for breakfast even though I didn t order it or have it The money was refunded to my account but I was refunded less than they had charged me , The bed was a standard single bed Nothing special
391482,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The bed is too hard ATM not on site, Very pleasant and accommodating staff I had to make several updates to my reservation due to schedule changes during my stay Further they have very flexible liberal pet policy at this hotel which is a differentiator for me I stayed here 3 years ago and had same experience this time Same pleasant stay still love Sky Lounge room service was fast and food reasonable and good

391485,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, nothing the view on the station is not the best option if it is possible chose the city view , everything the bar at the 11th floor is breathtaking the steak hous inside has superb food the staff is friendly and professional the room are big and fully equipped
391486,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Water pressure could have been better at times And to my surprise I could spot the odd tray with room service leftovers lying in the corridor outside a room for a full 24 hours before it got picked up , Top location next to the central railway station with view of city centre and the canals Perfect breakfast buffet excellent view from the sky lounge bar and good drinks Free wifi and complimentary Mac computer in your room Rooms and bathrooms really modern stylish and spacious No complaints in general My favourite hotel in Amsterdam

391531,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, I didn t like the suite It was very sterile and not very comfortable Didn t like the fact the the TV s were iMacs , The ground floor was decent Restaurant was pretty good 
391532,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Would have loved to see the new years celebrations from the skylounge but was full to capacity as from 8pm with many guests who wernt actually staying at the hotel To which i think priority should have been given to actual hotel guests for the amount one had payed to stay there, Very friendly and helpfull staff excellent location very central and right next door to the train station which was perfect Skylounge offers some of the best views of amsterdam 
391533,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Given the price of the room one could expect to have normal water pressure in the shower no problems with the toilet flush and Wi Fi in the hotel room as advertised Unfortunately water pressure was very low and dependent on the number of other users in the hotel the toilet flush was hardly working and Wi Fi was temporarily unavailable for three out of six days , The hotel is very clean 
391534,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The initial room which we had to change Also the fact that both rooms were for disabled people whilst our booking was for a double queen room with a dog irrespective if we didn t brought same and a normal queens bedroom without any pet Thats why we wondered why two rooms with disability access , The response of the hotel s personal in all levels was fantastic The parking facilities were excellent The view from the skylounge bar was unique 
391535,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Room was not cleaned at all and I m not exaggerating though we complained several times we had to call each night when we are back to get some extra towels and someone trying to make it clean while we are in they are still authorising money on my visa until today because they Couldn t pull the money from my gold credit card though I paid with another They charged me drinks that I never took and asked me to pay until they investigate I had a flight so I had to pay and go Staff at the reception with the exception of one duty manager where extremely rude and not friendly the whole hotel experience was louzy and unwelcoming, The location the view some staff members
391536,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, the Bad point the wifi always not working and when you reserved is the most they should to put a password for the internet, I would say that for new year we spend a lovely time in this hotel we was a group and we are ao glad that we choose this hotel especially the staff are ao nice when they are working on new year there is facilities everywhere starbuck loung and skylounge
391537,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Air conditioning control is quite bad We set the highest temperature but the room was not warm Apple TV in the room broke down few times , Location facilities attention from staff
391538,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Floor 10 no good for young families as you can hear the music from the Sky Lounge Room not ready on check in Bed size not as advertised by booking com website , Location Clean Restaurant was good 
391539,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, We were in room 1022 Good view of city but right under Skye lounge was very noisy in our room one night until 3am The noise of people clearing up was unbearable , I just love Amsterdam The fact we got to stay in a nice hotel close to my favourite areas was a big bonus
391540,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The staff who processed our check in seemed a little lost without being able to locate our reservation , Pets were allowed and free of charge Quiet room despite being near the central station 
391541,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, For this price I had expected a more majestic room And certainly not one with a view on a blind wall , Great breakfast for me included in the price Good room nice staff Location is great as well close to the station and the city centre
391542,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Service was very poor Lacking staff throughout Breakfast was a shambles and little value Room was too small to swing the proverbial cat Requests to reception unheeded Not the standard I am used to from this chain I checked out a day early and stood the loss , Location early check in
391543,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Hallway noise The offer of a harbor view is misleading It s really a view of the train tracks If train noise bothers you you ll be unhappy , Location is great 
391544,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station,No Negative, I loved how welcoming the hotel is You get a cookie on arrival and the staff are really professional I got upgraded to executive and it was amazing 
391545,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Going back home, Stuff especially lovely receptionist Anne was very kind professional and helpful Location was nice hotel was clean roof was perfect
391546,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Nothing it was excellent , This is one of the 2 hotels that I stay at when visting Amsterdam usually for business It is always impeccably clean and has modem facilities The service is fast and responsive I had an issue with noise this time and it was dealt with quickly and generously by the night manager I recommend this hotel and really like staying there 
391547,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Rooms where small and basic TV was a computer monitor rather than a real TV Just seemed a little more Travelodge than Hilton , Central location great view of the city from upper floors
391548,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, None with the hotel or facilities just beware of the cyclists at crossing points, From the moment we arrived earlier than expected nothing was too much trouble for the staff Got booked in straight away Hotel was spotless location was perfect just take care of those cyclists wow manic staff brilliant really enjoyed our time there Great food perfect atmosphere in sky lounge with magnificent views Top dog do dars T J x
391549,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Room smelled terrible from smokers in a non smoking room They brought an air purifier but it didn t do enough And to top it off there was a full ashtray outside our door when we arrived should have known it wasn t going to end well They did do a nice solid and selected my wife as Guest of the Day Great little bonus but sadly we selected our perks and were told it would be in our room when it was ready fruit basket w wine and drink vouchers for the sky bar Sadly they were not there and after my wife asked the front desk twice they finally came through Hope if they try to make people feel special in the future they follow thru the first time not the third Tried watching the news on the Mac that is the TV and because of the air purifier you couldn t hear it Nice amenity but poorly executed if it is to double as the TV So I read the paper instead and did get to see an awesome London Times editorial cartoon lampooning Trump so maybe it s a win , Parking is amazing Most convenient in out we have had in a major European city and safe To top it up 12 for 24hrs is awesome Prolly would stay there again just because of parking Executive Lounge is a must View from balcony suite is legit 
391550,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, I was told that I can be upgraded to a king size bed An extra 30 euros for it Surprised to find out that it was actually joint double beds I complained to the reception but they say that that is King Size bed in Hilton R u serious 2 joint bed does not justify a 20 euro upgrade And I was facing the railway tracks Horribly noisy On top of it is a disco ends at 2am The noise is worse than being in a construction site , The good thing about it is it has a good connection for Internet 
391551,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Nothing, The staff made sure our stay was perfect with a free upgrade Cake and a bottle of wine to celebrate our birthdays The sky lounge was great despite the weather Nothing they could do about that but if there was I m sure they would have The views were superb 
391552,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, utterly expensive breakfast no facilities to change clothing after check out, perfectly situated in the center relatively cheap parking at hand modern design and clean
391553,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Wi fi is nearly non existent even though they claim it is free and included really a shame for a modern hotel in the hearth of corporate center such as Amsterdam is Single rooms cheaper version are tiny and consist of 2 separate singly tiny beds for some reason that you believe it or not cannot connect together so you will end up sleeping in a tiny bed realizing there s another one next to eat but due to design fault you can t connect them and create a bigger bed out of them , Nice staff great location great Sky Lounge at the top great building style on the outside and in the corridors don t let that full you though
391554,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, expensive breakfast better value at nearby restaurants , Excellent location can see hotel from outside of the train station close to central Dam yet rooms were quiet 
391555,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Service in the Sky Lounge if you go late on in the weekend Too busy with not enough staff , Location was fantastic Staff were good and was lovely and clean The Sky Lounge has great views but does get very busy at weekends late on 
391556,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Beds hard and uncomfortable check in was quite slow The room service was not the best things missing food cold etc and for the price they charge you expect nothing less than excellent , Nice balcony and room was nice but a bit small Guest services were very useful and staff overall very helpful 
391557,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Room a bit small but are packed with all the conveniences you might need , Good location and very helpful staff Room service was good but we never tried the bf
391558,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, A city view from the room would ve been nice but can only blame myself for not booking deluxe room , Modern quiet and great facilities Room was brilliant breakfast was amazing and location is excellent Recommend for any couple getaway 
391559,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station,No Negative, We checked in early and were told we were chosen as guest of the day Received a free upgrade to an executive room as well as free drinks and snacks in the lounge and a free breakfast the next day This was our second time staying at this hotel and cannot recommend it enough the staff are very friendly and the hotel is clean and modern 
391560,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, We didn t try the breakfast buffet as at all but 6 Euros we considered it too expensive Apart from that just a couple of gripes our room was on the cold side a matter which would no doubt have been remedied if we had complained and the complimentary toiletries shampoo conditioner and body lotion were impossible to use The holes in the top of the containers were too small and one couldn t squeeze out the contents because the containers were too rigid I suggest the management tries for themselves , The staff were absolutely first class from the moment we arrived to the moment we left Our room was well appointed and the bed exceedingly comfortable We had a nice meal in the restaurant where my partner ordered off menu with no trouble at all 
391561,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Was kept awake both nights of our stay by people in other rooms making stupid amounts of noise at really silly times of the morning Security were called one night Having the SkyLounge bar on the top floor open until 3am at the weekend probably doesn t help this situation , Perfect location for exploring the city and getting to from the central railway station 
391562,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, N A, The warm cookie on arrival the lady on the reception desk was also very helpful When my adapter plug didn t work the gent on reception gave me an alternative one to use The staff couldn t do any more for you very happy with our stay 
391563,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station,No Negative, I loved the hotel staff all in general are super professional and they really care about clients Normally i always stay in 5 hotels and this one being a 4 is far better than many superior hotels Trust in what i have to say this hotel is really great the staff the rooms great breakfast sky lounge on the rooftop is fun I have to say as well thank you to Am lcar from far the best professional i ve met made me feel at home and was always concerned with clients being happy I really felt at home with him what a wonderfull person and professional for a 7 hotel I normally travel to Amsterdam a couple of times a year and from now this hotel will be the home i choose yes the home i really felt it For ending thank you for everything and continue the great work i see that if people that are working are happy with the job and are treated well by the bosses from the top it will reflect in the experience for the clients This is a happy hotel Best Regards Nuno
391564,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station,No Negative, Amazing hotel with very friendly staff excellent spotlessly clean rooms with great entertainment systems and a number of excellent restaurants and bars

391566,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, There was nothing about this hotel that I didn t love stunning views of the city and cannal huge windows really comfy bed , The hotel has the perfect location right next to the station and a short walk to everywhere The service was impeccable and our room no 604 was perfect in every way so much so that my boyfriend proposed in the hotel room on Saturday and we are now engaged Double Tree thank you so much and we will see you again for our anniversary stay x
391567,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Check in service quite astonished by the approach of one of the staff Links to booking com reservations with the hotel were poorly established Poor views from the room, Hotel staff throughout except one encountered in reception Breakfast was fantastic Bedrooms comfort
391568,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Even though it was a nice overall stay there were many issues empty mini bar poor room service forgot things all the time unpleasant staff at times had to request for basic things like slippers robes the view towards the train too noisy woke me upv every day very average breakfast had pork every time and were aggressive when we pointed out the mistakes, The location which was very practical Skylougne and the other restaurants caf s in the hotel free coffee tea nice airport like feeling free water and cookies and lobby
391569,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, We were charged twice for our rooms , Great location lovely clean rooms and comfy beds Loved the fact we could stroll down to Starbucks for a late breakfast too
391570,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, but the room was given to me from 3rd floor and I saw it was just a WALL of my romms window , i stay always at the Hilton hotels gourup Super service super cleanliness this hotel s location is superb Thanks to all Hilton employees Then why I gave 6 3 point The only reason for choosing this hotel was to watch the Amsterdam magnificant view and scenery from my room but the room was given to me from 3rd floor and I saw it was just a WALL of my romms window I was shocked perhaps they apply to booking com reservation for these kind of room I was very ssad aboud this Althougha im a member of Hilton s bad to give this room to me certainly do not view risk to stay in this hotel again ps I added a picture of the wall view from the rooms window
391571,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Very wet and windy night there was continuous loud noise from somewhere outside, Breakfast was superb Tea and coffee making facilities in the bedroom 
391572,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The weather lol , It was a very warm welcome we were greeted with lovely fresh cookies on arrival The Sky lounge was probably the highlight of our trip to Amsterdam it was fantastic 
391573,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The lighting in both our room and the main restaurants was subdued with no option to use a stronger light for a specific purpose For example this made it really difficult to read your dinner menu with ease Atmosphere at the expense of practicality , Location of the hotel plus the young and helpful staff in the reception concierge and restaurant areas 
391574,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Location a bit away from the center 10 7 minutes walking, Great stuff best WIFI loved the iTV The SkyLoungh is amazing Gave me to do a late checkout with no problem and no charge
391575,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station,No Negative, When checking in they checked us into a room which already had persons staying there This I have never experienced before They gave us a New room and free breakfast but the staff needs to be more aware Nevertheless we liked the Place 
391576,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The price of the pints in the bar ye only make the stuff across the road, Great Hotel in the middle of the city Staff are super friendly and gave us a nice personal hand written letter for our honeymoon our room was on the top floor with spectacular views also the cookie on arrival was much aprieated after traveling The view From the bar is amazing its like something out of a children s novel at night
391577,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Many hotels include a bottle of water in the room which l appreciate For a quality hotel l like china coffee cups or mugs in the room not paper cups , The sky lounge was very atmospheric and the music and service was very good
391578,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, My husband didn t like the foam coffee cups in our room , Centrally located and we were given a room with a view We found the reception staff very friendly and helpful 
391579,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, We Were Overpriced For Our Room Was Charged 400 Shud Of Been 300 Odds, The fact That We Were Within Walking Distance From Train Station Dam Square Wasn t Too Far Either The Bar Staff In The Lobby Bar Were Excellent
391580,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Both my wife and I came off a River Cruise with chest infections The hotel allowed us an early check in however on entering our room we found that instead of the City or garden view promised in the Booking Com information we found our view consisted if 12 railway lines with nearly 100 trains a day passing our 5th floor room As we were both sick we could not be bothered asking to shift and to their credit after I complained about the room the hotel credited our dinner we had on the first night Not real value however at 200 euros plus per night Just a warning don t get room 590 unless you are a train buff , Location
391581,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, View from room we got the short straw neither canal nor City just another part of the hotel building thus not much daylight , Location convenience to station and city ambience clean modern and comfortable staff friendliness helpfulness food quality excellent VERY comfortable bed best Hotel bed for a few years Skylounge great views good atmosphere breakfast dinner 
391582,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, the 150 euro deposit they debited from our account and said we would be given 150 euro back when we checked out instead of the normal pre auth thats drops off when you check out so we had 150 euro more that we didnt want to spend and had to convert back into sterling as a poor rate this was the second time I had stayed there and it didnt happen previously , Location and the hotel itself is really nice the food was great and so is the sky lounge
391583,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Room very small and bed was very hard Drinks in the bar were expensive Terrible smell from drain in shower kept coming back after being fixed SkyBar never had a seat available when we went up , Breakfast was great and breakfast staff were all very helpful and nice View from balcony was amazing Water in fridge was nice touch Reception staff was nice and gave us a warm cookie Bottled water at reception 
391584,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, First night disturbed by music from Hotel rooftop Bar We were given a quieter room the following day for the rest of our stay , Clean modern hotel close to transport hubs 
391585,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, there was some confusion with the room number so we ended up with laundry that was not supposed to be for us and also an anniversary present that was supposed to be for the couple staying in the room they forgot to release the deposit on my credit card for which I then had to call my bank a week after I had already paid for the stay the hotel is always busy which may be a question of taste but since we were there for a private stay we found this rather unnerving , for a city trip this place is just wonderful it is just a short walk from the central station and from the city center we had a room with a balcony which was superb the staff was ever so lovely always friendly and helpful
391586,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The executive lounge was simply another breakfast or sitting facility not exclusive or grandiose This lounge was busy and fairly cramped at breakfast and during 6 8pm free drinks snacks Limited restaurant variety within the hotel and poor selection for vegetarians and vegans , Very modern design with lots of glass and lovely views over the water and city from Its 11 floors The 11 th floor skyline bar provides lively and fun evening atmosphere and great night time views without music disturbing the wider hotel 
391587,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station,No Negative, A really great location next to Central Station and within walking distance of a lot of excellent sites The restaurant was nice for breakfast and there was even a Starbucks for coffee The rooms were very comfortable and spacious Loved it 
391588,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The cellphone conection is very low inside the hotel but hey you have free WiFi and an iMac in your room , Outstanding good Breakfast location the amazing good service of the staff great cocktails 
391589,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Nothing, From the hot cookie when you arrive to the free water and apples all little details that you don t tend to get when staying in Dam Having the sky lounge to attend on the 11th floor just adds that bit of extra fun to the hotel
391590,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Bed wasn t that comfy but have slept on worse, Modern looking with a iMac in the room Really enjoyed the sky lounge wasn t that expensive either Great location also very quiet considering the train station was so close Definitely stay again next time 
391591,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Apple tv was too small for viewing no movies available bottled water not in mini bar upon check in tried to use internet on apple tv but failed asked for change of bedsheets but was not done had to call housekeeping to remind can hear music from sky lounge on level 11 from room level 8 room was small compared to prices paid per night , Near station staff were friendly and helpful
391592,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, I was struck by how dingy the hallways to the rooms were not attractive at all compared to lobby The rooms themselves are better brighter and seem recently refurbished The one major downside a very hard uncomfortable mattress Given the price of the room I expected better , Best location next to train station so easy for people travelling or needing access to airport The sky lounge is also beautiful 
391593,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, only thing as it was my birthday weekend i wished they had a spa facility but that didn t dampen my stay at all , the staff were polite and tentative nothing was a too big or too small for them to deal with Lotta reception was excellent 
391594,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The hotel is too pricey for what it delivers The shower is not so good and the heater of the room doesnt work at all we even changed the room and nothing , The room is good and comfy 
391595,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The room could have been a little cleaner towels were old thin and one had a whole in the material The waste baskets were not emptied and the TV control was not user friendly , The staff was friendly courteous very helpful

391599,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Rooms were a little on the small side and quite business like , Loved the executive lounge and sky bar Complimentary Breakfast was of the highest quality and even included champagne Great location very near central station and only a few minutes walk from dam square 
391600,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Room facing the train station Noisy at night disturbing sleeping quality Sink was stuck but fixed rapidly , Delicious chocolate cookies upon check in Warm welcoming 
391601,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Very expensive for what it is especially considering breakfast is not included in many of the rates , Convenient lovation well appointed rooms friendly staff very clean rooms

391603,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, So old and at the first night it was miserable room it didn t worth even 100 There is no coffee machine and they didn t refund us about this But the second night it was grat comparing to the first, I like only the view of the canal
391604,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The restaurant was lacking both in service and food quality When the host brought me to the table there were crumbs on it which he brushed off with his sleeve , Perfectly fine if unexceptional hotel in a very good location Staff is very friendly and helpful 
391605,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Breakfaston sunday 4th no tables available no extra tables had been set in lobby bar no one seemed to care Very unhappy as we paid a lot of money for this hotel , Location near railway station brilliant
391606,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station,No Negative, The location is perfect next to the Central Station and on a walking distance to the old city center And an iMac in your room is awesome too Free bottled water in the lobby and ice machine 
391607,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, I guess the room is not soundproofing I can hear the voice from next room and train sound from central station There were mistakes made by employees 1 over charged for room I check out before 4 days I still don t have any reply from hotel 2 Despite staying though canceled my reservation and charged me no show penalty , Good location very close to central station Good breakfast 
391608,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Our room was a loooooooong way from the lift Room wasn t incredibly large , Great Location close to the main train station Incredible breakfast one of the best I ve ever had Helpful staff Close to the Red Light District 
391609,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Actually I didnt like the hotel at all because of these reasons 1 The price is too much expensive comparing with the level of the rooms 2 Its shame that the price is expensive and breakfast is not included 3 The reception is so bad I called three times from the room asking some two time no answer third one aswered with im busy call u back and never called really im surpised , quiteness
391610,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The club room space is a bit small for a club room, The privilege of a balcony in the Club room with balcony is fantastic with a top view over the city executive lounge access and facility is reasonable and available at any time for a light snack or drink 
391611,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The price was a bit expenisive, It was wonderful hotel it is close from train station and close from tram station and it has great view to canals The room was nice and clean
391612,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, I had water leaking problem in my room they were late in solving my problem They gave a room worst than main They did not apologies, Location and breakfast
391613,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station,No Negative, Room was so quiet which is unusual for a large hotel where you can usually hear constant doors banging and people returning to their rooms yelling and shouting None of this in DTAmsterdam Room was large and nice view and modern installations Staff could not do enough for us Staff also are uniformed in excellent attire Free applesand bottled water Would not hesitate to stay there again 
391614,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station,No Negative, The location was perfect The staff were very helpful and friendly they gave us help and advice on how to get to the football stadium They also gave us good places to visit 
391615,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, nothing, My wife got bee sting while we were coming back to the hotel and there are two of the stuff of the hotel Mario Raula helped us so much even we didn t need to go to the hospital
391616,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The complimentary wifi was a little unreliable The hotel was fully booked so at night prime time good luck connecting on your own device , The location was absolutely fantastic you are right by the centraal station and within minutes walking distance into the centre of town The warm welcome cookie was a lovely extra touch and an apple mac in your room was a great surprise 
391617,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Awful terrible service I requested to change my booking as I had a change of plan I was travelling for business and not on holiday The staff at front desk took ten minutes to talk to the manager to tell me they couldn t help me I had to contact Booking com I was pressed for time on a short stay When I asked to change the booking I had to rush to a meeting I did have the time to call or e mail Booking com wait for their reply take it back to the reception and again wait for them to process the change in booking This was an absolute farce I had just previously stayed at the Marriott at the city before and they had absolutely no problem accommodating the same request I even stayed with them again after returning from a meeting in another city The front desk staff told me it s not our room anymore we sell it to Booking com They were simply wrong It s their hotel they simply pass on the commission for the stay to Booking com Yet more mis leading information on their Booking com description they advertise as offering Crabtree Evelyn toiletries They most certainly do not Their toiletries are Aroma Actives Essentials by Sysco Guest Supply I use Crabtree Evelyn and it appealed to me when making my booking Sadly Hilton once again disappointed It does not encourage me to stay at any Hilton property again and I don t think I would recommend to my colleagues or business partners either They may not care for the loss of business but I don t think it would be insignificant All I got from the hotel manager was a standard rather insincere apology and an offer of a discount on my next stay However it is not the price or discount that matters to me but the service Service is what matters for business travellers as opposed to leisure travel Sorry Hilton if you got to the end of this rather long review , Location was not too far from Centraal train station although there are hotels closer 
391618,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Room excellent staff great bathroom good have, All staff were very friendly and helpful the Australian waitress was excellent and concierges desk very helpful
391619,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Nothing this place was amazing , I absolutely loved the free warm cookies and the unlimited amount of bottle water The staff was extremely nice and helpful The room and view was gorgeous I loved the fact the tv was a MAC As a result you were able to watch tv search the Internet and connect to Netflix The sky lounge was very nice and had a great view of the city The food options were limited but the burger was delicious Stay here you won t regret it 
391620,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, One of reception staff refered my request of 500 change to central station , Free outside telephone calls at reception searchable different sattelite canals on room tv
391621,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, I don t think I will get used to the single comforter no top sheet some European hotels utilize I sleep hot so having a top sheet only option is key , The location near the train station and access to the trams is excellent We had a city view room on the 9th floor and it was excellent The Sky Lounge bar is really fun in the evenings 
391622,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The room was like a travelodge room nothing special For 160 a night with no breakfast I wouldn t say value for money Breakfast 25 euros each is nuts , Hotel was lovely albeit overpriced for the rooms they offer 
391623,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The first room prior to moving wasn t cleaned very well and in both rooms the tea and coffee facilities weren t updated on a daily basis , The staff did their best to accommodate a room move at a very busy time of the year when a floating nightclub bar moored outside the first room allocated 
391624,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The only aspect for me was the fim lighting down stairs This however is a interior design direction , Well positioned and close by transport eg train and trams Availability of executive lounge was a great asset Loved views from window Facilities such as iron was much appreciated after travelling
391625,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Amsterdam accommodations are expensive with the Doubletree being good value in comparison , Right on the harbour next to central train station walking distance to many sights Great little fitness room Very clean and comfortable modern decor rooms Great views from Skybar with good variety of food for all palates Walking distance to cruise ship port 
391626,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Staff should me be more flexible and personal with guest instead of highly professional all times ALSO sky lounge was always much crowded , Location facility room size value for money
391627,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station,No Negative, Location excellent in the city centre but yet separated from the crowd Very clean service is also on top level everything you need just ask and be sure it will be done 
391628,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, A long way from cheaper eating places except for those near the railway station Breakfast should have been included for the price charged , Close to Central Station and the Port and the trams Easy to walk through the Canal district Easy to visit the museums Wifi was very good 
391629,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Nothing , the junior suite booked was spacious modern An added bonus was the complimentary drinks and nibbles provided in the executive lounge The staff were helpful and polite at all times Overall we were more than happy with our stay at the hotel and would definitely stay here again when returning to Amsterdam 
391630,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, no view no help with apple gagets and chargers i had to leave my phone at the reception for them to charge it i had forgoton my charger at an hotel in brussels and needed batery urgently ,No Positive
391631,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, We had a meal at Eastwood the hotel restaurant and found it to be quite poor considering the cost of the meal On our floor the carpets smelt as if they were damp , Location
391632,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Room was not ready until 3 hours after check in time Room had stained carpet WiFi was practically useless could barely connect and slow when connected , Location 
391633,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, It seems they don t have enough staff to clean the rooms daily our room was not made everyday and one time was only going to be made up late the afternoon , The location en facilities are very good The rooftop bar is nice We enjoyed our stay 
391634,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Long walk to the lift which was part and parcel of the beautiful water view we had, The location was excellent right next to the railway station and next door to the cruise terminal so we had a 5 minute walk arriving and departing This hotel is well equipped very clean and comfortable 
391635,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, A dirty toilet is a definite no no The queen beds are very small you might consider not booking a one queen room for two adults And although we asked for a quiet room we heard a band playing loudly on the fabulous that s true rooftop deck And the tipsy people in the elevators on a weekend night going to the rooftop deck aren t pleasant either , The location is perfect next to the Central Station and on a walking distance to the old city center And an iMac in your room is awesome too But those are unfortunately the only two great things about this hotel 
391636,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Had to return twice when we checked in as the room wasn t ready Not a good start The room hadn t been cleaned on the second day when we returned at 6pm very bad The room was ok though better suited to one person as quite compact , Very clean hotel Free bottled water in the lobby
391637,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, arrived early in the morning and had booked the room from night before but the room wasnt held because the hotel was full so had to wait 5 hours to get the room , location excellent breakfast very good 
391638,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station,No Negative, The staff was super friendly and helpful They were able to make reservations at every restaurant we requested It was also my birthday and they left a little gift for me in the room It was also really convenient for public transportation Our room had a beautiful view of the city We also had a computer which doubled as the TV If the wireless seemed slow we just jumped on the computer to look up directions and restaurants All in all we would be happy to stay here again 
391639,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Bed was very hard but staff had an additional foam mattress added after the first night Hotel restaurant was good the first night but horrible the last night of our stay Our waiter was evidently the main problem Spoke English well but didn t understand but pretended to what we were ordering , Faculty was modern and clean in every way you would expect from Hilton The morning brunch was outstanding Wifi was powerful and plenty Concierges were very helpful 
391640,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station,No Negative, I arrived after long haul flight from Australia feeling very unwell The hotel staff were excellent in expediting a room arranging Doctor and collecting my prescription in extremely efficient helpful and pleasant manner I spent my time in Amsterdam predominantly in my room which was very comfortable On my departure a charming porter walked my luggage with me to my train He made sure my luggage was safe and I was comfortable This is such wonderful customer service and not readily discovered in our modern world I absolutely recommend each and every member of your team who made my stay a much more pleasant experience than it could have been with ill health Compliments to you all 
391641,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Arrived earlier than 3pm for check in and our room was not ready which was acceptable At 3pm we checked again and it was not ready we had to wait and complain until we got another room through a better staff member , Great location close to central station Warm cookies at check in Small kids playground behind the business like center Starbucks and Sixt car rental are available 
391642,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, bed was really small given two Singal beds as we booked on one big double bed No bath at all , Close to the central station Nice sight at near canal 
391643,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Can t think of anything , Loved the SkyLounge bar great view tasty snacks and amazing cocktails Location excellent for transportation nightlife and shopping Rooms clean comfortable beds and hotel staff very friendly 
391644,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The security was very poor with anyone accessing through the lift to all floors No room key access to the lift therefore anyone could enter the accomodation floors We witnessed a drug deal go down three doors from our room on the 6th floor , Staff at the front desk where very attentive to our needs but the messages did not seem to get through to the service dept Location was great and very close to the city cente and main railway station Many people used the hotel as a staging location for jionoing and leaving river cruises 
391645,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station,No Negative, The reception service was great with a free cookie on arrival made you really feel welcome The staff were very helpful with booking tours and information around Amsterdam 
391646,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Lack of amenities in the room Not well furnished the room even if executive no drink in executive during all day just in a few hours , The location of the hotel is perfect to visit the city of amsterdam very close to central station and dam square
391647,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, We asked for smoking room but we were not provided though at time of booking we were told it will be given subject to availability However at check in we were told such rooms belong to higher category and hence we need to pay more Small rooms and beds , Only the location 
391648,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Location was in a chaotic part of the city with all kinds of vehicles intermingling centrally Small TV the size of a computer screen only No Fox News, Great breakfast buffet with champagne Provided free water bottles and fruit at the lobby
391649,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Things had run out and were not replenished if you were late down to breakfast Room not large but it contained a lot Milk substitute supplied on drinks tray tasted foul , Near to station Excellent choice for breakfast Although see other comments View from Sky Lounge and bedroom Comfortable bed All facilities needed in room Fridge hot drink making etc Wifi
391650,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, the bed was a bit small and we were on the 10th floor so we could hear the music from the lounge but we didnt mind it much, Our stay was amazing it close to everything the staff were very welcoming and they made us check in early
391651,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The only improvement I d suggest is more choice on room service and forgetting a service charge of 5 50 when all you yearn for is a bowl of fries Why should customers have to pay a service charge on top of the daily room rate doesn t that include providing service , A nice warm welcome from Lesley on reception including a warm chocolate chip cookie Always nice after a journey Very easy to get to from the airport short train trip and about 10 minutes stroll Location is fab easy to wander into the tourist areas but far enough out to not be in a crowd of party goers all the time Room not the biggest but nicely furnished and a free Apple Mac pc tv Free water and apples fruit I ve stayed in Hiltons all round the world over 30 years and for the first time ever someone knocked on my door and unprompted asked if I was happy with the cleaning The Sky Lounge is fantastic and as well as serving nice drinks and complimentary popcorn has an amazing panoramic view over the city Much better than the one everyone talks about at the library Overall I d recommend to anyone and will use it next time I come to Amsterdam
391652,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The bathrooms were not cleaned properly , Fantastic location 5min walk from Central Station We paid extra to upgrade the rooms and breakfast and afternoon drinks and snack was included 
391653,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, If you have more than one room then you have to watch your credit card becuase they will charge you more than the rooms rate and as i experinced lately and still struggling with this issue , Everything is good
391654,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, hotel staff force me to take third room while i just ask extra bed for my child 11 years old in hotel condition allow for extra bed but they refuse to give extra bed, location
391655,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Cleanliness of room was awful public toilets were smelly no toast at breakfast and staff in executive lounge were unhelpful and all at 284 per night , Location was excellent and views superb
391656,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The size of the room was small with limited storage areas for clothes , The This is a lunch bag in the breakfast buffet is the best thing I have ever seen and we used it every day brilliant Doubletree 
391657,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Our suite was positioned almost directly underneath the hotel s discotheque My wife was unable to sleep due to the loud music The disco closes at 3am To the hotel s credit they did move us elsewhere when the noise issue was raised with them Another irritation though was room service trays left outside rooms for far too long more than a day Simply unacceptable , This hotel is within a 10 minute walk from Amsterdam s Central Railway station It is also very code to Dam Square with expansive views over the city canals 
391658,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, The breakfast was good but incredibly expensive , Everything from the staff to the location were definitely on point The Skylounge was beautiful along with good listing of drinks and food The restaurant downstairs was slightly pricey but great food 
391659,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station, Only bad thing was we had to leave and continue our trip in Holland , The friendly staff the comfort the cleanliness of the hotel overall was too class The view from the sky lounge day and night is fantastic This was my second trip to this hotel and wo not be my last
